His kids were in bed, and he had just turned on a cooking show on Netflix and pulled out his work laptop to send some e-mails. On his Facebook feed, he learned that, roughly two hours before, a man had entered a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and opened fire. This turned out to be the second of two shootings, during which the gunman killed fifty people and injured another fifty before being arrested. Unlike most people, Jay couldn’t dwell on his feelings of despair. “As soon as I saw the news about the attack that night, I knew immediately this was going to be something my team would be working on,” he told me. Jay, whose name has been changed to protect his security, is a lawyer by training. In 2015, he left a position working on intellectual-property operations at Facebook to run a new department known as the global-escalations team, which removes heinous images and videos from the platform. At Facebook, human content moderators, assisted by computers, spend their days sifting through posts that users have reported. These posts range from the mundane (teen-agers reporting pictures in which they think they look fat; neighbors reporting each other while squabbling over politics in a comments section) to the grotesque (a beheading by a Mexican drug cartel), exploitative (revenge porn posted by a jilted lover), illegal (communications about a drug deal using an invented language of numbers and emojis), and exhaustingly hateful (threads praising 9/11 or calling for the extermination of people with autism or hereditary baldness, and a seemingly endless stream of racist vitriol). This work takes a toll on moderators, and Jay’s team is focussed on the most virulent content. “There’s a spiritual resiliency they need to have to do the work,” Jay told me. This may explain why Jay has the permanently tired look of a much older man. The Internet doesn’t run on a tight nine-to-five schedule, so Facebook maintains branches of the escalations team around the world, which work eight-hour shifts that “follow the sun,” so that someone is always on call to manage a crisis. When the shooting happened, a dozen content moderators on the global escalations team were working in Singapore, and Jay messaged them to get an update. The moderators have a three-step crisis-management protocol; in the first phase, “understand,” they spend as much as an hour gathering information before making any decisions. Jay learned that the shooter seemed to be trying to make the massacre go viral: he had posted links to a seventy-three-page manifesto, in which he espoused white-supremacist beliefs, and live-streamed one of the shootings on Facebook, in a video that lasted seventeen minutes and then remained on his profile. Jay forced himself to watch the video, and then to watch it again. “It’s not something I would ask others to do without having to watch it myself,” he said. Facebook Live was launched in 2016, and we are still grappling with the possibilities of the medium. Since its early days, it has been used to share the antics of children with their grandparents, broadcast amateur cooking shows, and record academic panels, but it has also been exploited to showcase violence. In 2017, a group of teen-agers kidnapped and tortured a man with mental and developmental disabilities and streamed video of the event to their friends. A number of people—sadly, many of them young—have streamed their suicides. Facebook is able to screen most photos and videos with an artificial-intelligence system, which makes sure that they haven’t been previously banned and automatically deletes those that have. But since live video, by definition, has not been banned before, Facebook mostly relies on users to flag inappropriate posts to moderators. (The company has developed some technology that can detect certain themes or imagery in live video and block them immediately.) Viewers are not always civic-minded; four thousand people watched the video of the Christchurch shooting before it was taken down, but no one flagged it until twenty-nine minutes after the live stream began. Jay stayed up until 4 A.M. monitoring developments. During the “understand” phase, Facebook determined that the video qualified as terrorist content under its Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, which bans “organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence.” Jay’s team removed the video, and, as soon as the gunman’s identity was confirmed, removed his account. But, after years of doing this work, Jay knew that the video would continue to spread in dark corners of Facebook, along with praise for the massacre. “We know, for example, that people will begin to create fake accounts in the killer’s name,” he told me. “We know people begin to role-play mass murders; we know we see merchandise that starts to capture this tragedy. Taking down the video is just one part.” At 6 A.M. in Dublin, five hours after the shootings had occurred, a thirty-nine-year-old named Cormac Keenan rolled over to check his phone, saw the news, and rushed to the office. Keenan is the head of the local branch of Facebook’s market team, which, worldwide, includes a few hundred people who, collectively, speak more than eighty languages and translate the idiosyncrasies of specific cultural contexts for the company. A typical day might involve reviewing a post that uses slang from Thailand to determine whether it’s a harmless joke or a local form of hate speech. The market team often helps the escalations team, though working on the shooting was a bigger job than normal. “When I came into the office, it just took over my entire day,” Keenan said. Understanding context is one of the most difficult aspects of content moderation. Sometimes, a post seems clearly destructive. In April, 2017, Steve William Stephens, a vocational specialist, shot and killed Robert Godwin, Sr., an elderly black man who was walking on the sidewalk near his home, in Cleveland. Stephens said, bafflingly, that he had decided to kill someone because he was mad at his ex-girlfriend, and posted a video of the killing on Facebook, where it remained for two hours before the company removed it. People were horrified by how long it stayed up. “Traditional media companies have finely-wrought guidelines and policies to help them make these decisions,” Emily Dreyfuss wrote, in Wired. “But Facebook depends on us to do it. And now it might very well be time for the company to roll up its own sleeves and get to work.” But disturbing videos may not always be damaging. In July, 2016, Philando Castile, a black school-nutrition supervisor, was shot seven times by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, live-streamed the aftermath, as Castile bled from his wounds and died after twenty minutes. The footage arrived amid a series of videos depicting police violence against black men but was striking because it was streamed live, which exempted it from claims that it had been edited by activists or the police department before it was released. Facebook initially removed the video, but then reinstated it with a content warning. To moderators looking at both, the videos might look similar—a grisly shooting of a black man in America—but the company eventually determined that the intentions behind the videos gave them distinct meaning: keeping up Reynolds’s video brought awareness to the systemic racism of the criminal-justice system, while taking down Stephens’s video silenced a murderer’s deranged homage to his ex-girlfriend. Such scenarios, for better or worse, force tech companies to do the delicate work of determining whether a video of violence ultimately serves a harmful or noble purpose. In the case of the Christchurch shooting, Facebook decided that the danger of the video becoming a tool of extremist propaganda outweighed its informational value. The danger of violence spreading through imitation has long been documented. In 1978, the sociologist Mark Granovetter described how riots are contagious, growing and multiplying as people see each other joining in. A new study, co-authored by the Network Contagion Research Institute and the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, confirms that extremist violence works in much the same way. Far-right ideologies begin on smaller social-media sites (such as Gab, 4chan, and 8chan), spread to more mainstream outlets, and then lead to real-world violence. Depictions of the violence then get cycled back into social media, fuelling the spread of the ideologies. “Fringe social-media platforms are enabling terrorism in a way that would have been unimaginable even five or ten years ago,” Eileen Hershenov, a vice-president at the A.D.L., wrote recently. “The research demonstrates how online propaganda can feed acts of violent terror, and, conversely, how violent terror can feed and perpetuate online propaganda. In essence, these platforms serve as round-the-clock white supremacist rallies, amplifying and fulfilling their vitriolic fantasies.” By the time Keenan got involved, Facebook had already moved onto the second phase of its protocol, “isolate,” and was trying to stop the spread of the content. “At that stage, it was six or seven hours in, so a lot of the initial responses had kicked off,” he told me. His and Jay’s teams tracked down and removed posts from around the world that praised the attack or urged further violence, and deleted copies of the video. This created an ethical tangle. While obvious bad actors were pushing the video on the site to spread extremist content or to thumb their noses at authority, many more posted it to condemn the attacks, to express sympathy for the victims, or because of the video’s newsworthiness. For consistency, and in deference to a request from the New Zealand government, the team deleted even these posts. The situation was a no-win for Facebook. Politicians were quick to condemn the company for the spread of extremism, and users who had posted the video in good faith felt unreasonably censored. At the time of the shooting, Sherif Ahmed, a forty-two-year-old who works on Facebook’s Dangerous Organizations Team (whose last name has been removed for his protection), was sitting down to a dinner meeting with his co-workers when everyone’s phone started buzzing. Ahmed’s team tries to stop terrorist organizations and hate groups from using the platform to spread propaganda, and it has been increasingly effective; last fall, the Justice Department announced that an alleged ISIS supporter was cautioning members to hijack or acquire the accounts of “legitimate users” to get around Facebook’s growing abilities to detect terrorism. Ahmed helps craft mechanisms for the enforcement of policies; he left the dinner, and, for much of the next twelve hours, worked on the Christchurch case. He told me that the video of the shooting was different from other extremist videos that he had seen because of the “point of view of the filming,” which forced the viewer to see the scene from the perspective of the killer, and because of “how incredibly brutal it was.” To remove videos or photos, platforms use “hash” technology, which was originally developed to combat the spread of child pornography online. Hashing works like fingerprinting for online content: whenever authorities discover, say, a video depicting sex with a minor, they take a unique set of pixels from it and use that to create a numerical identification tag, or hash. The hash is then placed in a database, and, when a user uploads a new video, a matching system automatically (and almost instantly) screens it against the database and blocks it if it’s a match. Besides child pornography, hash technology is also used to prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, and over the last two and a half years it has been increasingly used to respond to the viral spread of extremist content, such as ISIS-recruitment videos or white-nationalist propaganda, though advocates concerned with the threat of censorship complain that tech companies have been opaque about how posts get added to the database. By the time the handling of the Christchurch video switched to teams in the United States, some twelve hours after the shooting, moderators discovered a problem that they hadn’t encountered before at such a scale. When they tried to create a hash databank for the shooter’s video, users began purposefully or accidentally manipulating the video, creating slightly blurred or cropped versions that obscured the hash and could make it past Facebook’s firewall. Ahmed decided to try a new kind of hash technology that took a fingerprint from a vector of the video—its audio—which was likely to remain the same across different versions. This technique, combined with others, worked: in the first twenty-four hours, one and a half million copies of the video were removed from the site, with 1.2 million of those removed at the point of upload. The Christchurch attacks were terrifying not only for their violence but because of how they unfolded in the digital sphere. “[A] surprising thing about it is how unmistakably online the violence was, and how aware the shooter on the videostream appears to have been about how his act would be viewed and interpreted by distinct internet subcultures,” Kevin Roose wrote, in the Times, following the attack. “In some ways, it felt like a first—an internet-native mass shooting.” In the aftermath of the shooting, Facebook faced widespread criticism for failing to take down the videos fast enough, for failing to provide transparency in how it handles violent extremism, and for not doing more to combat terrorism and hate speech online. Similar complaints have been made against other social-media companies, including Reddit, which recently removed groups devoted to videos depicting human death, and Twitter, which has long fostered trolls and harassers. After the attack, Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, sent a letter to several major tech companies urging them to crack down on extremist content. “If you are unwilling to do so, Congress must consider policies to ensure that terrorist content is not distributed on your platforms,” he wrote. Facebook and other tech companies have not always done enough to address hate speech. Many early policies took an absolutist view of the importance of free speech, which let racism or misogyny proliferate, making the platforms hostile places for women and people of color and accelerating the spread of extremist views. This Easter Sunday, a little over a month since Christchurch, hundreds were killed in Sri Lanka, in a series of coördinated suicide bombings at Christian churches and luxury hotels. Government officials cited Facebook’s role in spreading misinformation and shut down the platform within its borders following the attack. For the last few years, however, in the face of significant criticism, almost every major platform has tried to crack down on these issues, giving users new features for privacy and security, hiring armies of moderators, and consulting with outside academics to create better policies. At this point, Facebook wants to keep violence off its site as much as we do, if only to avoid scandal; in the twenty-four hours after the shooting, hundreds of people worked to keep the video from spreading. No doubt, more can be done. But the Christchurch shooting may demonstrate that, as long as social media exists, some amount of horror is bound to slip through the cracks. Ultimately, what likely disturbs us most about moments like Christchurch is that this kind of content exists and, perhaps worse, that there are bad people trying to make it spread. By thirty-six hours after the shooting, the escalations team had moved into its third phase: “enforcement.” Moderators had mostly contained the video, and were monitoring to make sure that it didn’t reëmerge. The next day was Sunday, and Jay, a lifelong University of Texas fan, took his young son to his first baseball game—a rivalry game between U.T. and Texas Tech. The game was close, and, at the top of the ninth, Tech looked to be about to take the lead. But U.T. brought in a relief pitcher who shut down the next three batters, ending the game. “It doesn't happen every day,” Jay told me, “but sometimes the good guys win.” By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

1,http://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/31/fact-check-dianne-feinstein-gunman-lay-down-weapons-human-nature/,"A meme shared on Facebook claimed that Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said a gunman will lay down his arms if no one else is armed.  “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in…. that’s just human nature,” reads the alleged quote. Verdict: False There is no record of Feinstein ever saying this. The quote appears to have originated on a now-defunct satirical website. Fact Check: Feinstein has been a vocal supporter of gun control for decades. In the 1990s, she authored the now-expired assault weapons ban that limited the types of firearms Americans could purchase. The California senator has repeatedly sought to enact gun control legislation, including an updated version of the ban. “Without stronger laws to prevent straw purchasing and close the gaping holes in our background check system, a presumptive murderer barely has to lift a finger to buy a gun,” Feinstein said after the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest Feinstein ever made the statement attributed to her in the meme. An online search revealed nothing credible resembling the quote. (RELATED: Did Dianne Feinstein Say It’s Legal To Hunt Humans With 30-Round Magazines?) The quote has circulated online for years, and the satirical website The Palookaville Post appears to be the source. Although the site is no longer accessible, a February 2013 article – “Feinstein and Boxer Ask Californians to Lay Down Their Weapons During Statewide Manhunt” – contained the quote: “The Senators feel the best course of action is to remove all weapons from law enforcement and private citizens so no one else gets hurt,” reads a fabricated quote, attributed to a Senate communications intern. “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in … that’s just human nature.” Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

2,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/kUDjefKEPK0/,"HBO The Rundown is a weekly column that highlights some of the biggest, weirdest, and most notable events of the week in entertainment. The number of items will vary, as will the subject matter. It will not always make a ton of sense. Some items might not even be about entertainment, to be honest, or from this week. The important thing is that it’s Friday and we are here to have some fun. Are you aware that three of the best dramas in television history are making movie-length returns in the near future? You probably are. You’re smart and you follow interesting developments. Let’s run through them anyway, just for the other people: Deadwood is back this weekend for a two-hour conclusion to the unfinished story it left behind over a decade ago; The Sopranos will return at some point in a slightly altered form when David Chase finishes his prequel film; and Vince Gilligan and company are working on a Jesse Pinkman-based follow-up to Breaking Bad. Whether these are all good decisions is open to interpretation and depends largely on the finished products (it’s not like we have any reason to doubt the people involved), but if three of the five best dramas ever made are in on the fun, the cat is already out of that bag. This is a thing now. And because it’s a thing now, it raises an obvious question: What’s next? What other shows will get movie-length adaptations from the original creative team? The options here are limitless. The three I listed above feature one continuation (Deadwood), one prequel (Sopranos), and one borderline spin-off (Breaking Bad). There’s plenty of room to build out from the source material if other shows want to give it a crack. I’ve got a few options listed below, all of them selected for being my personal favorites as much as any other reason. You probably have your own suggestions, too. Toss them into the ring. Have a blast, I say. Justified Justified was a very good show with a very good ending. (“We dug coal together.”) There is nothing like it on television right now, with its mix of drama and goofs and action. I would love to have more Justified in my life if the people involved can figure out a way to do it. I’m not the only one, either. Listen to Timothy Olyphant: [T]here’s no Deadwood-esque Justified revival on the immediate horizon, but Raylan Givens is a role Olyphant hopes to play for the rest of his career. “If [they] want to come back three years from now, or ten years from now, and do a Raylan story—I’ll do them until they say, ‘Tim, you’re too old.’ I’ll do them in a heartbeat. I would love nothing more than for that to happen.” I read that quote and immediately had this flash in my brain of a series of Columbo-style Raylan one-offs. Four or five of them, one every few years, with the whole gang back together and Raylan breaking up Oxy rings or organized crime groups or hunting Wynn Duffy throughout the surf spots of the Pacific. He can go to Boyd for help with his cases, visiting the wild-haired maniac in prison like Clarice visiting Hannibal Lecter. Again, I don’t know if this is a good idea. I would very much watch it, though. Every time. I miss my devious Kentucky boys. Also, please don’t forget this: Why yes, I would also watch a spin-off about Boyd Crowder getting out of prison — perhaps early, in exchange for his help — and opening a Dairy Queen. I want to see his rise. I want to see him threaten and intimidate and become the ice cream king of the south. I want this badly. Please. Mad Men Who among us doesn’t want to spend more time with the characters from Mad Men? I miss Peggy and Don and Joan and Roger. Especially Roger. Even Pete Campbell, surprisingly. I really started coming around on him near the end, probably related to him shouting “The king ordered it!” while defending his family’s aristocratic legacy. Hell, I’d even go so far as to say I’d watch an entire spin-off movie about Pete doing business in Kansas, where we last saw him and his family headed. I can’t believe I’m saying this. I once — many times, actually — advocated for Pete getting eaten by a bear. I’d still kind of like to see it, if I’m being honest. Maybe that’s how the movie ends. Best of both worlds. Worth considering. Happy Endings Happy Endings was one of my favorite network comedies of all-time and I’m still angry it got canceled. It was so funny and so fast and so loaded with talent that it feels unfair that it just doesn’t exist anymore. I’m sure getting everyone together again would be a logistical nightmare at this point. I doubt there’s even the demand beyond me banging pots and pans together about it right now. I don’t care. I want it and I think I should have it. Zoo Okay, listen. I know I’m the only one who cares about Zoo, the short-lived CBS summer series about genetically-altered animals banding together to overthrow the human race. But it’s important to point out that the last thing any of us saw on the show was, well, this. To be clear, that is a remote-controlled military issue jumbo jet — complete with a fully-stocked laboratory and an also-fully-stocked bar, for reasons that were never explained — crashing through the wall that separates humans from a gaggle of bloodthirsty scienced-up hell-beasts. That was the cliffhanger ending of the third season and then the show was canceled. On one hand, this is the perfect way to end a show that created rubble and chaos everywhere it went with little concern for the fallout, but on the other hand… no, never mind. It’s too perfect. Forget I said anything. Assassin season is over, sadly. Barry wrapped up its brilliant second season a couple of weeks ago and Killing Eve wrapped up its… good… season this week. Yeah, let’s go with good, not great. The show was still cool and visually enchanting and the performances of the two leads — Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer — still lapped most other performances on television. Especially Comer. She’s so good as Villanelle, the show’s sociopath contract killer, that I think I’d just haul off in the opposite direction if I ever saw her on the street. Can’t be too careful. But the second season lacked the depth and sizzle of the first. Some of that can be attributed to the show’s creator and driving voice, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, leaving the show to go make the basically perfect second season of Fleabag. Some could just be your general sophomore slump. Again, the show was still good and better than 80-85 percent of other options on television. It just fell a little short of the stratospheric highs of the first season. This is the show’s own fault, really, for setting the bar so high. I will say this, though. In the show’s fourth episode, after Villanelle leaves her handler to work for Constantin again, she takes an assignment in Amsterdam that involves posing as a prostitute who wears a pig mask and gutting some lout from belt to sternum while he hangs upside-down in front of a crowd of Red Light district gawkers, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before. I’m almost sure of it. I think I’d remember if I had. It was a wild and fun and tension-packed scene. I’m not sure it did much for the actual forward thrust of the season beyond being very cool. Sometimes that’s enough, though. It’s obviously stuck with me. I definitely won’t be visiting any pig-masked Dutch prostitutes any time soon. Again, can’t be too careful out there. LOOK AT IT LOOK AT PIERCE LOOK AT THE GOD OF VACATION SOAK IN THE SUMMER VIBES THAT ARE RADIATING THROUGH YOUR SCREEN MIX UP A PITCHER OF MAI TAIS LOOK AT THE REST OF THE PICTURES FROM THE ESQUIRE PROFILE, TOO READ THE PROFILE READ THIS “I love to paint. I don’t paint enough. I have a body of work that I wish to show, expose, exhibit. There’s been word of doing an exhibit in Paris. That’s been talked about. I don’t know,” Brosnan says. “I think if I do an exhibit, I feel it should be in Los Angeles. Have a showing. Turn the lights down low. Have some margaritas and some wine, good music.” NOW LOOK AT THE PICTURE AGAIN I MIGHT GET IT PRINTED ON A T-SHIRT AND REQUEST TO BE BURIED IT PIERCE YES Here’s Kate McKinnon pretending to be Reese Witherspoon in the latest clip from Billy on the Street. That should be enough to get you to click. McKinnon and Eichner tricking people into thinking they’re meeting Reese Witherspoon is a perfect comedy premise. Her impression isn’t even dead-on. It’s more of a feel thing than straight-up mimicry, starting with the dress and hair and extending to the “heyyy yoouuuu” she drops on the first person they encounter. It’s kind of like Will Ferrell’s impression of George W. Bush. It’s not necessarily accurate but it feels accurate anyway. Kate McKinnon is the greatest. In fact, the only bone I have to pick with the whole endeavor is that these people should recognize Kate McKinnon. All of them should. Kate McKinnon has been killing it on SNL for years and stole Ghostbusters like a very weird cat burglar. She should be a much bigger star by now. She should be huge. Why haven’t we let Kate McKinnon become a huge star who leads her own raunchy blockbuster comedy? She should be so famous by now that this sketch fails miserably because everyone who bumps into her is like “Holy shit, it’s Kate McKinnon” before she gets into her Reese ruse. The world might be a tiny bit less fun because it’ll rob us of bits like this, but it would be more fair and just. I think that’s a decent trade here. It sets a good precedent, at least. Vin Diesel reflects on making #F8 with F. Gary Gray pic.twitter.com/QShhWxj22B — Variety (@Variety) May 28, 2019  Director F. Gary Gray was honored with a star on the Walk of Fame this week. The director of Straight Outta Compton and Fate of the Furious has been kicking around for a while and doing great work. No complaints here. They gave Guy Fieri one last week. I say that not to diminish to achievements of either man. I say it mostly because it is still incredible to me. Matthew McConaughey gave the speech. I may never get over that. Not to be outdone, though, this ceremony featured a speech by Vin Diesel. I really must insist you watch this speech. It hits every Vin Diesel bullet point. Here, look: What a strange man. I love him. If you have questions about television, movies, food, local news, weather, or, like, whatever you want, shoot them to me at brian.grubb@uproxx.com and put “RUNDOWN” in the subject line. I am the first writer to ever answer reader mail in a column. Do not look up this last part. Ryan: I’ve been watching Collateral on HBO a lot recently. On my fifth or sixth watch, I finally caught it from the very beginning and realized that the person who gives Tom Cruise the briefcase with all the kill list info in it is … Jason Statham! He only in the movie for 30 seconds! My questions are: Are you aware of this? Why is Jason Statham in Collateral for only 30 seconds? Ryan, this is an excellent point. We discussed Collateral a few weeks ago to note that Tom Cruise’s character is apparently named Vincent Collateral, according to the movie’s supplemental materials. We were all so excited about it that we did not discuss the Statham of it all, though. This was an error on my part, and an unforgivable one at that. I apologize. To answer your questions: Yes, I am aware and it delights me every time. He and Cruise do the old “bump into each other and swap briefcases” move in the airport. Here’s proof. As far as the why, let’s go to the most trustworthy and unimpeachable source of information available: user-submitted IMDb trivia. Jason Statham’s cameo is often regarded as a nod to his character Frank Martin from The Transporter (2002) and its sequels. He delivers a bag to Vincent at the airport and then disappears, no questions asked. Good enough for me! It’s fun to think about someone explaining everything that happens after this to Statham’s character. Like, the next day. I picture him listening to it all very patiently and then saying, in total disbelief, “Da fookin cabbie did all ‘is?” To Australia! “Egg Boy,” the Melbourne teen who cracked an egg on the head of an Australian senator after his inflammatory remarks about the New Zealand mass shooting in March, said he’s donated almost A$100,000 (about $69,000 U.S.) to the Christchurch Foundation and Victims Support. Egg Boy! We all remember Egg Boy, yes? We all remember how much Egg Boy ruled? I really hope we do. For all the original reasons, of course, but also for this. Listen to Egg Boy. For those of you who don’t know, there were 2 Go Fund Me pages set up to help cover the cost of my legal fees and to ‘buy more eggs’. Gratefully, Gordon Legal acted probono for me so I don’t have any legal fees. I decided to donate all monies to help provide some relief to the victims of the massacre… it wasn’t mine to keep.

A longtime city employee opened fire in a municipal building in Virginia Beach on Friday, killing several people on three floors and sending terrified co-workers scrambling for cover before police shot and killed him following a “long gun-battle,” authorities said. (Kaitlin McKeown/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)  The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city’s Municipal Center, and “immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,” Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect’s name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45-caliber handgun, the chief said. “It was a long gunbattle between those four officers and the suspect,” he said. He said officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died. Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. Police said they have identified the suspect in the shooting but have not released his name because they haven’t been able to notify family members. Cervera said when he does release the name, it will be only once. He said after that, “he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families.” The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the “unspeakable, senseless violence,” and is offering the state’s full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. “That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,” the governor said during the news conference. The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. “Thank God my baby is OK,” Banton’s mother, Dana Showers, said. At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. “I think she knew some of the people,” he said. Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives. She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun. Then he saw the bodies. “This is unbelievable for Virginia Beach,” Cheryl Benn said. “By and large, it’s a pretty calm and peaceful place to live.” Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Washington, D.C.; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; and Tom Foreman Jr. in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed to this report.

City Councilwoman Barbara Henley had just pulled up to the City Hall building just after 4 p.m. to pick up the agenda as she does every week when she heard sirens and saw police cars.
“I thought it was an accident,” Henley said. As she parked her car in the lot between Building 1 and 2, she noticed city employees standing outside using their cellphones. Someone told her there was a shooting and she should leave. Henley had gotten back in her car when she heard a male voice shout, “Get down!” People scattered. “I was scared to death,” Henley said. She quickly drove home. Henley said she’s never seen a situation like this before at the Municipal Center, adding that security has recently been “beefed up” in the City Hall building as a result of shooting incidents across the nation, but that some of the other municipal buildings do not take the same security measures.

Virginia Beach police Chief Jim Cervera said the heavily armed shooter died in an exchange of gunfire with four officers who rushed into the building. The gunman was armed with a .45 caliber handgun and he exhausted multiple extended magazines in the onslaught, leaving a ""war zone"" of carnage, spent bullets and empty ammunition casings, Cervera said. Cervera said the gunman walked into the Virginia Beach Municipal Center - where up to 400 people work - shortly after 4 p.m. EDT and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all the victims."" His name has not yet been released because police said they have been unable to notify his relatives. ""The officers stopped this individual from committing more carnage,"" Cervera said. The gunman likely would have used all his ammunition on innocent people had the officers not engaged him in the gun battle, forcing him to use up the massive store of ammunition that he brought on his killing mission, the chief said. Among the wounded: a Virginia Beach Police officer whose life was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. Police also say the gunman brought extended ammunition magazines that held more bullets than a typical magazine, suggesting that he wanted as much firepower as possible to inflict damage inside the building. He also had a sound suppressor for his handgun. Unlike some states, silencers are legal in Virginia, though it is illegal to have one in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. More: What we know so far about the Virginia Beach shooting The nation's latest mass shooting sent alarm and shock throughout Virginia Beach, a popular resort town with a population of 440,000. The municipal center is several miles from the resort areas of the beach, located along the Atlantic Coast about 200 miles south of Washington, D.C. The community is also home to three military bases. ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Mayor Bobby Dyer said. ""The people involved are our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues."" The extent of the injuries to survivors is still unclear. Four patients were undergoing surgery late Friday at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. Initially, police said 11 victims had died, but a 12th died on their way to the hospital. ""We're still trying to figure it out,"" Dyer said of the victims and their injuries. ""There is obviously a lot of chaos and confusion."" The gunman himself was among the wounded after the gun battle. Officers were in the midst of bringing him out of the building when he died of his wounds, Cervera said. Christina Pullen, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Norfolk, said the bureau is responding to assist Virginia Beach police. The shooting broke out in Building No., 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, which includes several city facilities, including the police department. Building 2 houses offices for planning and public works and is adjacent to city hall. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting broke out, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” Sheila Cook, an employee, said workers heard shooting but didn't think it was so close. She told reporters that police were able to alert them quickly to give them time to leave the building. ""I am still shaken, because there is entirely too much killing going on,"" Cook said. Zand Bakhtiari told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper that the gunfire thundered in swift succession, sounding like an automatic weapon. “It was repeated, rapid gunfire,” said Bakhtiari, who said he was one of only five people left in the IT department on the first floor of the building at the end of the day. He was warned by his supervisor, who had left the office and texted to say there was an active shooter and people should shelter in place. After a few minutes the flurry of bullets seemed to stop, he said, but the fire alarm went off and he could smell gunpowder. After about 10 minutes SWAT team members and police escorted Bakhatiari and his co-workers to safety, he told the paper. Arthur Felton, an 18-year employee in the planning department, told the Virginian-Pilot he was able to evacuate after a co-worker heard gunshots.  A shaken Felton said he “never thought this would happen in my building. The people who were shot – I’m sure I know most of them.” City Councilwoman Barbara Henley had just arrived at the City Hall building right after 4 p.m. when she heard sirens and assumed there had been an accident, she told the Virginian-Pilot. After exiting her car, Henley said she was told by employees outside there was a shooting as they urged her to leave. She said she heard someone shout “Get down!” as she got back in her car. “I was scared to death.” Henley told the paper security had been increased recently at the City Hall building but said some other city buildings don’t follow the same security measures. Survivors of the shooting were reuniting Friday evening with friends and relatives at a middle school. Paul Swain was among those who arrived at the Princess Anne Middle School to reunite with loved ones who were in the municipal building during the shooting. Swain said he saw his fiancee across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. He said he thinks she knew some of the people who were hurt or killed. The school’s parking lot was filled with police and civilian vehicles. Cervera praised first responders for their actions. ""When this violent act occurred, police and fire-rescue responded and did the professional thing that they do, because that's what they do,"" he said. Cervera also said that citizens can ""rest easy"" tonight after the suspect was taken down. ""This day will not define Virginia Beach, our response will define Virginia Beach,"" Councilman Aaron Rouse said. ""We will come together, we will show the strength of our city."" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who rushed to the scene, said it was an ""horrific day"" for the community and that ""This is unspeakable, senseless violence."" The mayor of Aurora, Illinois, where six people were killed in a shooting in February, said people in his community ""mourn for the victims of this senseless mass shooting."" Virginia Beach Council member Aaron Rouse was a student at Virginia Tech when 33 people died in a mass shooting at the Blacksburg school in 2007. He told CNN he was “in shock” when he learned of Friday’s rampage, and it hit close to home. “I immediately jumped into ‘not again, this cannot happen again, I can’t believe this happened again.’” Rouse, who saluted the valiant first responders on Friday, said he went from feeling sorry and helpless during college to knowing that in his role as a councilman he could help have “those tough conversations” about ways to end gun violence and make communities safer. “We must learn from the mistakes of our past. We cannot show fear; our leaders have to stand up.” Rouse said a good way to start was to open minds and hearts and have more tolerance for people. Mass shootings affect everyone, no matter where they happen, he told CNN. “We were Virginia Tech strong, now we are Virginia Beach strong.” Contributing: Susan Miller and the Associated Press",2019-05-31 19:41:44,Police: 11 killed after shooter opens fire in Virginia Beach municipal building; suspect dead,,85390,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider

Six other people were wounded in the shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life, said Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera. The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered Building 2 in the Virginia Beach Municipal Center, and “immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,” Cervera said. He did not release the suspect’s name. Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was killed, the chief said. The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. But the building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” She said she texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. Banton works in an office of about 20 people that is part of the public works department. “Thank God my baby is OK,” said Banton’s mother, Dana Showers. Five of the injured were being treated at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital and a sixth was being transferred to the Trauma Center at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, Sentara Healthcare tweeted. Paul Swain, 50, was among those who arrived at the Princess Anne Middle School to reunite with loved ones who were in the building during the shooting. He said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. “I think she knew some of the people,” he said.

22,https://newsone.com/3853534/dewayne-craddock-virginia-beach-shooting-suspect/,"Posted May 31, 2019 UPDATED: 3:19 a.m., June 1 — The death toll has risen after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach municipal building on Friday. A 12th person died from the gun violence that was allegedly perpetrated by DeWayne Craddock, a 40-year-old longtime city worker who was reportedly disgruntled after being fired recently. The 12th shooting victim reportedly died on the way to the hospital. The number of injured was reduced from six to four, according to the Associated Press, which reported that one of the people wounded was a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life. In the meantime, investigators were working to learn more about Craddock.  Original story:  The suspected mass shooter who killed at least 11 people and injured at least six others at a municipal center in Virginia Beach on Friday afternoon was widely identified across social media as DeWayne Craddock. The Wall Street Journal also reported that the gunman was identified as DeWayne Craddock, a 40-year-old Black man who “made multiple firearm purchases in recent weeks.” “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said after the shooting. “The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues.” Cable news outlets described the shooter as being disgruntled and the Wall Street Journal reported that he was a “longtime city employee who had been fired entered a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va., Friday afternoon to exact revenge.” A web page on the MyLife.com listed information about a Virginia Beach resident named DeWayne Craddock as being 40 years old and having a birthday on Oct. 15, 1978. It lists him as a Black registered Democrat and Christian who is married. The shooter died in an exchange of gunfire with police. Heavy.com produced a photo of DeWayne Craddock that showed an image of a Black man. If it does turn out that Craddock was the gunman, the fact that he is Black would offer a unique narrative surrounding the spate of mass shootings that have been taking place across the U.S. in recent years. “Statistics show that since 1982, the majority of mass shootings — 54 percent — were committed by white men,” Newsweek reported while citing statistics on mass shootings compiled by Mother Jones. “Black people were the second largest perpetrators of mass shootings based on ethnic background, but only accounted for roughly 16 percent of the total incidents during the same time period.” That Newsweek report was from 2017, before the Parkland massacre and other public shootings that resulted in mass deaths perpetrated by white males. Between 1982 and June of last year, 59 of the 101 mass shootings in that time span were launched by white people, according to data provided by Statista, which offers “statistics and studies from more than 22,500 sources.” Black people had the next-highest number of mass shooters at 16.

24,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-illinois-gun-bill-no-vote-20190531-story.html,"A major gun licensing reform bill will not make it out of the Illinois legislature this session. Backers of the “Fix the FOID” act, which was largely a response to a mass shooting in Aurora in February, have vowed to bring back the measure for another try. Proponents say the bill is needed to strengthen background checks for gun owners and provide more funding to better enforce existing laws that bar dangerous people from possessing weapons. The measure, which would have increased fees for gun licenses and required all applicants be fingerprinted, won House approval earlier this week despite opposition from lawmakers who said it infringed on Second Amendment rights. But legislators told the Tribune on Friday that the bill would not be called for a vote in the Illinois Senate. The failure of the bill that was prompted by one mass shooting happened to occur on the day of another mass shooting, this one in Virginia Beach, Va., where local authorities said 11 people were killed Friday. The February mass shooting in Aurora — by a revoked Illinois license holder who should never have been able to purchase the handgun he used to kill five people — became a rallying cry for supporters who wanted to close loopholes in the law. But the legislation faced strong opposition, with detractors calling the proposed new regulations among the most “onerous” in the nation and an infringement on their constitutional rights. The bill was debated for three hours in the House, with Downstate and suburban Republican lawmakers challenging the need to fingerprint or raise fees on lawful gun owners. On Friday, Democrat Julie Morrison, the Senate sponsor of the bill, spoke strongly in support of it but said she ran out of time to explain to fellow senators the significant changes it proposed. “I feel confident that it is going to become law,” Morrison said. “It’s just not going to become law May 31.” Kathleen Sances, president of the Gun Violence Prevention PAC, which was involved in drafting the legislation, is holding out hope the proposal will come for a vote before the Senate at a later date. “We’re really thrilled that we were able to get the bill out of the House, and I really have to give credit to Rep. (Kathleen) Willis,” Sances said of the bill’s House sponsor. “We ran out of time in the Senate. … So moving forward we’ll just be talking with both chambers and we’ll see what we can do to get enough votes to pass it in the Senate.” Morrison said the legislation could be taken up in November during the veto session. The call to require fingerprinting to obtain a state firearms license, known commonly as a FOID, gained serious steam after Aurora gunman Gary Martin opened fire with a Smith & Wesson handgun at the Henry Pratt Co. and killed five co-workers. Martin, a convicted felon, was prohibited from owning a gun and had his FOID card revoked by Illinois State Police in 2014. But he managed to keep both the license and the Smith & Wesson he used in the mass shooting. A Tribune investigation in May found the state stripped more than 34,000 residents of their FOID cards over the past four years. But because of a lack of follow-up, law enforcement does not know what nearly 80 percent of those people have done with their weapons, the Tribune found. As many as 30,000 guns are unaccounted for, the report found. Willis, the House sponsor, vowed to continue the fight to pass the legislation. “While I am disappointed … I remain committed to continue to work over the summer with the stakeholders to return with a bill that will … address the issues with the (FOID) system and make our state safer,” Willis, a Democrat, said in a statement to the Tribune. Besides the fingerprinting provision, the measure would have increased the application fee from $10 for a 10-year FOID card to $20 for five years. Some of the additional revenue would have funded a task force to account for the firearms of revoked cardholders. The Illinois State Police, in the wake of Aurora, instituted major changes to how FOID card revocation details are shared among law enforcement, taking the unprecedented step of creating a database listing every revoked cardholder statewide. The information, which has been shared with most departments, includes the crucial information about firearms purchasing history for each revoked cardholder and the reason for the revocation. State police also announced they planned to form regional task forces to help communities address their backlogs. But all of this now appears to be happening without any additional money that the legislation would have provided through the fee increase. “Long-term, more funding is critical to addressing the revocations and the backlog, but in the meantime the work needs to continue,” said Cara Smith, chief policy officer for the Cook County sheriff’s office, which has a revocation team. “Dangerous people are revoked every day.” Tribune reporter Stacy St. Clair contributed. asweeney@chicagotribune.com sfreishtat@tribpub.com creyes@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-05-31 22:05:00,"Illinois gun licensing bill prompted by Aurora mass shooting fails, but supporters vow to bring it back",,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

30,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/liam-sigler/illinois-house-passes-bill-requiring-fingerprints-obtain-gun-license,"The Illinois House of Representatives passed a bill on May 29 that would require residents to give their fingerprints in order to obtain a firearm license. The bill passed 62-52, and now moves on to the Illinois Senate. State Representative Julie Morrison (D-Ill.) declared, “Fingerprinting increases our ability to look at records in other states, so it’s a huge advantage and one I think Illinois needs to seriously look at.” As reported by the Chicago Tribune, the law would also establish a special task force that would enforce the removal of all firearms in the possession of a gun owner who had had their license revoked. The bill would also reportedly make it possible to impose delays in legal firearm transfers, criminalize private transfers, and mandate an additional background check, if gifted a firearm (even if they already possess a Firearm Owner’s Identification card). A FOID is restricted under this law, reducing its longevity from 10 years to 5 years and requiring the applicant to pay for the fingerprinting process, which can cost up to $150, in addition to any application fees, stated the NRA.  State Representative Charlie Meier (R-Ill.), argued that instead of invasive fingerprint records, Illinois ought to enforce gun laws already on the books. “I am against the fingerprinting,” said Meier. “I believe we have far exceeded going against our Second Amendment rights in trying to fingerprint our citizens. The shooter in Aurora should have been caught by the laws we already have. He was breaking the laws we already have. What does fingerprinting honest citizens have to do with it?” The fingerprinting legislation has been introduced as a solution to gun violence, such as the deadly workplace shooting in Aurora, Illinois on Feb. 15, in which six people were killed and six injured. Democratic House members have pointed out that although the Aurora, Ill.,  killer possessed a FOID, he had a criminal conviction that ought to have nullified his license, reported the New York Times. Democrats have also claimed that the fingerprint bill supplements an already flawed FOID system, which they say does not prevent gun applicants from putting misinformation on their FOID card. Kathleen Sances, president of the Illinois Gun Violence Prevention Action Committee, said, “Our FOID card system is clearly broken. It’s prudent that lawmakers act as soon as they can to prevent another mass shooting in our state.” The State Journal Register reported that, “The Illinois State Rifle Association will bring legal action against the bill should it become law.

Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said the mass shooting in the coastal resort city began as a  public utility employee entered the public works and utilities building at the city municipal center and ""immediately and indiscriminately fired upon all the victims."" The chief later said that the suspect engaged in a ""long-term gun battle"" with law enforcement officers as police confronted him inside the building. One police officer was wounded in the shootout, but his bullet-proof vest saved his life, Cervera said. The police chief said the suspect was armed with a .45-caliber handgun equipped with a ""sound suppressor"" device and was reloading his weapon with extended ammunition magazines as he moved through the building. Authorities said the gunman ultimately was shot by police and was pronounced dead at a hospital. Cervera said the suspect was a longtime public utilities employee, and described him as ""disgruntled,"" but declined to say more about what may have precipitated the attack. Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer said the event marked the city's ""darkest hour."" Governor Ralph Northam called the shooting ""a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia."" ""My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning, and will not return tonight, as well as those who have been injured in this tragedy,"" Northam said in a statement. ""This is unspeakable, senseless violence. I commend local and state law enforcement, first responders, medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation,"" the governor said. ""My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families."" The shooting was believed to be the deadliest act of workplace gun violence in the United States since February, when a factory worker shot five colleagues to death in Aurora, Illinois, just after he was let go from his job. —CNBC contributed to this report.

37,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602615280/0/phoenix/nation~aposWar-zoneapos-killed-in-Virginia-Beach-as-gunman-roamed-three-floors-shooting-at-will/,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — The heavily armed public works employee who fatally shot 12 people at a municipal building here is described by police and those who knew him as an enigma who gave no indication that he was stockpiling an arsenal and planned a systematic assault on his co-workers. DeWayne Craddock, a 15-year veteran of public works and a civil engineer, was still employed at the time of the massacre and had a pass to enter the secure inner offices and conference rooms, officials said Saturday. Virginia Beach police chief Jim Cervera said Craddock, 40, a public utilities engineer, had not been fired from his job. The chief refused to theorize on a possible motive for why Craddock sprayed bullets into fleeing office workers, using a .45 caliber handgun armed with a silencer that police believe was used for stealth and to keep victims from knowing where the attacker was in the building. That could at least partially explain why survivors of the attack said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. Craddock brought numerous extended magazines loaded with ammunition, which carry more rounds than traditional magazines, police said. “Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,” said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. Craddock was eventually killed in an ""intense firefight"" with four responding officers who hemmed him in and likely prevented him from using his load of ammunition on more victims, Cervera said. The image of a public works employee holed up with a silencer and extended magazines amid a merciless assault is a far cry from how Craddock's neighbors saw him. They describe Craddock as a car enthusiast, bodybuilder, and seemingly quiet man. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, lived in a Virginia Beach townhome beneath Craddock for the past year and only got to know him in passing, exchanging the occasional greeting. “He wasn’t much of a talker,” Archer recalled. “He’s a mystery to us. He’s a mystery to everybody, apparently.” City Manager Dave Hansen said Craddock was still employed in the department, had a security pass and ""was authorized to enter the building."" In order to avoid excessive publicizing of the shooter's name, officials said they would only give his name publicly once and would afterward refer to him only as ""the suspect."" Craddock had served in the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time of his city hire, and received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Craddock roamed three floors of the office building, shooting indiscriminately at his co-workers. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said at a Saturday afternoon press conference that Craddock legally bought two .45 caliber handguns – one in 2016 and 2018. Both were found at the crime scene and neither was previously used in any other crime, the ATF reported. Hansen said all but one of the victims were employees of the city working in the public works department.The shooter killed his first victim in a car in the parking lot before he entered the building. The victims were identified as Laquita Brown, Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alesander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Richard H. Nettleton, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer, Robert “Bobby” Williams  and Herbert “Bert” Snelling, a contractor. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" a somber Hansen told reporters. Outside a movie theater in a strip mall about 3 miles from the scene of the shooting, about 200 people gathered at a morning vigil as pastors delivered messages about resilience interspersed with prayer songs. Parents held umbrellas over squirming children as speakers vowed that the shooting wouldn’t identify the community. Some knelt. Others turned their heads down while rubbing their eyes A few in the crowd wore T-shirts or baseball caps marked with the names of city departments. Jonas Alered said he had lunch with one of the victims, Gallagher, earlier in the week. The tragedy left a “deep void,” he said. Four people were also injured in the shooting that broke out Friday afternoon in the popular Virginia resort city with a population of 440,000 about 200 miles south of Washington, D.C. Three were in critical condition; a fourth was in fair condition, officials said. Also, a Virginia Beach Police officer was also shot, but his life was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. Sal’s Pizza owner Mostafa Essabar was in his shop across from the Virginia Beach Municipal Complex around 4 p.m. Friday when he started noticing police activity in the area. Across the street, he saw a man he recognized as one of his regular customers on the ground with officers surrounding him. ""I was thinking it's like an accident or something, but then I saw like the blood start coming from his chest,” he said. K-9 vehicles started converging on the scene, helicopters were circling and SWAT was arriving, he said. As an ambulance drove the injured man away, Essabar realized there was something big going on. When officials released the names of the 12 victims killed in the shooting Saturday morning, Essabar said he recognized at least six of them as customers who regularly frequented his business. Often, he said, they only had about about a 45-minute window to grab lunch. But he knew many of their favorite orders and would start working on them as soon as they stepped in the door. Among the victims Essobar knew were Katherine Nixon, whose favorite order he recalled was a salad and wings with a Diet Pepsi, and Robert Williams, who he said came in sometimes twice a week to grab pepperoni pizza. His business was among several in the area near the complex that painted the words #VBStrong on their windows in a show of support for those affected by the tragedy. “It’s sad. It’s really sad. It’s like you lost one of your family,” Essobar said. “They are like a part of you because you’ve been dealing with them every day, every week, and they are very nice people.” The mass shooting was the deadliest attack in the U.S. since the November rampage at Borderline Bar & Grill in California, when 12 people were also killed. Friday's massacre sent shock waves throughout Virginia Beach, also home to three military bases. Spoke to Virginia Governor @RalphNortham last night, and the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Virginia Beach this morning, to offer condolences to that great community. The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all! President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that he had spoken to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and city officials ""to offer condolences to that great community."" He said the federal government would provide whatever assistance was needed. Cervera said the heavily armed shooter died in an exchange of gunfire with four officers who rushed into the building. After downing the shooter, police then attempted to give the gravely injured suspect first aid before he died. The sound suppressor that the gunman used for his handgun is legal in Virginia but is not permitted in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. Some survivors said they did not think the gunfire was close at first because it was not especially loud. Cervera described the scene as a ""war zone"" in the running battle between police and the shooter. Cervera said the gunman walked into the Virginia Beach Municipal Center — where up to 400 people work — shortly after 4 p.m. EDT and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all the victims."" ""The officers stopped this individual from committing more carnage,"" Cervera said. The gunman likely would have used all his ammunition on innocent people had the officers not engaged him in the gunbattle, forcing him to use up the massive store of ammunition that he brought on his killing mission, the chief said. In Yorktown, where Craddock's relatives live in a two-story house, a handwritten note taped to the front door said the Craddock family ""wishes to send our heart felt condolences to the victims, "" The Washington Post reports. ""We are grieving the loss of our loved one,"" the note said. "" At this time we wish to focus on the victims and the lives lost during yesterdays tragic event. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who loss their lives, and those recovering in the hospital.” More: What we know so far about the Virginia Beach shooting ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Mayor Bobby Dyer said. ""The people involved are our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues."" Christina Pullen, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Norfolk, said the bureau is responding to assist Virginia Beach police. The shooting broke out in Building No., 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, which includes several city facilities, including the police department. Building 2 houses offices for planning and public works and is adjacent to city hall. Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the department of public works, said he had worked with Craddock before and had a brief interaction with him Friday. Scott said he saw him in the men’s restroom about five minutes before the shooting. “He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,” Scott said. “I said ‘Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?’ It was just a brief conversation.” Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting broke out, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” Sheila Cook, an employee, said police were able to alert them quickly to give them time to leave the building. ""I am still shaken, because there is entirely too much killing going on,"" Cook said. Zand Bakhtiari told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper that the gunfire came in swift succession, sounding like an automatic weapon. “It was repeated, rapid gunfire,” said Bakhtiari, who said he was one of only five people left in the IT department on the first floor of the building at the end of the day. Arthur Felton, an 18-year employee in the planning department, told the Virginian-Pilot he was able to evacuate after a co-worker heard gunshots.  A shaken Felton said he “never thought this would happen in my building. The people who were shot – I’m sure I know most of them.” City Councilwoman Barbara Henley had just arrived at the City Hall building right after 4 p.m. when she heard sirens and assumed there had been an accident, she told the Virginian-Pilot. After exiting her car, Henley said she was told by employees outside there was a shooting as they urged her to leave. She said she heard someone shout “get down!” as she got back in her car. “I was scared to death.” Henley told the paper security had been increased recently at the City Hall building but said some other city buildings don’t follow the same security measures. Cervera praised first responders for their actions. ""When this violent act occurred, police and fire-rescue responded and did the professional thing that they do, because that's what they do,"" he said. Virginia Beach Council member Aaron Rouse was a student at Virginia Tech when 33 people died in a mass shooting at the Blacksburg school in 2007. He told CNN he was “in shock” when he learned of Friday’s rampage, and it hit close to home. “I immediately jumped into ‘not again, this cannot happen again, I can’t believe this happened again.’” Rouse, who saluted the valiant first responders on Friday, said he went from feeling sorry and helpless during college to knowing that in his role as a councilman he could help have “those tough conversations” about ways to end gun violence and make communities safer. “We must learn from the mistakes of our past. We cannot show fear; our leaders have to stand up.” Mass shootings affect everyone, no matter where they happen, he told CNN. “We were Virginia Tech strong, now we are Virginia Beach strong.” The Virginia Beach police sent out a notice early Saturday saying an Active Threat Citizens Defense workshop previously scheduled in the city had been canceled.

He was a veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department who made multiple legal firearm purchases, including for a handgun and rifle, in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported. A police officer was also wounded, but was saved by his bullet-proof vest. The police didn’t reveal the motive for the shooting. Omar’s comment about the NRA prompted the group’s spokeswoman to question how it was related. “This was a heinous tragedy,” Loesch wrote in a tweet. “Your remarks move me to ask: What do 5 million members of the NRA have to do with this man’s crime?

As our own writer Annie Reneau eloquently stated less than one month ago:  I am a person of faith, but I am done with our first and only response to mass shootings being to think about and pray for victims. Thoughts and prayers are a given, not a solution. I'm done with lone wolf after lone wolf after lone wolf—the majority of which actually have some striking commonalities—terrorizing my country because we refuse to take any serious steps to prevent the easiest means of mass murder. I'm done with blaming mental health when every other country in the world has mentally unstable people and nowhere near our number of mass shootings.    Now, with yet another mass shooting on the books, it's time to shift away from ""thoughts and prayers"" and lean into common sense action. After the Parkland shooting, one site put together a list of 30 concrete examples of things we can all do now to support sensible gun control and put an end to mindless, and yes, systemic, gun violence.

(Reuters) - The gunman who killed 12 people at a Virginia Beach municipal building before dying in a shootout with police was identified on Saturday as a disgruntled city engineer and co-worker of most of the victims. All but one of the victims from Friday’s mass shooting in the coastal resort community were employed by the city, officials said, while the other was a contractor seeking a permit. Four people were wounded. The gunman, DeWayne Craddock, had worked for the city’s public utilities department for about 15 years, Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said at a news conference. He declined to comment on any possible motive. “These are 12 individuals who came to work ... thinking they would go home in the evening, and they didn’t return and it left a tremendous void in their families and in our community,” Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said at a news conference. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since November 2018, when a dozen people were slain at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who then killed himself. Bodies were found on all three floors of the Virginia Beach building and in a car parked outside, according to authorities. Cervera described the crime scene as “horrific” and said that investigators who spent the night inside the building endured a “physical, emotional and psychological toll.” Related Coverage  Police said the gunman was armed with two .45 caliber pistols and used an employee pass to enter secure areas before firing “immediately and indiscriminately” on victims while reloading with multiple extended ammunition magazines. At least one of the pistols was fitted with a “sound suppressor,” police said. Both handguns were bought legally by the shooter within the last three years, Ashan Benedict, a special agent at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the news conference. Two more firearms were found at the home where Craddock lived alone, he said. After the attack began, two police supervisors from a building across the street arrived within minutes, Cervera said, and they were quickly joined by two police dog-handlers. The suspect was killed after a lengthy gun battle. The victims who worked for Virginia Beach had been employed for between 11 months and 41 years. Six worked in the public utilities department and five were employed in the public works department. A number of vigils and commemorations are planned, including a memorial service the city is organizing for Thursday evening. (Graphic: Major mass shootings in the United States - tmsnrt.rs/2KefvTT) The bloodshed unfolded at Building Two of the municipal center complex on Friday afternoon as workers prepared to leave for the weekend. Some survivors recounted how they cowered in fear after stacking desks against office doors as makeshift barricades. Three of the wounded victims were in critical condition and a fourth was in fair condition at local hospitals, said Julie Hill, a spokeswoman for Virginia Beach. A police officer who was shot but saved by his ballistic vest has been treated and released, she said. Cervera said he would only name the gunman once, and hereafter refer to him just as “the suspect.” According to local media, Craddock was 40 years old and had no serious criminal record. He served in the Virginia National Guard from 1996 to 2002, and was assigned to a Norfolk-based battalion as a cannon crew member, a guard spokesman said, adding that Craddock’s records do not indicate any overseas deployments. Cervera said 40 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are recovering evidence at the crime scene, which lies in a complex of office buildings several miles inland from the town’s popular seashore, situated on the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Virginia’s most populous city has roughly 450,000 year-round residents. Its police department had trained for a mass shooting, and even planned to hold a citizen workshop on active shooter situations on Saturday. The workshop was canceled. On Saturday, Melissa Millemon, a daycare worker, and Tina Devault, who works for a heating and cooling company, were among local residents who came to the shooting site to lay flowers, American flags, and other tributes to the victims. Both said they either knew someone who had been killed or had a friend or acquaintance who knew one. “One of my friends lost her neighbor,” Millemon said, adding that a member of the local softball community was also killed. “It’s a sad day,” Devault said.

News By Eileen AJ Connelly Submit June 1, 2019 | 9:13am				| Updated June 1, 2019 | 11:34pm They were moms, churchgoers, musicians, and good neighbors. One man worked for the city for over four decades. Others had just months on the job. The five women and seven men slaughtered at work in Virginia Beach ranged in age from 35 to 74. All but one worked there, serving the city a combined 150 years. Some were lifelong residents, others immigrants from far away places, drawn to the coastal city for its beaches and beautiful scenery. “I have worked with most of them for many years,” said City Manager Dave Hansen. “They leave a void that we will never be able to fill.” The city will hold a remembrance for the victims Thursday evening at Rock Church in Virginia Beach. They were identified as: Laquita C. Brown, 39, of Chesapeake, Virginia, a Public Works right of way agent who worked for the city for four years. “She was one of those people who just lit up a room. Every room,” her lifelong friend Sinda Price wrote in a Facebook post. “And now that light is gone, and my heart can’t stop hurting.” Ryan Keith Cox, 50, a Public Utilities account clerk from Virginia Beach, was known for his singing voice and the frequent acts of kindness he performed. The son of the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach, he was a regular soloist in the choir. “My heart is hurting because my baby brother was murdered today,” his brother, Ervin Cox, wrote on Facebook. “I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore. I loved my brother and will truly miss his caring soul.” Alexander Mikhail Gusev, 35, a right of way agent with Public Works for nine years, also lived in Virginia Beach. A native of Belarus, he came to the U.S. in 2003 as a student and started working for the city after he earned his bachelor’s degree. A friend told the Virginian Pilot Gusev was hoping to get married and have children. “He was a good friend,” said Igor Musin. Musin recently complained that he needed to cut his grass, but didn’t have a lawnmower. Gusev showed up a short time later not to lend Musin a mower, but to cut the grass himself. “That was incredible,” Musin said. Michelle Missy Langer, 60, an administrative assistant in Public Utilities for 12 years. She had planned to retire in a couple of years. A native of Ohio, she had moved to Virginia Beach, the scene of childhood family vacations, more than 20 years ago, but retained her devotion to the Pittsburgh Steelers. “She loved the beach,” her sister-in-law Kimberly Langer told the Post. “She was a very bright and bubbly person that loved life.” Katherine A. Nixon, 42, of Virginia Beach, worked in Public Utilities for 10 years. “She was a great mom” to her three kids, said her uncle, Matthew Lusich, before choking up. She had three girls, the youngest just 15 months old. Nixon came from a family of civil engineers, her grandmother, Claudia Blodget, told the Washington Post. Nixon was wounded in the shooting but died later Friday evening in surgery. Christopher Kelly Rapp, 54, of Powhaton, Virginia, was an engineer with Public Works for 11 months. He learned how to play the bagpipes, joining the Tidewater Pipes and Drums when he moved to the Virginia Beach area last year. He had marched with the band as recently as St. Patrick’s Day. “He was quiet, but had a passion for the pipes and Scottish culture,” the band posted on its Facebook page. “We are heartbroken.” Richard Nettleton, 65, who lived in Norfolk, was an engineer with Public Utilities for 28 years, and had recently gone back to working full time following a car accident in January. “You couldn’t ask for a better human being,” Dwight Farmer, a former colleague, told the Pilot. “It was never about him.” Nettleton was a veteran who had served as a lieutenant in the 130th engineer brigade in Germany. Herbert “Bert” Snelling, 57, was a contractor and the only victim who was not a city employee. He was at the building Friday to get a permit. Snelling was known as someone who was always willing to help. “He was just always there,” Snelling’s longtime neighbor Alton Hill told the Pilot. Snelling was the type of neighbor who would alert Hill when he lost a shingle in a storm, and then climb up on the roof to help him fix it, the newspaper reported. He was married to his wife, Sonja, for 38 years. Tara Welch Gallagher, 39, was a six year employee of Public Works who lived in Virginia Beach. A civil engineer, she also earned a masters in engineering in 2003. Mary Louise Gayle, 65, was a right of way agent with Public Works for 24 years who lived in Virginia Beach. Joshua Hardy, 52, was a Public Utilities engineering technician for four years and lived in Virginia Beach. A devout Christian, he once self-published a children’s book. Robert “Bobby” Williams, 74, of Chesapeake, was a Public Utilities special projects coordinator who worked for the city for 41 years. A co-worker told reporters that he had planned to retire sometime this year to spend more time with his family. Read Next Admitted serial killer charged with murder of 2 more women...

""We want you to know who they were so in the days and weeks to come you will learn what they meant to all of us, to their families, to their friends and to their coworkers,"" said City Manager Dave Hansen. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill."" Four people were also injured in the melee that broke out Friday afternoon in the popular Virginia resort city. The victims' names were released by police Saturday morning: Brown worked at public works for 4.5 years. She was remembered by Kimberlita Casper, who identified herself as Brown's cousin, in several Facebook posts. ""I am heartbroken. My cousin's life was taken from her today,"" she wrote. Casper remembered a conversation with Brown where she spoke of doing preaching work and traveling abroad: ""You could see the true joy she had."" Even though they were at a family funeral, the two found peace in that moment. ""We were smiling, laughing and so happy because we know what God promises in just a little while longer if we give our best and do not tire out."" Cox worked at public utilities for 12.5 years. He was the son of Ray Cox, Sr., the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach, the Washington Post reports. Cox's older brother Ervin posted a tribute on Facebook: ""My heart is hurting because my baby brother was murdered today by the shooter in Virginia Beach mass shooting. I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore. I loved my brother and will truly miss his caring soul. Until we meet again in heaven"" Gayle worked at public works for 24 years. She was looking forward to a free day at a spa, which friends and neighbors told the New York Times was to be a reward for her work. “She was a super sweet lady; she always had this big smile,” next-door neighbor John Cushman told the Times. “She would always be out there in the yard, working on something and talking to my daughters.” Facebook user Kenneth Ashby, who said that he knew Gayle, remembered her as ""a happy person ... a good person."" ""A few years ago when she traveled to California on business, all she could think about was stepping in the Pacific so she could say she touched both oceans in the same day. The pictures she sent back weren't of a mature woman walking on the beach but of a middle aged kid dancing in the surf. Mary Lou will be missed by all who knew her."" Langer worked at public utilities for 12 years. She was remembered as ""a kind, faithful woman of God"" by Twitter user Nicole Newsome, who identified herself as a church family member and a journalist with the Virginian-Pilot.

He loved Scottish music and played the bagpipes in Tidewater Pipes and Drums, a southeastern Virginia pipe band. The band remembered Rapp in a Saturday Facebook post: ""Chris recently moved to Virginia Beach and immediately joined the band after learning how to play the bagpipes from our friends in the Greater Richmond Pipes & Drums. He was quiet but had a passion for the pipes and Scottish culture."" Rapp was the former director of public works for Stafford County, Virginia, the county tweeted Saturday. Snelling worked as a contractor. Friends and neighbors told the Virginian-Pilot that he was a kind, generous man who was willing to lend a hand. “He walked the halls of our church to make sure nothing happened. He protected us,” Mariana Rocha, who knew Snelling through Crosswalk Church, told the newspaper. Snelling led the church's security team, she said. Snelling had recently celebrated his wedding anniversary: “Him and his wife were best friends,” Rocha said. Gallagher worked at public works for 6 years Gusev worked at public works for 9 years. Gusev was an immigrant from Belarus, the New York Times reports. Hardy, 52, who worked at public utilities for about four and a half years, is recalled by neighbor Clay Rosser as a meticulous, religious man who kept his lawn in great shape. Rosser lowered the blade on his lawn mower an extra notch and mowed Hardy’s yard just the way he would have liked it. Rosser also erected a wooden cross with an urn and flowers in front of Hardy’s townhouse, where he lived alone. It was the least he could do for the man he described as the perfect neighbor. “So I came out here and cut it in, you know, his honor, and fashioned up a cross right there because Joshua was a devout man of faith,” Rosser said. On Saturday morning, Rosser learned his friend and neighbor had been one of 12 people slain at the municipal building. He said he placed the cross in Hardy’s yard as a reminder to others of what was lost. “But it’s not Joshua’s loss because for sure, as I am sitting right here touching this cross, this man is with our savior,” Rosser said, his voice cracking with emotion. Nettleton worked at public utilities for 28 years. Nixon worked at public utilities for 10 years. She worked as a senior engineer, following in a long family tradition of civil engineers, the Washington Post reports.

To get through dinner, a movie, or a game, we must temporarily suspend our knowledge that people are being slaughtered all around us. A police officer walks near the scene where at least 12 people were killed during a mass shooting at the Virginia Beach city public works building on May 31, 2019. Photo: L. Todd Spencer/The Virginian-Pilot via AP On Friday evening, my wife and I were on our way to dinner with our three youngest kids when I happened to learn from Twitter that a man in Virginia Beach had just shot and killed 12 people. And so my struggle, which I am sure is also regularly your struggle, began. In almost every developed nation in the world, 12 people being killed in a mass shooting would make that incident the deadliest in years. In some nations, it would be the deadliest ever. But in the United States, they happen so often, with such ferocity and carnage, that when we learn about the next one, we hardly skip a beat. Indeed, 2018 was by far the most violent year ever measured for school shootings in the United States, and 2017 was the deadliest year in at least a half-century for gun deaths altogether in this country — with an astounding 40,000 people killed by guns. That’s 110 people per day. We couldn’t keep up if we tried. After seeing the news of this latest mass shooting, I wanted to somehow relay the fact that 12 people were just murdered to my wife without actually saying the specific words in front of our kids. “Oh no. 12 people,” I said to her, not speaking in a complete sentence. “Virginia Beach,” I continued. I know my kids are aware of gun violence and mass shootings, but it just seemed like too much in that moment to say in front of them something like, “12 people were just shot to death.” Between the seriousness of my tone and the six words that I assembled for her about the shooting, she knew exactly what I was trying to relay to her without the kids quite catching on. They were happy. And we were pulling up to a fun restaurant in Brooklyn. And so I used the strange skill that none of us should have but all of us use almost every day. Somewhere deep in my mind I tucked the thought of that horrific shooting in Virginia Beach away. I compartmentalized it — boxed it up and closed the door to the memory — so that I could be emotionally present during dinner, so that I could listen to the kid’s stories about their day at school, and excitedly order from the menu with the family. And I did it. I moved on in that moment so that I could enjoy the taste of Vietnamese food. And while I ate dinner, as I reflect back on it, I don’t think I once thought again of the victims in Virginia Beach. That’s the game we play. To get through dinner, to get through a movie or a game, to get through quality time with our loved ones, we must temporarily suspend our knowledge that people are being slaughtered all around us. We speak of the wild, Wild West as some nostalgic era of the past, but we’re living it. The United States is the only nation in the world estimated to have more guns than people. And it shows. Americans are shooting and killing themselves and killing others with guns at a pace that should be treated as a dire national emergency. If we just enacted a fraction of the basic standards and norms held by the rest of the world, our nation would be so much safer. In New Zealand, after 51 men, women, and children were shot to death earlier this year while gathering for prayers in their local mosques, the nation, in a matter of just a few days, made radical shifts in their gun laws: banning assault rifles and so much more. And that urgency is just what the United States needs, but I am afraid we’ve crossed some invisible threshold, having given up after burying so many thoughts of so many shootings and so much violence — so that we can just have dinner in peace.

47,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/01/virginia-beach-shooting-12-victims-gunman-named,"First published on Sat 1 Jun 2019 14.15 BST America was reeling on Saturday after 12 people were shot dead at a government building in Virginia Beach late on Friday afternoon. It was the deadliest mass shooting this year and prompted fresh demands for gun control reform.  The 12 who died were named. Describing a “horrific crime scene”, police and city leaders said they would name the gunman only once, preferring to focus on those he killed. Four people remained in hospital, seriously injured. Virginia Beach’s city manager, Dave Hansen, struggled to suppress sorrow and anger as he described “a senseless, incomprehensible act of violence”. As he listed the dead, his co-workers, he referred to them in the present tense. Eleven were city employees who worked in Municipal Building Two. One was a contractor trying to get a permit. All but three lived in Virginia Beach. Details began to emerge, in tributes from friends and family. Christopher Rapp was a member of a local bagpipe group. In a Facebook post, bandmates said he was quiet but passionate. He had only been working for the city for 11 months. Robert “Bobby” Williams, a special projects coordinator, had worked for the city for 41 years. Laquita C Brown was remembered as someone who lit up any room. “It still doesn’t feel real,” Sinda Price wrote of the public works employee of nearly five years. “I can’t believe she’s gone.” Ryan Keith Cox’s brother, Ervin Ray Cox Jr, wrote: “My heart is hurting because my baby brother was murdered today. I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore. I loved my brother and will truly miss his caring soul. Until we meet again in heaven.” The other victims were Tara Walsh Gallagher, Mary Louis Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A Nixon, Richard H Nettleton, Joshua O Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer, and Herbert “Bert” Snelling. They left, Hansen said, “a void we will never be able to fill”. The injured were not named. Martin O’Grady, head of trauma at Sentara Virginia Beach hospital, told reporters one person had returned to intensive care and two needed operations “to get injuries repaired”. One person did not require urgent care, he said, “but if the injury were a little further over he probably wouldn’t be here today”. One policeman was hurt, saved by a bulletproof vest. The police chief, James Cervera, said officers responded “within minutes” of the first call from Municipal Building Two. There was no verbal exchange with the gunman. “Once he identified them he immediately opened fire,” Cervera said. “They returned fire. This was a long-term, large gunfight.” The gunman was killed by police. The shooting stunned this resort city of 448,000 residents and 3 million annual tourists, and renewed national debate about gun violence. Joe Biden, the former vice-president running for the Democratic nomination, said he and his wife, Jill, were “heartbroken”. “When will we finally say enough is enough?” he tweeted. “It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable.” Cervera named the gunman as DeWayne Craddock, 40, a 15-year employee of the public works department. According to the Associated Press, Craddock spent time in the national guard and received military training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He graduated from Old Dominion University with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering. Police confirmed on Saturday that he was a current employee and had not been recently terminated, as had been reported by some news outlets. The gunman gained access to the building with an active security pass. Authorities said the gunman used a .45 caliber handgun with a suppressor and “extended” magazines. On Saturday, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Ashan Benedict told reporters the gunman carried two pistols which were purchased legally in 2016 and 2018. An unidentified firearm recovered from the gunman’s home was also purchased legally. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. She texted her mother to say there was a gunman in the building. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” Banton told the AP. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” Virginia Beach is the biggest city in its eponymous state. Mayor Bobby Dyer called Friday “the most devastating day” in the history of his city. It was the deadliest instance of US gun violence since November 2018, when a dozen people were killed at a bar and grill in Thousand Oaks, California. Other recent death tolls include 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016; 58 people at a concert in Las Vegas in October 2017; 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018; and 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in October. On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted that he had spoken to Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, and city leaders “to offer condolences to that great community. The federal government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!” The president is a close ally of the National Rifle Association, which is headquartered in Virginia. Democrats competing to take on Trump were quick to demand reform. Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, wrote on Twitter: “The days of the NRA controlling Congress and writing our gun laws must end. Congress must listen to the American people and pass gun safety legislation.” In a statement, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, pointed to a bill passed in February when she said the House had “passed commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation”. But the prospect of an end to business as usual still appears remote. “The Senate must bring these bills to a vote,” Pelosi said. As the upper chamber is controlled by Republicans, that remains unlikely.",2019-06-01 10:01:45,Virginia Beach shooting: 12 victims and gunman named after 'horrific crime',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

A gunman opened fire Friday through all three floors of Building 2 of the coastal city's municipal center, killing 12 people and injuring another four, including a police officer wearing a bulletproof vest.
Advertisement The community is mourning victims of the shooting, which has been the deadliest in the United States this year, adding the Virginia coastal city to the list of places affected by mass shooting. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said in a news conference Saturday morning that the four people who were seriously injured are being treated at Virginia Beach and Norfolk hospitals. Eleven victims were city employees in public works or utilities departments, and one was a contractor, Hansen said time on the job ranging from 11 months to 41 years. The victims were identified as Lakita C. Brown, Tara Walsh Gallagher, Mary Louise Gale, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Richard H. Nettleton, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Ryan Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle ""Missy"" Langer, Robert ""Bobby"" Williams and Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cevera identified the gunman as DeWayne Craddock, 40, an engineer who worked with public utilities for approximately 15 years. Cevera told reporters he would only mention the name once, and instead refer to him as ""the suspect,"" putting focus on victims. The suspect was killed after firing at police officers in a gun fight. The gun fight was ""long"" Cevera added, meaning ""multiple shots,"" were fired at officers and others in the building. Cevera also said that it was a ""horrific crime scene"" and police are investigating with the help from the FBI and state police. He said an investigative task force has 40 members and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted with recovering additional weapons at the scene. Among the weapons, a .45-caliber pistol, a suppressor and several empty, high-capacity magazines were found near the gunman. A Virginia government source told CNN the shooter was a ""disgruntled employee."" Still, Cevera said that he could not comment on possible motive of the suspect at this particular time. Hansen said that Craddock was still an employee at the time of the shooting and would not comment if there was any change in his work status prior to the shooting that may have set him off. Hansen added that Building 2 of the campus of about 30 brick Colonial-style building in Princess Anne will be closed so the city will have to relocate some of the major services that utilities provided. There has been an ""outpouring of volunteers,"" including people who have agreed ""to serve as chaplains"" and ""to donate to families who are going to be in turmoil for quite sometime,"" Hansen said. ""My main concern is our city workforce, our manager,"" Cevera said, referring to the challenge of city services re-opening Monday. ""Even though we will grieve as a city, we will continue to move forward.""",2019-06-01 10:42:35,"12 victims killed, gunman ID in Virginia Beach shooting",,1706,http://www.upi.com/

As investigators piece together what happened, updates on the Virginia Beach shooting continue to roll in. According to CBS News, at least four people have been hospitalized for injuries sustained in Friday's shooting, three of whom are reported to be in critical condition. Authorities told the news outlet that officers had responded to reports of an active shooter situation at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center around 4 p.m. local time. Responding officers then engaged in a ""long-term gun battle"" with the suspect, who, according to both CBS News and CNN died in the gunfight. Speaking to reporters at a press conference, Virginia Beach Police Chief James A. Cervera described the crime scene as ""horrific,"" The New York Times reported. ""There is no way to describe an incident such as this,"" Cervera said, per NPR. ""No chief of police anywhere in the country, no mayor, no city manager ... ever wants to get up and give information such as this."" Police identified the shooter as a 15-year employee of the city's Department of Public Works but declined to comment on the possible motive during Saturday's press conference, The Washington Post reported. However, according to the paper, Cervera did note that the gunman was still employed at the time of the shooting and used his city-issued badge to enter the building. All but one of the victims killed Friday were city employees working in either the Department of Public Works or the Department of Public Utilities, police said. The victims have been identified as Laquita C. Brown, Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Richard H. Nettleton, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle ""Missy"" Langer, Robert Williams, and Herbert Snelling, a contractor in the building to file a permit with the city at the time of the shooting.

""Today we all grieve."" Friday's shooting is thought to be the deadliest mass killing to have ever happened in Virginia Beach as well as the deadliest shooting to have occurred in the United States since November when 12 people were killed at Borderline Bar & Grill in California.

Patrick Semansky/Associated Press Mike Harris, of Virginia Beach, Va., holds a Bible as he prays during a vigil in response to a shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va., Saturday, June 1, 2019.  By Laura Vozzella, Ian Shapira and Justin Jouvenal | The Washington Post VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — The man who shot and killed 12 people at a municipal building here Friday used two .45-caliber handguns that were purchased legally to carry out the rampage, authorities said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. DeWayne Craddock, 40, of Virginia Beach, bought the guns in 2016 and 2018, an ATF official said. Authorities recovered two other guns from Craddock’s home, one of which was also purchased legally, he said. He said authorities were still looking into the purchase of the fourth weapon. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera pointedly denied at the news conference that Craddock, who was an employee of the Department of Utilities, had been fired before he gunned down colleagues. Some media outlets reported Craddock’s employment had been terminated citing unnamed sources. “Make no mistake, we are a heartbroken city,” said Julie Hill, communications director for the city. “We lost 12 people who did nothing more than go to work.” Craddock, an engineer, was a 15-year employee of the city’s Department of Public Utilities, and all but one of his victims were city employees, authorities said earlier on Saturday. The last victim was a contractor seeking a permit. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen solemnly read the names of each at a news conference Saturday morning. They were listed as Virginia Beach residents Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer and Herbert “Bert” Snelling; Chesapeake, Virginia, residents Laquita C. Brown and Robert “Bobby” Williams; Norfolk, Virginia, resident Richard H. Nettleton; and Powhatan, Virginia, resident Christopher Kelly Rapp. “They leave a void we will never be able to fill,” Hansen said. Cervera then named Craddock, vowing it would be the only time he would speak his name publicly. Four wounded victims remained hospitalized in various conditions as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Sentara Healthcare. Cervera declined to discuss a motive for the spree at the news conference but said Craddock used a city-issued badge to gain entry to a public works building in the sprawling municipal complex. He shot people on all three floors of the building and shot one person in a car outside, police said. Cervera said city officers, along with the FBI and Virginia State Police, worked through the night to identify the victims of the shooting. “This is a horrific crime scene,” Cervera said. “It took a physical, emotional and psychological toll on everyone who spent the night in that building.” Cervera said investigators found weapons at the scene of the shooting, as well as at Craddock’s home, in addition to the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun outfitted with a sound suppressor and extended magazines that is believed to have carried out the shooting. Cervera declined to say what the additional weapons are. The gunfire erupted shortly after 4 p.m. in Building 2 of the complex, Cervera said. Four officers arrived on the scene within minutes of the shooting, since the police department is located less than 150 yards from the center, Cervera said. Two detective supervisors and K-9 handlers quickly found Craddock. The gunman opened fire on the officers and the officers shot back. Craddock did not say anything to the officers. “This was a long-term, large gunfight,” Cervera said. Cervera said one of the officers was hit by a bullet, but a bulletproof vest saved his life. Cervara said Saturday morning that the officer was “doing well.” Craddock was eventually shot and the officers rendered aid, Cevera said. Craddock later died. The shooting sent employees fleeing the building, while others froze in place. Bob Montague, the director of the public utilities department, had just wrapped up a meeting and was settling into his second-floor office to take care of some work when a burst of alarming, yet faint sounds began penetrating the air. “I heard rapid pop-pops, but they weren’t very loud, and then suddenly a kind of hole exploded in my wall, and I had bits of drywall and dust hit me,” Montague recalled. “That’s when I made the connection of what was happening. There was a series of gunshots, it was all very quick, a whirlwind coming through. You’re frightened and your adrenaline is up and you’re thinking about what you’re going to do if you encounter someone. I had no idea what was going on other than realizing these were gunshots.” Montague called 911, texted co-workers and remained in his office until the shooting was over. It was only then he discovered the magnitude of the tragedy: six employees he oversaw had been killed. “There is no answer to explain an event like this,” Montague said. Shelia Cook, 49, who works for the city, watched the response to the shooting unfold Friday. “We could kind of hear what was going on. . . . We heard like popping — poom, poom, like that — and then we saw the ambulance,” Cook said. “And we saw the police. We saw all these things going on. So then we were like, oh, it must be really big.” Afterward, Cervera said officers methodically checked every room, closet and desk in the building before determining it was free of danger. The building is the workplace to roughly 400 employees for Public Works, Public Utilities and other city agencies. On Saturday, Craddock’s family members had posted a note on their door in Newport News, Virginia, that read they were sending “heartfelt condolences” to the victims. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, said they were shocked to learn that the man who lived in their cul-de-sac had allegedly committed the mass shooting. They described Craddock as a quiet, reserved man who rarely said much to them when they passed outside the gray duplex they shared with him. “He was just to himself,” said Archer. “He just seemed like the kind of person who was just to himself and didn’t mess with the outside world much.” Craddock seemed to play an active role in the Department of Public Utilities. A 2015 post by the city of Virginia Beach said Craddock was a project manager for the installation of a water main along a city road. In 2018, he was listed as a contact person for a utilities project on the city website. He gave members of a local chamber of commerce a tour of a water pumping station project in 2015, according to an article from the time in the Lake Gaston Gazette. Court records show only a single traffic offense on his record in Virginia Beach. Old Dominion University officials said he was a 2002 graduate with a degree in civil engineering and he had served in the National Guard. Family and friends began to mourn the victims Saturday in private moments and public vigils. One had not yet finished his first year on the job, while another had spent more than four decades there. They were engineers, account clerks and administrative assistants. Christopher Rapp, a public works engineer, had a passion for Scottish music, friends said. The engineer from Powhatan had been working for the Virginia Beach public works department for the past 11 months, officials said. In his spare time, he enjoyed putting on a kilt and playing his pipes, friends said. Tidewater Pipes & Drums, a bagpipe band in southeastern Virginia, said on social media that Rapp was a member of their group. “We are heartbroken to share the news that our bandmate, Chris Rapp, was one of the victims of Friday’s senseless shooting,” the group said Saturday morning in a Facebook post. At the Virginia Beach home of Herbert “Bert” Snelling, neighbors keep arriving, some with flowers. “Bert was a great guy. He’d do anything for you,” said one man who lives on the street who didn’t want to give his name. Hansen said the city has received an outpouring of support and would be providing assistance to employees. Building 2 will remain closed and the city services housed there will be transferred elsewhere. Gov. Ralph Northam said Saturday morning that he ordered flags to fly at half-staff on government buildings. President Donald Trump tweeted he had been in contact with local and state officials. “The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!” Trump tweeted. Friday’s mass shooting was the deadliest rampage in the United States this year. It was the worst since a gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, killing 12 before fatally shooting himself. Cook returned to the complex Saturday with five members of her church, Mount Olive Baptist Church. They usually gather Saturday mornings from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. for an “intercessory prayer” meeting, where they call out the names of people who need God’s help. Their pastor, the Rev. Jason Knight, decided they should hold the meeting at the complex instead, although he did not make it. His car would not start. Related Articles

Jun. 1 2019, Updated 9:35 p.m. ET Longtime public utilities worker DeWayne Craddock reportedly went on a shooting rampage in a city building in Virginia Beach, Virginia on Friday afternoon, May 31. Craddock, 40, described as a ""disgruntled employee,"" killed 12 people before dying in a gun battle with police. All but one of the victims were city employees like Craddock. Another person murdered was a contractor at an office filing a permit at the time of the shooting, police said. Four other peoplehurt by the shootingwere hospitalized, police said. All had surgery on Friday night. Craddock had reportedly worked for the city for about 15 years. Officials said they found multiple weapons at the scene of the shooting and later at his home. The massacre was the deadliest in the United States so far this year after a rash of these disturbing crimes, including the Las Vegas Stephen Paddock rampage and the Parkland school shooting. Shocking violence happened again on Friday. Gunfire erupted while people were at the Virginia Beach municipal center doing business. Craddock fired through all three floors of Building 2 of the facility. Four officers confronted the killer inside the building and ""a long gun battle"" ensued, according to Virginia Beach police Chief James Cervera. After Craddock was wounded, police tried to save him, the chief said. ""They did what cops do and they rendered first aid to this individual,"" Cervera said. Officers found a .45-caliber pistol, a suppressor and several empty, higher-capacity magazines near Craddock after the massacre. It's believed he bought the firearms legally, investigators said. Cervera said Craddock was a ""disgruntled employee."" The certified professional engineer in the city's public utilities department was listed on department news releases as a point of contact for information on local road projects over the past several years, CNN reported. Megan Banton, who was in the building and barricaded with her co-workers, told reporters, ""I have an 11-month-old baby at home, and all I could think about was him and trying to make it home to him."" Cervera doesn't know Craddock's motive yet and said, ""Right now, we have more questions than we have answers."" He reportedly was still employed with the city at the time of the rampage, and had an active employee security pass. Craddock's neighbor Christian Coble told the Washington Post, ""He seemed like an all right dude. I guess you never know what someone is going through."" © Copyright 2021 Radar Media Group LLC.

The other was a contractor in the building trying to get a permit. “They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,” Hansen said. Police shot and killed the gunman following a “long gun battle,” authorities said on Friday. The suspect was identified as DeWayne Craddock, a 15-year public utilities engineer who was a current employee at the time of the shooting, during Saturday’s news conference. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said that authorities would only mention the gunman’s name once “and then he will be forever referred to as ‘the suspect’” to keep the focus on the victims. These are the victims of the Virginia Beach municipal center shooting: Brown was a right of way agent in the public works department for over four years. She lived in Chesapeake. Gallagher was an engineer in the public works department for six years. She lived in Virginia Beach. Gayle was a right of way agent in the public works department for 24 years.

He lived in Virginia Beach. Nixon was an engineer in the public utilities department for 10 years. She lived in Virginia Beach and was in her early 40s.

He lived in Norfolk. Rapp was an engineer in the public works department for 11 months. He lived in Powhatan.

Tidewater is planning to play at his funeral service, band manager Jim Roberts said in a statement.  Cox was an account clerk in the public utilities department for more than 12 years. He lived in Virginia Beach. Cox’s older brother, Ervin Cox Jr., told the New York Times that Cox had been working on his first sermon in hopes of following in the footsteps of his father, who is the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach. “This is hard. It hurts, it hurts deep. Just to have such a senseless thing done to take his life, to take him away from us,” Cox Jr. said. “He was just that caring, loving person that just cared about everybody and wanted to help everybody. He was like that at home and at church.” Hardy was an engineering tech resident in the public utilities department for more than four years. He lived in Virginia Beach.

Can’t believe it’s true. Just unbelievable. This kind of stuff has got to stop.” Langer is survived by her brother and sister. She will be buried in East Liverpool, Ohio, according to her sister-in-law. Williams was a special projects coordinator in the public utilities department for 41 years. He lived in Chesapeake.

Some media outlets reported Craddock’s employment had been terminated citing unnamed sources. “Make no mistake, we are a heartbroken city,” said Julie Hill, communications director for the city. “We lost 12 people who did nothing more than go to work.” Craddock, an engineer, was a 15-year employee of the city’s Department of Public Utilities, and all but one of his victims were city employees, authorities said earlier on Saturday. The last victim was a contractor seeking a permit. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen solemnly read the names of each at a news conference Saturday morning. They were listed as Virginia Beach residents Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer and Herbert “Bert” Snelling; Chesapeake, Virginia, residents Laquita C. Brown and Robert “Bobby” Williams; Norfolk, Virginia, resident Richard H. Nettleton; and Powhatan, Virginia, resident Christopher Kelly Rapp. “They leave a void we will never be able to fill,” Hansen said. Cervera then named Craddock, vowing it would be the only time he would speak his name publicly. Four wounded victims remained hospitalized in various conditions as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Sentara Healthcare. Cervera declined to discuss a motive for the spree at the news conference but said Craddock used a city-issued badge to gain entry to a public works building in the sprawling municipal complex. He shot people on all three floors of the building and shot one person in a car outside, police said. Cervera said city officers, along with the FBI and Virginia State Police, worked through the night to identify the victims of the shooting. “This is a horrific crime scene,” Cervera said. “It took a physical, emotional and psychological toll on everyone who spent the night in that building.” Cervera said investigators found weapons at the scene of the shooting, as well as at Craddock’s home, in addition to the .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun outfitted with a sound suppressor and extended magazines that is believed to have carried out the shooting. Cervera declined to say what the additional weapons are. The gunfire erupted shortly after 4 p.m. in Building 2 of the complex, Cervera said. Four officers arrived on the scene within minutes of the shooting, since the police department is located less than 150 yards from the center, Cervera said. Two detective supervisors and K-9 handlers quickly found Craddock. The gunman opened fire on the officers and the officers shot back. Craddock did not say anything to the officers. “This was a long-term, large gunfight,” Cervera said. Cervera said one of the officers was hit by a bullet, but a bulletproof vest saved his life. Cervara said Saturday morning that the officer was “doing well.” Craddock was eventually shot and the officers rendered aid, Cevera said. Craddock later died. The shooting sent employees fleeing the building, while others froze in place. Bob Montague, the director of the public utilities department, had just wrapped up a meeting and was settling into his second-floor office to take care of some work when a burst of alarming, yet faint sounds began penetrating the air. “I heard rapid pop-pops, but they weren’t very loud, and then suddenly a kind of hole exploded in my wall, and I had bits of drywall and dust hit me,” Montague recalled. “That’s when I made the connection of what was happening. There was a series of gunshots, it was all very quick, a whirlwind coming through. You’re frightened and your adrenaline is up and you’re thinking about what you’re going to do if you encounter someone. I had no idea what was going on other than realizing these were gunshots.” Montague called 911, texted co-workers and remained in his office until the shooting was over. It was only then he discovered the magnitude of the tragedy: six employees he oversaw had been killed. “There is no answer to explain an event like this,” Montague said. Shelia Cook, 49, who works for the city, watched the response to the shooting unfold Friday. “We could kind of hear what was going on. . . . We heard like popping — poom, poom, like that — and then we saw the ambulance,” Cook said. “And we saw the police. We saw all these things going on. So then we were like, oh, it must be really big.” Afterward, Cervera said officers methodically checked every room, closet and desk in the building before determining it was free of danger. The building is the workplace to roughly 400 employees for Public Works, Public Utilities and other city agencies. On Saturday, Craddock’s family members had posted a note on their door in Newport News, Virginia, that read they were sending “heartfelt condolences” to the victims. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, said they were shocked to learn that the man who lived in their cul-de-sac had allegedly committed the mass shooting. They described Craddock as a quiet, reserved man who rarely said much to them when they passed outside the gray duplex they shared with him. “He was just to himself,” said Archer. “He just seemed like the kind of person who was just to himself and didn’t mess with the outside world much.” Craddock seemed to play an active role in the Department of Public Utilities. A 2015 post by the city of Virginia Beach said Craddock was a project manager for the installation of a water main along a city road. In 2018, he was listed as a contact person for a utilities project on the city website. He gave members of a local chamber of commerce a tour of a water pumping station project in 2015, according to an article from the time in the Lake Gaston Gazette. Court records show only a single traffic offense on his record in Virginia Beach. Old Dominion University officials said he was a 2002 graduate with a degree in civil engineering and he had served in the National Guard. Family and friends began to mourn the victims Saturday in private moments and public vigils. One had not yet finished his first year on the job, while another had spent more than four decades there. They were engineers, account clerks and administrative assistants. Christopher Rapp, a public works engineer, had a passion for Scottish music, friends said. The engineer from Powhatan had been working for the Virginia Beach public works department for the past 11 months, officials said. In his spare time, he enjoyed putting on a kilt and playing his pipes, friends said. Tidewater Pipes & Drums, a bagpipe band in southeastern Virginia, said on social media that Rapp was a member of their group. “We are heartbroken to share the news that our bandmate, Chris Rapp, was one of the victims of Friday’s senseless shooting,” the group said Saturday morning in a Facebook post. At the Virginia Beach home of Herbert “Bert” Snelling, neighbors keep arriving, some with flowers. “Bert was a great guy. He’d do anything for you,” said one man who lives on the street who didn’t want to give his name. Hansen said the city has received an outpouring of support and would be providing assistance to employees. Building 2 will remain closed and the city services housed there will be transferred elsewhere. Gov. Ralph Northam said Saturday morning that he ordered flags to fly at half-staff on government buildings. President Donald Trump tweeted he had been in contact with local and state officials. “The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!” Trump tweeted. Friday’s mass shooting was the deadliest rampage in the United States this year. It was the worst since a gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, killing 12 before fatally shooting himself. Cook returned to the complex Saturday with five members of her church, Mount Olive Baptist Church. They usually gather Saturday mornings from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. for an “intercessory prayer” meeting, where they call out the names of people who need God’s help. Their pastor, the Rev. Jason Knight, decided they should hold the meeting at the complex instead, although he did not make it. His car would not start. Related Articles

Rosser lowered the blade on his lawn mower an extra notch and mowed Hardy’s yard just the way he would have liked it. Rosser also erected a wooden cross with an urn and flowers in front of Hardy’s townhouse, where he lived alone. It was the least he could do for the man he described as the perfect neighbor. “So I came out here and cut it in, you know, his honor, and fashioned up a cross right there because Joshua was a devout man of faith,” Rosser said. On Saturday morning, Rosser learned his friend and neighbor had been one of 12 people slain at the municipal building.

(Reuters) - The gunman who killed 12 people at a Virginia Beach municipal building before dying in a shootout with police was identified on Saturday as a disgruntled city engineer and co-worker of most of the victims. All but one of the victims from Friday’s mass shooting in the coastal resort community were employed by the city, officials said, while the other was a contractor seeking a permit. Four people were wounded. The gunman, DeWayne Craddock, had worked for the city’s public utilities department for about 15 years, Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said at a news conference. He declined to comment on any possible motive. “These are 12 individuals who came to work ... thinking they would go home in the evening, and they didn’t return and it left a tremendous void in their families and in our community,” Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said at a news conference. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since November 2018, when a dozen people were slain at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who then killed himself. Bodies were found on all three floors of the Virginia Beach building and in a car parked outside, according to authorities. Cervera described the crime scene as “horrific” and said that investigators who spent the night inside the building endured a “physical, emotional and psychological toll.” Related Coverage  Police said the gunman was armed with two .45 caliber pistols and used an employee pass to enter secure areas before firing “immediately and indiscriminately” on victims while reloading with multiple extended ammunition magazines. At least one of the pistols was fitted with a “sound suppressor,” police said. Both handguns were bought legally by the shooter within the last three years, Ashan Benedict, a special agent at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the news conference. Two more firearms were found at the home where Craddock lived alone, he said. After the attack began, two police supervisors from a building across the street arrived within minutes, Cervera said, and they were quickly joined by two police dog-handlers. The suspect was killed after a lengthy gun battle. The victims who worked for Virginia Beach had been employed for between 11 months and 41 years. Six worked in the public utilities department and five were employed in the public works department. A number of vigils and commemorations are planned, including a memorial service the city is organizing for Thursday evening. (Graphic: Major mass shootings in the United States - tmsnrt.rs/2KefvTT) The bloodshed unfolded at Building Two of the municipal center complex on Friday afternoon as workers prepared to leave for the weekend. Some survivors recounted how they cowered in fear after stacking desks against office doors as makeshift barricades. Three of the wounded victims were in critical condition and a fourth was in fair condition at local hospitals, said Julie Hill, a spokeswoman for Virginia Beach. A police officer who was shot but saved by his ballistic vest has been treated and released, she said. Cervera said he would only name the gunman once, and hereafter refer to him just as “the suspect.” According to local media, Craddock was 40 years old and had no serious criminal record. He served in the Virginia National Guard from 1996 to 2002, and was assigned to a Norfolk-based battalion as a cannon crew member, a guard spokesman said, adding that Craddock’s records do not indicate any overseas deployments. Cervera said 40 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are recovering evidence at the crime scene, which lies in a complex of office buildings several miles inland from the town’s popular seashore, situated on the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Virginia’s most populous city has roughly 450,000 year-round residents. Its police department had trained for a mass shooting, and even planned to hold a citizen workshop on active shooter situations on Saturday. The workshop was canceled. On Saturday, Melissa Millemon, a daycare worker, and Tina Devault, who works for a heating and cooling company, were among local residents who came to the shooting site to lay flowers, American flags, and other tributes to the victims. Both said they either knew someone who had been killed or had a friend or acquaintance who knew one. “One of my friends lost her neighbor,” Millemon said, adding that a member of the local softball community was also killed. “It’s a sad day,” Devault said.

61,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/602615280/0/indystar/todaystopstories~Virginia-Beach-gunman-who-killed-worked-in-public-utilities-office-and-had-pass-to-enter-the-area/,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — The heavily armed public works employee who fatally shot 12 people at a municipal building here is described by police and those who knew him as an enigma who gave no indication that he was stockpiling an arsenal and planned a systematic assault on his co-workers. DeWayne Craddock, a 15-year veteran of public works and a civil engineer, was still employed at the time of the massacre and had a pass to enter the secure inner offices and conference rooms, officials said Saturday. Virginia Beach police chief Jim Cervera said Craddock, 40, a public utilities engineer, had not been fired from his job. The chief refused to theorize on a possible motive for why Craddock sprayed bullets into fleeing office workers, using a .45 caliber handgun armed with a silencer that police believe was used for stealth and to keep victims from knowing where the attacker was in the building. That could at least partially explain why survivors of the attack said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. Craddock brought numerous extended magazines loaded with ammunition, which carry more rounds than traditional magazines, police said. “Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,” said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. Craddock was eventually killed in an ""intense firefight"" with four responding officers who hemmed him in and likely prevented him from using his load of ammunition on more victims, Cervera said. The image of a public works employee holed up with a silencer and extended magazines amid a merciless assault is a far cry from how Craddock's neighbors saw him. They describe Craddock as a car enthusiast, bodybuilder, and seemingly quiet man. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, lived in a Virginia Beach townhome beneath Craddock for the past year and only got to know him in passing, exchanging the occasional greeting. “He wasn’t much of a talker,” Archer recalled. “He’s a mystery to us. He’s a mystery to everybody, apparently.” City Manager Dave Hansen said Craddock was still employed in the department, had a security pass and ""was authorized to enter the building."" In order to avoid excessive publicizing of the shooter's name, officials said they would only give his name publicly once and would afterward refer to him only as ""the suspect."" Craddock had served in the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time of his city hire, and received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Craddock roamed three floors of the office building, shooting indiscriminately at his co-workers. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said at a Saturday afternoon press conference that Craddock legally bought two .45 caliber handguns – one in 2016 and 2018. Both were found at the crime scene and neither was previously used in any other crime, the ATF reported. Hansen said all but one of the victims were employees of the city working in the public works department.The shooter killed his first victim in a car in the parking lot before he entered the building. The victims were identified as Laquita Brown, Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alesander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Richard H. Nettleton, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer, Robert “Bobby” Williams  and Herbert “Bert” Snelling, a contractor. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" a somber Hansen told reporters. Outside a movie theater in a strip mall about 3 miles from the scene of the shooting, about 200 people gathered at a morning vigil as pastors delivered messages about resilience interspersed with prayer songs. Parents held umbrellas over squirming children as speakers vowed that the shooting wouldn’t identify the community. Some knelt. Others turned their heads down while rubbing their eyes A few in the crowd wore T-shirts or baseball caps marked with the names of city departments. Jonas Alered said he had lunch with one of the victims, Gallagher, earlier in the week. The tragedy left a “deep void,” he said. Four people were also injured in the shooting that broke out Friday afternoon in the popular Virginia resort city with a population of 440,000 about 200 miles south of Washington, D.C. Three were in critical condition; a fourth was in fair condition, officials said. Also, a Virginia Beach Police officer was also shot, but his life was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. Sal’s Pizza owner Mostafa Essabar was in his shop across from the Virginia Beach Municipal Complex around 4 p.m. Friday when he started noticing police activity in the area. Across the street, he saw a man he recognized as one of his regular customers on the ground with officers surrounding him. ""I was thinking it's like an accident or something, but then I saw like the blood start coming from his chest,” he said. K-9 vehicles started converging on the scene, helicopters were circling and SWAT was arriving, he said. As an ambulance drove the injured man away, Essabar realized there was something big going on. When officials released the names of the 12 victims killed in the shooting Saturday morning, Essabar said he recognized at least six of them as customers who regularly frequented his business. Often, he said, they only had about about a 45-minute window to grab lunch. But he knew many of their favorite orders and would start working on them as soon as they stepped in the door. Among the victims Essobar knew were Katherine Nixon, whose favorite order he recalled was a salad and wings with a Diet Pepsi, and Robert Williams, who he said came in sometimes twice a week to grab pepperoni pizza. His business was among several in the area near the complex that painted the words #VBStrong on their windows in a show of support for those affected by the tragedy. “It’s sad. It’s really sad. It’s like you lost one of your family,” Essobar said. “They are like a part of you because you’ve been dealing with them every day, every week, and they are very nice people.” The mass shooting was the deadliest attack in the U.S. since the November rampage at Borderline Bar & Grill in California, when 12 people were also killed. Friday's massacre sent shock waves throughout Virginia Beach, also home to three military bases. Spoke to Virginia Governor @RalphNortham last night, and the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Virginia Beach this morning, to offer condolences to that great community. The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all! President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that he had spoken to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and city officials ""to offer condolences to that great community."" He said the federal government would provide whatever assistance was needed. Cervera said the heavily armed shooter died in an exchange of gunfire with four officers who rushed into the building. After downing the shooter, police then attempted to give the gravely injured suspect first aid before he died. The sound suppressor that the gunman used for his handgun is legal in Virginia but is not permitted in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. Some survivors said they did not think the gunfire was close at first because it was not especially loud. Cervera described the scene as a ""war zone"" in the running battle between police and the shooter. Cervera said the gunman walked into the Virginia Beach Municipal Center — where up to 400 people work — shortly after 4 p.m. EDT and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all the victims."" ""The officers stopped this individual from committing more carnage,"" Cervera said. The gunman likely would have used all his ammunition on innocent people had the officers not engaged him in the gunbattle, forcing him to use up the massive store of ammunition that he brought on his killing mission, the chief said. In Yorktown, where Craddock's relatives live in a two-story house, a handwritten note taped to the front door said the Craddock family ""wishes to send our heart felt condolences to the victims, "" The Washington Post reports. ""We are grieving the loss of our loved one,"" the note said. "" At this time we wish to focus on the victims and the lives lost during yesterdays tragic event. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who loss their lives, and those recovering in the hospital.” More: What we know so far about the Virginia Beach shooting ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Mayor Bobby Dyer said. ""The people involved are our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues."" Christina Pullen, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Norfolk, said the bureau is responding to assist Virginia Beach police. The shooting broke out in Building No., 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, which includes several city facilities, including the police department. Building 2 houses offices for planning and public works and is adjacent to city hall. Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the department of public works, said he had worked with Craddock before and had a brief interaction with him Friday. Scott said he saw him in the men’s restroom about five minutes before the shooting. “He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,” Scott said. “I said ‘Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?’ It was just a brief conversation.” Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting broke out, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” Sheila Cook, an employee, said police were able to alert them quickly to give them time to leave the building. ""I am still shaken, because there is entirely too much killing going on,"" Cook said. Zand Bakhtiari told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper that the gunfire came in swift succession, sounding like an automatic weapon. “It was repeated, rapid gunfire,” said Bakhtiari, who said he was one of only five people left in the IT department on the first floor of the building at the end of the day. Arthur Felton, an 18-year employee in the planning department, told the Virginian-Pilot he was able to evacuate after a co-worker heard gunshots.  A shaken Felton said he “never thought this would happen in my building. The people who were shot – I’m sure I know most of them.” City Councilwoman Barbara Henley had just arrived at the City Hall building right after 4 p.m. when she heard sirens and assumed there had been an accident, she told the Virginian-Pilot. After exiting her car, Henley said she was told by employees outside there was a shooting as they urged her to leave. She said she heard someone shout “get down!” as she got back in her car. “I was scared to death.” Henley told the paper security had been increased recently at the City Hall building but said some other city buildings don’t follow the same security measures. Cervera praised first responders for their actions. ""When this violent act occurred, police and fire-rescue responded and did the professional thing that they do, because that's what they do,"" he said. Virginia Beach Council member Aaron Rouse was a student at Virginia Tech when 33 people died in a mass shooting at the Blacksburg school in 2007. He told CNN he was “in shock” when he learned of Friday’s rampage, and it hit close to home. “I immediately jumped into ‘not again, this cannot happen again, I can’t believe this happened again.’” Rouse, who saluted the valiant first responders on Friday, said he went from feeling sorry and helpless during college to knowing that in his role as a councilman he could help have “those tough conversations” about ways to end gun violence and make communities safer. “We must learn from the mistakes of our past. We cannot show fear; our leaders have to stand up.” Mass shootings affect everyone, no matter where they happen, he told CNN. “We were Virginia Tech strong, now we are Virginia Beach strong.” The Virginia Beach police sent out a notice early Saturday saying an Active Threat Citizens Defense workshop previously scheduled in the city had been canceled.

NBC News reported that a federal official said that “the suspect, who had worked for the city for about 15 years as an engineer recently purchased multiple firearms legally.” Below is a partial list of other mass shooters who acquired their firearms via background checks: The list of attackers acquiring guns legally is important because Democrats often emerge from a mass shooting incident with calls for universal background checks. This amounts to expanding our current background check system to cover private gun sales as if they were retail.

63,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/01/democrats-politicize-virginia-beach-shooting-gun-control/,"WAVY-TV/NBC/via REUTERS Many Democrats, including most 2020 presidential candidates, were quick to politicize the tragic mass shooting in Virginia Beach to push their gun control agenda, but Second Amendment supporters weren’t about to take any of it lying down. News broke Friday that public utilities department engineer DeWayne Craddock, 40, allegedly used a .45-caliber handgun with a sound suppressor to murder 12 of his former colleagues, but all Democrats needed was news of a mass shooting to echo their calls for gun control. 11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied.

Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) June 1, 2019  The news out of Virginia Beach is simply devastating.

We just need to get people in Washington who will represent them. — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) June 1, 2019  Today’s tragic mass shooting in Virginia Beach has left another community heartbroken.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Virginia Beach Police are turning their focus to the weapons cache and job history of the man whose Friday shooting spree at a municipal complex killed 12 people and injured several more. The gunman, ID'd as DeWayne Craddock, was employed as an engineer with the city's public utilities department for 15 years. Police killed Craddock after exchanging gunfire at the scene, but Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera has withheld identifying a potential motive. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE IDENTIFY ALL 12 VICTIMS OF SHOOTING AT MUNICIPAL COMPLEX In a news conference on Saturday afternoon, Cervera said that contrary to media reports, Craddock was not fired from his city post. As for weaponry, two .45-caliber pistols were said to have been used by the shooter, and two other guns were recovered at the shooter's home, the chief said. At least three of the weapons were purchased legally, though the history of the fourth was not immediately known. The two weapons used at the municipal center were purchased in 2016 and 2018 by the shooter, officials said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Cervera said a more specific timeline of the deadly ramage would be released sometime on Sunday. As more details about the shooter were emerging on Saturday, many in this stunned community continued to keep a focus on the victims, most of whom were municipal employees. Several vigils have been scheduled for the victims of the massacre, which has been dubbed the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year.

It was not from Biden. Corrects spelling of Senator Booker’s name in fifth paragraph.) Fourteen Democratic presidential candidates sparked cheers and applause in the streets of San Francisco on Saturday as they worked the crowds at the California party’s state convention, a sign of the state’s heft in upcoming nominating contests. Their presence lent star power to a state organizing convention that has become a window into the issues and rivalries at stake as Democrats compete for the nomination to run against Republican President Donald Trump in 2020. “Oh my God, is that Bernie Sanders?” a young woman yelled as she walked past the tousle-haired progressive icon, who was taking selfies with admirers after addressing a union group. Following an evening of parties including one emceed by a drag performer in the LGBTQ-friendly city, presidential hopefuls including Sanders and fellow U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar addressed members of the Service Employees International Union before heading into the main convention hall. “This election is not about one guy in one office,” New Jersey U.S. Senator Cory Booker exhorted the crowd in an afternoon speech. “It is about a referendum on who we are and what me must be to each other.” Harris, who has been eclipsed in early polling in California by former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders, made clear she was not taking her home state for granted. Supporters with signs bearing her name and shouting “Kamala! Kamala!” formed a gauntlet outside of the SEIU event that Sanders was forced to walk through. “I am here to earn everyone’s support, and I’m going to fight to earn it,” she said at a breakfast held by the party’s women’s caucus. Despite Harris’ clear organizational clout, however, it was U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who drew the greatest cheers from the progressive crowd on Saturday, far more than Harris or former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke. To screams and whoops, Warren called for universal free preschool and childcare, forgiveness of student loan debt, free college and a wealth tax on the highest earners. “That’s two cents on the dollar for people with fortunes worth more than $50 million,” Warren declared in an old-school political speaking style that swelled for emphasis as she reached each talking point. “They can afford two cents.” Notably absent from the event was Biden. As the convention opened on Saturday morning, his aides moved among the crowd press area. Biden leads in early polling in the state, but opted not to attend the convention, a move experts said could make him seem above the fray, but could also be risky if Californians come to see him as taking the state for granted. In perhaps a sign of the campaign to come, Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, polls second behind Biden among Democrats. A moderate, Biden appeared to be staking a position to the right of Sanders. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, who calls himself a pragmatic progressive, drew loud and prolonged boos when he told the crowd “Socialism is not the answer.” The boos drowned out Hickenlooper’s explanation that as a governor of a “purple” state with mixed Democrat and Republican voters, he was able to enact progressive policies by reaching out to opponents. It was not a welcome message at a convention where Sanders and Warren were greeted like rock stars. Other attendees emphasized their left-leaning positions, with Harris taking on Trump and demanding the House of Representatives begin impeachment proceedings against him. “We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief,” she said. When U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, vowed to “investigate and litigate to protect our democracy,” yells of “impeach!” broke out in the convention hall. Pelosi has so far resisted Democratic calls to impeach Trump over actions many say were illegal, including possible obstruction of justice in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election that brought Trump to power. Sanders is set to address the convention on Sunday. At the SEIU breakfast, he called the low federal minimum wage unacceptable and said it was a disgrace that millions of Americans did not have healthcare. The convention opened with a moment of silence for the 12 victims of a gunman in Virginia Beach on Friday, the latest mass shooting in the nation.

As proposed in March 2018 (and to some extent in 2015), the country now requires virtually all visa applicants to provide their social media account names for the past five years.  The mandate only covers a list of selected services, although potential visitors and residents can volunteer info if they belong to social sites that aren't mentioned in the form. Applicants also have to provide previous email addresses and phone numbers on top of non-communications info like their travel statuses and any family involvement in terrorism.  Some diplomats and officials are exempt from the requirements. The US had previously only required these details for people who visited terrorist-controlled areas.  The goal is the same, however.  The US is hoping to both verify identities and spot extremists who've discussed their ideologies online, potentially preventing incidents like the San Bernardino mass shooting. The measure will affect millions of visa seekers each year, although whether or not it will be effective isn't clear.  A State Department official told The Hill that applicants could face ""serious immigration consequences"" if they're caught lying, but it's not certain that they'll be found out in a timely fashion -- the policy is counting on applicants both telling the truth and having relatively easy-to-find accounts if they're dishonest.  And like it or not, this affects the privacy of social media users who might not want to divulge their online identities (particularly private accounts) to government staff.

                    PBS NewsHour As authorities continue searching for clues into Friday's mass shooting inside the Virginia Beach Municipal Center that killed 12 people, many in the community are trying to make sense of the rampage. NPR correspondent Sarah McCammon joins Megan Thompson from Virginia Beach to discuss how residents are coping. Megan Thompson: Joining us now on the phone from outside the municipal building in Virginia Beach is NPR correspondent Sarah McCammon. You're not just reporter reporting from Virginia Beach today, you are a resident. I mean as somebody who lives there how is the community doing today? Sarah McCammon: You know people respond to these shootings in sadly predictable ways these days. There are so many of them. And as I've talked to a couple of folks to kind of get the pulse of friends and strangers as well, there's a lot of what you might expect honestly. Shock that it happened here. Just devastation and need to process that, a feeling of numbness. A relatively small group of people gathered for a vigil this morning. One hundred people or so according to a colleague of mine. But there will be more of those that you know obviously this just happened and people are I think just trying to make sense of it. At the same time you know driving through the community today, things were almost, I don't know, sort of disturbingly normal. There was a carnival going on in my neighborhood, it looked sparsely attended but it was still going on. My son's scout troop was still meeting. Things are ordinary in a way because this has become so ordinary in America, sadly. But at the same time it's on everyone's minds and people are thinking about this, talking about it, reaching out to one another to see if everyone's OK and now that the names of the dozen victims have been released I started to see social media posts and things from friends and loved ones remembering the people who died yesterday. Megan Thompson: This happened in a government building. I mean what do we know about security there? I know that the suspect was an employee but did he have to get through metal detectors or anything like that? Sarah McCammon: My understanding is that this building is used for offices, that a lot of engineers worked there, some accountants, administrative assistance that kind of thing and also a place where people would come to to deal with sort of day to day rather mundane city paperwork — things like filing for permits. In fact, one of the victims was a contractor who was there at the building to file for a permit. Officials say it's a place that the public is welcome and the public uses it is it is in part an office building but also a place where residents of Virginia Beach come to just do day to day business. And again this man was an employee so he would have had as much access as anyone as an employee. Megan Thompson: And where does the investigation go from here? I mean what else will investigators be looking for? Sarah McCammon: Well I know they've spent the past 24 hours or so going through the crime scene. A scene that the chief Jim Cerverer here described as like a war zone. And I know they've found some additional weapons they say but they've looked at the crime scene they've also looked at the  suspect's home and found some some additional weapons. But going through the crime scene just taking an inventory of what happened, searching in every nook and cranny to try to gather whatever evidence they can. And of course, the victims have all been identified but that was much of the work of last night was identifying those victims, notifying their family members. And now of course the grieving begins. Megan Thompson: All right. NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much for joining us. Sarah McCammon: Thank you. Watch the Full Episode Jun 01 By Duarte Geraldino, Laura Fong, Michael D.

72,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/elizabeth-warren-san-francisco-democrats-virginia-beach-shooting,"Last modified on Tue 15 Dec 2020 14.35 GMT A day after the deadliest US mass shooting this year in which 12 people were shot dead at a government building, Elizabeth Warren was asked what she would do to confront an “overwhelming surge” in such events. The Massachusetts senator said she wanted to reframe the question, then continued: “It’s not just mass shootings.” Every day in America, she said, gun violence occurs “on sidewalks and playgrounds and people’s backyards. It’s happening family by family across the country. And it doesn’t get the same headlines. And that is wrong.”  In San Francisco on Saturday, Warren was one of 14 candidates for the presidential nomination appearing at the California Democratic convention, seeking to pitch to progressive voters. Her response, delivered at a “Big Ideas” forum hosted by the progressive group MoveOn, echoed what activists of color have argued for years: that the US gun control debate focuses too much on mass shootings and ignores the daily toll of gun violence, which disproportionately affects black and brown Americans. All the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination were in California, except Joe Biden, who was in Ohio. In all, 14 candidates converged, making this the largest gathering so far of 2020 hopefuls. For Democrats, endorsing stricter gun control laws is no longer a brave move. It is now a standard part of the policy agenda. In her answer, Warren endorsed ideas that are familiar across the sprawling 2020 field: expanding background checks on gun sales, banning military-style weapons, investing more in scientific research on gun safety. But Warren’s decision to push back against the focus on “mass shootings” did not just reflect a conversation among activists who have increasingly criticized racial disparities in the way politicians address gun violence. It also echoed arguments made by survivors of last year’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida: that the fact shootings in suburban schools get more attention than daily killings of children of color is “wrong”. Many of the candidates emphasized that their “big ideas” were relevant to racial justice, from the New Jersey senator Cory Booker’s argument that his proposal to create “baby bond” savings accounts for every American child would help erase the wealth gap, to New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s argument that her national paid family leave plan would particularly benefit women of color. Both Gillibrand and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke told the audience they supported legislation to establish a formal process for considering whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery. Such a move would “squarely confront the legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow,” O’Rourke said, calling it “fundamental to any repairs of the damage that we have caused”. In a response to a question, O’Rourke also acknowledged the advantages he had as a white male candidate. “There are advantages that I brought into this race that I did not earn,” he said, “that were functions of circumstances and fortunate and fate, being born a white man in this country.” In general, the candidates made clear that they think the 2020 election should be about more than just attacking Donald Trump. Booker, for example, was cheered for saying the election “should not be just getting one guy out of office, we should have bigger aspirations than that”. Among his big ideas was a pledge to make sure that “social media platforms do not become platforms for hate and bigotry”. If he is elected president, he said, his Department of Justice will put real resources into investigating white supremacist terrorism. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders promised to “stop endless wars” and to work with other countries to end the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, rather than spending trillions on “weapons of destruction to kill each other”.",2019-06-01 20:31:47,Elizabeth Warren reframes mass shooting debate after Virginia Beach,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

In 1996, Bill Clinton had signed the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) in the middle of the night because he thought that was necessary to ensure his re-election. Now a new Democratic president had embraced the push for equality as a political plus, especially with the younger voters who were so important to his success.  Obama said that even the Republican college students he had met were “very clear” about sexual orientation: “They believe in equality.” He also suggested the benefits of a presidential unit that included a brilliant wife and two precocious children. His daughters, Malia and Sasha, had friends who were the children of same-sex couples, and it had never occurred to them that their friends’ parents would be treated differently. “It doesn’t make sense to them,” Obama said, adding: “That’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.” The tidal wave of change continued. On 6 June, barely a month after the president’s announcement, Judge Barbara Jones of the southern district of New York ruled in favor of Edith Windsor, whose case against Doma focused on the estate taxes she was forced to pay after the death of her wife, Thea Spyer, a burden a straight widow would have avoided. The judge found that Doma was unconstitutional under the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment and ordered the federal government to issue Windsor a tax refund, including interest. Jones was the fifth federal judge to find the law unconstitutional. The political wisdom of Obama’s position was confirmed in November when he was re-elected with 332 electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote. Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington state approved marriage equality initiatives – and Minnesota voters rejected a state constitutional amendment that would have banned it. On 20 January 2013, in his second inaugural address, the president declared: “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” Six months later, Edith Windsor was sitting at her lawyer’s dining room table, along with the rest of her legal team. The New Yorker reported what happened next. Suddenly news of the supreme court’s decision flashed across a computer screen: “Doma Is Unconstitutional.” There were whoops and hollers and then the telephone rang. “Who am I talking to?” Windsor asked. The call was coming from Air Force One. “Oh! Barack Obama?” she exclaimed. Composing herself, she said: “I want to thank you.” And then she added: “I think your coming out for us made such a difference throughout the country.” As in Romer v Evans in 1996, which held that government cannot legitimately base its decisions on animus toward gay people, and Lawrence v Texas, which made gay sex legal, Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority decision. For the third time, he catapulted the gay cause forward. Back in Manhattan, Windsor was taken on an impromptu victory lap around the island. People burst into tears and shouted: “Thank you, Edie!” At the LGBT Community Center in Greenwich Village, Windsor’s lawyer compared her to “Susan B Anthony, or Rosa Parks, or Harvey Milk”; James Esseks of the ACLU echoed the earlier words of the attorney Ted Olson, declaring Windsor to have “made the country more free and more fair and more equal today. In fact, she has made it more American.” The Windsor decision was only the first piece of good news. California governor Jerry Brown and the rest of the state’s officials had declined to defend Proposition 8, a ban on same-sex marriage. At the supreme court, chief justice John Roberts and four of his colleagues decided unelected proponents of the ban did not have standing to appeal a district court victory for two same-sex couples who had sought to marry. That meant the case was not properly before the supreme court. Two days later, the ninth circuit court of appeals lifted its stay of the district decision. Hours after that, cheers erupted amid camera flashes as California attorney general Kamala Harris presided at the marriage of Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier at San Francisco’s city hall. They were one of the couples who had sued to prevent Proposition 8 from taking effect. Two years later, our decades-long battle for justice reached a thundering climax. Barack and Michelle Obama were the first great black leaders to treat the gay movement with the full respect earned by the civil rights movement. Their willingness to link the two movements had a special power. The inspiration we drew from the courage and the blood and the joyfulness of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, James Baldwin, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Martin Luther King Jr had made the gay movement possible. Thus it felt uncannily right that the arc of history had bent so dramatically toward liberty and justice for all during Obama’s presidency. And it made a kind of cosmic sense that a black man was president on 27 June 2015, a crescendo of a day in American history – a day of bottomless sorrow, a day of unparalleled joy. In the early afternoon, the president and first lady arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, to pay homage to the victims of another hideous mass shooting. There they joined 6,000 other citizens inside a downtown sports arena to celebrate the lives of the Rev Clementa C Pinckney and eight other African American parishioners shot and killed by a racist murderer during a service at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church. The emotional pinnacle came at the end of the four-hour service, when Obama reached the lectern. This was one of the magnificent moments of his presidency. Barack Obama stood before a large black gospel choir, flanked by the purple robes of African Methodist Episcopal pastors. He said he had felt “an open heart” after learning about the catastrophe, and that, more than anything, was what was needed now, along with a “reservoir of goodness”. He repeated: “That reservoir of goodness. If we can find that grace, anything is possible. If we can tap that grace, everything can change. Amazing grace. Amazing grace.” For 13 long seconds he was silent. And then he sang the first verse of an 18th-century British hymn, the one that long ago had been reborn as the greatest African American spiritual of them all: Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost, but now am found Was blind, but now I see. By the second line, all 6,000 mourners were on their feet, many with tears overflowing, singing the words with him. When the song was over, the president raised his voice, as if chanting a dirge: Clementa Pinckney found that grace. Cynthia Hurd found that grace. Susie Jackson found that grace. Ethel Lance found that grace. DePayne Middleton-Doctor found that grace. Tywanza Sanders found that grace. Daniel L Simmons Sr found that grace. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton found that grace. Myra Thompson found that grace. “Through the example of their lives they’ve now passed it on to us,” he concluded, “may we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift as long as our lives endure. May grace now lead them home. May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America.” The president and his wife returned to the White House that evening. As the sun began to disappear, a completely different feeling gripped New York and Washington, Chicago and Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In those places, and in hundreds of other cities, towns and villages, gay people and their friends swarmed into the streets to celebrate the day’s other, opposite kind of event: the ruling of the United States supreme court that finally made marriage equality the law of the land. For the fourth time, Anthony Kennedy, a Republican nominated by Ronald Reagan, embraced the idea of a constitution which must change as society changes. He and his four liberal allies found that “the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person”, and that the court had long held that “the right to marry is protected by the constitution”. Kennedy declared that “the fundamental liberties protected by the 14th amendment’s due process clause extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices defining personal identity and beliefs”. And just as advocates had predicted, the court cited Loving v Virginia, the decision that ended bans on interracial marriages, as a crucial precedent. Outside the courthouse, jubilant demonstrators waved rainbow flags and chanted: “Love has won!” In the Rose Garden, the president declared: “Progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.” Inside, as dusk settled, Michelle Obama spotted “a purplish glow” through a north-facing window. Then she remembered that the staff had planned a magnificent surprise: the illumination of the White House in the rainbow colors of the gay flag. In her memoir, Becoming, she described what happened next: Looking out the window, I saw that beyond the gates on Pennsylvania Avenue, a big crowd of people had gathered in the summer dusk to see the lights. The north drive was filled with government staff who’d stayed late to see the White House transformed in celebration of marriage equality. The decision had touched so many people. From where I stood, I could see the exuberance, but I could hear nothing … The White House was a silent, sealed fortress, almost all sound blocked by the thickness of its windows and walls … Oftentimes, I was happy to withdraw into the protected hush of the residence at the end of a long day. But this night felt different, as paradoxical as the country itself. After a day spent grieving in Charleston, I was looking at a giant party starting just outside my window. She asked her husband to come outdoors but he said he couldn’t deal with another crowd. Sasha, 13, was too focused on her iPad to move, but her 18-year-old sister, Malia, agreed to come. The two of them skipped by hovering Secret Service agents. We were giddy now. “We’re getting out!” I said. “Yeah we are!” she said. We made our way down a marble staircase and over red carpets, around the busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and past the kitchen until suddenly we were outdoors. It had taken gay Americans exactly 50 years to reach this moment: 50 years of blood, sweat, toil and tears. In 1965, this building, like the federal government itself, like the entire United States of America, had loomed as a fortress of unchallenged prejudice. But tonight the White House was the glowing mansion at the center of a great national celebration of freedom: the home at the end of our rainbow. Outside, Michelle and Malia Obama saw “a beautiful, close-up view of the White House, lit up in pride”. “Malia and I leaned into each other,” Michelle wrote, “happy to have found our way there.” This is an edited extract from The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America by Charles Kaiser, published by Grove Atlantic on 4 June",2019-06-02 01:00:36,Obama v Doma: how gay Americans marched towards equality,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

(Courtesy City of Virginia Beach via AP) VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. – Officials in Virginia Beach are making a concerted effort to focus on the victims of the country's latest mass shooting, not the suspect. City leaders on Saturday quickly released details and photos of the 12 people who died Friday. They said little about the man who's been identified as the shooter inside the city building. Police uttered DeWayne Craddock's name just once at a news conference and promised not to mention it again. The 40-year-old died in a shootout with officers. This coastal Virginia city is employing an increasingly common public information strategy: Release more details about the victims of mass shootings than of the killers to limit the criminals' exposure and prevent copycat shootings. Deputy city manager of public safety Steve Cover says officials ""wanted to control the narrative."" ___ Associated Press writer Denise Lavoie contributed to this report.

76,https://nypost.com/2019/06/02/im-going-in-brave-cop-says-in-dramatic-audio-from-virginia-beach-shooting/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Laura Italiano Submit June 2, 2019 | 4:25am				| Updated June 2, 2019 | 8:12am It was 35 minutes of terror. Audio of police radio dispatches from the shooting that left 12 people dead in Virginia Beach starts at 4:08 p.m. Friday with a steely-nerved dispatcher announcing, “One down — gunshot wound, 2405 Courthouse Drive, Building 2.” She continues: “Caller is advising of a male outside Building 2, possibly shot.” It’s the city’s Public Utilities offices, where shooter DeWayne Antonio Craddock, who worked there as a civil engineer for 15 years, has begun his rampage, opening fire in front of the building. In the three minutes after that earliest dispatch, the first cops to arrive, four plainclothes officers, rush to the scene from the police station just 100 yards away. Craddock, meanwhile, rushes back inside to continue the massacre. “Which building is Building 2?” a cop asks, as the sounds of police sirens fill the tape. “The operations building,” another cop responds. They ask if shots are still being fired, and the dispatcher answers them, “10-4. Still actively hearing gunshots.” It’s 4:11 p.m. when they reach Building 2. “Do we have any idea where the shooter is at?” one officer asks. His voice is rushed and shaking, and he doesn’t wait for an answer. “I’m going in,” he says. “Shooter is on the second floor,” another cop is heard saying. “10-4, shots fired, second floor,” another answers. More units are responding, and the dispatcher repeats the address — Building 2, operations building. Some begin helping people evacuate, while others search for the shooter, at first finding only casualties. “I’ve got a male down on the third floor with a gunshot wound to his arm,” one says. “Still looking for the gunman,” he adds. Another dispatcher, on another channel, puts a description of Craddock out over the scanner. “He’s a black male six foot tall, wearing a blue shirt, has a gun with a silencer, last seen on the second floor, Building 2, 2405 Courthouse Drive.” Cops and other emergency responders are now flooding into the shooting scene; some set up a command post outside. “Somebody just jumped out the second floor, on the east side,” one cop says at 4:19. Soon afterward, in a stairwell between the second and third floors, Craddock has been located and begins firing at the police. The next staccato bursts of audio reveal the bravery of the officers amid the chaos of the firefight. “Officer hit! Officer hit!” a cop shouts, anxiously. “Suspect is DeWayne Craddock,”  says another. “We still have active shots and a suspect on the second floor,” says another. “We have a team of three going up the stairwell, west side,” says still another. The shot cop, whose name had not been released by Sunday morning, is led to safety. “The vest helped stop some of it,” a cop tells the dispatcher of the bullet the cop took to the chest. “But, uh, still broke skin … better get him treated.” Another cop is heard: “We have the shooter isolated in a stairwell on the east side on the second floor.” “Isolated between the second and third floor,” the dispatcher repeats. “East side of the stairwell.” He’s shooting through a doorway, another cop explains. “We do have shots coming through that door.” Meanwhile, other officers report “multiple victims” on the third floor. “We’re on third level, with citizens, we have multiple victims in area 385, alpha,” says an officer. “I have six victims,” says another. “I have one survivor in the corner.” The evacuation of survivors proceeds, complicated somewhat by a series of locked doors requiring key cards for access —  even as the firefight with Craddock continues. “Two coming down to you,” a cop says. “Coming down with two.” A male victim has a gunshot wound to the face, but is still alive. Other survivors are cowering in place — and in fear: “My wife just called me, she has a friend on the third floor, and they’re hiding in the bathroom,” a cop relays. Craddock, though, has gone silent. “There hasn’t been shots fired in a while — where is the shooter isolated at?” a cop asks. Another cop urgently asks for radio silence — “Clear the air!” — so that Craddock can be heard above the tumult. “We need everyone to stay off this channel,” another adds. Silence. Minutes pass with scant radio communications. It’s 4:41 when the a cop announces of Craddock, “We have him on the other side. He’s on the ground. Hold the air,” he adds, asking for more silence. And it’s 4:43 when another cop says of the dead or dying gunman, “We have the suspect in custody at this time.” Read Next Adam Lanza's shrink pleads guilty to sex assault on patien...

77,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jun/02/virginia-city-remembers-12-slain-not-ki/,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- The 12 people fatally shot in a Virginia Beach government building were remembered Saturday as city officials sought to put the focus on those who died and not the gunman. Four were engineers who worked to maintain streets and protect wetlands. Three were right-of-way agents who reviewed property lines. The others included an account clerk, a technician, an administrative assistant and a special-projects coordinator. In all, they had served the city of Virginia Beach for more than 150 years. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" said City Manager David Hansen, who had worked for years with many of the dead. Hansen led a news conference that included a slide show of the victims and their years of service. ""I have worked with most of them for many years,"" Hansen said. ""We want you to know who they were, so in the days and weeks to come, you will learn what they meant to all of us."" Police Chief James Cervera identified the assailant as DeWayne Craddock, who had been employed for 15 years as an engineer with the city's utilities department. Cervera declined to comment on a motive, though he denied that Craddock had been fired before the shootings, which ended with Craddock's death in a gunbattle with officers. ""This was a long-term, large gunfight,"" Cervera said, noting that officers rendered aid to Craddock after he was shot. Cervera said one of the officers was hit but was saved by a bullet-resistant vest. The chief said Saturday morning that the officer was ""doing well."" City officials uttered Craddock's name once, which Cervera said was ""the only time we will announce his name."" Hansen referred to the shooter as ""the 13th person."" ""Make no mistake, we are a heartbroken city,"" said Julie Hill, communications director for the city. ""We lost 12 people who did nothing more than go to work."" Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the utilities department, said he had worked with Craddock and had a brief interaction with him Friday, passing him in the men's restroom about five minutes before the shooting. ""He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,"" Scott said. ""I said 'Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?' It was just a brief conversation."" Scott said he left for the day right after and learned of the shooting when a co-worker and then his son called him asking if he was OK. ""I couldn't believe that it happened,"" he said. Shelia Cook, 49, who works for the city, watched the response to the shooting unfold Friday. ""We could kind of hear what was going on. ... We heard like popping -- poom, poom, like that -- and then we saw the ambulance,"" Cook said. ""And we saw the police. We saw all these things going on. So then we were like, 'oh, it must be really big.'"" PIPE BAND, BIG SMILE One of the victims had worked for Virginia Beach for 41 years. Six worked in the same department as Craddock, though authorities have declined to say if anyone was specifically targeted or if the gunman had issued threats before. Authorities have said Craddock fired indiscriminately. The victims were found throughout the building, on three floors, police said. One of the dead, Christopher Kelly Rapp of Powhatan, enjoyed Scottish music and joined a pipe band last fall. He played with the group in October during a Celtic festival in Virginia and marched with band mates on St. Patrick's Day. ""Chris was reserved but very friendly, quietly engaging members one-on-one after our weekly practices,"" the band, Tidewater Pipes & Drums, said in a statement. Another victim, Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, was described as a ""super sweet lady"" who always had a big smile. ""She would always be out there in the yard, working on something and talking to my daughters,"" John Cushman, Gayle's next-door neighbor, told The New York Times. The other employees who were killed were identified as Tara Welch Gallagher, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua Hardy and Michelle ""Missy"" Langer, all of Virginia Beach; Laquita C. Brown and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams, both of Chesapeake; and Richard Nettleton of Norfolk. The 12th victim, Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling of Virginia Beach, was a contractor who was in the building to seek a permit. The police and fire departments were to assign members of their honor guards to help each victim's family. Hundreds of people attended a Saturday prayer vigil for the dead. Scott, the co-worker, said he, his wife and several others prayed for the shooter, too. ""He was a human, too, and his family is hurting, too,"" Scott said. ""He's not evil ... he was just another guy who had problems."" Virginia Beach is a sprawling city of about 450,000 people. But in its core, particularly around the municipal building, it has a town-square feel. Cook returned to the municipal building Saturday with five members of her church, Mount Olive Baptist Church. ""Our pastor called for us to come out and pray on the grounds, because our colleagues and our neighborhoods and our city need God,"" she said. ""We need God right now. And we want to be able to be that light in a dark world."" NO FELONY RECORD Craddock, 40, graduated from Denbigh High School in nearby Newport News in 1996 and joined the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time. He received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Okla. He later graduated from Old Dominion University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. Craddock appeared to have had no felony record, making him eligible to purchase guns. Government investigators identified two .45-caliber pistols used in the attack, said Ashan Benedict, the regional special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. All indications were that the shooter purchased the weapons legally, one in 2016 and one in 2018, Benedict said. The police chief said at least one had a noise suppressor. The municipal building was open to the public, but security passes were required to enter inner offices, conference rooms and other work areas. As a current employee, Craddock would have had the pass to enter the inner offices, Hansen said. At least three of the wounded remained hospitalized Saturday. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a physician who treated soldiers from Operation Desert Storm, visited the wounded early Saturday and said he saw similarities between their injuries and those he had seen in combat. ""It's difficult as a physician, and it's difficult as a human being, to see what these weapons can do to the human body,"" the governor said in an interview. ""I saw it during the war, and I saw it today."" Northam said he would pursue gun-control measures ""in upcoming days."" Friday's mass shooting was the deadliest in the United States this year. It was the worst since November, when a gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., killing 12 people before fatally shooting himself.

On Friday, at a municipal building, 12 people were murdered Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.13 BST Twelve stars and stripes flags were planted on the grass verge, one for each of the lives cut short. Floral tributes accumulated in their midst with the prosaic details of price tags: $6.99 for one bunch, $4.87 for another. Police officers and TV crews went about their work, the latter shaded by white canopies. In a nearby carpark, mourners joined hands as a pastor offered a prayer and a woman strummed a guitar.  This was Virginia Beach, a day after 12 people died when a man entered a city municipal building and started shooting. Police say 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, who worked for the city as an engineer, was confronted by officers and killed. Eleven of the victims were city employees. The other was a contractor. So Virginia Beach would be etched into a collective conscience that also bears names such as Virginia Tech, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland and Pittsburgh. A common narrative thread runs though them – a mass shooting was unthinkable here – but each has a distinct story and grieves in its own way. Virginia Beach, the state’s biggest city with around 450,000 people, has the surface charm of the American dream. Residents praise its schools; tourists flock to its beaches; there is a strong military presence. The municipal centre where the attack happened is a collection of neat local government buildings in a bland but pretty setting of trimmed lawns, flower beds, trees and a gazebo. But it is also home to a Confederate statue that troubles some African American citizens. On Saturday afternoon, Pastor Chris Mitchell of the Gateway City church led a group in prayer, then broke down in tears as he said “the Lord is good” and embraced colleagues. “This was impromptu,” explained the 38-year-old, wearing a grey T-shirt. “Last night we went to bed at one, woke up at four and just wept, asking God, what can we do? Just organically we felt we needed to be here. We were compelled. “We said prayers for the families. I can’t imagine what they’re going through. A mother described it as the same sort of feeling she had on September 11 2001. That might sound like overkill to some but for us, it is that weighty.” Mitchell was born in Ohio but has lived in Virginia Beach for 27 years. “I don’t think any person ever thinks it’s going to take place in their backyard, the place they think of as home. A friend of mine called and said this is unprecedented. There has never been anything remotely like this in any way. We are in equal parts shocked and devastated.” Yet the city will recover, he insisted. “It’s a transient community because of the military presence but it’s a strong community. People are known for their hospitality and their warmth.” The municipal centre sits adjacent to an upmarket shopping strip: Princess Anne Center for Dental Arts, Online Formals Dress Boutique, Acupuncture, Courthouse Veterinary Clinic, Salon Mosaic. And there is Gun Shop, where a handwritten note in the window read: “apologise for any inconvenience, we are closed until Tuesday.” Its phone went to voicemail. A message went unreturned. Nearby, a gift shop called A Pen Lovers Paradise was open for business. Its owner, Pamela Huynh, recalled Friday’s events: “I was at my front door and saw people on my front lawn. I said, ‘Do you know what’s going on?’ A woman said, ‘There’s an active shooter in our building’ and pointed across the street. I came in, locked up and went home. I was scared to death. I didn’t know where he was. I thought, I’m not going to stay here by myself. I was terrified.” A mass shooting was as unimaginable here as anywhere. Huynh, 58, said: “It’s normally quiet here. This is like the quietest part of Virginia Beach; on a Saturday there would be no cars in the parking lot. Virginia Beach is a fun-loving place and family oriented. It’s a place you come to get away from it all, enjoy yourself, relax and feel safe – normally. I think it will heal, but it will take some time.” The municipal centre contains something else: a statue of a soldier, erected in 1905. The plinth states, “Princess Anne County Confederate Heroes” – a tribute to the southern troops who fought to preserve slavery during the American civil war. It is a reminder of the state’s chequered history. In 2017, attempts to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville triggered deadly in neo-Nazi violence. Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, who has visited people injured in the shooting, defied calls to resign earlier this year after a photo of someone wearing blackface resurfaced from his page in a medical school yearbook from 1984. Jared Grooms, who is African American, lives two minutes from the municipal centre. While he does not allege that the gunman had a racial motivation, he believes the statue is telling. “The Confederate influence and the lack of diversity are relevant,” he said. “It seems some equivalent to the culture of a combative environment.” The city has backed Republicans for president for the past half-century. Grooms, a 22-year-old biology graduate, added: “Virginia Beach is racially segregated: there are two definitely ‘white’ schools and the remainder are known as the ‘diverse’ schools. We expect mass shootings in America, but I’m not surprised it happened in Virginia Beach.” Earlier on Saturday, Pauline Jennett, an educator from Boston who is African American, was hauling her luggage after a long train and bus ride. She reflected: “Virginia Beach is idyllic and people are super-friendly; it’s touristy but not over the top touristy. But as an African American who’s been coming here for decades, it is the south. You will see Confederate flags being sold along with souvenirs. But on a day-to-day level nobody bothers you.” Jennett had considered cancelling her annual trip here when she heard about the shooting. “It was quite startling,” she said. “I felt fear and anger. I called the hotel yesterday and said, ‘Should I still come?’ They said it’s fine. I never heard of anything like that in Virginia Beach. It felt a little piece of the world that wasn’t going to be touched by violence like that.” Hours after the carnage, Bobby Dyer, the mayor of the city, told the world: “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.” That was plain to see amid the solemn flags, flowers and police tape at the municipal centre. But less than 10 miles away on the coast, life carried on as if nothing had happened in a city where tourism is a $2.45bn industry, bringing more than 10 million overnight visitors a year. Shoppers idled in beachwear stores or ate pizza or ice cream on Atlantic Avenue. A ferris wheel turned in a fairground. Music blasted from loudspeakers. A “military village” was set up on the beach, including a naval hovercraft, as part of a “patriotic festival”. Men on motorbikes, engines rasping, performed flips and other stunts on the sand. Motorboats sped by in the water, planes trailing advertisements flew above. People strolled the boardwalk, sunbathed or splashed in the Atlantic ocean, as blissfully unaware of danger as in a Hollywood movie. Among those on the pier were Robin Michals and her husband Marc, whose friend survived the massacre, telling them he had been within three feet of the gunman and later stepped over a dead body as police led him out. Marc, 55, who owns a marketing company, put the city seal with a black ribbon on his Facebook page. Robin, 52, said: “‘Virginia Beach strong’ is what everyone is saying.” The couple moved here in 1990 and have no regrets. Robin said: “It’s a great place to live. The school system is phenomenal.” Marc added: “It’s clean and well kept and safe. It’s hard to say that after yesterday.” Indeed, for Robin the mass shooting was a brutal reminder that in America in 2019, the unimaginable can happen anywhere. A pre-school teacher, she said: “We have children aged two to six and, along with fire drills, have to do internal lockdowns and external lockdowns. “It’s difficult for young children to comprehend. They get scared. We are a small school and I’m the one in charge of locking the door. It’s always there.”",2019-06-02 08:43:24,A mass shooting couldn’t happen in Virginia Beach … until it did,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

News By Lee Brown Submit June 2, 2019 | 10:11am				| Updated June 3, 2019 | 8:44am The gunman who shot 12 people dead at a Virginia Beach municipal building had been facing disciplinary action for a violent fight at work, according to a report. DeWayne Craddock, 40, was still employed as an engineer with the Department of Public Utilities when he went on his shooting rampage Friday, killing 12 and injuring several others, including a cop. But he recently started showing serious behavioral problems and got into physical “scuffles” with other city workers, a source told the New York Times. The source told the paper that the troubles had escalated in the week leading up to the mass shooting — and Craddock was involved in what it called “a violent altercation on city grounds.” Craddock reportedly knew he was facing disciplinary action for the fight when he went into the municipal building with two .45-caliber handguns, at least one of which was equipped with a sound suppressor — and both of which were purchased legally. Craddock killed 12 people, all but one co-workers, and injured several others before he died in a police shootout. He launched the attack after brushing his teeth — and sharing pleasantries with a fellow engineer. His family posted a handwritten note outside their Yorktown, Va., home, offering “heartfelt condolences to the victims,” according to the Washington Post. “We are grieving the loss of our loved one. At this time we wish to focus on the victims and the lives loss [sic] during yesterdays tragic event,” the note said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who loss [sic] their lives, and those recovering in the hospital.” “They’re beautiful people, both,” Betty Ware, a deaconess, said of Craddock’s parents, saying his mother would talk about their children “all the time.” “She was just proud of them, her children,” Ware told the Washington Post.

85,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602642778/0/phoenix/nation~Virginia-Beach-mass-shooting-that-killed-puzzles-law-enforcement-critical-at-hospitals/,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. –  The longtime Virginia Beach public works employee accused of the nation's latest mass shooting put in his two-weeks notice Friday morning, hours before the attack that killed 12 and wounded four, city officials said Sunday. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said DeWayne Craddock's job performance was ""satisfactory,"" he did not face any disciplinary measures before he notified the city that he intended to quit, and he was not fired. ""He was in good standing within his department, no issue of discipline ongoing,"" Hansen said. In an interview with USA TODAY, Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera said the gunman’s motive is a mystery to authorities – a glaring question that may never be answered. Craddock died after the shooting. “Right now, we’re open to everything on his motive. We haven’t focused in on any one thing,” he said. “You have a professional life, you have a personal life. Is it something that happened in his personal life? Is it something long-term that happened in his personal life?” Cervera said investigators are looking at everything from his electronic trail and finances to his resignation and relationship with co-workers. He said nothing has stuck out that could explain why the gunman snapped. Authorities worked to put all the pieces together and track the shooter’s exact movements Friday to see whether there were any signs, but Cervera said, “Anecdotally, what I’m hearing is it was a regular workday.” NEW: Virginia Beach City Manager says gunman had given his two-week notice Friday morning — hours before he killed 12 at his workplace @USATODAY pic.twitter.com/yijTrSA53Z Four shooting victims all had multiple operations and were recovering Sunday at two area hospitals. One at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital was downgraded from fair to critical condition after a surgery, and two others there remained in critical condition. A fourth victim was critical but stable at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, which handles higher-level trauma cases. Sunday, residents of this resort town about 200 miles south of Washington flocked to churches as they grappled with the horrific incident. At Lifehouse Virginia Beach, Pastor Brandon Shank's praise for the police response received rounds of applause. He assured congregants the rampage would not define the Virginia Beach community and issued a call for unity.  “What took place in this city is not who we are,” Shank said. Craddock was described by police and those who knew him as an enigma who gave no indication that he stockpiled an arsenal and planned a systematic assault on his colleagues. More: Virginia Beach victims remembered with songs and sermons at vigils Craddock, a 15-year veteran of public works and a civil engineer, was still employed at the time of the rampage and had a pass to enter the secure inner offices and conference rooms. Police arrived two minutes after emergency calls about shots fired at Virginia Beach's municipal building No. 2  at 4:08 p.m., Cervera said Sunday. He described the three-story municipal building with a basement as a ""honeycomb,"" a maze of doors, stairwells and offices used by city municipal workers. In a chaotic scenario, four officers scoured the building, searching for the shooter. They discovered him on the building's second floor and engaged him in a gunbattle. The suspect fired numerous shots through an office door and wall toward the officers before the gunfire stopped, Cervera said. That's when officers decided to enter the office and engage the shooter. ""That’s not an easy decision to make,"" Cervera said. ""There’s an individual on the other side of the door. He has a gun. He just shot one of your officers."" Police found Craddock alive but wounded and began administering first aid. The suspect died en route to the hospital. Cervera said the shooter used a .45-caliber handgun with a silencer that police suspect was used to keep victims from knowing where the attacker was in the building. That could explain why survivors said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. The attacker brought numerous extended magazines, which carry more rounds than traditional ones. “Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,” said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. More: A 'woman of God,' a Scottish music lover: These are the victims of Virginia Beach shooting The image of a public works employee holed up with a silencer and extended magazines engaged in a merciless assault is a far cry from how Craddock's neighbors saw him. They described Craddock as a car enthusiast, bodybuilder and quiet man. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, lived in a Virginia Beach town home beneath Craddock for the past year and got to know him only in passing, exchanging the occasional greeting. “He wasn’t much of a talker,” Archer recalled. “He’s a mystery to us. He’s a mystery to everybody, apparently.” To avoid excessive publicizing of the shooter's name, officials said they would give his name publicly only once and would refer to him afterward only as ""the suspect."" He served in the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time of his city hire, and received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said he legally bought two .45-caliber handguns – in 2016 and 2018. Both were found at the crime scene, and neither was used in any other crime, the ATF reported. Hansen said all but one of the victims were employees of the city working in the public works department.

So it’s just senseless.” “These were 12 individuals who came to work in the city of Virginia Beach thinking that they would go home in the evening and they didn’t return and have left a tremendous void in their families and in our community.” “There was nothing different about him. Nothing different. I wish I would have seen something that I could have maybe identified to help him. Of course, everybody wants to know why. I just pray that he’s in heaven.” “We will not be defined by this horror. We will go forward. We have many members of our public that help and save lives. But most of all, let me commend the officers, the people that ran into a building with the active shooter shooting 45-caliber bullets and saved many people. Without doubt, question or reservation, Virginia Beach is a city of heroes.” By Glenn Thrush and Alan Blinder VIRGINIA BEACH — The resignation email arrived in the morning, and the gunfire started in the afternoon. DeWayne Craddock, an engineer who had worked for the City of Virginia Beach for about 15 years, notified his superiors on Friday that he intended to quit. Then at around 4 p.m., he embarked on a rampage in Building No. 2 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center, turning its offices and corridors into a battleground. When it was over, 12 people lay dead and Mr. Craddock was fatally wounded. As the authorities on Sunday shared a more detailed accounting of the siege, they also acknowledged for the first time that the gunman’s employment had been nearing its end. But they said he had not been forced to resign. James A. Cervera, the police chief in Virginia Beach, said investigators were focused on establishing what Mr. Craddock’s motives were and whether his job status “had anything to do with the horrific acts and events that he perpetrated.” At a news conference on Sunday, Chief Cervera offered a chilling timeline of what happened in Building No. 2, the stately 1970s-vintage brick structure where Mr. Craddock opened fire on three floors and where a small team of police officers rushed to confront an employee who had become an assailant. The first urgent calls, the chief said, were received at 4:08 p.m., and less than two minutes later officers were outside the building, which over the years had become what he called a “honeycomb” of rooms and passageways. There was no time to consult a blueprint, no time to map out a strategy. They had to find the gunman. By 4:18 p.m., the chief said, the officers had located Mr. Craddock, a 40-year-old former soldier who was armed with two handguns and plenty of ammunition. A gun battle began. Mr. Craddock moved through the building, exchanging shots with the officers, including one who was wounded at about 4:19 p.m. Precisely how many rounds the gunman fired is not yet known, Chief Cervera said on Sunday, but “it was well into the double digits.” “At one point, the suspect was firing through the door, through the wall at the officers,” the chief said. “And then the firing stopped.” Mr. Craddock had barricaded himself in a room. The officers, the chief said, were worried about an escape and another burst of violence, and made plans to breach the door. “That’s not an easy decision to make: There’s an individual on the other side of the door, he has a gun, he just shot one of your officers,” he said. They broke in and found Mr. Craddock alive but seriously wounded. Chief Cervera said the officers tried to save his life, but he died later. As the police cleared the building, some of the workers who escaped injury had to navigate what city officials described as a “horrific” scene. Eleven city workers were killed in the rampage, one of the deadliest episodes of workplace violence in the United States in recent years. The employees, who had collectively worked for the Virginia Beach government for more than 150 years, were LaQuita Brown; Ryan Keith Cox; Tara Welch Gallagher; Mary Louise Gayle; Alexander Mikhail Gusev; Joshua O. Hardy; Michelle Langer, known as Missy; Richard H. Nettleton; Katherine A. Nixon; Christopher Kelly Rapp; and Robert Williams. Herbert Snelling, a contractor who was at the municipal center to see about a permit, also was killed. [Read more about the victims.] Local hospitals said on Sunday that four people who were injured in the attack were in critical condition. One patient who had been listed in fair condition “had additional surgery and is critical during recovery,” Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital said in a statement. On Princess Anne Road, near the municipal complex, passing drivers were slowing down to gaze at a growing memorial to the victims, a collection of flowers, cards, balloons and American flags. A set of crosses was installed in the afternoon. A few hundred yards away, F.B.I. agents were processing evidence from Building No. 2, which was still ringed with crime-scene tape. Much about Mr. Craddock, an engineer who had worked on projects like sewer pipelines and pump station replacements, remained unclear. Members of his family have declined to speak publicly, but expressed their condolences to victims of the attack and their loved ones in a handwritten statement posted on the door of a family home. [Read more about the suspected gunman.] Although the gunman’s state of mind at the time of the killings remains a mystery, local law enforcement officials involved with the case believe Mr. Craddock had recently “snapped,” according to three city officials. In the middle of the rampage, Terry Inman, who worked with Mr. Craddock in the public utilities office, was trying to find a way out of the second floor of the building when he ran into the gunman, who had his weapon pointed downward. Mr. Inman said he asked Mr. Craddock: “What are you doing? Stop it, DeWayne!” Mr. Craddock responded with a blank stare and, after a moment, turned around and walked away without firing, Mr. Inman said. Deeply shaken by the encounter, Mr. Inman then sought safety on an upper floor. David L. Hansen, the city manager, said at the news conference on Sunday morning that Mr. Craddock’s performance in his city job had been “satisfactory, and he was in good standing in his department.” Mr. Hansen said that officials were continuing to examine whether co-workers had raised concerns about Mr. Craddock, but added that he was “not sensing that” there had been misgivings about him. Prodded by questions a few minutes later, Mr. Hansen acknowledged that Mr. Craddock had notified the city on Friday morning of his intention to resign. Asked whether Mr. Craddock’s email had cited a reason for his resignation, Mr. Hansen said, “We are determining where that letter is.” But he said he did not believe the resignation was connected with any decision about Mr. Craddock’s future position in the government. Building No. 2 will remain closed indefinitely, Mr. Hansen said. The rest of the municipal center, a sprawling complex of more than two dozen buildings, is expected to reopen on Tuesday. “Our recovery is underway,” Mr. Hansen said. “Our grieving is underway.” Advertisement",2019-06-02 15:42:03,"Gunman in Virginia Beach Attack Planned to Quit City Job, Officials Say",,1,http://nytimes.com

At 4:08 p.m. on Friday, Cervera said, emergency communications dispatched officers to Building 2 for a report of shots fired. It included police, fire, emergency medical services and Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office deputies. Within two minutes, the first officers arrived outside the building — which Cervera described as a ""honeycomb"" with numerous staircases, a tunnel in the basement and many offices. ""We had no idea where the suspect was. We had no idea of the extent of the shots being fired,"" he said, explaining that law enforcement didn't have plans for the three-story building available. The police chief called it ""extremely chaotic."" Between 4:15 p.m. and 4:18 p.m., four officers, none of whom had body cameras, found the suspect on the second floor. ""They came from different commands, yet they formed a rapid-entry team and entered the building,"" Cervera said. Cervera said investigators don't know if the gunman was targeting specific people. The team swept through the building until it found the suspect on the second floor. Police then engaged in a gun battle with the suspect while other officers scoured the rest of the building. The shooter used two .45-caliber handguns, equipped with extended magazines and a suppressor on at least one of the weapons. Once the suspect was cornered in an office, he kept shooting round after round through the wall and door at law enforcement. Police returned fire. At 4:19 p.m., an officer was shot, spared only by his bulletproof vest. Officers then breached the door and apprehended the gunman, who was still alive.

Within two minutes, the first officers arrived outside the building — which Cervera described as a ""honeycomb"" with numerous staircases, a tunnel in the basement and many offices. ""We had no idea where the suspect was. We had no idea of the extent of the shots being fired,"" he said, explaining that law enforcement didn't have plans for the three-story building available. The police chief called it ""extremely chaotic."" Between 4:15 p.m. and 4:18 p.m., four officers, none of whom had body cameras, found the suspect on the second floor. ""They came from different commands, yet they formed a rapid-entry team and entered the building,"" Cervera said. Cervera said investigators don't know if the gunman was targeting specific people. The team swept through the building until it found the suspect on the second floor. Police then engaged in a gun battle with the suspect while other officers scoured the rest of the building. The shooter used two .45-caliber handguns, equipped with extended magazines and a suppressor on at least one of the weapons. Once the suspect was cornered in an office, he kept shooting round after round through the wall and door at law enforcement. Police returned fire. At 4:19 p.m., an officer was shot, spared only by his bulletproof vest. Officers then breached the door and apprehended the gunman, who was still alive. ""First aid was immediately rendered,"" the chief said. He died on the way to a hospital. It all happened in 36 minutes. Twelve dead. Four seriously wounded. And a city in mourning. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-06-02 11:28:00,Gunman gave 2 weeks notice before Virginia Beach's deadliest shooting that killed 12 people,,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/
92,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/602615280/0/milwaukee/home~aposA-mystery-to-everybodyapos-City-employee-who-killed-used-stealth-to-hunt-down-coworkers/,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — The heavily armed public works employee who fatally shot 12 people at a municipal building here is described by police and those who knew him as an enigma who gave no indication that he was stockpiling an arsenal and planned a systematic assault on his co-workers. DeWayne Craddock, a 15-year veteran of public works and a civil engineer, was still employed at the time of the massacre and had a pass to enter the secure inner offices and conference rooms, officials said Saturday. Virginia Beach police chief Jim Cervera said Craddock, 40, a public utilities engineer, had not been fired from his job. The chief refused to theorize on a possible motive for why Craddock sprayed bullets into fleeing office workers, using a .45 caliber handgun armed with a silencer that police believe was used for stealth and to keep victims from knowing where the attacker was in the building. That could at least partially explain why survivors of the attack said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. Craddock brought numerous extended magazines loaded with ammunition, which carry more rounds than traditional magazines, police said. “Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,” said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. Craddock was eventually killed in an ""intense firefight"" with four responding officers who hemmed him in and likely prevented him from using his load of ammunition on more victims, Cervera said. The image of a public works employee holed up with a silencer and extended magazines amid a merciless assault is a far cry from how Craddock's neighbors saw him. They describe Craddock as a car enthusiast, bodybuilder, and seemingly quiet man. Amanda Archer, 22, and Cassetty Howerin, 23, lived in a Virginia Beach townhome beneath Craddock for the past year and only got to know him in passing, exchanging the occasional greeting. “He wasn’t much of a talker,” Archer recalled. “He’s a mystery to us. He’s a mystery to everybody, apparently.” City Manager Dave Hansen said Craddock was still employed in the department, had a security pass and ""was authorized to enter the building."" In order to avoid excessive publicizing of the shooter's name, officials said they would only give his name publicly once and would afterward refer to him only as ""the suspect."" Craddock had served in the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time of his city hire, and received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Craddock roamed three floors of the office building, shooting indiscriminately at his co-workers. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said at a Saturday afternoon press conference that Craddock legally bought two .45 caliber handguns – one in 2016 and 2018. Both were found at the crime scene and neither was previously used in any other crime, the ATF reported. Hansen said all but one of the victims were employees of the city working in the public works department.The shooter killed his first victim in a car in the parking lot before he entered the building. The victims were identified as Laquita Brown, Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alesander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Richard H. Nettleton, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle “Missy” Langer, Robert “Bobby” Williams  and Herbert “Bert” Snelling, a contractor. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" a somber Hansen told reporters. Outside a movie theater in a strip mall about 3 miles from the scene of the shooting, about 200 people gathered at a morning vigil as pastors delivered messages about resilience interspersed with prayer songs. Parents held umbrellas over squirming children as speakers vowed that the shooting wouldn’t identify the community. Some knelt. Others turned their heads down while rubbing their eyes A few in the crowd wore T-shirts or baseball caps marked with the names of city departments. Jonas Alered said he had lunch with one of the victims, Gallagher, earlier in the week. The tragedy left a “deep void,” he said. Four people were also injured in the shooting that broke out Friday afternoon in the popular Virginia resort city with a population of 440,000 about 200 miles south of Washington, D.C. Three were in critical condition; a fourth was in fair condition, officials said. Also, a Virginia Beach Police officer was also shot, but his life was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. Sal’s Pizza owner Mostafa Essabar was in his shop across from the Virginia Beach Municipal Complex around 4 p.m. Friday when he started noticing police activity in the area. Across the street, he saw a man he recognized as one of his regular customers on the ground with officers surrounding him. ""I was thinking it's like an accident or something, but then I saw like the blood start coming from his chest,” he said. K-9 vehicles started converging on the scene, helicopters were circling and SWAT was arriving, he said. As an ambulance drove the injured man away, Essabar realized there was something big going on. When officials released the names of the 12 victims killed in the shooting Saturday morning, Essabar said he recognized at least six of them as customers who regularly frequented his business. Often, he said, they only had about about a 45-minute window to grab lunch. But he knew many of their favorite orders and would start working on them as soon as they stepped in the door. Among the victims Essobar knew were Katherine Nixon, whose favorite order he recalled was a salad and wings with a Diet Pepsi, and Robert Williams, who he said came in sometimes twice a week to grab pepperoni pizza. His business was among several in the area near the complex that painted the words #VBStrong on their windows in a show of support for those affected by the tragedy. “It’s sad. It’s really sad. It’s like you lost one of your family,” Essobar said. “They are like a part of you because you’ve been dealing with them every day, every week, and they are very nice people.” The mass shooting was the deadliest attack in the U.S. since the November rampage at Borderline Bar & Grill in California, when 12 people were also killed. Friday's massacre sent shock waves throughout Virginia Beach, also home to three military bases. Spoke to Virginia Governor @RalphNortham last night, and the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Virginia Beach this morning, to offer condolences to that great community. The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all! President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday that he had spoken to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and city officials ""to offer condolences to that great community."" He said the federal government would provide whatever assistance was needed. Cervera said the heavily armed shooter died in an exchange of gunfire with four officers who rushed into the building. After downing the shooter, police then attempted to give the gravely injured suspect first aid before he died. The sound suppressor that the gunman used for his handgun is legal in Virginia but is not permitted in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. Some survivors said they did not think the gunfire was close at first because it was not especially loud. Cervera described the scene as a ""war zone"" in the running battle between police and the shooter. Cervera said the gunman walked into the Virginia Beach Municipal Center — where up to 400 people work — shortly after 4 p.m. EDT and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all the victims."" ""The officers stopped this individual from committing more carnage,"" Cervera said. The gunman likely would have used all his ammunition on innocent people had the officers not engaged him in the gunbattle, forcing him to use up the massive store of ammunition that he brought on his killing mission, the chief said. In Yorktown, where Craddock's relatives live in a two-story house, a handwritten note taped to the front door said the Craddock family ""wishes to send our heart felt condolences to the victims, "" The Washington Post reports. ""We are grieving the loss of our loved one,"" the note said. "" At this time we wish to focus on the victims and the lives lost during yesterdays tragic event. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who loss their lives, and those recovering in the hospital.” More: What we know so far about the Virginia Beach shooting ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Mayor Bobby Dyer said. ""The people involved are our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues."" Christina Pullen, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Norfolk, said the bureau is responding to assist Virginia Beach police. The shooting broke out in Building No., 2 of the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, which includes several city facilities, including the police department. Building 2 houses offices for planning and public works and is adjacent to city hall. Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the department of public works, said he had worked with Craddock before and had a brief interaction with him Friday. Scott said he saw him in the men’s restroom about five minutes before the shooting. “He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,” Scott said. “I said ‘Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?’ It was just a brief conversation.” Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting broke out, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door. “We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.” Sheila Cook, an employee, said police were able to alert them quickly to give them time to leave the building. ""I am still shaken, because there is entirely too much killing going on,"" Cook said. Zand Bakhtiari told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper that the gunfire came in swift succession, sounding like an automatic weapon. “It was repeated, rapid gunfire,” said Bakhtiari, who said he was one of only five people left in the IT department on the first floor of the building at the end of the day. Arthur Felton, an 18-year employee in the planning department, told the Virginian-Pilot he was able to evacuate after a co-worker heard gunshots.  A shaken Felton said he “never thought this would happen in my building. The people who were shot – I’m sure I know most of them.” City Councilwoman Barbara Henley had just arrived at the City Hall building right after 4 p.m. when she heard sirens and assumed there had been an accident, she told the Virginian-Pilot. After exiting her car, Henley said she was told by employees outside there was a shooting as they urged her to leave. She said she heard someone shout “get down!” as she got back in her car. “I was scared to death.” Henley told the paper security had been increased recently at the City Hall building but said some other city buildings don’t follow the same security measures. Cervera praised first responders for their actions. ""When this violent act occurred, police and fire-rescue responded and did the professional thing that they do, because that's what they do,"" he said. Virginia Beach Council member Aaron Rouse was a student at Virginia Tech when 33 people died in a mass shooting at the Blacksburg school in 2007. He told CNN he was “in shock” when he learned of Friday’s rampage, and it hit close to home. “I immediately jumped into ‘not again, this cannot happen again, I can’t believe this happened again.’” Rouse, who saluted the valiant first responders on Friday, said he went from feeling sorry and helpless during college to knowing that in his role as a councilman he could help have “those tough conversations” about ways to end gun violence and make communities safer. “We must learn from the mistakes of our past. We cannot show fear; our leaders have to stand up.” Mass shootings affect everyone, no matter where they happen, he told CNN. “We were Virginia Tech strong, now we are Virginia Beach strong.” The Virginia Beach police sent out a notice early Saturday saying an Active Threat Citizens Defense workshop previously scheduled in the city had been canceled.

Recounting the chaotic minutes that followed the Friday afternoon gun rampage, authorities said they were still seeking a motive for why DeWayne Craddock, 40, would launch the attack on his co-workers and others at a municipal complex. “To the extent that the subject’s employment status has anything do with these events, that will be part of the ongoing investigation,” City Manager Dave Hansen told reporters. “However, he was not terminated and he was not in the process of being terminated.” Craddock, an employee in the coastal resort city’s public utilities department for about 15 years, had been described by officials as disgruntled. But Hansen contradicted reports that he was being disciplined or fired. “To my knowledge, the perpetrator’s performance was satisfactory, that he was in good standing within his department and that there were no issues of discipline ongoing,” he said. On the morning of the shooting Craddock tendered his resignation by email, but he had not been under pressure to do so, Hansen added. Using his employee pass to enter secure areas of the building where he worked, Craddock began indiscriminately shooting people with two .45 caliber pistols, reloading with extended ammunition magazines, according to police. All but one of those killed were employed by the city, while the other was a contractor seeking a permit, officials said. The rampage in Virginia’s biggest city was the worst mass shooting in the United States since November 2018, when a dozen people were slain at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who then killed himself. Three of the four people who were wounded were listed in critical condition on Sunday, while the fourth was critical but stable. Officials said all had undergone surgery. A police officer who was shot but saved by his ballistic vest has been treated and released. The 11 dead municipal workers had been employed for between 11 months and 41 years. Six worked in the public utilities department and five were employed in the public works department. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said officers were on the scene within two minutes of the first report at 4:08 p.m. EDT (2008 GMT) and that the suspect was taken away within 36 minutes. With police entering the maze-like 1970s era Building Two of the complex from several points, four officers from different commands worked together to locate the suspect on the second floor “and immediately engaged in a gun battle,” Cervera said. During the exchange of fire, with the number of rounds fired by Craddock running “well into the double digits,” Cervera said the suspect led the officers on a chase through office doors that he was able to access and that locked behind him. “They were returning fire, and at one point the suspect was firing through the door and the walls at the officers,” he said. Cervera said the officers found the suspect alive and administered first aid, but that he died after being rushed to a hospital. Stressing that the investigation is still in progress, Cervera said police do not believe the suspect was targeting any specific individual. A federal agent said on Saturday that the handguns used in the attack were bought by the shooter legally within the past three years, and police said at least one of the pistols was fitted with a “sound suppressor.” The city is planning a memorial service for Thursday evening. All municipal buildings will be closed on Monday, officials said. Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

95,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/02/virginia-beach-shooting-suspect-is-believed-to-have-submitted-his-resignation-hours-before-killing-1/,"The man suspected of committing a mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal office building on Friday afternoon is reported to have submitted his resignation from an engineering job only hours earlier. DeWayne Craddock, the man suspected of shooting 12 people at the office (including 11 of his former colleagues), sent an email on Friday announcing that he intended to quit his job, according to The New York Times. ""He notified his chain of command that morning,"" Virginia Beach City Manager David L. Hansen said on Sunday, pointing out that Craddock had not been forced to resign and that investigators have not yet succeeded in retrieving a copy of his resignation email. It is unclear whether there was any direct connection between his resignation and subsequent decision to commit the mass shooting. The 11 city workers who were killed during the shooting had collectively worked in the Virginia Beach city government for over 150 years. They included LaQuita Brown, Tara Welch Gallagher, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Michelle ""Missy"" Langer, Katherine A. Nixon, Robert Williams, Ryan Keith Cox, Mary Louise Gayle, Joshua O. Hardy, Richard H. Nettleton and Christopher Kelly Rapp. A twelfth individual, contractor Herbert Snelling, was at city hall to seek a permit and was also killed during the shooting. Craddock himself was eventually killed after engaging in a gun battle with four police officers who arrived at the scene of the shooting. As of Sunday four other people who had been injured during the shooting were listed as being in critical condition. Since the Friday shooting, it has been learned that Craddock worked for Virginia Beach for roughly 15 years and had received training as an engineer. Aside from traffic violations, he did not have any history with the criminal justice system. He owned two handguns that he had legally purchased in 2016 and 2018, and federal investigators announced that two more handguns were discovered during a search of his apartment and at least one of those had also been purchased legally. CNN reported one chilling anecdote about Craddock acting entirely normal with a colleague before carrying out the mass shooting. Joseph Scott, an engineering technician, said he exchanged pleasantries with the quiet, 40-year-old certified professional engineer for the city in the bathroom shortly before the carnage. ""I said, 'How are you doing?' He said he was doing OK,"" Scott remembered. ""I asked, 'Any plans for the weekend?' And he said, 'No.' I said, 'Well, have a good day.' And he said the same to me."" Scott went home for the day. There was no sign of what was to come. Although the Virginia Beach shooting is yet another example of a high-profile mass shooting to occur in the United States, Republican politicians and other pro-gun advocates have resisted calls for stricter anti-gun laws to reduce the frequency of these types of tragedies. ""There are things the government can do and there are things this government is doing, but we are never going to protect everybody against everybody who is deranged,"" White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Mulvaney added, ""You have laws on the books that make murder illegal, yet they still do it. Laws are not going to fix everything."" Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer for Salon.

96,https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2019/06/02/virginia-beach-gunman-resigned-hours-before-mass-shooting-officials-say,"By Jim Morrison, Rachel Weiner, Patricia Sullivan, The Washington Post   VIRGINIA BEACH – DeWayne Craddock submitted a letter of resignation from his job as an engineer for the city of Virginia Beach on Friday morning, hours before murdering 12 people at the government building where he worked, officials said Sunday. “He notified his chain of command that morning,” City Manager Dave Hansen said at a news conference. “My understanding is he did that via email.”  Officials did not elaborate on the substance of the email. Hansen added that they are “determining where that letter is.” Craddock, 40, had not been fired and was not in danger of being fired, Hansen said. His performance was considered “satisfactory.” He was “in good standing in his department,” and “there were no issues of discipline ongoing.”   Police Chief James A. Cervera cautioned that Craddock’s motivations remain under investigation and said police are looking into his professional and personal life. “We do not have anything glaring,” Cervera said. Police arrived at the building within two minutes of a call going out for shots fired just after 4 p.m. on Friday afternoon, Cervera said. Craddock had arrived at Building 2 and immediately shot a contractor in the parking lot, who was there to file a permit. He next killed a woman who was on her way out of the office, before using his badge to access the building’s second floor and begin shooting indiscriminately.   “We were moving at a rapid pace,” he told reporters, but “we had no idea where the suspect was.” Building 2, built in the 1970s is a “honeycomb” with many additions and subdivisions, he said: “It’s a maze where the workers are.” Five to eight minutes after entering the building, he said, officers encountered Craddock on the second floor and “immediately engaged in a gun battle.” Two detectives were the first to enter the building, followed by a pair of uniformed K-9 officers who also got there fast. Cervera called the exchange a “long gun battle” with the number of rounds fired “well into the double digits.” The shooter was still moving, Cervera said, firing through doors and walls. At about 4:19 p.m., an officer was shot and wounded but saved from fatal injury by his protective vest.   Eventually, the shooting stopped and police were able to confront Craddock in an office. They broke down the door and engaged him with fire. When the shooter was subdued – 36 minutes after the first call to police went out – officers attempted to render aid to save Craddock’s life. He died on the way to a nearby hospital. Craddock used two .45-caliber handguns in the shooting and police found a sound suppressor, commonly known as a silencer, and extended magazines. He purchased the guns legally. A 2003 report in Dolan’s Virginia Business Observer said Craddock had joined a consulting firm called MSA and was a project engineer. Firm partner C. Scott Acey declined to comment Saturday beyond confirming that Craddock worked for the company for three to four years before going to work for Virginia Beach.   Within about an hour of the initial attack, Cervera said, all the wounded had been transported out for emergency care. Along with the 12 people killed, four people were hospitalized. All have undergone multiple surgeries, officials said Sunday. “They are progressing and our prayers are with them,” Hansen said. The municipal center will remain closed Monday, but Virginia Beach’s other city offices will be open. All municipal center buildings other than Building 2, where the shooting took place, will reopen Tuesday. “Our recovery is underway; our grieving is underway,” Hansen said. At the Courthouse Community United Methodists Church, less than a mile from the municipal center, many local government employees were among the 150 congregants Sunday morning looking for solace.   None of the victims of the shooting were members of the church, but a stepsister of one congregant is in the hospital with injuries. Rev. Beth Anderson prayed for the victims and their families; she also prayed “for the person who perpetrated this crime and his family” and asked God to give love and peace to them. “All I can offer is that God is with us and we need to be in solidarity with everyone,” Anderson said. “It can’t be about divisiveness. We tried that already and it doesn’t work. My hope is it won’t take another shooting before we come together.”   Hundreds more residents gathered Sunday morning by the iconic Neptune sculpture on Virginia Beach’s sandy coast for an evangelical service hosted by Trinity Church. Patty Richards has been praying ever since she first heard on Friday that multiple people had been shot at the municipal center not far from her house. Her husband, a contractor, had planned to go to that building on Friday for a permit but put it off until Monday. And Richards, a former critical cardiac nurse at a nearby hospital, knew all too well what the medical professionals treating the victims would be facing. “I know about that kind of pain,” she said.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) VIENNA, Va. – The pastor of a Virginia church has asked God to give President Donald Trump wisdom to lead the country. Standing with Trump at McLean Bible Church in Vienna, pastor David Platt said Sunday that ""fools despise wisdom and instruction."" Trump made an unannounced stop at the church after leaving his private golf club in Sterling, Virginia. The president bowed his head as Platt led the congregation in audible prayer. The president did not address the congregation but mouthed ""thank you"" as he left the stage. The White House said Trump stopped at the church to visit with the pastor and pray for the victims of Friday's deadly mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Rev.

100,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/briefing/mbz-trade-wars-trump.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Alisha Haridasani Gupta (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Because of technical problems, we look a little different today than usual — including not having pictures. We should be back to normal tomorrow. Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, is arguably the most powerful leader in the Arab world. He controls sovereign wealth funds worth $1.3 trillion and props up reliable allies around the region, including Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. The prince has long been considered a crucial friend to the U.S. as well, influencing Washington’s foreign policy in the region. Now, U.S. prosecutors are investigating his ties to President Trump. The special counsel has unearthed evidence that the prince tried to help the Russians open back channels to the Trump campaign. Takeaway: Under the Trump administration, the prince’s influence in Washington seems greater than ever, with the president adopting his views and moving against the prince’s two enemies — Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood — even over the advice of his own cabinet officials and senior national security staff. _____ President Trump arrives in London today for a long-delayed state visit. His visit comes as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to step down on Friday, and his penchant for headline-grabbing statements could further shake up a divided, Brexit-battered country. On the agenda: Much of the activity on Monday will be at Buckingham Palace, including a formal welcome and a banquet with Queen Elizabeth. He will have afternoon tea with Prince Charles. He meets with Mrs. May on Tuesday. And he is expected to take part in solemn ceremonies commemorating the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. He won’t, however, address Parliament. Reminder: Mrs. May invited Mr. Trump for a state visit when he first took office two years ago. But as the relationship between Britain and the U.S. turned awkward, the trip was sidelined. Mr. Trump visited Britain last year on a working trip — a downgrade from a full-blown state visit. _____ Chinese officials showed little signs of backing down in the trade standoff with the U.S., blaming Washington for a breakdown in negotiations. In a white paper released on Sunday, Beijing didn’t specify how it would respond to the latest round of U.S. tariffs and the Trump administration’s ban on Huawei. But commentaries in state-run news media have suggested the government could target American companies that source key components, like the minerals used to power batteries and smartphones, in China. Quotable: “China isn’t willing to fight a trade war, but it isn’t afraid to fight and will fight if necessary. That attitude has not changed,” the white paper said. _____ President Trump threatened to impose gradually increasing tariffs on imports from Mexico on June 10 unless the country acts to curb the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. In doing so, he is said to have ignored the objections of several senior advisers, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to multiple administration officials. The announcement, which the president made on Twitter, could greatly rattle the U.S. economy — including by disrupting plans some U.S. companies had to shift their China-focused business dealings to Mexico. By the numbers: Mexico displaced China as the top U.S. trading partner this year. The U.S. imported $345 billion in goods from Mexico last year, and about 30 percent of the content of Mexican exports originated in the U.S., according to a recent study. Related: Mr. Trump also targeted India in his sprawling trade war, terminating its special trade status on the same day the Indian government reported that the country’s economy was growing at its slowest rate in five years. _____ Greed and death in Vancouver The lurid trial of Zhao Li, an immigrant accused of murdering his wealthier cousin, has riveted Canadians and made headlines in China, exposing a real-life drama of souring family ties, revenge and violence. But his case also illuminates the recent changes that an influx of wealthy Chinese immigrants have brought to Vancouver. Tiananmen anniversary: Days before the most politically sensitive date on China’s calendar, Twitter suspended the accounts of Chinese human rights lawyers, activists, college students and nationalists, who use workarounds to access the banned social media platform. The company apologized and said the accounts were suspended by overactive filters, but doubt over the explanation ran rampant online. YouTube: Kanghua Ren, a YouTube prankster known as ReSet to his followers, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison and fined about $22,300 for one of his pranks in which he replaced an Oreo cookie’s cream with toothpaste and handed it to a homeless man in Barcelona. Boeing: As the aircraft manufacturer rushed to build a 737 Max, employees and the Federal Aviation Administration were left in the dark about a fundamental overhaul to an automated system that would ultimately play a role in two fatal crashes. Big Tech: The two U.S. agencies focused on antitrust, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, have split up oversight of Google and Amazon, according to three people familiar with the matter, signaling greater scrutiny, if not yet investigations. North Korea: Kim Yong-chol, the leader of negotiations for two summit meetings with President Trump, has largely disappeared from view. Some analysts in South Korea believe he may have been sidelined, even banished to forced labor, and members of his team possibly executed, after the diplomacy failed to achieve the aims of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. U.S. mass shooting: A Virginia Beach public utilities employee who killed 12 people and injured several others before dying himself in a shootout with the police on Friday had just submitted his resignation. India: Rescuers have been looking for eight climbers — two Americans, four Britons, an Australian and an Indian — on the country’s second-highest mountain, the Nanda Devi East , after they failed to report back to base camp on May 26. Top Shop: Sir Philip Green, the British owner of the major fashion retailer Arcadia Group, has been charged with assault in the U.S. by a fitness instructor in Arizona. He denies the allegations and doesn’t plan to attend a hearing in the case, scheduled for June 19. Elizabeth Gilbert: The author of “Eat Pray Love” has evolved greatly since that personal journey around the world and has now published a new book, “City of Girls,” set during World War II. “The Weekly”: A new half-hour TV show from The New York Times brings you one big story every week. The premiere is about the T.M. Landry school scandal in Louisiana. What we’re reading: This exploration of the word “intersectionality”from Vox. Amanda Taub, our Interpreter columnist, appreciates how Jane Coaston “unpacks the obscure academic term, which has become one of the biggest flashpoints in today’s culture war.” Cook: Don’t doubt the power of a pasta and zucchini salad. Chef Yotam Ottolenghi’s recipe is delicious. Watch: Asian-American couples don’t get to have sex in Hollywood movies. Randall Park and Ali Wong wrote “Always Be My Maybe” anyway, now streaming on Netflix. Listen: Steve Lacy is largely a one-man studio band on his debut album. Its grand statement is the nine-minute “Like Me,” one of 12 new tracks on our weekly playlist. Read: The first volume of a planned trilogy about the American Revolution is one of nine books we recommend this week. _____ Smarter Living: You can tame Facebook’s aggressive attempts to engage you. In the feed of notifications — which you can see when you click or tap the bell icon in any version of the Facebook app, whether desktop or mobile — there’s a three-dot button which allows you to adjust future notifications. You can also turn off some notifications in the app settings. Or simply use the mobile web version of Facebook to avoid notifications altogether. And our writer offers a whimsical, effective solution to the challenging social condition of forgetting someone’s name. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting. It’s a time of celebration, with rich desserts, gifts and gatherings. This year, it may come Tuesday. But there’s no guarantee. Islam operates on a lunar calendar, and the official marking of Eid is the sighting of the first crescent of the full moon. Cloudy weather could prevent the sighting in a given location. Since there is no central Islamic authority, Eid can arrive on different days in different places. In the U.S., according to calculations by Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the new moon will be visible on Tuesday. The United Arab Emirates formed a committee tasked with spotting the new moon cycle on Monday night. If the panel doesn’t see signs of a new moon, Ramadan will last another day, and Eid will take place on Wednesday there. In any case, this week you can wish “Eid Mubarak” (“Have a blessed holiday”) to your Muslim friends. _____ That’s it for this briefing.

News By Mark Moore and Lee Brown Submit June 2, 2019 | 5:07pm President Trump was in Virginia Sunday for a special church service praying for victims of the Virginia Beach mass shooting. Trump, wearing khakis and a jacket over a polo shirt and holding a golf hat, was applauded by the congregation as he arrived at McLean Bible Church. While he did not talk during the service, Trump stood behind pastor David Platt as he offered a prayer for the 12 killed in Friday’s mass shooting. The president was there to “visit with the Pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,” said Judd Deere, the White House’s deputy press secretary. Trump arrived at about 2:20 p.m. and his motorcade left a little over 15 minutes later. DeWayne Craddock, 40, slaughtered 12 at Virginia Beach’s municipal building Friday — just hours after quitting his job as a civil engineer.

106,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602649658/0/phoenix/nation~Hereaposs-the-biggest-news-you-missed-this-weekend/,"Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this column and newsletter misstated the number of people injured in the Virginia shooting. Four were injured. The longtime Virginia Beach public works employee behind the nation's latest mass shooting put in his two-week notice on Friday morning, hours before he carried out an attack that killed 12 and wounded four, officials said Sunday. The suspect used a handgun armed with a silencer that police believe was used to keep victims from knowing where the attacker was in the building. The shooter was eventually killed in an ""intense firefight"" with four responding police officers. The suspect was ""in good standing"" in his job and gave no indication that he planned an assault on colleagues, City Manager Dave Hansen said. Eleven of the 12 victims killed worked for the city. President Trump is slamming reports that he called Duchess Meghan ""nasty,"" despite an audio recording of the exchange. ""I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty,"" Trump tweeted Sunday, referring to a Friday interview with Britain's The Sun. A journalist noted the former American actress ""wasn’t so nice"" to Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ""I didn’t know that she was nasty,"" Trump said. The president plans to visit the U.K. this week and will meet Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Kate after he and first lady Melania Trump arrive Monday in Britain.  But Trump is not expected to exchange pleasantries with Duchess Meghan, who is currently on maternity leave with one-month-old Archie. China said it won't give in on ""major issues of principle"" in its trade war with the United States, according to a report issued Sunday that blames the U.S. for the escalating dispute. China, in the report from the Cabinet spokesman's office, accused the U.S. of backpedaling over agreements in trade talks and ""resorting to intimidation and coercion."" The report added that ""any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit."" The Trump administration ratcheted up its trade battle with China in May when it hiked U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in imported Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. The president has also threatened to add a 25% tariff on virtually all the remaining $325 billion in products brought in from China. A couple from Maryland was found dead in a hotel room while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. Edward Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Ann Day, 49, had been staying at the Bahía Príncipe hotel at the resort Playa Nueva Romana since May 25, hotel director Francisco Romero told local media. After they missed their checkout time on Thursday, hotel staff entered the room and found both bodies unresponsive but no signs of violence, the hotel said in a statement. Dominican Republic National Police said blood pressure medication was found in the room and that an autopsy revealed the cause of death to be respiratory failure, according to CNN. Reigning ""Jeopardy!"" champion James Holzhauer has secured his 32nd win. Now he's just one dominant game from surpassing Ken Jennings' non-tournament record of $2,520,700. The professional sports gambler brought in $79,633 Friday night, bringing his total earnings to $2,462,216 – just $58,485 from breaking Jennings' record. Holzhauer had $52,633 going into Friday's Final Jeopardy! round. Jennings and Holzhauer are the only two ""Jeopardy!"" contestants to earn $2 million or more in regular, non-tournament winnings, a barrier Holzhauer crossed in last Friday's episode. Onlookers ran in panic as an out-of-control cruise ship collided with a much smaller tourist boat in Venice on Sunday morning. At least five people were injured in the crash, Italian news outlets reported. The accident occurred at around 8:30 a.m. on the busy Giudecca Canal as the ship rammed into the river boat. The cruise ship, called the MSC Opera, encountered a mechanical problem as it attempted to dock, ship owner MSC Cruises said. Davide Calderan, president of a Venice towboat association, told Italian news agency ANSA that ""two towboats tried to stop the giant and then a tow cable broke, cut by the collision with the river boat."" The accident sparked renewed calls to ban cruise ships in Venice, a source of frustration in the popular tourist city. The remains of a child found Friday in Arkansas have not yet been confirmed to be Maleah Davis, the Texas 4-year-old reported missing more than three weeks ago. An autopsy will determine the identity and cause of death, police said. “Do we believe that it’s possibly her? Yes. But can we confirm it right now? No,” Executive Assistant Police Chief Troy Finner said Friday. Authorities discovered the remains after a tip from local activist Quanell X, who said he spoke with Derion Vence, the ex-fiance of Maleah’s mother, Brittany Bowens, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a press conference. The U.S. Navy acknowledged Saturday that it received a request to shield a U.S. warship bearing the name of former political rival John McCain from Trump's view during the commander-in-chief's visit to Japan last week – but did not comply. The statement did not mention who made the request. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that White House officials wanted the destroyer to be kept ""out of sight"" during Trump's Japan visit, apparently fearful that the president would be upset at having to see the name of the late Arizona senator. Trump on Thursday said he had no knowledge of the request to keep the ship from view, saying, ""I would never do a thing like that."" Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden skipped this weekend’s California Democratic Primary, but he was hardly forgotten. The former vice president, who polls show with a solid lead in California, was the only top-tier White House hopeful to pass on the convention. That gave rivals an opportunity to throw jabs: Without naming him, Sen. Elizabeth Warren alluded in her speech to comments that Biden made last month in New Hampshire. “Some Democrats in Washington believe the only changes we can get are tweaks and nudges,’’ Warren said. “If they dream at all, they dream small."" Instead of California, Biden headed to Ohio to speak at an event on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.

(1:32) Dwyane Wade, reflecting on the challenges faced by the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a mass shooting took place last year, told the school's 2019 graduating class that ""I've never experienced anything to the magnitude that you guys just experienced."" Wade was a surprise speaker for the high school's graduation ceremonies Sunday. In his speech, he shared his perspective on his first visit to the Parkland, Florida, school in March 2018, three weeks after the shooting that killed 14 students and three staff members. ""I remember walking to the school, and I remember hearing absolutely nothing,"" Wade said. ""I remember thinking to myself, 'I've never heard this kind of silence before in my life.'"" Wade then related his surprise at the reaction he got from people at the school, saying they made him a part of the ""MSD family."" ""As I was walking in, students started seeing me, I remember seeing smiles, people running, pulling out their phones,"" Wade said. ""... I remember thinking, 'Wow.' It was packed. I didn't expect that."" Wade told graduates that it was understandable if they felt unsure about their futures. He said that in some ways, after 16 years in the NBA, he also was unsure exactly what his future entails. The now-retired Wade has been a regular supporter of the school ever since the shooting. He said he was honored that Joaquin Oliver, who was killed in the attack, was a huge fan of the former Miami Heat star and was buried wearing a Wade jersey. Wade closed his remarks by asking those in attendance to join him in a cheer that he used to spur on the Heat in the 2013 NBA Finals. The cheer was punctuated by the words ""to the last man, to the last minute, to the last second, we fight, we fight, we fight!"" Once he led the graduates and their guests in the cheer, he wrapped up his speech by again saying, ""MSD Strong"" -- the school's mantra since the tragedy.

110,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2839152-steve-kerr-wears-vote-for-our-lives-shirt-after-virginia-beach-shooting," Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has once again advocated for stricter gun control laws in the wake of the latest American mass shooting. Monte Poole of CSN Bay Area provided video of Kerr, who made remarks Sunday in response to a gunman killing 12 people in a Virginia Beach, Virginia, municipal center on Friday: Steve Kerr explains his ‘Vote for our lives.’ Felt appropriate in the wake of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach on Friday to display his desire for gun laws. https://t.co/dXEy6fI8gD Kerr's shirt, which read ""Vote for Our Lives,"" is a movement based on the student-led ""March for Our Lives"" demonstration that took place on March 24, 2018. March for Our Lives has now evolved into a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization whose stated mission is ""to harness the power of young people across the country to fight for sensible gun violence prevention policies that save lives."" Vote for Our Lives is the organization's effort to get people to register to vote and support politicians in favor of stricter gun control laws. The gun control debate is personal for Kerr: His father, Malcolm, was shot and killed in January 1984. Malcolm Kerr, who was the American University of Beirut president, was killed by members of the Islamic Jihad. Kerr has been a vocal gun-control advocate for years, notably speaking out after the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He's also praised students' efforts for stricter laws. Kerr, who made the comments prior to Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, is trying to lead his team to its fourth NBA championship in five years. Enjoy our content?

Cory Booker struggled for specifics during a Sunday morning “State of the Union” appearance when CNN anchor Jake Tapper pressed him on how his gun reform plan would have stopped the Friday’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. WATCH: “How would your plan have stopped this tragedy, if at all?” Tapper asked after noting that the Virginia Beach shooter’s handguns were purchased legally. Instead of answering the CNN anchor’s question directly, Booker pointed to the mass shootings that happen “in the aggregate” before calling the level of shootings a “uniquely American problem.” “I have a comprehensive plan that people say is bold,” Booker added. “But I’ll tell you what, it’s not bold. It’s common sense, evidence-based things we can do to lower gun violence. We are not helpless … ” “But you — you keep saying,” Tapper interrupted. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but you keep saying, ‘we’re not helpless.’ So I’m saying, what would have prevented this tragedy? I think that’s one of the issues that people wonder about when there are these horrible tragedies. What steps specifically would have stopped the massacre in Virginia Beach?” (RELATED: Democrats Politicize Virginia Beach Shooting To Push Gun Control, Second Amendment Supporters Push Back) Booker again dodged Tapper’s second attempt to frame the question specifically around Virginia Beach: You’ve taken a look at 16, 17 things we have in my plan that would drop the levels of violence overall, from one handgun a month laws, all the way to investing in the kind of mental health and the kind of community empowerment strategies that would do something about it. In the aggregate, we can do things that dramatically lower the levels of violence in our community. We’ve allowed this debate to be framed by the corporate gun lobby that has so eroded common sense, that even stopping the CDC having money to study this problem, from stopping consumer product safety commissions having the ability to regulate in this space. So, enough is enough. We can do so much more.

113,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/06/02/mass-shooting-survivors/,"Trending: CHICAGO — Pardeep Singh Kaleka has surveyed the landscape of an America scarred by mass shootings. Seven years ago, a white supremacist invaded a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and killed six worshippers — among them, Kaleka’s father. Now, whenever another gunman bloodies another town, Kaleka posts a supportive message on social media. Then, later, he may journey to the community to shore up others who share his pain. He’s been to Newtown, Conn. Charleston, S.C. Pittsburgh. “We’ve become kind of a family,” Kaleka said. It’s true. The unending litany of mass shootings in recent years — the latest, on Friday, leaving 12 dead in Virginia Beach, Va. — has built an unacknowledged community of heartbreak, touching and warping the lives of untold thousands. All the survivors, none of them unscathed. Loved ones of the living and dead. Their neighbors, relatives and colleagues. The first responders, the health care workers, the elected officials. The attacks have changed how America talks, prays and prepares for trouble. Today, the phrase “active shooter” needs no explanation. Schools hold “lockdown drills” to prepare students for the possibility of a shooter. Police and firefighters, tormented by memories of carnage they’ve witnessed, are treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Healing centers have opened. Support groups of survivors have formed. Mayors, doctors, police and other leaders who’ve endured these crises are paying it forward — offering mentoring and guidance to the next town that has to wrestle with the nightmare. Former Oak Creek Mayor Stephen Scaffidi remembers the night of the 2012 Sikh temple shooting, when he got a call from the mayor of Aurora, where 12 people had recently been killed at a movie theater. “He gave me the best advice … ‘Be calm. Reassure your community. And only speak to what you know,’ ” Scaffidi recalled. Last year, two days after the fatal shooting of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Christine Hunschofsky, mayor of Parkland, Fla., met the mother of a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “She said at first it will seem like everyone comes together,” the mayor recalled. “Then it seems like a tsunami that hits the community. People become very divided. This is all normal after a mass trauma.” Mass shootings account for a tiny percentage of homicides, but their scale sets them apart. In 1999, the Columbine shooting shocked the nation with its unforgettable images of teens running from the school with their hands up. Today, the public follows these unfolding events through live-streamed video or tweets. The National Center for PTSD estimates 28 percent of people who have witnessed a mass shooting develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and about a third develop acute stress disorder. April Foreman, a psychologist and board member of the American Association of Suicidology, likens exposure to mass shootings to a flu epidemic. “Some people might be immune or not susceptible to that strain,” she said. “Some people are going to get a little sick, some people are going to be very sick. … Suicide is like the extreme outcome.” Some first responders diagnosed with PTSD have turned to UCF RESTORES, a clinic at the University of Central Florida that helps military and civilian trauma victims. Deborah Beidel, the clinic’s director, says first responders from Parkland and Pulse face trauma similar to those in combat. About 50 of these workers have been treated, most in a three-week outpatient program that exposes them to the sounds, smells and sights they encountered during the event. Jimmy Reyes, a 35-year-old Orlando, Fla., firefighter, suffered panic attacks after Pulse. He was haunted by memories of that morning when he treated bloody, wounded people screaming in agony. As part of the program, he told his story over and over, recalling everything he saw, including one man who’d been shot in the head and another who asked, “Am I going to die?” At certain points, a therapist cued up sounds he’d heard — gunshots, sirens, an explosion. At first, he says, he cried. By the end of the sessions, he was dry-eyed and calm. Reyes is better now but he’s changed. “I felt like I was normal before Pulse,” he said. “I was a very happy guy. … Now I still deal with depression.” “June 11th, I was normal. Then June 12th happened. I’m a completely different person.” So is Las Vegas trauma surgeon Dave MacIntyre. In the chaos after the 2017 Route 91 concert shooting, his hospital treated more than 90 severely injured patients in 113 minutes. After 20 years, MacIntyre is now a part-time trauma surgeon looking to leave the operating room. He’s enrolled in an MBA program for doctors and plans on becoming a consultant to help hospitals deal with similar challenges. MacIntyre didn’t realize he had PTSD until a program coach noticed his anxiety, stress and short temper. “I find it very hard to talk to family members and give them bad news … much more so than before,” he said. Brian Murphy, a former Oak Creek police officer, says he didn’t have any psychological trauma after the Sikh temple shooting. He was shot 15 times throughout his body. One bullet remains lodged in his skull; another in his throat, giving him a permanent rasp. Medically retired, Murphy refuses to dwell on the past. “It’s not like I wake up and say, ‘I can’t believe this happened.’ It’s just life now. I don’t think there’s a tremendous amount of good that comes from looking behind.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2019-06-02 21:14:32,Mass shootings create rippling network of stricken survivors,,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

          / CBS News Twelve people were killed Friday in a mass shooting at the municipal center of Virginia Beach, Virginia, after a city employee opened fire in the building, authorities said. One survivor told NPR her co-worker and longtime friend tried to save others in the building — and ultimately lost his life because of his bravery. Christi Dewar, a public utilities employee for almost 13 years, said she thought it was a drill when a woman ran down an office hallway shouting ""active shooter."" Dewar said the shots initially sounded ""like a nail gun going off."" She didn't think a gunman was behind the noises because renovations were going on in the building. However, as the noises continued, Dewar and Ryan Keith Cox became alarmed. Dewar described Cox as one of her closest friends and a longtime colleague. Both began their government positions on the same day, had desks close to each other and clicked on a fundamental level, she said, according to the outlet. The co-workers began to move toward a staircase they believed to be away from the shooting noises when another co-worker ran by, telling them to go in the other direction. While Dewar said she thought the break room would be a safe place, Cox implored them to stay in an office room. ""He said, 'No, stay here, stay quiet,'"" Dewar recalled. ""I said, 'Come on,' and he said, 'I have to go check on the other ones.'"" He told Dewar and seven of their colleagues  to barricade themselves in the room, then left. The group blocked the door using a heavy cabinet and kept quiet as they hid behind furniture. ""Two bullets almost came through the back of the cabinet,"" Dewar recounted. ""We fell to the ground; then we heard other shots close to us,"" she said. ""That's when he got Keith."" After the sounds of bullets became harder to hear, Dewar called 911 — and police quickly arrived, she said. An officer held onto her hand as they walked down the steps and told her to ""not look down."" However, Dewar said she had a difficult time averting her eyes from what lay below her feet. ""As we went down the stairwell,"" Dewar told the outlet, ""I had to step over one of my friends."" ""I called him my big teddy bear,"" Dewar said of Cox. ""Every time I was upset, he would give me a hug. When I was upset about something, he knew exactly what to say to make you smile."" The heroic story echoes those of other victims in two recent mass shootings. Student Kendrick Castillo was the sole victim killed in the May shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado. He died trying to stop one of the armed suspects from firing, allowing his classmates to escape. He, along with several other students, helped prevent further violence. One of the two students killed in the University of North Carolina at Charlotte shooting in late April, Riley Howell, was also lauded as a hero for fighting the gunman. Officials said if it wasn't for his actions, the shooter may not have been disarmed. The Virginia Beach gunman, identified as city employee Dewayne Craddock, also wounded four people before he died after a long gunfight with police. Craddock gave his two weeks' notice from his government job just hours before the massacre, city officials said Sunday.  Eleven of the people killed were city employees, while one worked as a contractor at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center.

Trump visited the church on Sunday to pray for the community of Virginia Beach, which was recently rocked by a mass shooting that took place at a municipal building. McLean Bible Church’s pastor, David Platt, asked the congregation to “pray for our president,” and they did just that. “We pray that he would look to You, that he would trust in You, he would lean on You,” Platt prayed. “That he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice, and good for righteousness and good for equity, every good path.” Platt also covered other national leaders in prayer. “Please, oh God, give him wisdom and help him to lead our country alongside other leaders,” Platt said. “We pray today for leaders in Congress. We pray for leaders in courts. We pray for leaders in national and state levels. We know we need Your mercy. We need Your grace. We need Your help. We need Your wisdom in our country.” With a hand placed on Trump’s back, Platt sealed the prayer in Jesus’ name. “Help us to trust in Your Word. Help us to seek Your wisdom and live in ways that reflect Your love and Your grace– Your righteousness and Your justice. We pray for Your blessings on our president toward that end,” he prayed. “In Jesus name we pray, amen.” WATCH: Trump prays at the McLean Bible Church with Pastor David Platt in the wake of the Virginia Beach mass shooting pic.twitter.com/cpqs7efVYg — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) June 2, 2019 President Trump pops into church for prayer.

117,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602660758/0/phoenix/nation~Virginia-Beach-shooting-Cover-gunmen-but-donapost-turn-them-into-celebrity-role-models/,"Hours after Friday’s Virginia Beach rampage had ended, a swarm of reporters pressed police Chief James Cervera for details about the crime and the criminal. Cervera was prepared to shed light on the shooting but not shine a spotlight on the shooter. Before revealing the gunman’s identify, Cervera indicated that this would be the only time he would utter the name. Going forward, DeWayne Craddock, 40, would instead be known as the suspect. A near gag on a mass shooter’s identity has become in vogue as of late. Following the recent massacre at two New Zealand mosques, for example, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was praised for her firm decision not to speak the name of the person responsible for the unspeakable atrocity. But should the news media follow the lead of public officials here and abroad? Should journalists take the “No Notoriety” pledge as famously urged by CNN’s Anderson Cooper and supported by over 140 criminologists who signed an open letter to the media seeking a news blackout on the names and images of mass shooters? Read more commentary: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too. New law arming teachers might backfire — mass shooting victims have seen it happen Danger in overreacting to Santa Fe school shooting Although I appreciate the stated desire not to inspire copycats, I disagree with the strategy. That slope could hardly be any slippier. Are we not to repeat the names of other murderers, like James “Whitey” Bulger, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or Charles Manson? What about sex offenders whose names and faces appear on state-sponsored registries? If celebrating murderers is the concern, then perhaps the criticism should be directed more at criminal biopics with Hollywood stars like Zac Efron and Charlize Theron humanizing serial killers Ted Bundy and Aileen Wuornos on the screen. When it comes to mass shootings, it is the act, not the actor, that like-minded individuals applaud. For example, the 1999 Columbine massacre encouraged a number of copycats, but it was the carnage — not the assailants’ names and faces — that was so attractive and compelling to followers. Basic information about an assailant — name, image as well as such details as age and occupation — is news and should be reported.  However, sharing superfluous material about the gunman’s life, interests and personal biography can cross the line from news reporting to celebrity watch. Only then does an undeserving individual become a powerful role model. Some suggest that even basic information about a mass killer demonstrates the opportunity for some insignificant nobody to have a taste of fame. However, the cost of such a plan is unquestionably great. There are other ways to attract attention without risking life incarceration or death. The problem starts when potential copycats learn all about the killer’s personal misfortunes and disappointments in life. They can empathize with their hero’s situation and admire the subsequent act to get even with an employer, a particular racial or religious group, or society in general. It is not just the details about an assailant that can motivate others to commit similar crimes. The more we tell stories of suffering and bloodshed, the more we play into the minds and sentiments of the few misfits and malcontents who would see these tragedies as a positive — as a victory for the little guy. They watch the nonstop coverage of the horror while imagining what it would be like to be there, but of course from a position at the back end of the gun. The more we speak of record-breaking body counts, the more we incite others to become record-setters. The Virginia Beach authorities have appropriately tried to focus more on the victims than their assailant. Indeed, too much attention to the killer adds insult to injury — quite literally — in regard to the victims. City officials have shared photographs and biographical sketches on all 12 who were killed during the rampage. Likewise, the news media, especially television, should focus less on painful stories and images of chaos, and more on resilience. The message should be that the little guy did not win. In a broader sense, we should avoid the notion that America is awash with mass shootings. The epidemic is in terms of the fear, not the frequency. By promoting the idea that the country is besieged by mass shootings and that the public is vulnerable and scared, we embolden those who would seek to hurt society and inadvertently fuel the contagion.

121,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-shooting/police-search-for-reason-for-virginia-beach-mass-shooting-idUSKCN1T4132?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 3 Min Read (Reuters) - The 12 victims of Friday’s mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building included an engineer who had recently taken up the bagpipes, an account clerk with a beautiful singing voice and a Belarusian immigrant, according to friends and relatives. It remained unclear on Monday why the alleged gunman, DeWayne Craddock, opened fire at the resort city’s Department of Public Works, where he had worked for almost 15 years before handing in his resignation hours before the attack. He was fatally shot by a police officer. The shooting was the deadliest instance of U.S. gun violence since November, when a dozen people were slain at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who then killed himself. Among the victims who had most recently joined Public Works was Christopher Rapp, who was about to mark his first anniversary at the job. After moving to the Virginia Beach area, Rapp had nursed his love of Scottish music by joining the Tidewater Pipes & Drums. “He was quiet but had a passion for the pipes and Scottish culture,” the band said in a tribute posted on social media, which was accompanied by a photograph of Rapp smiling at Celtic festival in 2018 dressed in a tartan kilt. Related Coverage  Tara Welch Gallagher, who had been an engineer at Public Works for six years when she was killed, was remembered as someone who “always had kind words to say” to friends or strangers in a tribute posted on GoFundMe, where supporters are raising funds for her 21-month-old son. Alex Gusev, a right-of-way agent, emigrated from Belarus in 2003 to get a degree in civil engineering before joining Public Works nine years ago, according to a profile by the Virginian-Pilot. He enjoyed playing basketball and soccer with neighbors who had also emigrated from Eastern Europe, a friend told the newspaper. Katherine Nixon, who had worked at the department as an engineer for a decade, was a mother of three young girls. Ryan Keith Cox, an account clerk with the city’s Public Utilities Department for more than 12 years, came from a devout Christian family. “I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore,” his brother, Ervin, wrote on Facebook. Four other people hurt in the shooting remained in critical condition at local hospitals after surgery as of Sunday afternoon, according to a spokesman for the hospitals. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera described Craddock as “disgruntled,” but declined to say more about what may have precipitated the attack. He was an employee in good standing before handing in his resignation, officials said. An impromptu memorial set up at the municipal center was visited by well-wishers on Sunday, and media images show family and friends holding hands and lighted candles at multiple churches.

Good morning, We’ve published a major investigation of the transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her family’s company in China. We’re also covering President Trump’s state visit to Britain and the latest from last week’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, has improved the profile of Foremost Group, her family’s shipping firm, which has deep ties to the economic and political elite in China. A Times investigation found that Ms. Chao has repeatedly used her connections and status in China to help Foremost, which benefits from industrial policies in Beijing that are at the heart of diplomatic tensions with Washington. Ms. Chao has no stake in Foremost, but she and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have received millions of dollars in gifts from her father, James, who ran the company until last year. Read the takeaways from our investigation. Response: Ms. Chao declined to be interviewed, but in a written statement she affirmed her family’s commitment to the U.S. A Transportation Department spokesman said there was no link between Ms. Chao’s actions as secretary and her family’s business interests in China. Background: The editors who lead our investigations team answered questions about how The Times decides which projects to pursue. Mr. Trump landed in Britain this morning for a three-day visit, including a state banquet tonight at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II and a meeting on Tuesday with Prime Minister Theresa May, who is set to step down as the leader of her party this week. The president will also attend commemorations of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. Here are the latest updates. In a country already roiled by Brexit, Mr. Trump’s penchant for uncensored opinions is likely to capture headlines. (This morning, he called London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, a “stone cold loser.”) Related: In an interview published before his arrival, Mr. Trump said that Britain’s next leader should “walk away” from withdrawal negotiations with the European Union to extract a better deal. He also said Boris Johnson, the pro-Brexit former foreign secretary, would be a good candidate to succeed Mrs. May as prime minister. Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, is almost unknown to the American public, but he controls sovereign wealth funds worth $1.3 trillion and is among the most influential foreign voices in Washington. Prince Mohammed has urged the U.S. to adopt his increasingly aggressive approach toward the Middle East, particularly his two enemies, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. And he appears to have found a willing audience in President Trump, who has repeatedly supported the prince’s positions, even over the reservations of U.S. officials. Here are five takeaways from our report. Another angle: The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election unearthed evidence that Prince Mohammed had tried to help Russia open back channels to Mr. Trump’s team. At least five people working for the prince have been caught up in criminal investigations growing out of that inquiry. With growing political pressure for scrutiny of tech giants, two federal agencies that handle antitrust matters have split up oversight of Google and Amazon, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The Justice Department is taking Google, and the Federal Trade Commission is taking Amazon. That doesn’t mean the agencies have opened investigations, the people said. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, as did Alphabet, Google’s parent. Yesterday: Gmail, YouTube and other services that rely on Google’s technology were disrupted for several hours by what the company said were “high levels of network congestion.” Trump Tower Punta del Este — a 25-story condominium with an indoor tennis court and a helipad — was one of the Trump family’s most ambitious development projects. But it has fallen behind schedule, the Miami-based broker selling the condos is suing the local developer, and some buyers are selling their units. The problems in Uruguay are a microcosm of the challenges facing the Trump Organization as it stakes its future on projects outside the U.S. White House economist’s departure: The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, will depart “shortly,” President Trump said on Sunday. Virginia Beach rampage: The employee who killed 12 people at a city government building before dying in a shootout with the police last week had submitted his resignation hours earlier, the authorities have said. Read more about the victims. Killings in Canada: A national inquiry into the widespread killings and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls equates the violence with genocide, according to a long-anticipated report to be released today. Violence in Sudan: Security forces opened fire today on pro-democracy protesters in the country’s capital, Khartoum, killing several people, according to a doctors’ association and local news media reports. North Korean official resurfaces: Kim Yong-chol, a former spymaster, was reportedly seen over the weekend with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, despite reports that he had been banished to a labor camp. Climbers are feared dead: Eight mountain climbers missing for more than a week in the Himalayas appear to have died in an avalanche, officials in India said today. “The Weekly”: A new half-hour TV show from The Times brings you one big story every week.

And our writer offers a whimsical solution to the challenging social condition of forgetting someone’s name. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting. It’s a time of celebration, with rich desserts, gifts and gatherings. This year, it may come on Tuesday. But there’s no guarantee. Islam operates on a lunar calendar, and the official celebration of Eid is the sighting of the first crescent of the full moon. Cloudy weather could prevent the sighting. Since there is no central Islamic authority, Eid can arrive on different days in different places. In the U.S., according to calculations by Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the new moon will be visible on Tuesday. The United Arab Emirates formed a committee with the job of spotting the new moon cycle tonight. If the panel doesn’t see anything, Ramadan will last another day, and Eid will take place on Wednesday there. In any case, “Eid Mubarak” (“Have a blessed holiday”) to those who celebrate.

News By Lee Brown Submit June 3, 2019 | 8:29am				| Updated June 3, 2019 | 10:14am A Virginia Beach city worker was confronted by gunman DeWayne Craddock three heart-stopping times during the workplace slaughter — but was spared each time. Ned Carlstrom said he assumed it was an active-shooter drill when he first came face to face with his co-worker carrying an “obnoxious-looking gun” during Craddock’s slaughter of 12 people on Friday. “He had the gun down at his side. He was so close to me, he swung his arm out, he damn near hit me with the gun. That’s how close we were,” Carlstrom recalled Sunday of their first encounter in a stairwell. “But he never raised the gun at me. He looked up at me briefly.” Carlstrom, who works in the billing section of the city water department, still assumed civil engineer Craddock, 40, was acting out a drill for the municipal building. “By the way he walked past me, he barely gave me a glance and never broke stride,” he said. “I either thought he was playing the part of the bad guy or playing the part of someone pursuing a bad guy.” Five minutes into the massacre, the killer walked into a room Carlstrom was in — sparing him and his colleague Terry Inman, who had yelled, “DeWayne, stop!” “He turned and looked straight at me, but he didn’t see me,” recalled account clerk Inman, 61. “He looked straight in my face and he did not see me standing there because he didn’t raise the gun. “To me, that was the Holy Spirit inflecting something on that man to the point where he didn’t see Terry Inman standing there.” Carlstrom, of Chesapeake, dodged death a third time when Craddock came right up to the window of an office he was hiding in a little while later. “We had the door locked, but he could have punched through it or shot through it,” Carlstrom said. Carlstrom never saw Craddock fire his guns — but heard numerous shots fired, including the one he assumed killed his friend Ryan Keith Cox, who he said was trying to get co-workers to safety when he was killed. He only realized the full extent of the carnage when he was finally led to safety. “That’s when I had to step over the body of one of my co-workers in the stairwell,” he said. “I don’t think it will (sink in) until we go back to work and we don’t have these people anymore.” Police Chief Jim Cervera has insisted that Craddock — who had quit his job hours before the mass shooting — was not known to have been “targeting anyone specifically.” Carlstrom is also at a loss as to why he was repeatedly spared by the man he only knew from light-hearted conversations in the parking lot. “I guess it’s a feeling of being fortunate,” Carlstrom said of his emotions. His colleague Inman was also stunned that Craddock would carry out such carnage. “It’s so cotton-picking cliche you almost hate to say it, but he has always been rock-solid kind of positive guy. He always had a smile on his face,” Inman said. “Nothing in (his) character would cause you to think, ‘This guy is going to come in and kill 11 of my colleagues … 12 people that work in the same building.’” With Post wires Read Next Pilots find 5 bodies while searching for missing Himalayas...

127,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/03/virginia-beach-shooting-gunman-victims-vigil,"Municipal center employees mourn at makeshift memorial and hundreds gathered last night at a church to remember the dead First published on Mon 3 Jun 2019 13.21 BST In Virginia Beach on Monday, signs of a shooting that killed 12 people on Friday could still be seen at a complex of government buildings as authorities search for a motive.  At one entrance to the municipal center, a makeshift memorial was made up of bouquets, flags, teddy bears and crosses bearing the names of the dead. A small group of city employees cried and hugged each other as they left flowers by one of the crosses. Volunteers with comfort dogs were on hand. A section of the compound was still blocked off by law enforcement vehicles and FBI personnel could be seen walking around. On Sunday night, hundreds gathered to remember the dead. City and state officials were among the mourners at Piney Grove Baptist church. Rabbi Israel Zoberman of Virginia Beach was among the speakers. A son of Holocaust survivors who escaped Poland in the second world war, he said the city had “lost its beautiful but also blinding innocence”. The vigil closed with the lighting of 12 candles alongside a framed photograph of each victim. A woman read each name aloud as she lit the candles. Four people were severely wounded in the shooting. Police have sought not to add to speculation over why the 40-year-old gunman, DeWayne Craddock, acted as he did. Police have not announced that he left any note, internet message or manifesto. Police said he had no specific target, shooting indiscriminately, including a first victim in a vehicle in the parking lot. He was shot and fatally wounded by police after a gun battle in the halls of the 1970s-era municipal building, having at one time shot through a closed door and wall. Virginia Beach’s police chief, James Cervera, described the gunman as “disgruntled” but declined to say more about what may have precipitated the attack. The gunman was employed by the city as an engineer. He declared his intention to quit by email in the morning and started shooting at his workplace of almost 15 years that afternoon, about 4pm. His bosses said he was an employee in good standing with no disciplinary actions pending and was not going to be fired. “To the extent that the subject’s employment status has anything do with these events, that will be part of the ongoing investigation,” the Virginia Beach city manager, Dave Hansen, told reporters. On Monday the city communications director, Julie Hill, said the email was brief, unremarkable and did not contain anything that foreshadowed what happened next. The resignation letter, Hill added, is now part of the investigative file and must be cleared by detectives for public release. The gunman’s parents posted a handwritten note on the front door of their home in Yorktown, Virginia, expressing sorrow and prayers for the victims. The shooting was the deadliest instance of US gun violence since November, when a dozen people were killed at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who killed himself. The Virginia Pilot reported that Greg Zanis, from a group called Crosses for Losses, drove to Virginia Beach from Chicago to deliver a dozen white wooden crosses, one each for the victims. In February, Zanis delivered five crosses to a workplace in his hometown, Aurora, Illinois, after a shooting there.",2019-06-03 08:21:20,Virginia Beach shooting: mourners gather to remember victims at vigil,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

6.3.2019 9:35 AM Can ""the sound of gunfire…save lives""? A civil engineer for the Virginia Beach government opened fire on his co-workers last Friday, fatally shooting 12 people and wounding others. The shooter, 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, reportedly resigned from his job with the city's utilities department via an email sent just hours before the attack. On Friday afternoon, Craddock opened fire in a city office building and wound up in what local Police Chief James Cervera described as ""a long gun battle"" with police officers. Craddock himself was shot—possibly by his own hand, possibly by a cop—and taken to the hospital, where he soon died. Authorities said they do not have any clue as to Craddock's motive and that there was no pattern to whom he targeted. One co-worker said Craddock passed him three times and spared him each time. His victims included a contractor who was dropping by the building and an array of city employees, including several staffers on the administrative side, four civil engineers, and three property-line review agents. Craddock used two .45 caliber pistols, which he purchased legally in 2016 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Because there was no ""assault weapon,"" just common handguns, and no whiff of trickery or malfeasance in how Craddock obtained them, those who jump on senseless violence to advocate gun control have seized on the fact that he had fitted his guns with a sound-suppression mechanism (a.k.a. a ""silencer""). ""The sound of gunfire can save lives,"" Hillary Clinton tweeted Sunday, sharing a Washington Post op-ed that calls for a ban on such devices. The Post piece, by former Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem, points out that ""suppressors are legal in 42 states, though they are regulated under the National Firearms Act and therefore are treated like other specialty gun accessories, including requiring a background check and a $200 tax."" Kayyem continues: Recently, making suppressors more easily accessible has become a focal point of gun rights activists who want to increase dwindling gun sales and hunting groups who argue that suppressors are actually a health necessity in that they reduce hearing loss. As recently as June 2017, the then-Republican-majority House was considering a law to make the regulation of suppressors less onerous. You know, for the sake of the auditory sensitivities of shooters. One mass shooting with a suppressor does not make a trend, nor does it require us to alter how we train for or respond to them. But, it does mean we must continue to vigorously regulate and even eventually ban these devices as essential steps in adopting common-sense gun-control measures. Many on the left and in media are using the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump for everything from playing golf the morning of the Virginia Beach shooting to not making a long enough statement about it to wearing golf attire while doing so. After playing golf this morning, @realDonaldTrump stopped off at a Virginia church to offer his ""thoughts and prayers"" for the victims of the Virginia Beach shooting. He spent 16 minutes there. His speech at the NRA convention in April lasted almost an hour. Any questions? — Andrew Weinstein (@Weinsteinlaw) June 2, 2019  The border authorities want info about visitors' digital footprints. ""The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers,"" reports NBC. ""It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors."" It's also incredibly stupid. Those whose extremist content could get them excluded from entry will surely just leave out those accounts on their application. Meanwhile, the American authorities will waste massive amounts of time and resources combing through perfectly benign Twitter feeds and Facebook pages, not to mention subjecting visitors to probing questions about their emoji use, sarcastic comments, and article shares. Before this, social media and phone number searches were only done on visa applicants who triggered an extra level of scrutiny. That was about 65,000 applicants per year, reports NBC. Under the new rules, about 15 million applicants will be affected. A draft spending bill released by congressional Democrats on Sunday would encourage U.S. banks to work with marijuana businesses. It would also allow a more permissive marijuana legalization scheme in the District of Columbia. Currently, recreational marijuana growth, possession, and gifting have been decriminalized in D.C., but the drug can't be sold there legally. Financial institutions across the U.S. are still often reluctant to do business with cannabis operations in states where recreational sales are legal, since the drug remains outlawed at the federal level. The new federal spending bill, which heads to a subcommittee on Monday morning, states that none of the funds made available in this Act may be used to penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, a producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling marijuana, marijuana products, or marijuana proceeds, and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian Tribe: Provided, That the term ""State"" means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States.

Report: Nearly 90 Percent of Illegals Fail to Show Up for Court Hearings Since December 21, 2018, DHS  has released at least 190,500 border crossers and illegal aliens into the interior of the United States. Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan  told Congress this month that those foreign nationals are eventually given work permits that allow them to take U.S. jobs while awaiting their asylum hearings. In testimony before Congress this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials said that the agency had recently conducted a pilot program with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to test how many recent illegal aliens would show up to their asylum hearings after being released into the U.S. The results, an ICE official told Congress, were that about 87 percent of illegal aliens, or almost 9-in-10, recently released by DHS into the U.S. did not show up to their asylum hearings. With illegal aliens not showing up to their scheduled hearings, the ICE official said, the agency is then forced to grapple with attempting to locate and deport each illegal alien, an almost impossible task that strains federal resources. So, none of the illegals show up at their hearings. But if the feds lock them up to ensure they do, the wokeltarians at reason scream bloody murder. If the feds just deport them, the wokeltarians scream bloody muder as well. But they all assure me that no one actually supports completely open borders. They just support policies that result in that which is totally different than supporting fully open borders because REASONS!! Yeah! Lock the refugees and poor migrants up because they have been summoned by the man! That’s democracy! Hello. People who ignore proper legal procedures will ignore legal procedures when they get the opportunity.  How surprising. I saw that article yesterday. reason never does articles on this aspect of immigration. I guess once Trump and the US government concedes to give these lying illegals and their shitbag attorneys the ability for bogus asylum hearings, it’s fuck the USA and its laws. But if we only had their Facebook IDs… Face recognition, anyone? Too bad there’s no link to the actual report. A civil engineer for the Virginia Beach government opened fire on his co-workers last Friday, fatally shooting 12 people and wounding others. The standard narrative didn’t fit here, it seems. Guns don’t kill people.  Silencers kill people. definitely engineers too … Well, university engineering departments are some of the last bastions of moderate politics on campus.  Obviously, engineers need to be Woken.  Or shamed. Liberals, and probably Jeff, think silencers actually make guns silent and not still louder than a Jack hammer. That’s the funny part. They think it’s a magical device where just a tiny pew pew sound is heard. They accept the Hollywood version as fact. That is the extent of what they know about them; reducing noise levels to less than 90 dcbl [the average motor cycle] does not make it “quiet.”  But they’ve surely watched movies like “Tears of the Sun” where SPEC-OPS goes into a village and pops off round after round that doesn’t even make the noise of a bolt cycling. Municipal Employees kill people. only one gun had a silencer The female gun right? Civil engineer? Shooting one’s colleagues isn’t very civil. “What’s so civil ’bout war anyway?” – Guns N Roses Toxic whiteness. So … it appears that Facebook helped the reporter who wrote this story identify the person behind the doctored video of Nancy Pelosi — i.e., Facebook used its own internal data to help publicly identify a private citizen. Facebook Handed Over Private Data To A Convicted Hacker, Who Used It To Dox A Private Citizen Facebook has thus far not commented to Big League Politics regarding the assistance they provided Daily Beast journalist and former convicted hacker Kevin Poulsen in doxxing the formerly private citizen who shared the viral meme of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appearing to speak even less clearly than usual. Twitter Bans Analyst Who Revealed AntiFa Connections With Journalists. Former teacher and analyst Eoin Lenihan has been banned from Twitter after revealing major links between so-called “anti-extremism” campaigners and the hard-left AntiFa group. Lenihan published his findings in Quillette, revealing links between journalists who write for the the Guardian newspaper, HuffPost, Al Jazeera, and various other publications to the hard left group. Lenihan was suspended early Wednesday morning, prompting speculation about the ban. Andy Ngo, a Wall Street Journal contributor and editor at Quillette, alleges that Lenihan was suspended following mass reports by members of AntiFa on Twitter. So Twitter bans a guy who does actual journalism, because “journalists” are already compromised by acting as pro bono propogandists. Nuke social media today. Reason will never be accused of doing journalism. +10 And no one will ever accuse the two of you of having functional brains. reason troll. Making fun of a powerful Democrat elected official is a serious offense that undermines our democracy. That seems to be the actual justification for the minor moral panic in the media about the “doctored” video. Since when did slowing down a video become doctored?  I listened to her press conference live, I texted my buddy saying she was wasted. Didnt need the video slow down. But they have their narrative now. They accused trump of tweeting doctored videos even though his was not doctored. Just like the PP videos. Liberals are intentionally ignorant. The propagandists went into overdrive with Hillary’s “being thrown like a bag of potatoes incident” to cover that up, as NO medical problem, no siree. Same shit here. Pelosi is old as fuck and likely has medical problems just like all old people. She was drunk or had some medical thing and it would be fine if they just admitted that. The propagandists will cover for her as they always do. New York times just doxxed some Honduran nationals who were trying to fight the MS-13 gangs in the central American areas. Family members, names, addresses, everything. Hope MS-13 doesnt have a times account. It seems to me that MS13 has “friends” in high places. A new paper posits a link between cell phone usage and declining crime. if these people are using their phones in public we should arrest them for being annoying then We must make new crimes to make up the gap. Fox News schlock jock Tucker Carlson that’s shlock jock warrior to you, or SJW for short The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers… usa_iz_gr8@aol.com @longliveAmerica_69 555-1776 No area code? http://dailycaller.com/2019/06/02/daily-beast-backlash-doxxing-black-forklift-operator/ The Daily Beast took a fair amount of heat over the weekend after doxxing a black forklift operator from New York over the fake “drunk Pelosi” video that circulated on social media. The article, written by Kevin Poulsen, claimed to reveal the identity of the man who doctored the video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and was published on Saturday. (RELATED: Liberals Pounce After Facebook Execs Explain Why Doctored Pelosi Video Is Staying Up) They doxxed the guy for sharing a video and made a big deal that he has served time in jail. The “reporter” who did this great deed is a convicted federal felon who was a black hat hacker and theif. But they go after some forklift operator for the sin of sharing a video they didn’t like. The media is the enemy of the people. They are just disgusting garbage. “black forklift operator” He apparently served time and now he has a job other than being a gang member, professional vote fraudster, or bomb making activist. Definitely not the Democrats’ kind of guy Cannot have one of the plebs humiliating the one of the honored patrician class.  If it was a Tea Party Republican, it would be one thing, they are no better than the rabble themselves, but a female Democrat Speaker? The social order cannot stand for that! Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) continues his crusade to nationalize social media. That R must be a misprint. They left off “INO”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman A funny straw man argument to avoid the truth. You tell a lot from what people say and do. I can link the GOP platform for you. If you are not following the GOP platform, you might called a RINO. Google, like the social media giants, is poised to lose from the anti-tech fervor  in Congress. not before at the last minute they offer to help write the regulations that will crush other companies and oh hey, look here, there’s some campaign money freed up or jobs in your district Google, like the social media giants, is poised to lose from the anti-tech fervor  in Congress. They can take the hit. http://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-beheading-scandinavian-hiker Moroccan admits beheading Scandinavian hiker but says he now regrets it. Sounds like a future dreamer to me. Get Dalmia to do a cover story on this guy and his future contribution to America. I bet he wants to start a food truck. “In hindsight, maybe it was….overkill.” “Maybe this is not the best way to enrich lives through diversity.” “Maybe I should have just robbed and raped her and started a food truck.” “I guess I just lost my head”. It is just with that son of a bitch Trump in the White House. Mistakes were made. It’s true.  We should hold entire nationalities accountable for individual actions.  It’s the rational, libertarian thing to do. Yes, because some people are good, that means we should let everyone in. That is what open borders means and that is your position. This guy when he gets out of prison, and he will, should be able to come to the US if he wants to. Punishment should be forever. What is the recidivism rate of beheaders? I don’t know, but if it’s bad I’m sure it’s due to them not being allowed to migrate here Come on Lap, he said he regretted it. Things got a little out of hand. What do you want from the guy? You joke about the wokeltarian position on borders but it is not a joke. Whatever crazy shit you can dream up, no matter how crazy, they actually believe it. Fool me once, shame on you… SparkY looks at keeping non-Americans out of America as punishment. Hahaha. Why do you insist on advertising your stupidity? ^Check out the big brain on bread! “$park¥ is the Worst June.3.2019 at 10:19 am Punishment should be forever” Explains why you think you need to keep posting. Punishment should not be forever, only until his execution for this guy. If you go by your logic, then we as Americans should have no rights because some have abused their rights.  It’s the same argument for gun control, which is quite comical.  I’d prefer to treat everyone as individuals good or bad. I’ve never said that we should let everyone in.  In fact, I’ve stated my position is that we should open up the visa system (or something similar) such that we can screen people based on any criminal records in their home countries.  So people who want to come here and live or work peacefully don’t have to sneak in, thus freeing up the border patrol to go after actual “bad hombres.” We get it Leo, its Capital punishment to keep illegals out of the USA. Yep, that’s exactly what my post said. It was pretty clear to others too. I’ve never said that we should let everyone in. In fact, I’ve stated my position is that we should open up the visa system (or something similar) such that we can screen people based on any criminal records in their home countries. Sure you never said that. That is because you are a dishonest coward. You never say you support letting everyone in. But you oppose any policy that is required to prevent that from happening knowing full well the results of that while still claiming not to be for completely open borders. But you oppose any policy that is required to prevent that from happening knowing full well the results of that while still claiming not to be for completely open borders. I stated a policy that I think would let that happen.  Maybe we could discuss that policy? I’m also not naive enough to think that the war on immigration will be any different than the war on drugs, prohibition, war on poverty, war on prostitution, war on gambling, war on guns, or any of the other times that government thinks it can prevent human behavior when it basically never can. Your side likes to make the point that these people are breaking the law.  True.  So what additional laws should we pass that you think they’ll follow?  The corollary to gun control is so stark that it’s comical to me that both liberals and conservatives insist on one side, but always fail to see the other.  Our current laws fail, we just need this one more law.  Then when it fails… just one more law from now until the end of time. We don’t need more immigration laws. We need to simple enforce the ones we have. Unlike the War on Drugs, nobody is looking to steal property in asset forfeiture or lock people up for prison sentences. Illegals need to all be deported, either via forced deport or self-deport. Then Americans can decide who and how many non-Americans we want in the USA and for what reasons. Poor Leo. Having a rough time of it. First he learns that some rights are created by the US Constitution and now this. First he learns that some rights are created by the US Constitution. Thomas Jefferson is calling… Unlike the War on Drugs, nobody is looking to steal property in asset forfeiture or lock people up for prison sentences. Nah, they’ll steal the property through eminent domain.  Walls gotta be built!  And the locking up has already been pretty well documented. “Thomas Jefferson is calling…” So, in lieu of an argument about a subject you clearly have no knowledge of, you decided behaving like a 10 year old child would suffice. you decided behaving like a 10 year old child would suffice. You’re not from around here are you. “We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…” Leo, you are free to have the Constitution changed to repeal eminent domain for public use with just compensation. Since you dont have the support and the idea of absolute property rights outside of Anarchy-Land is not popular, I doubt you can get 3/4 of states to ratify it. “If you go by your logic, then we as Americans” Oh, you’ve already failed. Poor Leo cannot honestly admit that in some nations, in fact most of the World, life is cheap. We hold people accountable for murder in the USA and want our new immigrants to assimilate to our Rule of Law. No. Everyone in the world is just like him. Every person in the world has an innter libertarian just dying to get out. Didn’t you know that? No.  I’ve come to accept that not everyone has to be like me in order to have rights. I mean it says right there in the Constitution Preamble what non-Americans get: We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America World. How surprising that lovescontroll69 believes that rights are granted by the Constitution. Some rights ARE granted by the constitution. Figures that SparkY does not know shit from shine-ola. I will let YOU look up which rights are created and guaranteed by the US Constitution. I can help you if ask real nice like. Some rights ARE granted by the constitution. And this is precisely why we generally question your libertarian credibility.  Only a statist believes that rights can come from the government.  Guaranteed yes, created, no. The Constitution is a contract, so your libertarian cred is in jeopardy more than his. Poor Leo. He thinks that I care if questions my street cred. The right to jury is, of course, a Natural Right and just needed to be guaranteed. The right to non-excessive bail was not created as a right for Americans by the US Constitution. It was simply “guaranteed” and poof! Leo, its really like you have a 20 year old Anarchist and a 5 year old running your account. Its hilarious though. Hold accountable?  How about first just recognizing illegal immigrants are violating laws. So are drug users, owners of certain types of guns, plus just about everyone if you subscribe by the “Three Felonies a Day” premise. Not when they became citizens. Not sure what is difficult here. We hold citizens accountable. We contract with the rest of the world the terms to legally migrate. Again.. how about recognizing the laws we have. This is why there cant be an honest discussion. By the way leo… surveys of some of these countries shown almost 1/5th support the Muslim based terrorism. So how about we do some vetting and not be open borders huh? It’s almost like…lottery based and non-merit based immigration systems don’t work…whoa We should hold entire nationalities accountable for individual actions. It’s the rational, libertarian thing to do. Instead we should evaluate entire nationalities positively based on individual actions. OR we could evaluate individuals based on individual actions.  You know, pretty much the basis of modern libertarian theory. Yet you are advocating not evaluating anybody worth your open borders stances. The real lesson here?  Westerners need to stop fucking backpacking in these goddamned areas.  Stop it.  Stop it now. Mexico City is decriminalizing prostitution. Bribe-taking police hardest hit. up-and-up policia exist? Yup, now the police actually have to pay Bake the cake.  Also, anyone who says Single Payer won’t force doctors to comply is a liar. Liberals sue so they can make doctors violate their religious beliefs on transgenderism The same thing is happening here predictably, as if following the progressive formula of maximum societal infiltration: Now doctors must provide care, even if it violates their religious beliefs, and even if they don’t believe it’s medically sound. This is not only malpractice and inhumane but indicative that the transgender lobby doesn’t just equality, they want entitlement. They want to force their beliefs on another group until that group relents, which is far more unconstitutional than refusing to provide care for legitimate reasons. <a href=""https://americanpowerblog.blogspot.com/2019/06/woke-los-angeles-is-new-typhus-hotbed.html""Woke Los Angeles is the New Typhus Hotbed: Homeless Catastrophe Makes City of Angels Unlivable (VIDEO) Bubonic Plague ‘Likely’ Already Present In Los Angeles, Dr. Drew Says “We have a complete breakdown of the basic needs of civilization in Los Angeles right now,” Pinsky told Fox New host Laura Ingraham. “We have the three prongs of airborne disease, tuberculosis is exploding, rodent-borne. We are one of the only cities in the country that doesn’t have a rodent control program, and sanitation has broken down.” Pinsky said bubonic plague — also known as the “Black Death,” a pandemic that killed off millions in the 14th century — is “likely” already present in Los Angeles. The plague is spread by infected fleas and exposure to bodily fluids from a dead plague-infected animal, with the bacteria entering through the skin and traveling to lymph nodes. Typhus, which broke out in the city last year, will likely return, Pinsky said. Already, a Los Angeles police officer has contracted typhoid fever, which infects fewer than 350 Americans each year. The various types of typhus are caused by a bacterial infection and spread by body lice, chiggers or fleas. In the 1600s, the disease decimated Germany. But muh vaccines… Hospital shortages a death sentence for Venezuelan children Look Johnny just tell the lie and be polite. The reasonites assure me that lying to please the mob is the only rational option. Paging OBL to praise the fact that a responsible socialist outsider will have the leverage to control Trump: China aims to disrupt America’s ability to make its own medicine It is the free market Johnny. If China destroys the US’s ability to make its own medicine and then uses that leverage to harm the US, well the US had it coming because it is what the market decrees. It sounds like Johnny and Johnny have given up on MAGA. Sounds like you don’t realy understand what is going on here. Gibson pointed to the recall of blood pressure medication that affected millions of Americans. She said the Federal Drug Administration found that the Chinese medication had an excess amount of carcinogen-tainted ingredients. Yeah.  There obviously aren’t any US based drug manufacturers capable of making shitty drugs. No one is saying otherwise. This seems to be a debate going on entirely in your head. Sorry, I thought you read the linked article.  I know that’s a bad assumption. How cute. Sparky is fucking ignorant. Ho read up on the costs to start up a us based generic drug factory due to regulations. But keep blaming capitalism. Drug shortages happen due to the government. And that’s China’s fault, apparently. Dumping cheap drugs subsidized by their government in order to kill local industry is. It’s like Sparky wans people to know his parents are brother and sister Does religion say anything on transgenderism?  I know medical science does, but religion?

And make no mistake, Mexico is a hostile foreign power” Someone’s lawn care hasn’t been up to snuff. Mexico refuses to do their duty under international law to control its borders and ajudicate asylum seekers’ claims on their soil. Instead, they are not only ushering such people through their country and dumping them on the US, they are encouraging people to come and do so. That is a hostile act. And yes, Mexico is a hostile country. It is not an act of war but it is absolutely an act of hostile and not something an ally or any respectable member of the international community would do. Funny how Old Mexican and the rest of the Wokeltarians on here never say a single fucking work about Mexico’s refusal to even adjudicate these people’s claims of asylym. Nope. Mexicans are sacred and special and don’t have to do the things filthy Americans are expected to do. We hear a lot about how people (children) die in U.S. custody but fail to mention many more are saved. I was listening to a border agent spokesperson give an update rattling off numbers, and that one jumped out at me. Reason’s position on this is confused if not just plain immature in my opinion. Reminds me of how we used to argue in high school, ‘yeh bro’ /passes joint ‘it’s not cool man. They system, is like, fucked man’. I keep waiting for a really good in-depth article on it respectful of Reason’s stature but none has been forthcoming. Sorta like how they refuse to interview Peterson. I really would like to see Nick interview him. I would love to see Nick interview him. +100 He doesn’t want to get skinned. Southern Arizona has lost virtually all of its trauma one care centers due to emergency care of illegal immigrants. The federal government doesnt pay the costs, but the hospitals are controlled by EMTALA.  Reason has never broached this subject. There is even a group that will get crossers who are unhealthy, have them cross in, then phone in for emergency services once across. Of course this harms American citizens in rural areas of southern Arizona, but they aren’t a favored populace for compassion. And this is stuff Reason should be covering. Not this idiotic TDS rubbish they seem to willingly engage in. Maybe it’s ‘too local’ or something. I notice that Arizona is under attack by Lefties trying to get rid of outstanding gun protections and illegals swamping services. “Fox News schlock jock Tucker Carlson calls Mexico a ‘hostile foreign power'” LOL The hostile foreign power all patriotic Americans should fear is not Mexico, but Russia.  It wasn’t Mexico that hacked our election and installed one of its intelligence assets as President. #TrumpRussia #LibertariansForGettingToughWithRussia And Iran has Nukes! #LibertariansForWar #IStandWithBolton A new paper posits a link between cell phone usage and declining crime.

No country in the world meets the mark on gender equality, but these are the best performers The US is in an atrocious, but not surprising, 28th place.  What do you expect when a theocratic extremist President is literally trying to turn us into The Handmaid’s Tale? #LibertariansForGenderQuotas Not just The Handmaid’s Tale…it’s a Nazi Handmaid’s Tale! “The sound of gunfire can save lives,” Hillary Clinton tweeted Sunday, Like the time she was ducking and running from gunfire? “Craddock used two .45 caliber pistols, which he purchased legally in 2016 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.” I know some of you are extremely well read on Second Amendment issues, and I’d really appreciate some edification on the following apparent contradiction: On the one had, I’ve been repeatedly assured that the government doesn’t keep records of gun sales that survive background checks–because that’s supposedly illegal. On the other hand, every time there’s a mass shooting, whether the mass shooter legally obtained the guns used in the shooting seems to be confirmed by the government within hours of the shooting. Somebody must be keeping a database of this information somewhere.  It  isn’t just springing into existence from the government Ex nihilo.  Shouldn’t this be as big of a deal to my fellow libertarians as the NSA tracking our phone calls? The federal government is prohibited by law from keeping any private register of ordinary firearms – rifles, pistols and shotguns. But firearms manufacturers and dealers are required to keep a register of their transactions at their premises. When this incident happened, the two pistols were recovered a scene.  The government initiated a trace, which most likely went like this: Pistols were made by manufacturer A with Serial Numbers 1 and 2. Upon being called by the ATF, mfr A looks up their records and says that they shipped to distributor B. Distributor B looks up their records and says that they shipped to local dealer C. Local dealer C is contacted and says, yes, we did sell these pistols to shooter S on this date.  We have his background check form on the premises. But you are missing the important part. All this effort to track the gun sales proves that all procedures were followed, thus no crime was committed. Let’s put Mueller on it  when he cant exonerate everyone we will lock them up. When the suspect is killed, the government loves to go after someone who had something to do with the guns that is still alive. Of course, all gun control laws are unconstitutional violations of the 2A but the goal is to eliminate Americans getting around the unconstitutional gun control laws that track how many guns and who has them since the 1980s. The gun control bureaucrats and politicians loathe that tens of millions of guns have been passed between family members without a record at all. I guess that doesn’t make me feel better at all. Local California law enforcement seems to have better things to do that to actually enforce gun confiscations from people who’ve had their ex-wives accuse them of being anxious and depressed in the wake of a divorce or whatever.  If the government can target people for exercising their rights just as easily by requiring FFLs to keep those records as they would if they were keeping the database themselves, then whatever law there is that’s supposed to protect the identity of gun buyers from abuse by government is insufficient. I see two sides to this where the conventional wisdom seems to get it all wrong. 1) Gun rights people who say that we don’t need to change the laws in the wake of a mass shooting because the shooters’ guns were obtained legally. In the minds of gun grabbers and the people who find them persuasive, that’s not how the logic works. If background checks were insufficient to prevent a mass shooting, they argue, then what we need to do is ban guns and confiscate, confiscate, confiscate. It’s like we’re testifying against ourselves in they court of public opinion without even realizing it.  Moderate gun rights organizations imagine background checks as an alternative to confiscation, but I swear it looks like a vehicle for confiscation to me.  If background checks are ineffective, maybe we should just get rid of them. 2) The law that prohibits the federal government from keeping this data is insufficient to protect the rights of people who’ve never shot anybody from government abuse.  If we don’t want the NSA tracking our phone calls because of the First Amendment, we shouldn’t want the government to have access to anybody’s privacy regarding their exercise of the Second Amendment either–for the same reasons. If the FBI wants to put a wiretap on my phone, they should–at the very very least–need to go to a court and get a warrant on basis of affirmation and evidence.  Why should that be different for gun purchase records? If California or the ATF want to know who owns a gun or whether someone own a gun, why shouldn’t they need to get a warrant? Why should they just be free to call an FFL without a warrant? The FBI gives more respect to the rights of terrorists when they tap their phone calls! Exactly Ken. Was it a Supreme Court case that posited that the Fed couldn’t keep a gun registry? And if so, does anyone know the case? Pretty good collection of 2A caselaw. Wikipedia Firearms cases Additionally there was a concerted effort in the 1960s to go after gun owners and the Warren Court set some really bad precedent. Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968) United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601 (1971) 28 CFR § 25.9 covers this topic: 28 CFR § 25.9 – Retention and destruction of records in the system. The BATF operates a National Tracing Center to track firearms, so you know the feds are keeping records. Thank! I didn’t read the whole wall of text, but while I know where you’re coming from, but legally purchased firearms have really almost always been traceable to the purchaser.  What happens after private sale or theft becomes murky. Washington passed a law which now requires a background check for private sale so that means previously if a gun I purchased but sold privately was used in a crime, the cops would come a’knockin’ on my door.  At that point my testimony of who I sold it to becomes paramount. Sorry, distracted by work… Anyhoo, now if my privately sold gun is used in a crime, I can’t claim “I sold it to a stranger” if the gun was purchased by me after the law went into affect.   If there’s no background check on file, yadda yadda, then I’m in violation of that new law. So there’s not a single database, but the data can be pieced together using standard trace techniques. The gun dealers are required to keep records for “x” amount of time based on whether the transaction was completed or not. I would bet the US government keeps all records of NICS checks for purchase of firearms. You raise a good point Ken.  The paper trail itself is problematic, because when/if the government decides to confiscate guns, we’ll be at the mercy of everyone in the supply chain to keep that information from the government once they come knocking. It’s also problematic (and naive) to think that local law enforcement don’t keep records on who has passed a background check which was initiated by a gun purchase.  Does anybody really believe that local law enforcement doesn’t keep these records? “Food delivery apps are drowning China in plastic” […] “…Scientists estimate that the online takeout business in China was responsible for 1.6 million tons of packaging waste in 2017, a ninefold jump from two years before. That includes 1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons. Put together, it is more than the amount of residential and commercial trash of all kinds disposed of each year by the city of Philadelphia. The total for 2018 grew to an estimated 2 million tons….” https://www.theweeklyn.com/2019/06/02/food-delivery-apps-are-drowning-china-in-plastic/ (A NYT feed) This is a country with a population of 1.3Bn people, geographically the 3rd largest country in the world, with thousands of un-populated square miles, and it is “drowning” in the waste equivalent to that of a US city of 1.5M. Can we say ‘fake news’? Yes, I think we can. Just shut up and ban plastic straws already! #doYourPart #Woke #SaveThePlanet But you fail to note that the China packaging is shown as only from on-line takeout delivery, while the Philadelphia figure is all residential and commercial trash combined. Imagine what the combined trash from all sources in China amounts to. Also remember that China is the leading source of plastics in the oceans. A civil engineer for the Virginia Beach government opened fire on his co-workers last Friday, fatally shooting 12 people and wounding others. So this guy is a hero, right?  Killing off a bunch of government flunkies that were likely lefties? Ignorant retarded strawman argument for the win sparky. He’s not a hero because he didn’t kill any cops, right? Continuing with retarded strawmen arguments huh? You obviously don’t know your fellow commenters.  You probably shouldn’t speak for them. “sound of gunfire” line is cute. Is the decline in Free Range kids, responsible for the dwindling number of serial killers? Aamodt said reasons for the apparent decline in serial killing could include advances in forensic technology, tighter use of parole and more widespread caution in the way people live. All factors which suggest victims have become harder to target and criminals easier to catch. “One of the big reasons for the decline is change in parole,” Aamodt said. “Not quite 20% of our serial killers were people who had killed, gone to prison and had been released and killed again. With the longer prison sentences and the reduction in parole, those folks are not going to be back on the streets to kill again. “The second factor, people have changed their behaviour. Go back and think about the 1970s, we would hitchhike, we would let kids walk to the store, let ’em go play. If there was a stranded motorist you’d go and help them – we don’t do those things any more. What we call the free-range behaviours are on the decline and it’s more difficult for serial killers to find victims than it has been in the 70s and 80s.” Forensic skills have improved too and smaller DNA samples can be viable. “There isn’t data to support this, but it may be we are catching people after a single murder, before they commit two or three,” Aamodt said. http://www.unz.com/isteve/the-decline-in-serial-killers/ What can you say, it just isn’t as easy to pick up hookers and bury them in  your basement as it once was. It’s easier to pick up hookers now probably but their are far more safeguards with the internet. I’m guessing it has way more to do with the improvements in forensics meaning the “serial killer” is caught after the first victim instead of after the 40th, than it does have to do with free range behavior.  It’s an interesting theory, but it seems like a stretch to me. Craddock used two .45 caliber pistols, which he purchased legally in 2016 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. All gun control laws are unconstitutional violations of the 2A, including background checks. So are we going to see just mass blanket ban of anti-establishment memes and accounts on Twitter/facebook or are they just going to slowly bleed them out until 4 weeks before 2020? The former. They are already going after Brexit aligned politicians. Do they think this is going to help them?  Are they aware that Ronald Reagan won two elections with literally every news outlet aligned against him?  They are just screwing themselves from understanding how to beat their opposition.   It’s almost reassuring these people are such total fucking pussies and fucktards. I mean milkshakes really? Well he didn’t kill any cops so he’s not that big of a hero. This sure is an interesting place to have put my reply to JesseAZ. It doesnt really matter. People have to care about what you write for it to matter. HEY!  You finally got something right.  I knew you could do it. God your hem tugging is fucking lame. Your reply was fucking stupid no matter where it is placed. “Mexico, meanwhile, rushed a delegation to the U.S. to discuss immigration issues, following the Trump administration’s threat last week to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods entering the U.S. if the Mexican government fails to take aggressive measures to stem the flow of immigrants through Mexico and into the U.S.” I lived in southern Mexico for more than a year, and one thing that became really clear to me after a while is that the Mexican government doesn’t have control of the country the way people in the U.S. imagine. In the U.S., Congress passes a law and the president signs it, and then the president enforces it. That’s like what happens in Mexico, too, but in Mexico, just because the president says he’s enforcing something doesn’t mean local government is under his control. The ongoing “Mexican Drug War” was initiated when President Calderon was elected in 2006.  It all started in large part because the newly elected president created an federal army of loyal soldiers and then went about the country trying to get the locals to do what Calderon said.  They refused! The drug cartels, elements of the Mexican military, the local police, the courts, etc–they’re all the same people! At one point, Calderon sent his military into Tijuana to disarm Tijuana’s police department–it set off a war that’s still going on today. 60,000 Mexican citizens died in a shooting war between the federal government and the President–and the question of whether everyone else in the Mexican government should have to do what they say.  Where I lived in Merida, the Federal Police operated out of a fortress with turreted machine guns on its walls in case it was attacked by the locals. The Mexican people voted Calderon’s party out of power because they wanted that civil war to end.  Things are better now than they were back when the federal government of Mexico was trying to assert control of the government outside the walls of parliament, but the national of government of Mexico still doesn’t assert control of the rest of Mexico the way the U.S. government passing and enforcing laws does in the U.S. Trump is insisting that the Mexican government do something about something that the Mexican government can’t control.  The same gangs and officials that are deeply involved in the trafficking of cocaine, etc. from Central America across Mexico’s southern border are the same ones involved in trafficking asylum seekers and immigrants. The president of Mexico may not have any more power of government forces on Mexico’s southern border than I do. P.S. The Zapatistas have been autonomous within their zone of control since 2003. You think the president of Mexico can tell those people what to do and how to do it? No, that’s not the point. More important, the official state police in Chiapas–outside of Zaptista territory–don’t necessarily do as the president says. “Attack the Zapatistas, you say, El Presidente? Thank you for voicing your concerns.  We’ll take your advice under consideration . . . pendejo“. Seems like a solid point.  Would be great to see intrepid reporters investigate this beyond surface level omg look at these migrants nvm asking how these migrants get the money/food/resources to travel the over 1000 miles of land to get here. I’ve crossed the southern border back into Mexico on foot.  The government officials who staff that border crossing are straight out of central casting. When they asked me for money, I wasn’t sure whether I should give it to them. If I had some, maybe I had more! The only way to tell for sure is to light his balls up with jumper cables, amirite! They pulled me off the bus I was on for being a gringo that just didn’t seem like he belonged. Never felt so lonely as seeing that bus go across that the border at that rural station without me. Trying to explain the idea of “adventure travel” to a crooked border agent in central America is the only time I’ve ever felt compelled to argue that if I was guilty of anything, it was only “white privilege”. P.S. “When you own a big chunk of the bloody Third World, the babies just come with the scenery”. —-Chrissie Hynde “The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers,” Really hope that the EU and Asian countries demand the same of all US visitors.  Only then might some of the sheeple actually stand up against the continued 9/11 inspired privacy erosions. Let them do it. It is their country.  They don’t owe you letting you in. Furthermore, most radicals and terrorists as much as openly advertise it on the social media accounts. The dumb asses in Boston did. So did the couple in California. I think looking to see if you are doing so is pretty reasonable. Remember, they are not asking for passwords just names. So there is nothing they can get that isn’t public to begin with. Everyone knows it’s impossible to have two accounts. Everyone knows terrorists or criminals are never stupid. And just because it might not work every time means it is never worth doing at all. After playing golf this morning, @realDonaldTrump stopped off at a Virginia church to offer his “thoughts and prayers” for the victims of the Virginia Beach shooting. He spent 16 minutes there. His speech at the NRA convention in April lasted almost an hour. Any questions? I have one.  Was he wearing that same kind of goofy plaid outfit that Payne Stewart used to wear? Generally, I prefer brevity when politicians are speaking. I find Trump’s speeches to be somewhat irritating since he tends to repeat a lot of stuff he already said in earlier speeches or on Twitter. So I’m thinking the folks at the church got a break. Mythbusters  is essential viewing for this. Naturally, gun control advocates don’t know that “silencers” a) don’t really make the shot silent, regardless of what they’ve seen in the movies, and b) aren’t really high-tech devices and can be made at home pretty easily. Especially with semi-auto pistols, like the supposed .45 cal pistols that he had. Gas is released via each ejection of a round casing, causing noise. Truly “silenced” pistols are single shot pistols and manually reload is required. This causes all gas from the round to go thru a sound suppression device. Along with subsonic rounds, this can be a very quiet pistol, relatively speaking for firearms. I’m old enough to remember all of the cheesy movies and TV shows that portrayed “silenced revolvers”. No doubt Hillary thinks that really works. Trump calls London mayor a ‘stone cold loser’ ahead of U.K. visit https://news.yahoo.com/trump-calls-london-mayor-a-stone-cold-loser-ahead-of-uk-visit-115357101.html;_ylt=AwrE1x9dL_VcId8AfJ9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEyY3VucDBuBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDQjY4MjFfMQRzZWMDc2M- Now that’s funny. Fun fact, “Stone Cold Loser” was the punk band Trump started and later managed in Military School. Unless Trump was the only member. shouldn’t the band be called Stone Cold Losers? Unless, being ‘punk,’ it didn’t matter? Or maybe nothing matters and who cares? In this timeline there is zero chance he didn’t get kicked out for “creative differences”.  After coming up with the name and missing the first two scheduled rehearsals. Totally. That is how he became the manager. I see Trump as the drummer and everyone kept to his beat. no chance he was the frontman for exactly two days and never sang a note. These Socialist just cannot stand that Trump does not bow down to their insults and unprofessional behavior. Trump is definitely not a stoic statesman but these government types around the USA and World are unprofessional too. Its a shame that its comes down to this type of international behavior but we elected Trump to not kiss ass (unless it’s a fine ass hooker). You can take the thug out of New York, but you can’t take the New York thug out of POO*. *President Orange Obstruction #MAGA #MAGA The “Kick Me” sign taped to the back of unsuspecting geeks. MAGA champions put “kick me” signs on geeks like YOU. The Monster Returns Despite the plot’s blatant stupidity, the visuals showcasing destruction of epic proportion and the terrifying arrival of King Godzilla offer some solid jump scares. But enough about Trump in London. Group building privately funded border wall plans to expand reason wont touch this story with a ten foot pole. Anyone who’s been around when a suppressed firearm is shot knows why “silencer” is right up there with “assault weapon” as a Liberal  fake trigger word. They basically reduce the noise from painful to not painful, and can still be heard. You know what supressors or silencers do is make guns safer. If it ever comes to having to use a gun to defend yourself in your home, you are looking at potential hearing damage if the gun doesn’t have some kind of a supressor on it. To play devil’s advocate, it’s dramatic enough where people in the immediate area will hear it, but it might not be obvious that it’s a gun shot.  Whereas with no silencer, you’re going to hear the gunshots across campus. I know this column isn’t supposed to be an all-inclusive view of the major stories of the day, but the WSJ wrote a story on Friday saying that the Justice Department is about to launch an antitrust probe of Google and I’ve been waiting on a thread ever since. “WASHINGTON—The Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google . . . . The FTC and the department have been in talks recently on who would oversee any new antitrust investigation of a leading U.S. tech giant, and the commission agreed to give the Justice Department jurisdiction over Google, the people said. With turf now settled, the department is preparing to closely examine Google’s business practices related to its search and other businesses —-WSJ https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-preparing-antitrust-investigation-of-google-11559348795? This story won’t be about speculation for much longer. and this is likely to go especially badly for Google (and other tech giants) in an election year.  There are few issues candidates more tempting to candidates than a tech giant like Google.  People on the right hate them for being elitist, unaccountable, social justice warriors. Elitist social justice warriors like Elizabeth Warren hate them for being insufficiently accountable to elitist, social justice warriors. That’s a shitty position for Google to be in. Looks good on ’em. Update from five minutes ago: “The FTC secured the rights to begin a potential investigation of Facebook and whether it has engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices as part of an agreement that allowed the DOJ to take the reins in a Google probe, according to people familiar with the matter. “ So, the FTC is going after Facebook on antitrust, and the DOJ is going after Google. I’m much more sympathetic to the case against Google than I am to the case against Facebook. In neither case is it straight up support for antitrust action on either one of them.  I have two questions: 1) What problem do plan to address with antitrust? 2) What solution are you proposing? Whether or not OJ is guilty of murder, I don’t support charging him with arson or burning him at the stake when he’s found guilty. I see no evidence that [Google] is guilty of arson, and burning [Google] at the stake is completely inappropriate. I have heard very little on this seemingly very important issue. Do you think there is a reason for the lack of coverage on recent anti-trust action? Maybe it’s because it doesn’t have a clear anti-Trump angle? Silencers are NOT silent. Which is why they are called suppressors. It’s only in video games and movies where they are silent. If you use facts and logic, you might end up persuading people, which is likely to encourage more people to use facts and logic–and obviously we can’t have that. It leads to people thinking for themselves, which makes them harder to control. And everybody knows that leads to horrifying results: rising sea levels, the reemergence of the Klan, homophobia, cats and dogs living together, . . . Much better to just sit back and let the experts do our thinking for us.  We know we can trust progressive experts especially–because they care about people. Tucker Carlson is such a tool. Invading Mexicans are not that hard to spot since they have darker pelts than normal humans. On the other hand, invading Canadians are more of a threat because their lighter coloration allows them to pass as regular people as long as they don’t vocalize. It’s the Canadians that are the hidden threat, you fools! Dole fruit trucks burned in Honduras as protests spread reason’s idea of “free markets” will surely handle this situation. And by “free markets”, I mean reason likes managed trade that they like, not completely open markets with no government regulation. If someone passes a background check they should get instant National Conceal Carry Reciprocity. Background checks just to buy and/own a firearm is unconstitutional. With that being said, all states are required to honor other states under the Privileges and Immunities Clause (Art IV, Sec 2). If one state gives a gun permit to a citizen, then every state that they pass into should honor that permit. Its why gun control laws are so shitty. They make crimes of innocent behavior like carrying guns and then restrict what a visiting resident of another state can carry firearms. This place is like the zombie with its head blown off who doesn’t realize he’s dead (again). QUIT FUNKING SAYING HIS NAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

President Donald Trump has arrived in the U.K. to begin a three-day state visit that is sure to be full of pomp — and protest. Here's what we're watching today. The famous ""special relationship"" between the U.S. and Britain will be on display — and tested during Trump's three-day visit. Even before his arrival on British shores, the president created several diplomatic headaches for his hosts. He waded into British domestic politics by endorsing nationalist-leaning former London Mayor Boris Johnson in the race to replace Theresa May as prime minister and called Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, ""nasty"" during an interview with a British newspaper. The president denied insulting the American-born royal in that manner, despite an audio recording of it, but then used the same word to describe London's Mayor Sadiq Khan minutes before touching down. But as NBC News' Jonathan Allen writes in an analysis, beleaguered Britain needs Trump and the U.S. relationship — and he knows it. To that end, Trump and first lady Melania will receive the royal treatment today. He is expected to have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, tea with Prince Charles and then will be fêted by a state banquet back at the palace this evening. But Britain's public isn't much for royal niceties. Along the way, Trump is expected to be met by protesters, including the baby Trump blimp and a massive demonstration on Tuesday. The city engineer who killed 12 people in a shooting rampage at work had submitted his resignation letter earlier that day, a city official said Sunday. DeWayne Craddock, who had worked with Virginia Beach’s utilities department for 15 years, died in a gun battle with police. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said the city employees that were killed “leave a void that we will never be able to fill.” Meantime, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney argued that the Trump administration has taken steps to combat gun violence after the nation's latest mass shooting. But the government is ""never going to protect everybody against everybody who is deranged,"" he said on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""Laws are not going to fix everything,"" he said. The Democratic governor of Louisiana signed one of the strictest anti-abortion bills in the country into law — and the 2020 contenders have a lot to say about it. Calling the move ""dangerous,"" ""draconian"" and ""outrageous,"" Democrats have come out swinging, even against one of their own. Seventy-five years after D-Day, the world is once again a troubling place to a former German soldier who was on the losing side of the operation that hastened the end of World War II. Paul Golz, 95, has a clear memory of being on guard duty in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944 — and realizing the invasion was underway when the skies over the Normandy coast were illuminated by flares. But as the leaders of the free world prepare to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, Golz said he fears a fraying of the alliances that were created in the wake of the war, alliances that brought peace and stability to Europe.

132,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-shooting/bagpiper-singer-mother-mourned-among-the-dead-of-virginia-beach-massacre-idUSKCN1T4132?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 3 Min Read (Reuters) - The 12 victims of Friday’s mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building included an engineer who had recently taken up the bagpipes, an account clerk with a beautiful singing voice and a Belarusian immigrant, according to friends and relatives. It remained unclear on Monday why the alleged gunman, DeWayne Craddock, opened fire at the resort city’s Department of Public Works, where he had worked for almost 15 years before handing in his resignation hours before the attack. He was fatally shot by a police officer. The shooting was the deadliest instance of U.S. gun violence since November, when a dozen people were slain at a Los Angeles-area bar and grill by a gunman who then killed himself. Among the victims who had most recently joined Public Works was Christopher Rapp, who was about to mark his first anniversary at the job. After moving to the Virginia Beach area, Rapp had nursed his love of Scottish music by joining the Tidewater Pipes & Drums. “He was quiet but had a passion for the pipes and Scottish culture,” the band said in a tribute posted on social media, which was accompanied by a photograph of Rapp smiling at Celtic festival in 2018 dressed in a tartan kilt. Related Coverage  Tara Welch Gallagher, who had been an engineer at Public Works for six years when she was killed, was remembered as someone who “always had kind words to say” to friends or strangers in a tribute posted on GoFundMe, where supporters are raising funds for her 21-month-old son. Alex Gusev, a right-of-way agent, emigrated from Belarus in 2003 to get a degree in civil engineering before joining Public Works nine years ago, according to a profile by the Virginian-Pilot. He enjoyed playing basketball and soccer with neighbors who had also emigrated from Eastern Europe, a friend told the newspaper. Katherine Nixon, who had worked at the department as an engineer for a decade, was a mother of three young girls. Ryan Keith Cox, an account clerk with the city’s Public Utilities Department for more than 12 years, came from a devout Christian family. “I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore,” his brother, Ervin, wrote on Facebook. Four other people hurt in the shooting remained in critical condition at local hospitals after surgery as of Sunday afternoon, according to a spokesman for the hospitals. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera described Craddock as “disgruntled,” but declined to say more about what may have precipitated the attack. He was an employee in good standing before handing in his resignation, officials said. An impromptu memorial set up at the municipal center was visited by well-wishers on Sunday, and media images show family and friends holding hands and lighted candles at multiple churches.

Much of the police tape barring public access to the Virginia Beach Municipal Center had already come down, but the doors to city offices remained shuttered following a gun rampage by a longtime city employee that left 12 people dead. The center will reopen Tuesday, city officials say, but Building 2 where the shooting took place will be closed indefinitely. Among the few municipal center facilities opening their doors Monday was the administrative building for Virginia Beach City Public Schools. As students and staff returned to classrooms Monday morning, Superintendent Aaron Spence said routine is a top priority for the week. More: Virginia Beach shooting: What we know about the motive, the victims ""One of the things we know whenever there's trauma, a traumatic event like this is that it's important to get children back into routines, just of normalcy, as quickly as possible,"" he said. Regular elements of the school day will continue as usual, such as state testing planned for this week, but teachers and administrators will be making extra efforts, he said, to let students know they're ready to help and answer questions. The school system's teaching and learning team worked through the weekend, Spence said, preparing messages for teachers, as well as strategies they can use to talk to students, taking into account the varying ages and maturity levels that may need support. More: 'Got to see if anybody else needs help': Virginia Beach shooting hero died trying to save others ""We're not actively promoting stopping teaching and talking about this, but sometimes those questions come up, and it just provides a moment to have a conversation with the child,"" he said. Each school also has a crisis response team, he said, which includes counselors and school psychologists who will be available to students and staff. Spence said the community's schools are already equipped with a ""robust security program,"" and they'll be doubling down on those efforts to ensure students and staff feel secure. Much of the activity at the municipal center Monday morning focused around a growing memorial erected in front of building 11, which houses the police department. Mourners adorned in varying shades of blue – the color adopted as a symbol of unity – approached the line of 12 white crosses with bouquets and other tributes. Each cross had been decorated with a victim's name and photo as well as balloons, American flags, flowers and psalms. More: A 'woman of God,' a Scottish music lover: These are the victims of Virginia Beach shooting For Ryan Keith Cox, a 13-year veteran of the city's public utilities department who reports say was shot while trying to help colleagues to safety, people penned messages such as ""Thanks for your bravery,"" and ""Thanks for saving lives."" Multiple K-9 teams from Crisis Response Canines stood by to comfort those working to confront their grief, including Becky Langer and her K-9 partner Exon. The organization has provided its support to multiple communities recovering after mass shootings, including Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh and Parkland, Florida. ""It's very important for the people who are going through this crisis, whether it's community members, victims, first responders especially, to get them de-stressed, to bring the calm to them, let them pet the dogs and just decompress a little,"" Langer said. Peggy Bryan was among those who embraced Langer and Exon, seeking solace as she looked over the messages of love community members had left for victims with tears in her eyes and a tremble in her voice. More: Suspected Virginia Beach shooter used a gun suppressor. Did it make Friday's shooting deadlier? A lifelong Virginia Beach resident, Bryan taught in city schools for more than three decades but now works in neighboring Chesapeake. She stopped by the memorial on her way into work. Bryan knew a handful of people who had been in building 2 when the gunfire broke out, including a friend's son who heard the shots but was able to escape safely. With the heartache still fresh in her mind, she said returning to work as usual would be difficult, but the tragedy has not stolen her sense of security. ""Everybody says, 'Oh, it'll never happen here.' Well, it did,"" she said. ""Our police department has done such a wonderful job and our mayor. I don't feel unsafe anywhere in this city."" Becky Demetriou lives down the street from the municipal center and was driving by with friends as the shooting took place. They didn't see much because police quickly directed them out of the area. Since then, Demetriou said there's been a sense of guilt because she’s been able to go on with her normal life, and she felt pulled to return to the center and visit the memorial. ""I know people that went there that morning to get permits and they luckily got out of there,"" Demetriou said. ""They wanted to go early to avoid traffic and whatever. Friday afternoon, it could've been a lot worse I imagine."" Suffolk resident Tammy Peterson works in Virginia Beach managing an employment center. She previously spent 20 years in the financial industry and said one of the victims had been a client. She described the loss as surreal. ""The reality is that there is a family that is left without a dad, a brother, a husband. And there's going to be a long road ahead of them, for all of the families,"" she said.

In her office, she said she's felt the need to step up and be a leader for her staff as they work to process their emotions. ""Everybody kind of processes this kind of thing differently in my opinion, and I don't know that there's a right or wrong way,"" she said. ""So I think there has to be an open tolerance and understanding for everybody, whatever stage they're at with this."" Edward Sivells Sr. of Chesapeake was drawn to the memorial by the victims and their stories, particularly those of Christopher Kelly Rapp, who had only recently moved to Virginia Beach, and Joshua Hardy, whose family member is a Norfolk pastor Sivells knows.

135,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/03/nras-latest-grift-pushing-silencers-like-the-one-the-virginia-beach-shooter-used/,"Friday's mass shooting in Virginia Beach, in which 12 victims and the shooter were killed, will likely join the drumbeat of mass murder stories that have become so common they barely register as news anymore. The apparent shooter, a 40-year-old man named DeWayne Craddock, resigned his job early Friday and then showed up at his office, apparently intent on killing as many people as possible before the police, after a protracted gun battle, killed him as well. But this shooting has one detail that sets it apart from the numbing litany of mass shootings: Craddock had a silencer on his weapon, that device we've all seen on TV that the gun lobby insists on calling a ""suppressor."" ""He obviously knew what he was doing when he had extended magazines, he had suppressors. He was coming to kill as many people as possible, which is chilling,"" Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action told Salon. Craddock likely jumped through the numerous hoops created by the 1934 National Firearms Act, and his use of a silencer makes it quite clear he thought it would make it easier to kill more people. But gun industry shills are now fanning out across the media, denying to every journalist they can pin down that the silencer made any difference. That claim is hard to square with the reports from shooting witnesses, however, many of whom seemed confused about what was happening or how close it was. One person reportedly mistook the sound for a nail gun. It's also hard to square with the fact that the shooter clearly believed that a silencer would give him an advantaged in terms of piling up the body count. Silencers don't work like they do in the ""John Wick"" movies; they can't completely muffle a firearm's loud, percussive report. Instead, they work by muffling and distorting the sound, making it softer and more diffuse. As gun safety advocates point out, that is enough to make silencers a danger, especially in a chaotic mass shooting such as this one. ""Bystanders can run from the gunfire only if they know where it is coming from,"" Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of homeland security, explained in a Washington Post op-ed after the shooting. Silencers, by design, make it much harder to identify where shots are coming from, making it harder for victims to escape and for police to find an active shooter. Craddock likely purchased his silencer legally at one of the Virginia gun stores that sell the devices, but the heavy federal regulation of silencers has been successful in suppressing the popularity of this particular accessory. But the NRA, whose primary purpose is to boost sales for gun manufacturers, has been trying to change this, lobbying Congress and rolling out major marketing initiatives in hopes of gutting the 1934 law. The gun industry's big talking point on ""suppressors"" is to highlight the fact that they don't entirely silence the firearm report, so those who oppose their sales are a pack of hysterical ninnies trying to scare people unfairly. There are endless FAQ sheets and other talking point dissemination pages from the NRA that argue that ""suppressors reduce noise, but do not completely eliminate it"" and claim that their primary or sole purpose is to prevent hearing loss and keep shooters from annoying neighbors. ""Suppressors are about keeping people safe from hearing loss,"" NRA TV host Grant Stinchfield declared on Twitter in 2018, arguing ""that a 'suppressor' is anything but quiet."" When the topic is silencer sales, Stinchfield is quick to deny that murder is made easier by suppressing the sound of a gunshot. But he sang a much different tune last year, when a disgruntled video gamer murdered two people at a Florida tournament  that was being live-streamed on Twitch. Stinchfield blamed one of the victims, pointing out that 22-year-old Eli Clayton was wearing headphones when he was murdered. ""If you listen over the talking that person doesn’t hear the shots. Why? Because their headphones are on,"" Stinchfield said of the video of Clayton's murder. ""I heard at least four or five or six shots while that person was taking a cellphone video of the game. There’s no running for cover, there’s not even any looking around."" So, according to the NRA, sound suppression in a situation where people have no reasonable expectation that someone will start shooting at them is too deadly a risk. But applying a sound-suppression device directly to the firearm is somehow not unsafe at all. This defies common sense. The same technology that the NRA lauds for silencing guns enough to keep one's neighbors from hearing them will also silence guns enough that people locked in large buildings with active shooters won't be able to figure out what's going on. Watts disputed the claim that silencers are necessary to protect from hearing loss, pointing out that ""the military uses ear protection, not silencers, to protect soldiers' hearing."" What the military does use silencers for, however, is stealth. When SEAL Team Six raided Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011, its members customize their firearms with silencers as part of the larger mission to make the team's ""operations faster, quieter and deadlier,"" as reported by the New York Times. Watts is skeptical that the NRA is really interested in protecting people's hearing. She said she sees another motive in the NRA's push to demolish the 85-year-old law that regulates silencer sales: Money, baby. ""After they invested $30 million in Donald Trump's campaign,"" Watts explained, the NRA pushed hard for legislation ""to deregulate silencers because it would be a cash cow for gun manufacturers."" This was an especially high priority since gun sales were expected to go down after a Trump victory, since a primary marketing strategy of the gun industry is to exploit conservative insecurity and anxiety whenever Democrats are in power. Sure enough, there has been a ""Trump slump"" in gun sales. So the hope here is that by deregulating silencers, the industry can boost profits by selling more of them. Donald Trump Jr. even recorded a lengthy infomercial with the CEO of SilencerCo, in which  he said that silencers were great for getting ""little kids into the game."" Fortunately for our national sanity, the NRA is now embroiled in an internal civil war, driven by the very same unchecked greed that leads the group to endanger American lives for profit. Leaders across the group have been suing each other, exposing the stunning levels of grift within the organization, including setting up for-profit consulting groups to siphon money out of NRA coffers and lavish expense-account spending usage, including CEO Wayne LaPierre's $300,000 on clothes from Ermenegildo Zegna alone. Plus, the group's investment in Trump backfired on Sunday (pun intended), when the president's impulsive nature once again drove him off-message, at least from the perspective of his gun industry benefactors. When a reporter asked, ""Do you believe that silencers should be restricted?"" Trump responded, ""I don’t like them at all."" It's especially helpful that Republicans failed to repeal silencer regulations before Democrats took the majority in the House last fall. History shows that mass shooters are a valuable marketing asset for the gun industry, as their high kill rate functions as gruesome real-life advertising for the guns and accessories they use.  Both the AR-15 assault rifle and  bump stocks have seen massive sales surges after their use in mass shootings. Regulations on silencers, however, require purchasers to register through a relatively onerous and time-consuming process. The gun industry can't exploit the impulsiveness that drives post-shooting shopping sprees, which is probably why it has pushed so hard to get those regulations undone. After the Virginia Beach shooting, the discussion regarding silencers will likely be dominated by impossible-to-settle debates about how much impact the silencer had on this particular day of carnage. Those debates distract from the much larger issue, which is that the NRA and the gun industry it supports don't really care about any such questions as long as they're making money. It's high time that people whose only interest is profit, not in saving lives, should be denied any voice in determining how guns are regulated.

136,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/03/mass-shooters-gun-free-zones/,"Photo by Shutterstock It is no coincidence mass shootings tend to occur in gun-free zones, where shooters know they are less likely to encounter armed citizens who can defend themselves, according to a gun crimes expert. Friday’s shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that left 12 people dead, occurred in Building 2 of the city’s municipal center, a designated a “gun-free zone” where employees were banned from carrying guns, according to the Virginian-Pilot. “Another mass public shooting, another place where the victims were banned from carrying guns,” John R. Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, wrote after the shooting. Only four percent of mass public shootings from 1998-2018 occurred in areas where guns are allowed, with 96 percent occurring in “gun-free zones,” according to Lott’s research. This is significant, Lott argues, because state concealed carry regulations generally designate only a few restricted areas for carrying a gun, yet those places are where most shootings occur. VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA – JUNE 02: People stop to pay their respects to those killed in a mass shooting at a makeshift memorial outside the City of Virginia Beach Operations Building June 02, 2019 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Eleven city employees and one private contractor were shot to death Friday in the operations building by engineer DeWayne Craddock who had worked for the city for 15 years. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) “At some point, it would seem obvious that these attacks aren’t random,” added Lott. Lott compiled shooting statistics over the last 20 years, noting differences in his methodology than that used by gun-control groups like Everytown For Gun Safety, which Lott characterizes as “misleading.” (RELATED: Everytown Ignoring Bloomberg’s Findings) “Everytown for Gun Safety’s recent report on mass shootings contains many errors…it muddies the discussion…by including shootings in private homes along with ones in public places, and the vast majority of the cases they include are in private homes,” he said. In his article, “How mass killers pick out venues where their victims are sitting ducks,” written in June 2015, Lott noted that the Aurora, Colorado, “Batman” movie theater gunman had seven theaters closer to his residence, but he selected the only theater that was a designated “gun-free zone,” as Fox News reported. In addition, Lott pointed out in the same article that, despite 20 states allowing teachers to carry guns, shooting attacks had only occurred in schools where guns are banned. Rather than blaming Friday’s shooting on a lack of gun control laws, Lott suggests existing laws banning public employees from carrying firearms may be the problem. “Of course, the media seems immune to even discussing these points. The irony is that rather than going back and removing an existing policy that created a place where people couldn’t protect themselves, the attack will likely be used to make all the other buildings gun-free zones,” he said.

During the president’s visit, Pastor David Platt led the congregation in prayer for President Trump: ""God, we pray that he would know how much You love him. So much that You sent Jesus to die for his sins, our sins, so we pray that he would look to You. That he would trust in You. That he would lean on You. That he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice, and good for righteousness, and good for equity, every good path,"" He continued to pray for the President to exercise good leadership: ""Lord we pray, we pray that You would give him all the grace he needs to govern in ways we just saw in 1 Timothy, chapter 2, that will lead to peaceful and quiet lives, Godly and dignified in every way.""  Platt closed by praying for all elected officials throughout the nation: ""We pray today for leaders in Congress. We pray for leaders in courts. We pray for leaders at national and state levels.” The President’s visit came on June 2, the day that evangelist Franklin Graham urged his followers to join him for a day of prayer for President Trump. “President Trump’s enemies continue to try everything to destroy him, his family, and the presidency. In the history of our country, no president has been attacked as he has,” Graham posted to Facebook, “I believe the only hope for him, and this nation, is God.” “This is a critical time for America,” he continued “We’re on the edge of a precipice.

Footage from the rescues shows law enforcers guiding petrified employees down a stairwell where one person lay dead. ""Look me in the eye, I’ll help you down,” they said. “Don’t look down, look at me. Focus on me.” The heroism and compassion shown by his officers in those chaotic moments stayed with Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera, who described some of the body camera footage in an interview with USA TODAY. Cervera said police work naturally takes an emotional toll. “It’s the death by 1,000 cuts. It’s the water torture, drip by drip. It eventually has a toll on who you are as a person,"" he said. But ""to walk into a scene like this, it has an instantaneous effect on you.” Start the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox More: Virginia Beach shooting: What we know about the motive, the victims Cervera said he’s worried about how his officers will cope with the trauma from Friday’s shooting, the aftermath of which he described as a “war zone.” He knows many of his officers will continue to reel from the effects of the shooting as time passes. “They’re going to be forever changed,” he said. Departments across the country have faced a similar issue: How do you help officers who have witnessed the unimaginable and who are then thrust back into a job that tasks them with making life or death decisions daily? The increasing number of mass shootings in the USA has cast a spotlight on mental health and led some departments to reconcile how they help officers cope emotionally in a profession that has historically applauded strength and hid weakness. “We’re beginning to really research and ramp up what we call officer resiliency, and that is the psycho-emotional part of the job,” Cervera said. “We never thought about this in policing. As a matter of fact, it was looked down upon.” The police chief said his department was taking a hard look at how to respond, from offering professional and peer counseling to helping officers get back to their day-to-day lives. Cervera said he’s talked with several of his officers in the aftermath of the shooting, telling USA TODAY on Sunday that he met with two of the four who were part of an extended gunbattle with the suspect. The other two officers were having time with their family and “trying to get back to normalcy,” Cervera said. “The two that I spoke with, they are the consummate professionals. They will always give the outward facade of, you know, stoicism,” he said. “While they’re looking at me, and I’m the chief, ‘Yes, chief, it’s OK. I’m doing fine. I’m doing fine.’ ” Cervera said he knows that “when the door closes,” the facade fades. “As much as this individual’s the one who caused his demise, so to speak, as much as this individual indiscriminately killed 12 people, the police officers took a life,"" he said. ""That’s a heck of a thing to be able to look at yourself every morning and say, ‘I took a human life.’ They believe in the sanctity of human life. They really do.” More: Suspected Virginia Beach shooter used a gun suppressor. Did it make Friday's shooting deadlier? Talking about mental health within the law enforcement community was taboo for many years, but that culture is slowly changing, said Jeff McGill, co-founder of Blue H.E.L.P., a Massachusetts-based nonprofit group that aims to reduce mental health stigma for law enforcers. ""We talk a lot about how to respond to an active shooter, but we rarely discuss the aftermath and long-term mental health care that officers will need,"" he said. There is no question that an officer's demeanor changes after responding to something such as Friday's massacre in Virginia Beach, he said. ""To suggest that you're the same officer the next day at work is foolish,"" he said. Shootings change the tactics officers use, raise awareness and put them ""more on edge."" More clinicians that understand law enforcement culture are needed, and departments should boost support systems, both within their department and within officers' families, for employees who respond to shootings, car wrecks and deaths over the length of their career, McGill said. ""It builds up over time, and while it might not affect you right now, these psychological injuries that come along with a law enforcement career are likely to cause problems within your personal or professional life,"" he said. ""We have to be more proactive. We have to."" Omar Delgado doesn't like to leave his Florida home. It's the one place he feels safe. The former Eatonville Police Department officer, who was hailed as a hero after saving lives during the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the aftermath of the attack, which left 49 dead. He doesn't watch the TV news or spend much time on social media anymore, but he knew something bad happened Friday after dozens of texts poured into his phone, asking if he was OK.

Every time there's another mass shooting,” Delgado said. “The worst thing that's ever happened to me, the thing I wish I could just forget and move on from, I’m reminded of basically every single day.” Delgado said departments across the country need to do more to help officers cope with emotions after seeing the horrors of the job, which don't just happen during mass shootings but on everyday calls. ""You get tired of fighting, and I get it, I really do. That's why you get a lot of first responders who commit suicide,"" he said. ""They can’t control their brain from traveling 100 mph. It’s scary. There needs to more programs out there."" At least 159 officers took their own lives in 2018, outpacing the 145 officers who were killed in the line of duty, according to a study by Blue H.E.L.P. In 2017, at least 140 officers took their own life, which outpaced the 129 line-of-duty deaths, according to a study by the Ruderman Family Foundation, a philanthropic organization that works for the rights of people with disabilities. Some departments have made huge leaps forward when it comes to mental health, including in Las Vegas. Officers who responded to the Route 91 concert shooting, which left 58 people dead in 2017 – the nation's deadliest mass shooting – knew they had an in-depth support system within the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The department houses a Police Employee Assistance Program, which was lauded by the Justice Department in a report this year as the ""standard"" for how departments should handle counseling for officers. More: In Virginia Beach, a struggle to return to routine less than 72 hours after tragedy “The LVMPD spent decades perfecting their process so that when the most harrowing calls came, they had the tools, systems and best responses in place with deployment as their primary focus,"" the report said. Often, departments offer trauma counseling ""in the wake of a critical incident, leaving gaps as the practices catch up to the need."" Officer William Gibbs, manager of the assistance program, said departments need to do more, so they ""aren't playing catch-up"" when employees need the care. ""You want to get in front of stuff like this,"" he said, noting peer support programs and counseling are ingrained in the culture of the department, starting when an officer is in training. After the shooting, there was widespread willingness within the department to seek counseling and talk to someone about what officers witnessed, which is not always the case, Gibbs said. He attributes the success to normalizing self-care within the department and building a strong relationship with employees, who have trust in the program. ""We want to help employees become more resilient throughout their career and even after it when they've retired,"" Gibbs said. ""It's about shifting the culture within law enforcement that talking to someone and getting help is not a sign of weakness.""",2019-06-03 15:58:50,"How cops cope with shooting trauma: &apos;They&rsquo;re going to be forever changed,&apos; Virginia Beach police chief says",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Of course, even though the city was aiming for ""normalcy,"" as the city's public school Superintendent Aaron Spence put it to USA Today, that was a nearly impossible task. Monday was instead marked by memorial services, government building closures, and other moments of remembrance for the 12 victims of Friday's mass shooting. A city employee opened fire in Virginia Beach's municipal building on Friday afternoon, killing 12 people, most of whom were also city employees. Stories of all those victims began to spread over the weekend, including one of longtime public utility worker Ryan Keith Cox. When the shooting started, Cox and several other coworkers barricaded themselves in a break room. But Cox soon went back out, saying he needed to ""see if anybody else needs help,"" his coworker tells The Virginian Pilot-Online. Cox was among the employees remembered at a memorial service at Virginia Beach's convention center Monday morning. City employees wrote messages on rocks at the gathering, and they'll be used to build a memorial garden at the municipal center. The municipal center's building 2, where the shooting happened, will be closed indefinitely, though a wall of flowers and tributes had already grown outside. After a day off, the rest of the center will reopen Tuesday. City schools were open Monday after teaching teams had gathered to prepare coping messages and strategies for students over the weekend. Also on Monday, police released the gunman's brief resignation letter, which said he was leaving his job for ""personal reasons."" Read the stories of the 12 shooting victims at The Virginian-Pilot.

142,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-jr-endorsed-gun-silencers-his-father-claims-to-hate?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH The president disavowed suppressors like the one used in the Virginia Beach massacre, but his son says he loves them. Special Correspondent As he departed for England, President Trump was asked if he favored restricting silencers such as the one reportedly used by the killer in the mass shooting in Virginia Beach that left 12 dead. “I don’t like them at all,” Trump responded. Trump was perhaps unaware that both his elder son and the NRA have in the recent past opposed any regulation of silencers, also called suppressors. Donald Trump Jr. even made a video back in September 2016 in which he fired a silencer-equipped automatic pistol such as was used to such devastating effect in Virginia on Friday. “I think it's awesome!” he says in the video after blazing away. The video was produced and posted on YouTube by SilencerCo, which manufactures 70 percent of silencers sold on the civilian market in the U.S. Don Jr. had a sit-down chat with company CEO Joshua Waldron. “It’s about safety,” Don Jr. says. Don Jr. argues that without silencers, gunfire can injure a shooter’s hearing. “It’s a health issue,” Don Jr. says. Don Jr. tells Waldron, “I love your product,” and complains, “I can’t use it in the People's Republic of New York.” Silencers are indeed outright outlawed in New York and 10 other states, though not in Virginia. Waldron and Don Jr. clearly assumed that Donald Sr. would move to lift all restrictions. “He’s obviously going to be for it,” Don Jr. says. Don Jr. is in perfect alignment with the views the NRA expresses on its NRA Family website. “Silencers for firearms were made in 1902 by Hiram Percy Maxim in lock-step with another one of his inventions, the car muffler,” the NRA says. “This makes sense because both products utilized nearly identical technology. Today car mufflers are mandated by the government, while firearm suppressors are highly regulated by it. That doesn't make any sense at all.” The NRA goes on, “Fact is, silencers, also called suppressors, are rarely used in crime but offer myriad advantages. While they are not silent-supersonic projectiles still make a whip-like crack as they break the sound barrier-suppressors mitigate noise at the muzzle of the gun so it's not as dangerous to nearby ears. They also reduce recoil. They promote accuracy via less recoil and less flinch-inducing noise. Finally, they reduce noise complaints from non-shooters.” How nice that the Virginia Beach shooter did not have to worry about this ears and that he was able to murder one person after another without his accuracy being impaired by recoil and flinch-inducing noise. After Friday’s massacre, one of the survivors said he initially thought the shooting was the sound of a nail gun, not an automatic pistol. He survived, but you have to wonder if there were others who died because they were a few fatal moments slower in taking cover or barricading themselves in a safe room. One reason Special Forces operators use silencers is that their targets are less likely be alerted before it is too late. The same was likely true of the Virginia Beach shooter. Many of the dead were the sort of public servants who keep our water and sewage systems working so well that we take them for granted. Their efforts in Virginia Beach proved that government can function every time somebody turns on a tap or flushes a toilet. Government at high levels is another matter. With President Trump's response to the question about silencers, you could hope that for a moment he was taking a stance in the public interest at the chance of going against his base. More likely, he did not know what his son and the NRA had said. Or maybe he failed to consider the implications of what he himself was saying. Meanwhile, the Virginia Beach Police Department did not immediately respond to a query as to what brand of silencer the shooter there used. Not that it would have been hard to obtain. Unless you are in the People’s Republic of New York or one of 10 other states, you can simply order one online.

143,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-legislature-session-lightfoot-crime-spin-20190603-story.html,"Amid the heralding of a new day in Springfield, where Republican state lawmakers worked with the Democrats in power to pass a bipartisan budget as well as a plan to fix the state’s crumbling roads, bridges and government buildings, the rising mercury of summer once again drew back the curtains on what ails Chicago most: violence. In all, more than 52 people were shot, eight fatally, over the weekend, with Chicago’s top cop — no doubt feeling some pressure with new boss Mayor Lori Lightfoot vowing to lower crime — offering a similar refrain for the causes: the proliferation of guns on the streets and the courts not clamping down on offenders. Lightfoot’s picked a new school board, including a new president — Miguel del Valle — a Chicago Public Schools alum who as a state senator in the 1990s was a critic of the state handing control of the city’s public schools system to the Chicago mayor’s office. And a look at the winners and losers of the Illinois General Assembly’s 2019 legislative session. Welcome to The Spin. From legalizing pot for fun to stitching together a plan for dealing with the state’s crumbling roads and bridges, the rookie Pritzker pushed an aggressive agenda his first time out and got a lot of the things he wanted. You can read the breakdown here. That includes a $40 billion budget plan and, separately, a $45 billion public works package. That means we’ll be seeing lots of orange barrels and “Road construction, next 10 miles” on highways and byways in the coming years. The infrastructure bill allows lawmakers, particularly during the campaign season, to go back to constituents with tangible evidence of how their tax dollars are being put to use. With Democrats controlling the governor’s office and both chambers of the General Assembly, lawmakers might have wrapped up business by dinnertime Friday — ahead of the midnight deadline. But this was about political negotiations, including the governor’s office working with Lightfoot to secure her support for a Chicago casino, despite the fact that it’s not city owned as she had hoped, and ensuring both Democrats and Republicans could emerge claiming victory. Perspective: “Despite being forced into overtime this weekend after failing to meet its scheduled May 31 adjournment date, the size and scope of Pritzker’s achievements less than six months into office — often with Republican support — represented the release of a pent-up desire among lawmakers to show accomplishments after four years of governmental dysfunction and gridlock due to the ideological battles between former one-term GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled legislature,” the Tribune’s Jamie Munks and Rick Pearson report here. Other winners this legislative session: Casinos, gambling expansion: “It was the prospect of a large-scale construction program that helped push passage of a massive expansion of gambling in the state after more than a decade of unsuccessful efforts to add casinos to Chicago and elsewhere,” the Tribune reports. What it means: After years and years of legislative wrangling, Chicago is getting a casino and will collect one-third of all tax revenue from it. The state would funnel its share from six new casinos statewide along with revenue from legalized sports betting to pay for the repairs of state buildings, part of the $45 billion capital plan also just OK’d by the General Assembly. But with some studies showing casino revenues down, questions loom about whether the expansion will create the windfall lawmakers expect. Next up: The governor is expected to sign the measure into law, but it’s unclear when; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot told reporters this morning that she’ll launch a feasibility study to determine where to put the casino. Weed: Following 10 other states, including nearby Michigan, Illinois legalized adult recreational marijuana possession and sales starting Jan. 1, 2020 — a signature part of Pritzker’s “think big” agenda to create new state revenue. Taxes on the sale of pot along with licensing fees will generate new money that will be used to rebuild and otherwise improve poverty- and crime-ridden communities along with funding substance abuse, mental health and law enforcement services, the Tribune’s Robert McCoppin writes. What it means: ”With the governor’s signature, Illinois would become the first state to create a commercial recreational marijuana industry through the legislature rather than by voter initiative,” the Tribune’s Dan Petrella reported in a separate piece over the weekend. “Supporters hailed the measure as an acknowledgment that the prohibition of marijuana has failed, and they argued that the bill will begin to address decades of racial disparities in the prosecution of drug crimes.” Read the full story here. Next up: The governor will need to sign the bill into law to make it official. Read Tribune reporter McCoppin’s story, which answers all your burning questions about legalizing pot in Illinois, here. Legalizing marijuana: How did your state legislators vote? Check out the nifty Tribune graphic here. Abortion rights advocates: A bill approved by the General Assembly and expected to get the governor’s signature establishes the “fundamental right” of a woman to have an abortion and states that a “fertilized egg, embryo or fetus does not have independent rights,” the Tribune’s Jamie Munks writes. “It repeals the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, doing away with provisions for spousal consent, waiting periods, criminal penalties for physicians who perform abortions and other restrictions on facilities where abortions are performed.” What it means: The measure highlights divergent paths of blue states vs. red states, The Associated Press points out. While red states such as Missouri have moved to tighten restrictions, lawmakers in blue states such as Illinois and California have moved to loosen restrictions. While a number of religious groups see this as a defeat, abortion rights groups are claiming victory, concerned that pending legal cases on abortion could overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case, which legalized abortion nationwide. Next up: The governor is expected to sign the measure, known as the Reproductive Health Act. Gun licensing bill: The measure, which would have increased fees for gun licenses and required all applicants be fingerprinted, won House approval ... despite opposition from lawmakers who said it infringed on Second Amendment rights. But it wasn’t called for a vote in the Illinois Senate. What happened? “… the legislation faced strong opposition, with detractors calling the proposed new regulations among the most ‘onerous’ in the nation and an infringement on their constitutional rights,” according to the Tribune piece. Up next: Proponents, who pushed the measure following a February mass shooting in Aurora — by a revoked Illinois license holder who was not eligible to purchase the handgun he used to kill five people, say they’ll try again. Property tax reform: The Tribune’s Hal Dardick nails it down succinctly — “Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi failed to get his signature reform proposal approved by state lawmakers this spring, a setback for the rookie politician who campaigned on a promise to fix a broken system.” Read his story, which explains how more than a dozen special interest groups flexed their muscle in opposition to the measure, here. What happened? Dardick writes: “The Senate approved the bill, but it hit a roadblock in the House. That chamber is controlled by veteran Speaker Michael Madigan, who owns a property tax appeals firm. Madigan’s firm represents many owners of large commercial buildings that would have been subject to the reporting requirements in Kaegi’s bill.” Dardick notes. Up next: Kaegi says he’ll make a run at trying to pass it in the fall session. Smokers and drivers: The $45 billion building and transportation “infrastructure” plan also will be funded through hikes in cigarette and gas taxes along with license plate fees. The specifics: The state’s $1.98-per-pack cigarette tax goes up $1 and a 6 percent tax pay for public building repairs. Additionally, lawmakers passed a measure that imposes a tax of 6% percent daily and 9% monthly on garage and lot parking, among other things, to help cover the public works measure. Transportation projects under the infrastructure plan also will be funded by doubling the current 19-cent-per-gallon state motor fuel tax, last raised in 1990. Likewise, the state’s $101 license plate fee will jump to $151 annually, while owners of charge electric vehicles will pay $248 a year rather than the current $35 for two years. From the Tribune’s Gregory Pratt, John Byrne and Juan Perez Jr.: “Since 1972, 30 Chicago aldermen have gone to prison for various acts of public corruption. The Silver Shovel series of indictments in the 1990s ensnared six aldermen for pocketing bribes. And Hired Truck in the 2000s caught city officials trading jobs and promotions for campaign help. “The latest scandal to rattle City Hall was outlined Thursday in a federal indictment against Burke, for racketeering and other alleged abuses of power.” Chicago’s new Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, says: “Folks need to get the message. This is a different day, and we’re not going to stand for people who compromise themselves, a lack of integrity in the discharge of their responsibilities. It’s not going to happen, and I’m going to do everything I can to stand for a different set of standards and hopefully encourage other elected officials, other appointed officials, to model this behavior.” Read the full story here. From the Tribune’s Hannah Leone and Gregory Pratt: “del Valle is a longtime figure in city and state politics, with much of his focus in the education arena. He was the first Latino in the state Senate, where he headed the Education Committee. He currently serves on the Illinois Student Assistance Commission and he’s a past chairman of the Illinois P-20 Council, a state education reform group created in 2009. He’s also a former board member of the education advocacy group Advance Illinois and the Illinois Federation for Community Schools. During his time in Springfield, del Valle aligned himself with a group of Latino lawmakers who fashioned themselves as independent from the party bosses and battled against then-Mayor Richard M. Daley’s patronage process. He was a critic of Chicago’s government, which he saw as working more for the occupants of downtown high-rises and tony enclaves than those in struggling neighborhoods. And he was among the Chicago lawmakers who were opposed to the 1995 Republican-led decision to hand over Chicago Public Schools to the mayor, asking at the time if the state was giving Daley “the rope that the mayor of Chicago needs to hang himself with … and take 410,000 children along with him.” Teachers union boss gives Lightfoot’s move a thumbs-down: Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey released a statement after the appointments calling mayoral control of the board “a failure,” criticizing layoffs announced Friday and demanding more resources for classrooms Read the story, which notes that Lightfoot favors an elected school board but didn’t back legislation to do that this legislative session, here.

The mayor campaigned on a promise to make the city safer, yet there is a conundrum, as the Tribune’s Gregory Pratt and Jeremy Gorner reported in mid-May: “Getting too involved with the Police Department’s day-to-day operations can be a political problem. In his bid to succeed Rahm Emanuel as mayor, former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy frequently complained that City Hall meddled with policing. Lightfoot said she doesn’t want to micromanage Chicago cops, but also said it would be ‘foolish for her not to draw on her experience as a federal prosecutor and police accountability official in dealing with the department.’ “I’m not the police superintendent, but my job is to hold people accountable,” Lightfoot said.

Lightfoot said she doesn’t want to micromanage Chicago cops, but also said it would be ‘foolish for her not to draw on her experience as a federal prosecutor and police accountability official in dealing with the department.’ “I’m not the police superintendent, but my job is to hold people accountable,” Lightfoot said.

145,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/politics/on-politics-with-lisa-lerer-trumps-day-of-prayer.html,"Advertisement Supported by On Politics With Lisa Lerer By Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] President Trump isn’t much of a churchgoer. During his time in the White House, his church visits have largely been limited to Christmas and Easter services. When asked for his favorite Bible verse during the 2016 presidential campaign, he replied that he “didn’t want to get into specifics.” He has a habit of autographing Bibles at campaign stops. But Sunday was different. Surprising reporters and pastors, Mr. Trump decided to pop in for a 15-minute stop at McLean Bible Church in Northern Virginia after a round of golf that afternoon. The timing was unusual — most churches conduct Sunday services in the morning — and so was his look, which consisted of golf shoes, a baseball hat and a new slicked-back hairstyle that nabbed most of the headlines. Aides said the president made the stop to pray for the victims of the Virginia Beach shooting. But Elizabeth Dias, The New York Times’s ace national religion correspondent, alerted me to something else that was going on. About a week ago, the evangelical leader Franklin Graham, along with several hundred Christian leaders, called for this past Sunday to be a “special day of prayer” for Mr. Trump. Vice President Mike Pence participated at Sanibel Community Church. So did the Rev. David Platt at McLean Bible Church, who said he was given barely any notice of the president’s visit — and suspected it would divide his congregation. “Sometimes we find ourselves in situations that we didn’t see coming, and we’re faced with a decision in a moment when we don’t have the liberty of deliberation, so we do our best to glorify God,” he said in a statement on the church’s website. “Today, I found myself in one of those situations.” The victims of the shooting, and even the shooting itself, went unmentioned during the visit. So what do we make of Mr. Trump’s decision to find a bit of religion? Over the past two and half years, Washington, the country and the world have had to acclimate to the unpredictable and often unpolitic style of the president. It’s clear that people who want things from the White House have learned one lesson quite well: If you want to curry favor with Mr. Trump, make it about Mr. Trump. We saw that last week, when Japanese officials rolled out the red carpet for Mr. Trump, serving cheeseburgers and even letting him award a 70-pound, eagle-topped President’s Cup to the winner of a sumo wrestling match. We’ll most likely see it this week during his state visit to Britain, where officials are expected to lavish him with ceremony, even as Labour Party leaders boycott the visit. And we saw it with Mr. Trump’s church visit on Sunday, which came — it’s worth noting — less than a day after the president took to Twitter to thank Mr. Graham for his effort. And, on Sunday, Mr. Trump’s white evangelicals did the same, in the language they know best — they gave Mr. Trump a pump-up prayer session in churches around the country, right as the abortion debate reignites as a 2020 campaign issue. Mr. Trump was grateful even before he joined in. On Saturday, he thanked Mr. Graham for the effort. [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.] ____________________ Drop us a line!

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. ____________________ A new investigation from our Climate team found 84 environmental rules and regulations that the Trump administration was trying to eliminate. We asked one of the reporters behind the effort, Kendra Pierre-Louis, to tell us more: When President Trump took office, he did so promising that he would cut regulations. But that’s a broad pledge — it didn’t actually make clear which rules would be changed. To gain some clarity, about a year and a half ago the Climate desk began tracking the environmental regulations that the Trump administration was undoing. For a number of reasons, the definition of a rollback that we settled on focuses on regulatory changes. What this means, for example, is that the E.P.A.’s move to reject a ban on chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that can lead to developmental delays in children, is on our list. The administration’s decision to halt funding for research centers that focus on the risks to children from toxic chemicals, however, is not. Here are a few changes that stood out: • Proposed weakening Obama-era fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks. (The proposal also challenges California’s right to set its own more stringent standards.) • Loosened offshore drilling safety regulations put in effect by the Obama administration after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in 2010. • Revoked President Barack Obama’s executive order that set a goal of cutting the federal government’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent over 10 years. The list is agnostic. It makes no distinction as to whether a rollback is good or bad. But many of the rollbacks, such as the ones that eliminated limits and reporting requirements on methane releases, will delay meaningful action on climate change. And the experts say, when it comes to climate change, we’re quickly running out of time to act. Read the full story here: 84 Environmental Rules on the Way Out Under Trump ____________________ Our colleague Reid Epstein sent us this note today, on the unique circumstances of an article he recently wrote about gun control: I’ve written about the politics of gun control since 2012, when the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School again thrust the issue into the national spotlight. But never before have I had an article about gun politics come hours before a mass shooting. On Friday morning, The Times published my article detailing how, for the first time in a generation, Democratic presidential candidates were debating the best way to combat gun violence. And as some contenders are pushing the political discussion beyond universal background checks, grass-roots groups are calling for a more aggressive approach than is being advocated by the major gun control organizations. On Friday afternoon, a gunman killed a dozen people at a municipal building in Virginia Beach. The 2020 candidates immediately weighed in on Twitter, calling for action. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey used his speech at the California Democratic Party convention on Saturday afternoon to denounce “the normalization of mass murder in our country.” “Our children, getting drills on how to hide underneath desks because children are being murdered in our schools, and we do nothing,” Mr. Booker said. “It is time for us as a nation not to normalize the violence and the carnage of gun violence.” But by Monday, the Virginia Beach shooting had, for the most part, already faded from the news cycle.

147,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/trump-david-platt-prayer-pastors.html?via=rss,"McLean Bible Church’s main campus in Vienna, Virginia, is a 17-minute drive from the Trump National Golf Club, where President Donald Trump spent Sunday morning. Deep into the church’s 1 p.m. service, after pastor David Platt had delivered his sermon, Platt was summoned backstage and told that Trump was on his way and wanted the church to pray for him. In a letter to his congregation published later in the day, Platt explained that he went back out to lead the church’s Communion service, then returned to wait for the president. When Platt walked back onstage, the president was behind him, dressed as if he’d strolled straight off the golf course. “We have a unique opportunity today,” Platt told the congregation. “I want to ask us to bow our heads together now and pray for our president.” Trump had pulled off his white golf hat as he walked onstage and held it in his hands as Platt placed his hand on Trump’s back and prayed for almost three full minutes. In contrast with other pastors who have prayed for Trump, Platt was scrupulously nonpartisan. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, once thanked God at a campaign event for Trump’s willingness to “make America great again.” Platt prayed that God would give Trump wisdom, and that the president would trust God. He did not betray any hints as to whether he believes Trump currently possesses wisdom or currently trusts God. “We pray … that he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice, and good for righteousness, and good for equity, every good path,” Platt said, lifting up his Bible and bowing his head. “We pray that you would give him all the grace he needs to govern in ways … that lead to peaceful and quiet lives, godly and dignified in every way.” The White House told reporters that Trump made the appearance at the church to “pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach.” But that topic did not come up during his brief time at the church, which is more than three hours north of the site of Friday’s mass shooting. The real lure for him, it seems likely, was that evangelist Franklin Graham, a strong Trump supporter, had designated Sunday a “Day of Prayer” for Trump: “If his enemies are allowed to destroy him and pull down the presidency, it will hurt our entire nation,” Graham said in announcing his plans. Trump approved. “We will all stick together and WIN!” he tweeted Saturday in response to Graham’s announcement. “Thank you Franklin.” Platt alluded to Graham’s day of prayer in introducing the president. But he had not publicly signed on to participate in the day, and his prayer did not conform to its nationalistic spirit. If Trump wanted to make an appearance with a pastor who would lavish him with praise and edge up to endorsing him, 40-year-old Platt was an odd choice. As an author, Platt is best known for the 2010 book Radical: Taking Back Your Faith From the American Dream, which, if not exactly radical by most standards, does question the materialism of mainstream American culture. “I wonder if followers of Christ 150 years from now will look back at Christians in America today and ask, ‘How could they live in such big houses? How could they drive such nice cars and wear such nice clothes?’ ” he wrote. “How could they go on with their lives as though the billions of poor didn’t even exist?” David Brooks wrote approvingly of the book in 2010, identifying Platt as a key figure in the cultural recalibration away from wealth-obsessed pre-Recession values—what we might now call “Trump values.” Last year, Platt preached about the perils of nationalism on Fourth of July weekend. Politically, Platt’s entire ministry has been as assiduously nonpartisan as his prayer on Sunday was. Former White House staffer Cliff Sims wrote in Team of Vipers, his recent book about his tenure in the Trump administration, that Sims had wanted to invite Platt to deliver the keynote speech at a White House prayer breakfast. According to Sims, pastor Paula White, a Trump ally, rejected the suggestion because Platt “believes the American dream is evil.” Sims later told Christianity Today that Platt himself had felt conflicted too because of the baggage that comes with being seen as a political pastor. As critics pointed out, Platt may not have praised Trump this past weekend, but he did invite him onstage. “The prayer was very nonpartisan and very inclusive, but at the same time, there’s an image of this pastor with a positive expression on his face laying a hand on Donald Trump and the other hand holding up a Bible, and Trump has his head bowed,” Dan Nejfelt, who works for a national network of progressive faith leaders, told me. “That image conveys Trump is a Christian and a normal leader that Christians can get behind.” Photographs of Platt praying for Trump have already been used to illustrated approving coverage by Breitbart, the Christian Post, and the Christian Broadcasting Network, among others. In his letter to parishioners, Platt wrote that his “aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party.” Referring to a New Testament passage about the importance of praying for everyone, including “kings and all who are in high positions,” Platt wrote about his struggle: I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision. This weighs heavy on my heart. I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God’s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God. … I’m guessing that all of us will face other decisions this week where we don’t have time to deliberate on what to do. I’m praying now for grace and wisdom for all of us to do exactly what we talked about in the Word today: aim for God’s glory, align with God’s purpose, and yield to God’s sovereignty. By all appearances, Platt made an earnest, even sophisticated, attempt to avoid becoming Trump’s minion onstage on Sunday. (A representative of McLean Bible Church did not respond to multiple interview requests.) But declining to mention politics is itself a political act. And public prayer consists of much more than the text of its message. After Platt concluded his prayer for Trump on Sunday, video captured the congregation bursting into sustained applause and hoots of approval so enthusiastic that Trump seemed to linger onstage to enjoy it. It’s not clear that everyone at the church participated, or what exactly the applause meant; members of the musical ensemble looked unenthusiastic, for what it’s worth. Platt shook the president’s hand after the prayer but did not clap for him. He tried, impossibly, to have it both ways: to be on the stage with Trump, and also rise above it.

Craddock, an African-American, was a certified professional engineer who worked for the Virginia Beach public utilities department for 15 years. He was 40 at the time of his death. His resignation letter made public on Monday was typical as far as resignation letters go. ""I want to officially put in my two (2) weeks' notice to vacant (sic) my position of Engineer III with the City of Virginia Beach. It has been a pleasure to serve the City, but due to personal reasons I must relieve my position,"" wrote Craddock. In response, a supervisor wrote Craddock: ""I hope you are able to resolve your personal reasons. To be clear, your last work day will be Friday, June 14, 2019."" ""Thank you. Yes, that is correct,"" replied Craddock. City Manager Dave Hansen clarified that Craddock wasn’t fired or forced to resign. Craddock was in ""good standing"" and had no ongoing discipline issues. Hansen’s appraisal of Craddock jibes with the judgment’s of other people who knew Craddock. A fellow employee described Craddock as a “nice guy” who was quiet and polite. Joseph Scott, a city engineering technician, who knew Craddock, said he ran into Craddock at the men’s restroom of the building minutes before the shooting. After the murders, Scott says he was in complete disbelief after learning later Craddock was the shooter. At a vigil on Saturday morning, Scott said he prayed not only for the victims but also for Craddock. Craddock’s murderous rampage on the afternoon of May 31 began at the parking lot of Building 2 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center where he shot dead a contractor sitting in his car. He then entered the three-storey building and shot people on all three floors. He killed 12 persons and wounded 4 others. The gunman was later killed by city police officer after a prolonged gun battle inside the building. He was armed with two .45 caliber automatic pistols loaded with extended magazines. Police say Craddock fired indiscriminately and there is still no clear indication he was targeting anyone in particular. His resignation letter does not mention a beef with any of his managers or fellow workers. Volunteers carry wood crosses with the names of 12 shooting victims to a makeshift memorial at the Municipal Center June 02, 2019 in Virginia Beach. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Craddock’s crime is the worst non-terrorist workplace shooting in the U.S. In number of fatalities, it is exceeded only by the 14 persons murdered by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, during a murder spree in California in 2015. The Farooks massacred 14 people and wounded 22 others at an office party of his colleagues at the Inland Regional Center for San Bernardino County health workers. Police say Farook was inspired by Islamist militants.

149,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/04/why_so_many_mass_shootings_ask_the_right_questions_and_you_might_find_out_140486.html,"This past weekend, Americans learned of another mass shooting, this time by an employee who decided to murder as many of the people he had worked with for years as possible. As of this writing, the murder toll is 12 people. Every American asks why. What was the killer's motive? When we read there is ""no known motive,"" we are frustrated. Human beings want to make sense of life, especially of evil. Liberals (in this regard, liberals' views are essentially as the same as leftists') are virtually united in ascribing these shootings to guns. Just this past weekend, in a speech in Brazil, former President Barack Obama told an audience: ""Our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon any time -- without much, if any, regulation. They can buy [guns] over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" That the former president fabricated a series of falsehoods about the United States -- and maligned, on foreign soil, the country that twice elected him president -- speaks to his character and to the character of the American news media that have been completely silent about these falsehoods. But the main point here is that, like other liberals and leftists, when Obama addresses the subject of mass shootings -- in Brazil, he had been talking about the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 -- he talks about guns. Yet, America had plenty of guns when its mass murder rate was much lower. Grant Duwe, a Ph.D. in criminology and director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, gathered data going back 100 years in his 2007 book, ""Mass Murder in the United States: A History."" Duwe's data reveal: In the 20th century, every decade before the 1970s had fewer than 10 mass public shootings. In the 1950s, for example, there was one mass shooting. And then a steep rise began. In the 1960s, there were six mass shootings. In the 1970s, the number rose to 13. In the 1980s, the number increased 2 1/2 times, to 32. And it rose again in the 1990s, to 42. As for this century, The New York Times reported in 2014 that, according to the FBI, ""Mass shootings have risen drastically in the past half-dozen years."" Given the same ubiquity of guns, wouldn't the most productive question be what, if anything, has changed since the 1960s and '70s? Of course it would. And a great deal has changed. America is much more ethnically diverse, much less religious. Boys have far fewer male role models in their lives. Fewer men marry, and normal boy behavior is largely held in contempt by their feminist teachers, principals and therapists. Do any or all of those factors matter more than the availability of guns? Let's briefly investigate each factor. Regarding ethnic diversity, the countries that not only have the fewest mass murders but the lowest homicide rates as well are the least ethnically diverse -- such as Japan and nearly all European countries. So, too, the American states that have homicide rates as low as Western European countries are the least ethnically and racially diverse (the four lowest are New Hampshire, North Dakota, Maine and Idaho). Now, America, being the most ethnically and racially diverse country in the world, could still have low homicide rates if a) Americans were Americanized, but the left has hyphenated -- Balkanized, if you will -- Americans, and b) most black males grew up with fathers. Regarding religiosity, the left welcomes -- indeed, seeks -- the end of Christianity in America (though not of Islam, whose robustness it fosters). Why don't we ask a simple question: What percentage of American murderers attend church each week? Regarding boys' need for fathers, in 2008, then-Sen. Obama told an audience: ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools; and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Yet, the Times has published columns and ""studies"" showing how relatively unimportant fathers are, and more and more educated women believe this dangerous nonsense. Then there is marriage: Nearly all men who murder are single. And their number is increasing. Finally, since the 1960s, we have been living in a culture of grievance. Whereas in the past people generally understood that life is hard and/or they have to work on themselves to improve their lives, for half a century, the left has drummed into Americans' minds the belief that their difficulties are caused by American society -- in particular, its sexism, racism and patriarchy. And the more aggrieved people are the more dulled their consciences. When you don't ask intelligent questions, you cannot come up with intelligent answers. So, then, with regard to murder in America, until Americans stop allowing the left to ask the questions, we will have no intelligent answers.

That's how many days have passed so far in 2019. 156. That's how many mass shootings there have been in America in those 153 days. On Friday Virginia Beach  surpassed in infamy Virginia Tech, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, Aurora, and Pittsburgh for being the setting of the deadliest mass shooting this year in the United States. Although statistically mass shootings constitute a fraction of America's more than 32,000 firearm deaths every year, the U.S. outpaces other developed countries in gun deaths. According to United Nations (UN) data, the U.S. experienced 29.7 firearm homicides per 1 million people in 2012. By contrast, Switzerland experienced 7.7 million; Canada, 5.1 million; and Germany, 1.9 million. The U.S. comprises about 4.4 percent of the global population but has 42 percent of the world's civilian-owned guns. Empirical research proves settings where more guns are present increases the likelihood gun violence will ensue. At a Democratic state convention in San Francisco on Saturday, Massachusetts Senator  and presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, stated: ""It's not just mass shootings... on sidewalks and playgrounds and people's backyards. It's happening family by family across the country. And it doesn't get the same headlines. And that is wrong."" New Jersey Senator Cory Booker already has a comprehensive plan for gun-control reform that includes licensing reform and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Speaking to CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, he said: ""We are not helpless to stop this. This is a uniquely American problem. We have carnage in our country that no other nation sees."" He added: ""This idea that we are helpless to stop this, evidence points differently. We know that... licensing like Connecticut did, dropped gun violence in their state by 40%, suicides by 15%. We've allowed the debate to be framed by the corporate gun lobby which has... eroded common sense... enough is enough. We can do things about this problem. We know it. The only thing lacking seems to be a sense of moral urgency. But unfortunately after what happened in Virginia Beach, you see that growing.""

In a year-long series, the Guardian investigates the initiatives that are saving lives in a region scarred by rising inequality and gentrification. Sign up for the series’ newsletter In California’s Silicon Valley, the boom and the bust are playing out simultaneously. Tech companies have made the Bay Area one of the wealthiest places on earth. But on the streets of San Francisco and the cities around it, desperation is increasingly visible. A spiraling housing crisis has made it unaffordable for many people to live in the cities where they work. More than 30,000 people across the region are now homeless, many living in sprawling tent encampments or sleeping in their cars. For each new millionaire household the San Francisco Bay Area has produced, there are at least four new people living below the poverty level. San Francisco’s property crime rate has spiked to the highest in the nation. Many people – tech newcomers and longtime residents alike – complain of feeling unsafe. At the same time, with little fanfare, the Bay Area has seen a dramatic drop in its homicide rate, driven by a considerable decrease in deadly shootings. Across the region, the overall gun homicide rate has dropped 30% in the past decade, a Guardian investigation of homicide data across more than 100 cities has found. This homicide analysis is the first installment in a year-long Guardian series exploring how the Bay Area is defying expectations on gun violence amid growing inequality and economic pressures. Advocates and policy makers are already looking at the region to see what worked. One 2020 candidate, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, has cited Oakland’s success in reducing gun violence in his national platform to reduce violence nationwide. The Guardian’s series will investigate what really works to reduce the daily toll of shootings across the United States, and expose common myths and lies about gun violence in the country. Our analysis of homicide data from 2007 to 2017, across more than 100 cities and towns in the 12 counties of California’s Bay Area, has found: The Bay Area still sees nearly 300 gun homicides each year. But these changes are profound. The majority of America’s gun homicide victims are black, killed in everyday shootings in segregated, economically struggling neighborhoods in cities such as Oakland and Richmond. It’s this everyday toll of violence, not mass shooting casualties, that drives America’s gun homicide rate 25 times higher than those of other wealthy countries. Homicides dropped much sharper across the Bay Area in the past decade than in the nation as a whole. Between 2007 and 2017, the homicide rate for the whole Bay Area fell by more than 30%. The nation’s overall homicide rate fell only about 7% between those years. Cities such as Chicago, St Louis and Baltimore have seen their number of residents lost to violence rise. The Bay Area is being reshaped by gentrification, rising housing prices, and the displacement of longtime residents from cities such as Oakland and San Francisco. But the total number of gun homicides is down across the region as a whole. The gentrifying cities of Oakland, Richmond and San Francisco became dramatically safer, recording 25 to 40 fewer gun violence deaths each year. Many other cities in the area saw modest decreases in gun homicides, or relatively little change. There have been small upticks in annual gun homicides in Antioch, Hayward, Vallejo, and San Jose, among other cities. But the increases were small – two, three, or six additional gun homicides each year. Stockton, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 in the wake of the foreclosure crisis, is the only city that has seen a substantial increase in its gun homicide rate between 2007 and 2017, the last year of the Guardian’s analysis. It saw its annual number of gun homicides increase from 23 to 42. The bottom line: the huge drops in Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco far outpaced the small upticks in other cities, leading to a net decrease in fatal violence. In the Bay Area cities that historically have seen the worst burden of violence, daily gun homicides have fallen dramatically, the Guardian’s analysis shows. Cities that once ranked among the nation’s deadliest, such as Oakland and Richmond, have seen enormous decreases over the past decade. These are not single-year drops in killings, but declines sustained over multiple years. There’s early evidence that local violence prevention strategies – including a refocused, more community-driven “Ceasefire” policing strategy, and intensive support programs that do not involve law enforcement at all – were a “key change” contributing to these huge decreases. Gun homicide rates for all races have fallen, but the drop was largest for black Bay Area residents: a 40% decrease. In the past 10 years, tens of thousands of black residents have moved out of Oakland and San Francisco, as skyrocketing rents and housing prices have made the cities increasingly unaffordable. But in the region as a whole, the total number of black residents has remained steady, as the number of black residents living in the Bay Area’s outlying suburbs has increased, according to annual census estimates. Even with the decrease, stark racial disparities remain. The risk of being killed with a gun is still 22 times higher for black residents than white residents across the region, and many black residents who live in neighborhoods long burdened by violence say they don’t yet feel safe. “These areas are still dangerous. It’s the same trauma people are going through,” said Mya Whitaker, a 27-year old foster youth counselor who grew up in East Oakland and still lives there. “One false move can get you killed out here.” Black residents are still 10 times more likely to be killed by gun violence than others, despite the large decrease in the gun homicide rate over the last few years. Guardian graphic | Source: California Department of Justice; US Census Bureau “There’s still a lot going on that the statistics don’t always capture,” said Tyjohn “TJ” Sykes, 26, who works in Richmond’s RYSE Youth Center and runs a workshop on what safety means for young residents. “Someone could come through your neighborhood shooting every night, but if they don’t hit anyone and it doesn’t get recorded that doesn’t heighten my sense of safety.” The decrease in overall violence also hasn’t brought about a corresponding drop in police shootings. An average of at least 14 people were killed by the police each year, most by gunfire, but some killed by other means, in the greater Bay Area since 2007, according to reports compiled by the state attorney general. But the change in the gun homicide rate translates into hundreds of fewer people killed across the Bay Area over the past decade. In 2017 alone, the region suffered 111 fewer gun homicides, and 151 fewer total homicides, than a decade before. Projected homicides based on 2007 rates, compared to actual Guardian Graphic | Source: California Department of Justice; US Census Bureau As officials in cities such as Oakland have touted the progress in gun violence numbers, they have repeatedly faced the same question: is the drop in gun violence just a result of gentrification? Local leaders and activists have said the assumption is deeply flawed. “The idea that gentrification is more responsible for the reduction in shootings and homicides is offensive to the hundreds of outreach workers, community members and practitioners on the frontlines actually doing this work daily,” said Pastor Michael McBride, a Bay Area activist who leads a national campaign to end gun violence and mass incarceration. An academic study of gun violence in Oakland neighborhoods found that the city’s focused deterrence strategy, known as “Ceasefire”, significantly reduced shootings, even when accounting for the level of gentrification in different areas. Still, the fact that big drops in gun violence are coming at the same time as intense gentrification and displacement has raised troubling questions for some local activists about who will get to benefit from living in a safer Oakland – and whose interests the decreases in shootings may ultimately serve. Some violence intervention workers themselves have been priced out of Oakland, and can no longer afford to live in the city where they are working to prevent shootings and help survivors of violence, according to Anne Marks, the executive director of Youth ALIVE!, a local nonprofit. Wayne Clarke, the executive director of the Oakland Impact Center, said that, to the young men he mentors in East Oakland, it sometimes looks like, “the system, or public safety, cares more about the city, now that there’s gentrification and you’ve got big businesses and you’ve got dollars and you’ve got white people moving in,” Clarke said. “Before, it was just a city full of poor people, and we’re just going to let them kill each other.” “As we make the city safer, are we opening up the floodgates more for gentrification? That’s what it feels like,” Clarke said. “Are we cleaning up the city for other people to move in?” It may be impossible to pinpoint exactly what factors are driving the changes in the Bay Area, experts say. Violence is complex, shaped by a multitude of elements and dynamics. But some wider trends are clear. The Bay Area’s drop in gun violence does not reflect a drop in overall “crime”. The rate of property crimes such as theft and burglary have decreased only 16% across the region as gun violence has fallen by nearly a third. San Francisco has seen its property crime rate increase even as the number of people killed in gun homicides has dropped. Criminal justice reforms have reduced the number of residents spending their lives behind bars. Since 2006, California’s state prison population has fallen by 25%, in part due to a 2014 voter-approved ballot measure that reduced the criminal penalties for nonviolent drug crimes and theft. The Bay Area’s county jails are incarcerating thousands fewer on a daily basis than they did a decade ago. California has the strongest gun laws in the country, and it’s enacted more than 30 new gun control laws since 2009 alone, according to Robyn Thomas, the executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun legislation nationwide. At the same time, Thomas said: “few of the laws enacted in the last 10 years would have been expected to entirely explain the significant reductions in the Bay Area.” It was investment in local prevention strategies in Oakland, Richmond and San Francisco that was likely the “key change” that most significantly drove the recent 30% drop in gun homicides, she argued, though the “cumulative impact” of dozens of California gun laws enacted since the 1990s likely contributed to a decrease in violence. Far right politicians have ramped up efforts to stoke xenophobia in recent years by linking violent crime to immigrants. But the Bay Area has long been racially and ethnically diverse, and diversity has increased over the past decade as more Latin American and Asian immigration moved in and more white residents moved away, census data shows. About 600,000 current Bay Area residents were born in Mexico, according to the most recent estimates. And over the past decade, the number of people immigrating from the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, has increased. Nor have policies to shield undocumented immigrants led to violence, as Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies often warn. San Francisco saw a 49% drop in its gun homicide rate as it held to its pro-immigrant law enforcement policies. Local community-led efforts do appear to play a role in the reduction, according to the Giffords Center, which recently released a policy paper examining Oakland’s gun violence decrease called A Case Study in Hope. You’ll get an email each time we release a part of our investigation. At the heart of the different strategies Bay Area cities are using are the same basic elements: data, dollars, and community leadership, including leadership from formerly incarcerated residents. “The common context among each of these cities – Richmond, Oakland, and San Francisco – is that they have adopted community-driven, non-law enforcement approaches, and they’ve been robustly funded,” said DeVone Boggan, who lead Richmond’s Office of Neighborhood Safety as it developed a nationally recognized fellowship program for men at highest risk of violence. Boggan now leads leads Advance Peace, an organization spreading that strategy to more cities. “We have to extend the idea of what public safety is beyond policing and incarceration, to include these things like intervention, outreach and neighborhood empowerment,” Boggan said. “That’s the game changer. That’s the difference-maker.” Longtime community outreach workers and violence interrupters, many of whom are formerly incarcerated, are crucial to making these public health strategies effective, experts across the region said. Finally, better analysis of who’s behind the violence has helped law enforcement, social services and community groups intervene more effectively. In Oakland, for example, a 2017 study of every homicide that occurred over 18 months showed that only 0.16% of Oakland’s population, about 700 high-risk men, were responsible for the majority of the homicides. And any reckoning should also give credit to the individual men who are deciding not to shoot, said Boggan. “The individuals at the center of these conflicts are making healthier decisions,” Boggan said. “I think these individuals have to be a productive part of the solution. They have to be embraced and brought into the discussion.” One of the early participants in Richmond’s fellowship program graduated from college last year and is preparing to start business school this fall. “Gun violence is pretty much a form of disease. Once it starts affecting one person, it starts spreading,” said the former fellow, who asked that his name not be published. In the summer of 2004, as a 16-year-old high school student, he was shot while listening to the Fourth of July fireworks in his hometown of Richmond. The shooting changed his perspective -- and his behavior. “I wasn’t even thinking about carrying. I was playing football. All of a sudden, I think I need a gun,” he said. He ended up going to jail for carrying a gun illegally. Years later, the Office of Neighborhood Safety’s peacemaker fellowship sent him on trips, including to Washington, DC and London, with other young men caught up in the long-running cycle of local fights and retaliations. The fellowship helped him develop and realize a new vision for his life. He ended up graduating from the historically black college he had visited on one of the trips--a place, he said, where “I didn’t have to watch over my shoulder.” “To have somebody who believes in you, and knows you’ve got the potential to go for it, stuff like that makes you want to keep going right,” he said. The Guardian analyzed crime statistics from the California Department of Justice, which includes information on all homicides reported to the state from law enforcement agencies between 1987 and 2017. This report focuses on the homicide and gun homicide rates from 12 San Francisco Bay Area counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Joaquin, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, and Sonoma. Changes in gun homicide rates over the past decade were calculated using a two-year rolling average, comparing 2006/2007 with 2016/2017, which experts say captures crime trends more accurately than single-year comparisons. Using a three-year rolling average produced very similar results: there was a 31% decline in the Bay Area’s overall gun homicide rate using a two-year rolling average, and a 28% reduction using a three-year rolling average. The overall counts of homicides, as well as homicides committed with a firearm, were compared to population data from the California Department of Finance’s Demographic Research Unit, to calculate the homicide and gun homicide rates per 100,000 people. The arrows on the map are sized using the change in two-year average gun homicide count (2006/2007 versus 2016/2017), and the overall number of gun homicides in that jurisdiction. Only jurisdictions that had at least one gun homicide in 2006-2007 are shown. The “Homicide Rates” graph uses national murder rates from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting data tool for data from 1987-2014, and the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer for the latest UCR data in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Race-specific gun homicide rates were calculated using data about the race of gun homicide victims from the California Department of Justice, and the count of individuals in each county who identify with that race alone in the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates program. The two-year average (2006-2007 and 2016-2017) gun homicide rates are used, for more a stable representation of the change. Estimated homicides were projected based on the 2006-2007 two-year homicide rate, extrapolating using the population of every county in the current year.

What happened?,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
153,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/why-so-many-mass-shootings-ask-the-right-questions-and-you-might-find-out/,"This past weekend, Americans learned of another mass shooting, this time by an employee who decided to murder as many of the people he had worked with for years as possible. As of this writing, the murder toll is 12 people. Every American asks why. What was the killer’s motive? When we read there is “no known motive,” we are frustrated. Human beings want to make sense of life, especially of evil. Liberals (in this regard, liberals’ views are essentially the same as leftists’) are virtually united in ascribing these shootings to guns. Just this past weekend, in a speech in Brazil, former President Barack Obama told an audience: “Our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon any time — without much, if any, regulation. They can buy (guns) over the internet. They can buy machine guns.” That the former president fabricated a series of falsehoods about the United States — and maligned, on foreign soil, the country that twice elected him president — speaks to his character and to the character of the American news media that have been completely silent about these falsehoods. But the main point here is that, like other liberals and leftists, when Obama addresses the subject of mass shootings — in Brazil, he had been talking about the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 — he talks about guns. Yet, America had plenty of guns when its mass murder rate was much lower. Grant Duwe, a Ph.D. in criminology and director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, gathered data going back 100 years in his 2007 book, “Mass Murder in the United States: A History.” Duwe’s data reveal: In the 20th century, every decade before the 1970s had fewer than 10 mass public shootings. In the 1950s, for example, there was one mass shooting. And then a steep rise began. In the 1960s, there were six mass shootings. In the 1970s, the number rose to 13. In the 1980s, the number increased 2 1/2 times, to 32. And it rose again in the 1990s, to 42. As for this century, The New York Times reported in 2014 that, according to the FBI, “Mass shootings have risen drastically in the past half-dozen years.” Given the same ubiquity of guns, wouldn’t the most productive question be what, if anything, has changed since the 1960s and ’70s? Of course it would. And a great deal has changed. America is much more ethnically diverse, much less religious. Boys have far fewer male role models in their lives. Fewer men marry, and normal boy behavior is largely held in contempt by their feminist teachers, principals and therapists. Do any or all of those factors matter more than the availability of guns? Let’s briefly investigate each factor. Regarding ethnic diversity, the countries that not only have the fewest mass murders but the lowest homicide rates as well are the least ethnically diverse — such as Japan and nearly all European countries. So, too, the American states that have homicide rates as low as Western European countries are the least ethnically and racially diverse (the four lowest are New Hampshire, North Dakota, Maine and Idaho). Now, America, being the most ethnically and racially diverse country in the world, could still have low homicide rates if a) Americans were Americanized, but the left has hyphenated — Balkanized, if you will — Americans, and b) most black males grew up with fathers. Regarding religiosity, the left welcomes — indeed, seeks — the end of Christianity in America (though not of Islam, whose robustness it fosters). Why don’t we ask a simple question: What percentage of American murderers attend church each week? Regarding boys’ need for fathers, in 2008, then-Sen. Obama told an audience: “Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools; and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” Yet, the Times has published columns and “studies” showing how relatively unimportant fathers are, and more and more educated women believe this dangerous nonsense. Then there is marriage: Nearly all men who murder are single. And their number is increasing. Finally, since the 1960s, we have been living in a culture of grievance. Whereas in the past people generally understood that life is hard and/or they have to work on themselves to improve their lives, for half a century, the left has drummed into Americans’ minds the belief that their difficulties are caused by American society — in particular, its sexism, racism and patriarchy. And the more aggrieved people are the more dulled their consciences. When you don’t ask intelligent questions, you cannot come up with intelligent answers. So, then, with regard to murder in America, until Americans stop allowing the left to ask the questions, we will have no intelligent answers.

154,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/opinion/trump-impeachment-congress.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Advertisement Supported by The conversation Will we ever get there — and should we even go there? By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Gail Collins: Bret, what do you think about the Yankees? Who’s going to win the N.B.A. finals? Are you getting ready for football? Never had a sports conversation in my life until we got this president. Now I’ll do pretty much anything to get him off my mind. But, sigh, to get down to business: Are you still opposed to impeachment? Bret: I think most Americans will gladly learn the words to “O Canada” just to see Golden State defeated. And I’m looking forward to a Yankees-Dodgers World Series in the fall. As for football, it’s a dumb and dangerous game of maximum brutality and minimal movement. Just like impeachment. Gail: This is one of the best transitions ever. Bret: Impeachment will not end Donald Trump’s presidency, since the Senate will never vote to convict. Impeachment is more likely to help Trump politically than it is to hurt him. Impeachment will have to be based on an interpretation of the Mueller report that is, at the very least, contestable. Impeachment will further polarize the country and consume the country’s attention away from everything else. And finally, if the real purpose of impeachment is to censure the president for his wretched behavior, why not just pass a motion of censure, as I’ve been urging for a while? Gail: I have to admit I’m sliding a tad toward the I-word. Just as a matter of principle. Trump tried to stop the Mueller investigation. He told his White House counsel to lie. Even if there’s no proof that the president knew during the campaign that his team was working in tandem with the Russians, he certainly tried to cover it up later, by dangling the possibility of a pardon in front of Paul Manafort. Bret: I have the same temptation. Just trying to resist it. Go on. Gail: I’d like to think future generations could look back and say — hey, the American people wouldn’t stand for a president attempting to obstruct justice. So they got rid of him. But maybe you’re right that we should just focus on the next election. Speaking of which, are you disappointed that the Republican Party doesn’t seem to be able to cough up any serious, principled opposition that would take Trump on in a primary? Bret: Wait, you don’t believe that Bill Weld has the G.O.P. nomination in the bag? The surrender of the mainstream Republican Party to Trump will be a matter of political and even psychological analysis for decades to come. It is the transformation of a party into a cult. It is the triumph of hatred — of the left, of elites, of immigrants from s-hole countries — over principle. It is the collapse of moral judgment before the blandishments of political power. What’s particularly remarkable is how thorough the collapse has been among the conservative intelligentsia. Right-wing intellectuals don’t go along with Trump despite his despicable personality; they do so, quite openly, because of it. They’ve concluded that he’s just the sort of blunt instrument they need to “own the libs.” And in a way they are right: Trump does make the left go nuts. It’s just that, in the process, he’s doing incalculable damage to our political culture. Gail: I don’t buy into the theory that liberals are going into some kind of left-wing Trumpist tailspin. I’m old enough to remember the antiwar/student power/black power era of the ’60s and ’70s, when the left was way more radical, and the rhetoric was even more over the top than it is now. But the yelling was filtered through the press. There was no Twitter or Facebook or blogging, so it was easier to ignore. Bret: Key point. Gail: Look at the Democratic presidential candidates. There’s a lot of competition for the populist vote, but very few of them are tossing out hate-the-right sound bites. Unless you consider calls for impeachment to be extreme. Which is hard to do, given that we discuss the possibility very seriously all the time. Bret: I definitely don’t think calling for impeachment is extreme. I’ve called for it myself over his violations of campaign-finance laws, before thinking better of it. Then again, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado and long-shot presidential hopeful, got booed the other day by a Democratic audience in San Francisco for saying that socialism wasn’t the answer. There’s a made-for-TV moment for the Trump campaign. Other things that will help Trump: calls for slavery reparations, the Green New Deal, early prison release for violent felons. Gail: Socialism gets a raw deal. I know people are afraid of it, but when you compare it with Trumpian capitalism, it looks pretty damned good. However, I acknowledge that it isn’t a popular clarion call for a general election. Which is why getting booed for saying it isn’t the answer would be a great video if said candidate wants to appeal to moderates in the general election. Bret: I know I sound like a broken record, but the Democratic candidate is going to be the underdog in the election, no matter what the polls say right now. Trumpian capitalism has produced a strong economy and incumbents usually get re-elected. That means the candidate will have to lean strongly to the center to win. Gail: Well, not if a certain someone starts imposing tariffs all over the place. … Bret: Tariffs: otherwise known as unnecessary taxes on American consumers and affronts to American allies. In the meantime, there’s the real world to think about. I was struck, Gail, by the contrast between the massacre that took place in Virginia Beach on Friday and the recent attack on a group of schoolchildren at a bus stop in Kawasaki, Japan, by a man who killed two people, one of them an 11-year-old girl. The difference, of course, is that the American killer had a gun and the Japanese killer had a pair of knives. Gail: You know, we’re going to go down the agreement trail again here. But we can’t talk about this enough, so go on. Bret: I wish these contrasts would be drawn more often. Since I joined The Times just over two years ago, we’ve had massacres in Las Vegas (58 dead; more than 800 wounded or injured); Sutherland Springs (26; 20); Stoneman Douglas High School (17; 17); Thousand Oaks (12, 18); and the Tree of Life synagogue (11, 6). And those are just the worst ones that I can name. Is there some formula where people actually start to notice the cumulative cost? Or are we doomed to live with this? Gail: If there was going to be some moment when a mass shooting of innocents would trigger dramatic changes in the gun laws, we’d have taken care of the whole issue years ago after Sandy Hook. But all you get is nibbles, like the bump stock ban. The Virginia Beach tragedy has sparked interest in making it harder to buy gun silencers — it’s frankly not all that easy now, but I don’t see any reason they should be available, period. Bret: Well, how else am I supposed to play at being James Bond if not with a wide selection of silencers to choose from? Sorry, go on. Gail: The semi-collapse of the National Rifle Association because of internal corruption may make it easier for congressional candidates to run on rational gun platforms. And virtually everybody in the Democratic presidential field is already there. So I’m hoping for hope. Bret: The battle between Oliver North and Wayne LaPierre at the N.R.A. reminded me of Henry Kissinger’s quip about the Iran-Iraq War: It’s a pity both sides can’t lose. Come to think of it, “Can’t both sides lose?” would be a pretty good parlor game — past and present, fictional or nonfictional. Steve Bannon and Donald Trump, Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio, Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Bolton from “Game of Thrones.” Or Brangelina. Plenty of intriguing pairings to consider. On a more serious note, this week is the 30th anniversary of both the 1989 massacre of student protesters at Tiananmen Square and the 75th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day landings, which Trump is now commemorating with his visit to the U.K. and the Normandy beaches in France. These should be solemn occasions, but Trump has managed to vulgarize the moment yet again with his gratuitous attacks on the mayor of London and Meghan Markle. After this presidency, will we ever be able to recover a sense of solemnity in our politics? Gail: Would you hate it if I said that trivial times breed trivial politics? It’s true we have many, many profound issues facing the country — climate change being maybe the biggest of the big. But we’re not in any major international conflict and the economy is really good. In 2016, a lot of voters may have felt they could enjoy the luxury of being cranky and polarized because there weren’t any crises calling us to pull together. Next time, let’s discuss whether there’s anybody on the political horizon who could bring us time-of-crisis solidarity without actually requiring the crisis.

On Tuesday night Northern Territory police arrested the suspected shooter on a Darwin city street. He remains under police guard in a Darwin hospital, with police expected to lay charges on Wednesday.  On Wednesday the NT police commissioner Reece Kershaw said the man, who was released from jail on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time of the shooting and was “well known to us”. The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. A man was killed at the motel before three other deaths occurred at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Witness Leah Potter told the Today Show she had followed a police officer to the scene of the shooting at the motel. “We followed him, and the scene that we came across, I could not even believe that this could happen in Darwin,” she said. “A man had come through the Palms Motel and shot every window.” She said the man was looking for someone, and after shooting up the motel he allegedly found his target and shot him dead. Potter said the man was well known. “He’s a local Darwin lad that all of us know. So it’s quite shocking,” she said. Kershaw confirmed that the suspect had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time. A shotgun was used but its exact type is not yet known. “We’re still trying to establish the intent and the motivation behind this,” Kershaw told reporters. He said the shooting was not terrorism-related. Asked if the man was a member of the Rebels motorcycle gang, Kershaw said he may have associated with them. Kershaw said the man may have been trying to hand himself in to police and urged members of the public who had information or video footage to contact the force. Witnesses told the ABC that the man had walked into the Palms Motel and opened fire with a pump-action shotgun just before 6pm on Tuesday. A group of about a dozen men who were friends and relatives of a man who died at the motel gathered outside after the shooting, many in tears. Matthew James was standing in a car park nears the Palms when it all began. “It was just surreal,” he told Nine’s Today program on Wednesday. “All of a sudden there were these gunshots. “Moments later someone came running towards me carrying this woman who was covered in blood and just basically put her at my feet and she was screaming that she had been shot. “The guy that actually carried her up was pretty frantic at the time, saying he had opened the door and there was a gunman there with a shotgun and he proceeded to fire upon anybody inside the building.” James said the woman was hysterical. “She was caught up in it, she said, ‘I’ve been shot, I don’t know why, I don’t have anything to do with anything.’ The woman told James the shooter had been going from room to room, firing his gun and shouting the name of a man – Alex. “It just seems so insane,” James said. Chris Dalgleish, who was having a beer on the balcony of the Frontier Hotel pub across the road from the Palms, said people had raced inside when they realised someone was shooting. “Everyone started jumping inside, then locking doors and windows and went to the back corner,” he told Australian Associated Press. John Rose told the ABC he had seen a gunman walk into the motel with “a sawn-off shotgun”. “He shot up all the rooms and he went to every room looking for somebody and he shot them all up. Then we saw him rush out, jump into his Toyota pick-up, and rush off.” He said the gunman had appeared calm. “Once he left we went in and found one gentleman, he’s over there, we pulled him out,” Rose said. Leah Potter said the gunman had been armed with a pump-action shotgun and had shot a woman through her hotel room door. “I was in the car park [of a neighbouring hotel] when I heard what I thought were fireworks going off, really loud cracking, banging fireworks,” she told the ABC. “This lady turned up and started screaming, and we didn’t realise there was another person in there … apparently he’s dead, he’s been shot.” The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, said thoughts were with the families and friends of the victims. “This is not the Darwin we know,” he told reporters. A police duty superintendent, Lee Morgan, told the Guardian shortly after the shooting there were “four deceased and a number of other people who have been shot”.

As of this writing, the murder toll is 12 people. Every American asks why. What was the killer's motive? When we read there is ""no known motive,"" we are frustrated. Human beings want to make sense of life, especially of evil. Liberals (in this regard, liberals' views are essentially as the same as leftists') are virtually united in ascribing these shootings to guns. Just this past weekend, in a speech in Brazil, former President Barack Obama told an audience: ""Our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon any time -- without much, if any, regulation. They can buy (guns) over the internet. They can buy machine guns."" That the former president fabricated a series of falsehoods about the United States -- and maligned, on foreign soil, the country that twice elected him president -- speaks to his character and to the character of the American news media that have been completely silent about these falsehoods. But the main point here is that, like other liberals and leftists, when Obama addresses the subject of mass shootings -- in Brazil, he had been talking about the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 -- he talks about guns. Yet, America had plenty of guns when its mass murder rate was much lower. Grant Duwe, a Ph.D. in criminology and director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, gathered data going back 100 years in his 2007 book, ""Mass Murder in the United States: A History."" Duwe's data reveal: In the 20th century, every decade before the 1970s had fewer than 10 mass public shootings. In the 1950s, for example, there was one mass shooting. And then a steep rise began. In the 1960s, there were six mass shootings. In the 1970s, the number rose to 13. In the 1980s, the number increased 2 1/2 times, to 32. And it rose again in the 1990s, to 42. As for this century, The New York Times reported in 2014 that, according to the FBI, ""Mass shootings have risen drastically in the past half-dozen years."" Given the same ubiquity of guns, wouldn't the most productive question be what, if anything, has changed since the 1960s and '70s? Of course it would. And a great deal has changed. America is much more ethnically diverse, much less religious. Boys have far fewer male role models in their lives. Fewer men marry, and normal boy behavior is largely held in contempt by their feminist teachers, principals and therapists. Do any or all of those factors matter more than the availability of guns? Let's briefly investigate each factor. Regarding ethnic diversity, the countries that not only have the fewest mass murders but the lowest homicide rates as well are the least ethnically diverse -- such as Japan and nearly all European countries. So, too, the American states that have homicide rates as low as Western European countries are the least ethnically and racially diverse (the four lowest are New Hampshire, North Dakota, Maine and Idaho). Now, America, being the most ethnically and racially diverse country in the world, could still have low homicide rates if a) Americans were Americanized, but the left has hyphenated -- Balkanized, if you will -- Americans, and b) most black males grew up with fathers. Regarding religiosity, the left welcomes -- indeed, seeks -- the end of Christianity in America (though not of Islam, whose robustness it fosters). Why don't we ask a simple question: What percentage of American murderers attend church each week? Regarding boys' need for fathers, in 2008, then-Sen. Obama told an audience: ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools; and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Yet, the Times has published columns and ""studies"" showing how relatively unimportant fathers are, and more and more educated women believe this dangerous nonsense. Then there is marriage: Nearly all men who murder are single. And their number is increasing. Finally, since the 1960s, we have been living in a culture of grievance. Whereas in the past people generally understood that life is hard and/or they have to work on themselves to improve their lives, for half a century, the left has drummed into Americans' minds the belief that their difficulties are caused by American society -- in particular, its sexism, racism and patriarchy. And the more aggrieved people are the more dulled their consciences. When you don't ask intelligent questions, you cannot come up with intelligent answers. So, then, with regard to murder in America, until Americans stop allowing the left to ask the questions, we will have no intelligent answers.

Ralph Northam is summoning lawmakers back to the state Capitol to consider a package of gun-control legislation, saying Friday's mass shooting in Virginia Beach calls for ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers."" Northam also said Tuesday that he wants every state lawmaker go on record for or against his proposals during the special session this summer, rather than let leaders shield them from tough votes by killing them subcommittees. ""I ask that the members of the General Assembly engage in an open and transparent debate and that the bills brought before the legislature are put to a vote by the entire General Assembly,"" Northam said. ""The nation will be watching."" The Democrat said in an Associated Press interview ahead of his announcement that he wants the Republican-controlled legislature to hear from the public about the need for ""common-sense"" laws. A top GOP lawmaker signaled Monday that he's open to a legislative debate, but doesn't expect Northam's bills to pass. ""Show Virginians that it doesn't matter what party you are in, we all our Virginians first, and we care about the safety and security of every Virginian no matter who they are or where they live,"" he added. Virginia Beach city employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines on Friday to kill 12 people, all but one them colleagues he had worked with for years. Craddock was mortally wounded in an intense gunbattle with police. Northam's bills include legislation that directly relates to Friday's shooting, such as a ban on silencers and high capacity ammunition magazines, as well as broadening the ability of local governments to limit guns in city buildings. But he said other recent shootings, including the death last month of a 9-year-old girl who was shot at a community cookout in Richmond, are also driving his call for a special session. ""It's an emergency here in Virginia, and it's time to take action,"" Northam told the AP. ""Every one of these pieces of legislation will save lives."" Northam said he also wants votes on mandating universal background checks before gun purchases, limiting purchases to one handgun per month and a so-called red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily seize someone's guns if they are a shown to be threat to themselves or others. The governor has long advocated for stricter gun control. He made the issue a top priority of his 2017 gubernatorial campaign, drawing from his experience as a pediatrician and Army doctor who has treated children and soldiers wounded by firearms. Most of the legislation already proposed by Northam and other Democrats has failed in Virginia, where Republicans hold slim majorities in the House and Senate. This is a closely watched election year in the state, when all 140 legislative seats are up for grabs. Virginia law doesn't give a governor any say in how a special session is conducted. While GOP Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment indicated Monday that there's some willingness to debate whether to ban large-capacity magazines, according to the Virginia Gazette, he told gun-control advocates outside his office on Monday that ""nothing would have helped us in Virginia Beach."" Craddock appeared to have had no felony record, making him eligible to purchase guns. Government investigators identified two .45-caliber pistols used in the attack and all indications are that he purchased them legally in 2016 and 2018, said Ashan Benedict, the regional special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Friday's shooting has been Northam's first major test since a scandal over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook nearly drove him from office four months ago. The governor has been active in helping coordinate the state's response and comforting victims, while also pressing the case for stricter gun control. A top gun rights advocate denounced the special session as ""political theater,"" and called it ""pure baloney"" that silencers mask the sound of gun shots. Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, said ""there's really nothing other than allowing people to protect themselves until the police get there that would have worked."" In his AP interview, the governor flatly denied that he's ""playing politics.""

Tuesday, 04 June 2019 10:40 AM Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced on Tuesday that he'll recall lawmakers to the state Capitol in the coming weeks to take up a package of gun-control legislation, which he said is urgently needed to prevent killings like Friday's mass shooting in Virginia Beach. Northam said he plans to convene a special legislative session this summer. The Democrat said in an Associated Press interview ahead of his announcement that he wants the Republican-controlled General Assembly to hear from the public about the need for ""common-sense"" law related to guns and accessories. Republicans have previously rejected Northam's gun control bills out of hand, but a top GOP lawmaker signaled Monday that he's open to a legislative debate. Northam's announcement comes less than a week after Virginia Beach city employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to kill 12 people, all but one them colleagues he had worked with for years, and injure several others. Craddock was then killed in an intense gunbattle with police during which a bullet hit one officer in a bulletproof vest. Northam's package of bills includes legislation that directly relates to Friday's shooting __ including a ban on silencers and high capacity ammunition magazines as well as broadening the ability of local governments to limit guns in city buildings. But Northam said other recent shootings, including the death last month of a 9-year-old girl who was shot at a community cookout in Richmond, are also driving his call for a special session.

But GOP Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment indicated Monday that there's some willingness to debate whether to ban large-capacity magazines, according to the Virginia Gazette.

Northam hinted Saturday in news interviews that he may be considering some kind of executive action related to gun control efforts that would bypass the legislature, but his office declined to say what specific actions he may take. Republicans did not immediately comment on Northam's plans for a special session, but some of Northam's opponents have said the governor is trying to use Friday's shooting to deflect attention from his own troubles.

164,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Updated-Data-Mass-Shooter-by-David-Swanson-Mass-Shooting-190604-331.html,"Mother Jones magazine has updated its database of U.S. mass shootings. I've downloaded it and made a few changes, before posting it here. The main change I've made has been to add a column indicating whether
 the shooter was a U.S. military veteran. I've also deleted some of the 
shooting incidents, reducing the list from 111 to 97 shootings. I've 
done this, just as I had done previously,
 in order to be able to make an accurate comparison to the general 
population. Relatively few women are veterans or shooters, and the 
incidents of shootings by women seem too few to draw comparisons from. 
Looking at men only, the percentage who are veterans in the U.S. 
population varies dramatically by age group. So, I've removed shootings 
by women or by men under 18 or over 59. I've also deleted one shooting 
that was an attack on the U.S. military by a foreign-born shooter, as it
 seems irrelevant to ask if that shooter had been in the U.S. military. 
As blowback, however, that shooting involved the U.S. military as much 
as any other. Looking at the 97 shootings in the remaining database, I've marked 34
 of them as being committed by U.S. military veterans. In two cases, 
this indicates a veteran of JROTC, one of whom may or may not have had 
further participation in the military. These two were trained in 
shooting at public expense by the U.S. military, although at least one 
of them was not yet a member of or veteran of the military. I have not 
included as veterans shooters who had been security guards or prison 
guards. I have not included as veterans shooters who were on record 
describing their future crime in explicitly military terms as if 
participating in and referencing by name the U.S. military, unless I 
could determine that they had actually been in the U.S. military. I have
 left on the list of 97 a small number of foreign-born shooters, who may
 or may not have been trained by foreign militaries, and some of whom 
could not have legally joined the U.S. military; none of these are among
 the 34 marked as veterans. Also among the 97 are at least two men who 
tried to join the U.S. military and were rejected; they are not counted 
among the 34 veterans. At least one among the 97 worked at a U.S. Navy 
base but not as a member of the U.S. military; he is not counted as a 
veteran. Most significantly, I have not been able to determine military 
status one way or the other for the majority of the shooters on the 
list; it is entirely possible that more than 34 were military veterans. 
The 34 marked as veterans are simply those I could determine were 
veterans by reading news reports. The result of all this is that, with this updated database, 35% of 
U.S. mass shooters (lone, male, 18-59) are veterans, whereas 14.76% of 
the general population (male, 18-59) are veterans. A mass shooter is 
2.37 times more likely to be a veteran than a random person is. Needless to say, or rather, I wish it were needless to say, but I have to say it in every interview,
 veterans vastly outnumber mass shooters. Most veterans  virtually all 
veterans  are NOT mass shooters. Similarly, those with mental health 
issues vastly outnumber mass shooters. Virtually all people with mental 
health problems, or all men who've abused women, or all males, or all 
gun owners, are NOT mass shooters. The facts that ought to dissuade 
people from bigotry or profiling are painfully obvious, even if only 
selectively required. Needless to say, or rather, I wish it were needless to say, more than
 one contributing factor to mass shootings can be worth addressing. Needless to say, or rather, I wish it were needless to say, people 
inclined toward mass shootings could simply also be inclined to join the
 military, making the relationship a correlation and not a cause. In 
fact, I would be shocked if there weren't some truth to that. But it's 
also possible that being trained and conditioned and given a familiarity
 with mass shootings  and in some cases an experience of engaging in 
mass shooting and having it deemed acceptable or praiseworthy  makes 
one more likely to mass shoot. I cannot imagine there isn't truth in 
that.  1

Justin Fairfax seemed unified when they announced plans for gun control during a special session of the General Assembly in the capital city of Richmond on Tuesday morning. “It’s time for decisive action,” Northam said. “Let Virginia show the nation that we can respond to tragedy with decisive action.” Northam and Fairfax have been making the rounds in Virginia Beach in the days after city worker DeWayne Craddock killed at least 12 people during a rampage in a municipal building on Friday afternoon. But Tuesday was the first time responded to the shooting together. The Washington Post reported that the “Republican response was cool,” which suggested conservative politicians in the state may not be as eager for tighter gun laws as their Democratic counterparts, an indication that a legislative fight may be looming. Despite the gravity of the situation, the appearance of Northam with Fairfax was hard to ignore. The two had reportedly fallen out after it was revealed on the first day of Black History Month that Northam’s medical school yearbook page contained photos of people in blackface. However, a recent report conveniently couldn’t decide whether Northam was actually one of the people in the picture. Fairfax, in turn, was all but ready to assume the governorship when it was widely expected that Northam would resign in shame. Instead, two women ultimately came forward to accuse Fairfax of sexual assault from their respective college days more than a decade ago. One of the women said Fairfax raped her. Fairfax has been steadfast in his denials of the allegations, questioning the timing of them. The women said they came forward because they didn’t want to see a person they described as a sexual predator become governor. But on Tuesday, it appeared the governor and his lieutenant put aside their differences in the name of gun control, a common refrain in the wake of the repeated senseless gun violence plaguing the country. Only time will tell if this time around will be different. Attorney General Mark Herring, who was also dealing with his own blackface photo controversy, joined Northam and Fairfax.

Ralph Northam calls special session on gun control after latest mass shooting,,39573,http://www.staradvertiser.com/
170,https://www.dailynews.com/2019/06/04/apnewsbreak-virginia-gov-to-call-special-session-on-guns/,"Trending: By ALAN SUDERMAN VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced Tuesday he will summon lawmakers back to the state Capitol to consider a package of gun-control legislation, saying last week’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach calls for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” Northam, a Democrat confronted with a Republican-controlled General Assembly in the middle of an election year, also said he wants every legislator to go on record for or against his proposals during the special session this summer, rather than avoid tough votes by quietly killing the bills in subcommittee. “The nation will be watching,” the governor said, four days after Virginia Beach employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building. Craddock was then killed in a gunbattle with police. Northam’s bills include a ban on silencers and high-capacity magazines, as well as a broadening of the ability of local governments to limit guns in city buildings. The governor said he also wants mandatory, universal background checks before gun purchases; a limit of one handgun purchase per month; and a “red flag” law that would allow authorities to seize the weapons of those who are a threat to themselves or others. “I will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,” he said. In a statement, GOP Speaker Kirk Cox dismissed the governor’s call for a special session as “hasty and suspect when considered against the backdrop of the last few months” — a reference to the blackface photo scandal that nearly destroyed Northam’s career. Cox said the Republicans will instead put forward legislation to toughen penalties — including new, mandatory minimum sentences — for those who use guns to commit crimes. “We believe addressing gun violence starts with holding criminals accountable for their actions, not infringing on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” Cox said. Another top Republican, Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, indicated some willingness to debate a ban on large-capacity magazines, according to the Virginia Gazette, but told gun-control advocates outside his office that “nothing would have helped us in Virginia Beach.” Virginia is generally considered a very gun-friendly state and is home to the National Rifle Association’s headquarters. After the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a student with a history of mental problems shot 32 people to death, the state passed a law prohibiting people adjudicated as seriously mentally ill from buying a gun. But a push at the time for universal background checks failed. Most of the other legislation proposed this time also fell short before in Virginia, where Republicans hold slim majorities in the House and Senate. All 140 legislative seats are up for grabs this year, and the Democrats are thought to have a realistic chance of taking back control of the General Assembly. Northam got a standing ovation from gun-control advocates, state workers and elected officials as he said the massacre in Virginia Beach demands that lawmakers put saving lives ahead of party loyalty. Noting that first responders saved lives in last week’s attack, he said: “Now, I’m calling on the elected officials of this commonwealth to become second responders. Your duty is clear: Rush to the scene and put a stop to this violence.” “Show Virginians that it doesn’t matter what party you are in, we all are Virginians first, and we care about the safety and security of every Virginian,” he added. The governor has long advocated stricter gun control and gets an F grade from the NRA. He made the issue a top priority of his 2017 campaign, drawing from his experience as a pediatrician and Army doctor who has treated children and soldiers wounded by gunfire. Craddock appeared to have had no felony record and is believed to have legally purchased his two .45-caliber pistols, authorities said. Friday’s shooting has been Northam’s first major test since a scandal over a racist photo in his medical school yearbook nearly drove him from office four months ago. Northam denied he was in the picture of someone in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. A top gun-rights advocate, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, denounced the special session as “political theater” and said the answer is to make it easier for people to carry weapons. “There’s really nothing other than allowing people to protect themselves until the police get there that would have worked,” he said.

171,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/06/04/wapo-wonders-cant-just-amend-second-amendment/,"In the wake of the latest mass shooting in Virginia, the debate continues over what to do about gun violence. While most conservatives suggest we consider doing a better job of enforcing the laws we have on the books already, Democrats are busy pushing ideas for more gun laws that only affect the law-abiding. Stepping into the argument this week is WaPo columnist Henry Olsen, who offers up a somewhat more drastic proposal. Rather than repealing the Second Amendment as many liberals would like to do, Olsen suggests we amend it to make it more functional in the 21st century. But how would that work? The author actually does a fairly decent job of both describing and defending the arguments made by conservatives and supporters of gun rights, while also explaining some of the concerns of opponents. Then he gets down to the meat of the question. How could the Second Amendment be “improved” by editing it? A revised Second Amendment could spell out the relationship between public safety and private rights in more detail. It could give clear safeguards for people with no history of legal trouble or mental instability to continue to own guns while giving more authority to the government to guarantee that only people unlikely to misuse guns would have them. The precise details would have to be worked out through negotiations, but the general approach — rights for safe users, prohibitions or heavy regulations for others — could work. Critics might argue that the prospects for success are too low or that the process would take too long, but one must ask, “Compared with what?” The nation has been arguing over gun regulation since the dramatic rise in handgun crime in the 1960s. No amount of public pressure or circumstance has compelled gun owners to give in. Nor will it: Ordinary people who don’t misuse their guns have no reason to agree to give up their security or their hobbies to satisfy someone else’s theory about how to combat gun violence. This fact is not going to change, making legislative changes difficult even if Heller were overturned. Olsen was just brought onboard at the Washington Post this January as one of their conservative commentators. As such, it’s perhaps not surprising that he’s able to articulate the concerns of gun owners and Second Amendment advocates with clarity while also summarizing the concerns of liberals who would prefer to see the country disarmed. But despite having done a solid job of laying out the problem, Olsen leaves us without much to go on in terms of the solution. It’s an interesting idea, to be sure, and a calm, reasonable conversation between the two sides (assuming such a thing is even possible anymore) would be welcome. But the author isn’t offering much in terms of the specifics as to how the amendment would be rewritten. To be clear, I’ve long been a fan of the idea of amending the Second Amendment, but it would come in the form of dropping the first 13 words. Olsen appears to suggest a far more wordy amendment, assuring no infringement of the right to keep and bear arms, but only for those “with no history of legal trouble or mental instability.” It would then go on to grant additional authority to the government to ensure that “only people unlikely to misuse guns would have them.” If you’ll pardon my saying, we’re still heading for a brick wall at high speed with that sort of wording. If we were able to assume that all elected officials, judges and citizens would honor the spirit of such wording it might be salable, but that’s not how the world works. And raising these levels of specifics to the rank of a constitutional amendment removes the flexibility we have in the courts today. Allow me to expand on that a bit. The moment you invoke a phrase like “no history of legal trouble or mental instability” the equation is upended. Who, in the future, will decide what level of “legal trouble” makes you eligible to have your fundamental rights stripped away? No matter where you draw the line there’s going to be a gray area that some people will fall under. The question of mental instability is, if anything, even worse. For proof of that, look no further than New York State’s “SAFE Act.” People were having their guns confiscated over a medical history that might have included being given a prescription to combat depression once in their lives. Similarly, including any sort of wording referring to “people unlikely to misuse guns” is a trap door waiting to open beneath our feet. Now we’re getting into Minority Report territory and entrusting the government – likely on a state by state basis – with the power to predict in advance who might be likely to use a firearm in a crime. That opens the door to far too much governmental mischief. Under the current system, at least in the states that have more reasonable gun laws, each individual can be examined on a case by case basis. Adjudicating a person as dangerously mentally ill is a difficult task… and it should be. The individual needs to have the opportunity to challenge such a finding and avoid false or intentionally exaggerated claims about their own mental stability. When it comes to removing the gun rights of those who have already committed violent crimes, we have laws in place to cover that and few Second Amendment supporters disagree with this system. There’s no need to add it to the Constitution. I give Olsen credit for making the effort, and perhaps it’s possible that a rational conversation might be held on this subject. But given the furor all such suggestions are met with in much of the mainstream press, I don’t find myself hopeful of seeing any major improvements take place. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

172,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/04/at-least-four-dead-in-darwin-australia-shooting/,"Trending: By William Branigin and Rick Noack | Washington Post A gunman killed at least four people Tuesday in northern Australia, a rare mass shooting in a nation of strict gun laws. Police arrested a 45-year-old man in the rampage. Northern Territory Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw told reporters that four men were slain and a woman was wounded when the shooter opened fire at five sites in the city of Darwin. The suspect was identified as a former prison inmate who was paroled in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the gunman fired a sawed-off shotgun at the Palms Motel in the Darwin suburb of Woolner in the late afternoon. Witnesses said the shooter opened fire in a number of rooms in the motel before fleeing. Police said that they arrested the suspect about an hour later and that he apparently acted alone, the BBC reported. The city center was locked down for an hour after the shootings. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters that the attack was not linked to terrorism. Speaking in London during a visit to participate in D-Day commemorations, Morrison called the mass shooting “a terrible act of violence” but said there was “nothing to suggest” that it was “a terrorist act,” the Associated Press reported. Police responded to several crime scenes linked to the gunman in Darwin, the capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, ABC said. A reporter for the broadcaster said she saw police tackle the suspect at a busy intersection and use a stun gun to subdue him. Kershaw said the suspect was “well-known to police” but did not immediately identify him or offer any information about a motive. Nor did the police commissioner say why the man had been in prison, the AP reported. It was the worst mass killing in Australia since September, when five people were fatally stabbed or beaten in a house near Perth in western Australia. Mass shootings have been relatively rare in Australia since it enacted a strict gun-control law after 35 people were killed in a rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996. In March, a gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 51 people in a massacre that prompted the government there to ban most semiautomatic firearms in the country. An Australian anti-Muslim extremist was arrested in Christchurch shortly after those shootings and charged with multiple counts of murder. Whereas Australians strongly approved of their country’s gun laws even before the Christchurch attacks, opinion polls suggest that the Christchurch shooting rampage has generated support for even tougher measures, even though Australia already has some of the world’s strictest gun-control laws. The shooting in Darwin could spark a new debate over legislative changes. Far-right politicians have repeatedly sought to undermine Australia’s gun laws. In March, Al Jazeera published footage of a sting operation by some of the network’s journalists, who had recorded senior politicians with the far-right One Nation party appearing to seek up to $20 million in donations from the National Rifle Association (NRA), the U.S. gun rights group, during a trip to Washington. In return, the party officials promised, they would seek to undermine Australia’s tough gun laws. Al Jazeera said the recordings were made in September. When the recordings were released days after the Christchurch attacks, one of the filmed officials – Steve Dickson, then Queensland’s One Nation leader – denied the allegations, even though he acknowledged that meetings had taken place. Public responses to the recordings indicated that he and other far-right politicians would have a hard time selling their proposed changes to the Australian public. Australian commentators expressed outrage over the NRA’s apparent interest in influencing public opinion abroad through financial or ideological support, which has also been documented in other countries, including Brazil and Canada. Morrison, a conservative, was among the top officials who defended his country’s tough gun-control laws. He accused One Nation of trying to “sell Australia’s gun laws to the highest bidders, to a foreign buyer.” “I find that abhorrent,” Morrison said.

Trump, who tells everyone that his middle initial stands for Jax (which is totally a lie unless he’s shortening “jackass” to just “jax”), channeled his inner Sons of Anarchy during a memorial service for Virginia Beach shooting victims at McLean Bible Church, in Vienna, Va. It was Trump’s eighth time in a church since birth. It would have been his ninth but the late Arizona Sen. John McCain requested that the president not attend his funeral. Trump didn’t just show up with a slick-backed coif, he was also wearing some really wide legged tan golf pants and golf shoes because this asshole loves golf so much that he couldn’t change his fucking outfit to come to a memorial honoring the slain victims of a mass shooting looking presidential. Some claimed that the new look was just hat hair but that’s bullshit considering how this hairdo was styled to the gawds. “I’m sure they might say he took off his hat and it just looked like that,” Dhiran Mistry, a hairstylist at New York’s David Mallet Salon, told the Daily Beast. “But [to get that style] you have to put your hair back first and then put your hat on, so he knew what it was going to look like.” “He’s trying to be cool, but he will never be cool,” he said. “It’s sort of like American Psycho slicked-back, and he’s definitely an American psycho.” Indeed. But Patrick Kelly Kyle, a freelance editorial stylist based in New York, told the Daily Beast that the look wasn’t that bad. “I think he looks so much more approachable with his hair like that,” Kyle said. “Much more casual.” Trump clearly was using South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s Netflix password (his own password has been age-restricted) to watch reruns of arguably the greatest white motorcycle television show to hit the small screen and now believes himself to be a golfing version of bike gang leader Jax Teller. No word on how long it’s going to take White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to get out the order for the League of American Nationalists leather vests for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to wear around the Oval Office.

177,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/parkland-scot-peterson.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Audra D. S. Burch and Alan Blinder HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — As bullets ricocheted and bodies fell in the hallways and classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year, Deputy Scot Peterson was outside the building. Instead of storming in after the 19-year-old gunman, he retreated to a position of safety. [Update: Scot Peterson appeared in court on Wednesday. Read the latest story and the three steps he is accused of missing.] For more than a year after the February 2018 attack in Parkland, Fla., grieving parents have demanded that Mr. Peterson — along with the gunman who killed 17 and injured 17 — be held accountable in what would prove to be one of the nation’s worst school shootings. On Tuesday, law enforcement responded with a sweeping list of charges that resulted in Mr. Peterson’s arrest. His alleged crime: failing to protect the students. America’s long history of mass shootings have brought a variety of responses: Calls for tighter gun laws, civil lawsuits against companies that manufacture guns and firearm components, collective mourning. But Tuesday’s charges represented a highly unusual case of a lawman arrested for failing to save lives. Around Parkland, whose politically engaged students helped launch a national student movement for more gun control, there was both surprise and satisfaction. “I have no comment except to say rot in hell,” Fred Guttenberg, who emerged as an outspoken gun control activist after his daughter, Jaime, died in the attack, wrote on Twitter. “You could have saved some of the 17,” Mr. Guttenberg added, addressing Mr. Peterson. “You could have saved my daughter. You did not and then you lied about it and you deserve the misery coming your way.” Mr. Peterson, 56, who had been suspended in the immediate aftermath of the attack and later resigned, faces 11 charges of neglect of a child, culpable negligence and perjury. He was booked into the Broward County jail with a bond of $102,000. The 15-month investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that led to the charges, found that the former Broward County sheriff’s deputy, assigned as a school resource officer to Stoneman Douglas High, “did absolutely nothing to mitigate” the shooting, the department’s commissioner, Rick Swearingen, said in a statement. “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives,” he said. Officials determined that Mr. Peterson, as well as Sgt. Brian Miller, who was terminated on Tuesday but not charged, “neglected their duties.” Mr. Peterson was taken into custody after an administrative discipline hearing. The charges were an unusual instance of law enforcement officers being held criminally liable for not protecting the public. Civil lawsuits have become par for the course following mass shootings in the United States. Families of the victims and survivors themselves use litigation to hold institutions, both public and private, responsible for not keeping people safe, as well as to push for policy changes or to collect compensation for emotional and physical trauma or death. But experts say that criminally charging a law enforcement officer for allegedly being negligent in his response to a mass shooting is new ground. “This is the first time I have seen somebody so charged like this,” said Clinton R. Van Zandt, a former profiler with the F.B.I. and an expert on mass shootings. “I think that every police officer, sheriff and F.B.I. agent understands that you have to go to the threat and stop it and that we are no longer going to wait for SWAT or set up perimeters.” The Department of Law Enforcement said its inquiry showed that Mr. Peterson did not investigate the source of the gunshots, retreated during the shooting while victims were still under attack and directed other law enforcement officers to remain 500 feet away from the building. The sweeping investigation included interviews with 184 witnesses, along with reviews of video surveillance, to piece together what officials acknowledged was a slow and chaotic law enforcement response. Officials added a perjury charge alleging that Mr. Peterson knowingly made a false statement while under oath in stating that he did not hear shots fired after he arrived at the 1200 building, except for the first two or three shots he heard. The warrant portrayed Mr. Peterson, the only armed guard on campus, as an officer with a wealth of active shooter training who knew the gunman was inside, but did not go in to try to stop him as he killed and injured students and staff. It details a series of students and faculty who remembered seeing Mr. Peterson outside. One student, Arman Borghei, told investigators that during the shooting, he looked out a third-floor window and saw Mr. Peterson standing on the side of the 1200 building “with his gun drawn not really doing anything.” Since he was first interviewed by Broward detectives two days after the killings, Mr. Peterson has said he did respond, by alerting the police, locking the school down and evacuating children in the courtyard. “There wasn’t even time to think,” Mr. Peterson told The Washington Post. “It just happened and I started reacting.” He said he has run the shooting over and over in his head. “It was my job, and I didn’t find him,” he said of the gunman. Mr. Miller, who was the first supervisor on the scene, had told investigators that he heard three or four gunshots as he was arriving and believed they were coming from outside the school building. The investigation found that he had gone behind his car, outside of campus, and put on his bulletproof vest, and did not make his first radio transmission to direct a response until five minutes after he arrived — 10 minutes after the first radio communications about the shooting. Meanwhile, four officers from the nearby Coral Springs Police Department arrived and entered the building where the shooting was occurring, the investigation showed. In January, Florida’s newly elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, suspended the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, citing neglect of duty and “incompetence.” He named as his replacement Gregory Tony, a former sergeant with the Coral Springs Police Department. In his new position, Sheriff Tony oversaw an internal investigation of seven deputies at the department, including Mr. Peterson. Jeff Bell, the president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, expressed concern about the decision to charge Mr. Peterson, who was not a member of his organization. He argued that prosecutors had adopted a sweeping interpretation of the state’s negligence law that could put other officers at risk of charges in the future. “I am worried that state attorneys and political officers can start to weaponize criminal charges against law enforcement if you don’t meet their threshold for what you do or should not do,” said Mr. Bell, who said he and others were still disappointed by Mr. Peterson’s response to the shooting. Mr. Van Zandt said prosecutors appeared to be sending a message to the community that “we hear you are disappointed, and we will let the criminal justice system determine whether he made significant mistakes, whether perhaps he was a coward or not, or whether he acted properly with the information that he had.” A lawyer for Mr. Peterson, Joseph A. DiRuzzo III, said Tuesday that the former deputy’s team would fight “these spurious charges that lack basis in fact and law.” He complained that the prosecution appeared to be “nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at politically motivated retribution against Mr. Peterson.” Scot Peterson, a former Broward County sheriff’s deputy and school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., faces 11 charges of neglect of a child, culpable negligence and perjury. “Today the individuals who have made this charging decision have taken the easy way out and blamed Mr. Peterson for the actions on February 14, 2018, when there has only ever been one person to blame — Nikolas Cruz,” Mr. DiRuzzo wrote in an open letter to “the South Florida community and the American public.” Constitutional law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, does not generally give people a right to expect the police to protect them against harm. States can create obligations for the police under certain circumstances — for example, a crossing guard who is assigned to keep children from getting run over. But those would be civil liabilities, said Darren L. Hutchinson, a professor at the University of Florida School of Law, not criminal ones. Professor Hutchinson noted that the criminal statutes under which Mr. Peterson was charged for his behavior during the shooting, neglect of a child and culpable negligence, were not specifically drafted for law enforcement officers and are usually applied to parents. “Normally we don’t think of police officers as caregivers for children,” he said. The culpable negligence charge would require proof of behavior so reckless, like driving down a crowded sidewalk, that it could be inferred that the accused intended harm, Professor Hutchinson said. “Under a civil standard that’s a very tough load, and now they’re turning to the criminal standard, which is somewhat tougher, because they have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said. Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, died in the attack, said he welcomed Mr. Peterson’s arrest. “It’s about accountability, and there’s to be more in Broward County,” said Mr. Pollack, who previously filed a wrongful-death suit against Mr. Peterson. “We knew all along that this guy did something very terrible. He let my daughter die, and a lot of other victims in the school — teachers and children — and he didn’t do his job.” In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Pollack said he and his lawyer had turned over records — including a deposition of Mr. Peterson — in the civil case to law enforcement officials to consider during their criminal inquiry. Mr. Pollack said he hoped Mr. Peterson would be convicted and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. “He brought his Bible with him to the deposition,” he said. “Let him bring his Bible with him to prison. He can read the whole thing a bunch of times.” Daniel Bishop, 17, who was a sophomore when the Parkland shooting took place and was one of dozens of students who traveled to the State Capitol afterward to demand changes to state gun laws, said he was surprised by the news of the former deputy’s arrest. “It wasn’t his fault,” said Mr. Bishop, who will be a senior in the fall. “Who am I to place blame on anyone besides the one person who should be held accountable?” The Parkland shooting has become woven into the fabric of Florida politics. Most national attention on the tragedy focused on the movement against gun violence launched by Stoneman Douglas High students. But parents of the dead — and the elected officials who joined forces with them — were a force in the halls of power in Fort Lauderdale and Tallahassee, relentlessly seeking answers and accountability, not least from the sheriff’s department. The state attorney who filed the charges on Tuesday, Michael J. Satz, announced earlier in the day that he would not seek re-election next year. First elected in 1976, Mr. Satz said skipping a campaign for a new term would allow him to focus on the coming death penalty trial of Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the Parkland killings. Issues raised by the shooting are expected to continue to demand attention in Tallahassee, and not only on matters of gun policy and funding for safer schools. Also pending is how the state might compensate the victims’ families — an issue the families have already taken to court, claiming negligence by the school district and sheriff’s office.

Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering President Trump’s second day in London, the price of climate change and earthquake-mitigating innovations from Japan. On the second day of his state visit, President Trump’s agenda shifted to politics. In a joint news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May, he expressed confidence in Brexit, saying Britain is “a very, very special place and I think it deserves a special place” and that the withdrawal “will happen.” He later met with Nigel Farage, the most recognizable face of the pro-Brexit campaign. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump and Mrs. May had a round-table discussion with business leaders from both countries to talk trade. “I think we’ll have a very substantial trade deal,” Mr. Trump said. Go deeper: Mr. Trump’s extended family is also in London for the state visit, presenting themselves as the unofficial American royal family. Photographs: See pictures from Mr. Trump’s state visit. Republican senators sent the White House a sharp message, warning that they were opposed to President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on Mexican imports on June 10. They spoke just hours after Mr. Trump, speaking in London, said that Republican lawmakers would be “foolish” to try and stop him. His aim is to force Mexico to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. Mexican crackdown: Detentions and deportations in Mexico have multiplied in recent weeks, amid intense pressure from Washington. In April, Mexico deported nearly 15,000 migrants, up from about 9,100 in March, according to government statistics. Impact: Two new analyses found that the president’s tariffs on Mexico, China, Europe and other governments could nullify the economic gains from his signature tax cuts, undermining his biggest political win. The Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, signaled that the central bank was prepared to cut interest rates if trade tensions worsen. Already grappling with a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States, Beijing now has to worry about the rising price of food. As China fights a devastating swine fever epidemic, agriculture officials have warned that the price of pork could go up by 70 percent this year. The price of fruits and vegetables has also increased sharply, although the authorities blame severe weather and say it will be temporary. Quotable: “Whoever eats apples these days must be loaded,” said Li Tao, who has been selling the fruit for more than 20 years. Many of the world’s biggest companies are bracing for the prospect that a warming planet could substantially affect their bottom lines within the next five years. Hundreds of companies potentially face roughly $1 trillion in costs related to climate change in the decades ahead unless they take proactive steps to prepare, according to an analysis by the international nonprofit CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project). Real-world examples: Hitachi, a Japanese manufacturer, said that increased rainfall and flooding in Southeast Asia could knock out its suppliers and that it is taking defensive measures. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, noted that rising temperatures could increase the cost of cooling at its data centers. U.S. policy: The Trump administration has rolled back more than 80 environmental rules and regulations. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has introduced a plan to reinstate — and go beyond — Obama administration climate policies. For years, the country has invested in new technologies and building designs that greatly reduce the damage during earthquakes — an approach that could serve as a lesson for the U.S., which is also vulnerable to tremors. But the world’s two most technologically advanced countries have differed drastically in their responses to earthquakes, reflecting a broader attitude toward risk and collective responsibility. Darwin: A gunman opened fire in the main business district of the capital city of Darwin, killing four people and wounding at least one other person. The gunman was arrested and the police, though still figuring out the motive, said the mass shooting was not an act of terrorism. Canberra: The authorities have searched the home, computer and cellphone of a journalist who wrote an article last year detailing top-secret correspondence between government ministries over a plan to allow intelligence agencies to surveil Australian citizens.

The World Cup tournament takes place every four years. Its evolution offers an interesting reflection of British history. As Britain’s empire expanded around the world, so too did its national sport, permeating the fabric of many of its colonies. An early version of the sport’s global governing body, the International Cricket Council, came into being in the late 1920s and initially covered only “countries within the Empire,” including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India and the West Indies region. In 1965, the I.C.C. started to let in other countries, like the Netherlands and Denmark, and in 1975, it organized the first World Cup. Yet despite opening up the tournament over the years, every winner since the inaugural Cup has been a former colony. Oddly enough, England has never managed to win this tournament. The sun never sets on England’s hopes. The finals are on July 14 in London. That’s it for this briefing. Clear the ropes! — Alisha Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and Kenneth R.

I’ve personally never heard of one being prosecuted for actions he *didn’t* take. Police unions are going to have a collective aneurysm over the idea of officers being held criminally liable for excessive … “caution,” let’s call it. Although the whole point here is that, at a certain point, “caution” becomes neglect. They don’t call him the “Coward of Broward” for nothing. Scot Peterson, 56, had been nationally heckled and vilified for failing to confront the former student who gunned down and killed 17 students and staff at the Parkland school on Feb. 14, 2018. Peterson has been booked into the Broward Main Jail on 11 criminal charges, including child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury… The investigation showed Peterson refused to investigate where the gunshots were coming from, retreated during the gunfire as victims were being shot, and directed other law enforcement who arrived on scene to remain 500 feet away from the building, FDLE spokeswoman Jessica Cary said in an emailed statement… “The FDLE investigation shows former Deputy Peterson did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting that killed 17 children, teachers ad staff and injured 17 others,” said FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.” In a different age, the public disgrace involved in being known for hanging back while a lunatic gunned down children all around you would be enough to motivate an officer to intervene during a mass shooting. Most cops today would intervene, of course, but some seem to require more of an incentive, per the judgment of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Either get in there and help or face prison. Here (I think) is the crime Peterson’s been charged with — a subset of child abuse: (e) “Neglect of a child” means: 1. A caregiver’s failure or omission to provide a child with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the child’s physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the child; or 2. A caregiver’s failure to make a reasonable effort to protect a child from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person. “A person who willfully or by culpable negligence neglects a child and in so doing causes great bodily harm … commits a felony of the second degree,” notes the statute. Essentially Peterson’s being treated like a parent who starved his child to death or stood by while his spouse administered a fatal beating. The wrinkle may lie in the idea of being a “caregiver.” Courts typically find that the police owe no specific duty of care to individual members of the public that might give rise to liability if they breach that duty. But Peterson may be an exception. He wasn’t just a cop, remember; he was the school resource officer assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. Prosecutors may be gambling that that role created a “caregiver” duty for him towards the students that other officers didn’t share. That would reassure patrolmen’s unions, if so, as it would mean Peterson’s case would set a relatively narrow precedent. The phrase “complete inaction” used by the FDLE commissioner in the excerpt above might reassure them too. Maybe the “Peterson rule” will be that inaction by police can’t lead to criminal charges unless that inaction is “complete.” First Scott Israel gets suspended, now this. Hats off to Florida for demanding real accountability from the cops in the aftermath of a nightmare that might have been mitigated, if not prevented. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

181,https://people.com/crime/parkland-officer-charged-accused-inaction-during-school-shooting/,"""There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives,"" a law enforcement release states A former sheriff’s deputy who allegedly failed to intervene during the 2018 mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people has been arrested and charged, PEOPLE confirms. Scot Peterson, 56, was the school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, during the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting at the school. According to a statement from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Peterson was arrested Tuesday and faces seven counts of neglect of a child and three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury. “The FDLE investigation shows former Deputy Peterson did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting that killed 17 children, teachers and staff and injured 17 others,” said FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen in the release. “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.” According to the release, Peterson “refused to investigate the source of gunshots, retreated during the active shooting while victims were being shot and directed other law enforcement who arrived on scene to remain 500 feet away from the building.” Peterson lost his job about a week after the shooting when it was revealed he never entered the school during the shooting. An investigative report from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission alleges Peterson hid for nearly 50 minutes after the shooting began. During this time, officers from other agencies entered the school and tried to rescue victims and apprehend the shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz. A lieutenant from the Sunrise Police Department recalled seeing Peterson pacing back and forth outside Building 12, where the shooting took place, and saying, “Oh my God. Oh my God.” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter. When the lieutenant asked Peterson what was happening, Peterson allegedly said, “I don’t know. I don’t know. .. Oh my God, I can’t believe this.” The Sun-Sentinel reports that Peterson, in a 14-page response to the commission’s findings, said he followed protocol and had been unfairly blamed. “I assessed the situation and acted accordingly to the real time intelligence I assessed on the scene,” he reportedly wrote. According to the FDLE release, Peterson has been booked into the Broward County Main Jail. It was not immediately clear if he has entered a plea and his attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, did not immediately return PEOPLE’s requests for comment. State Atty. Mike Satz said the charges carry a combined prison sentence of almost 100 years, the Los Angeles Times reports. Peterson’s bail was set at $102,000, according to the outlet.

182,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-deputy/former-officer-charged-in-florida-school-shooting-on-claim-he-stayed-outside-idUSKCN1T52QS?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Brendan O’Brien 5 Min Read (Reuters) - A former Florida sheriff’s deputy was arrested on Tuesday on felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his lack of response in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead, the county sheriff said. Scot Peterson, 56, who was taken into custody, faces multiple counts of child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury, Broward County State Attorney Mike Satz said in a statement. The charges carry a combined maximum prison sentence of nearly 97 years, he said. Peterson, at the time a Broward County deputy, was on duty as a school resource officer when a gunman entered the school building in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, 2018, and opened fire, killing 17 people and wounding 17 others. He never went inside during the shooting, according to the sheriff’s office and surveillance video. Nikolas Cruz, who was 19 at the time and had been expelled from the school, was charged with the murders. He is awaiting trial. Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, said that while the law enforcement community is upset with how Peterson handled the incident and the harm to its reputation, his failure to act was not criminal. “What concerns me...is we are setting a dangerous precedent by coming after law enforcement,” he said. “In the future, if we don’t break up a fight in a school, will that be negligent? When does it stop?” “You have to be considered a caregiver to be charged with neglect and police officers are not caregivers, we are first responders,” he said. Peterson is the first police officer to be charged with a crime based on his actions responding to an active shooter situation, his attorney Joseph DiRuzzo said in a written statement. He plans to “vigorously defend” his client against the charges that “lack basis in fact and law.” “Today the individuals who have made this charging decision have taken the easy way out and blamed Mr. Peterson for the actions on February 14, 2018, when there has only ever been one person to blame – Nikolas Cruz,” he wrote. Peterson also faces legal trouble in civil court. In May 2018, Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the shooting, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Peterson. His son Hunter said on Twitter that he hoped Peterson spends the rest of his life in prison. “He cowered in Parkland while my sister died defenseless and lied about his failure to confront the shooter,” he said. Peterson was booked into the Broward County jail and his bond set at $102,000. Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said on Tuesday he had fired Peterson and another deputy, Brian Miller, who he said neglected their duties during the shooting. “We cannot fulfill our commitment to always protect the security and safety of our Broward County community without doing a thorough assessment of what went wrong that day,” Tony said in a statement. Peterson resigned a week after the shooting. But his and Miller’s termination means they can no longer serve as law enforcement deputies for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, the sheriff said. Peterson’s arrest follows a 14-month investigation that included interviews of 184 witnesses. Some sheriff’s deputies held back too long as shots were fired instead of rushing toward the gunfire, according to a 485-page report by a state-appointed commission released in January. The commission also found Broward County Sheriff’s Office training on active shooters was inadequate. The commission recommended arming teachers and spending more on school security and mental health to prevent similar mass shootings. Seven deputies in all were under an internal sheriff’s office investigation to determine if their actions complied with department standards, Tony said. Broward County Public Schools officials were not immediately available for comment. Senator Rick Scott, who was governor of Florida when the shooting happened, said it was time for justice to be served. “Had this individual done his job, lives would have been saved. Actions (or inaction) have consequences,” he said in a statement. Three weeks after the shooting, Scott signed into law a bill imposing a 21-year-old legal age requirement and three-day waiting period on all gun purchases and allowing the arming of some school employees.

The women of ABC’s The View on Tuesday hit far-left Democratic presidential candidate Eric Swalwell from the even farther left, quizzing the Congressman about taking the issue of gun control “out the hands” of politicians and into those who “are not beholden to the NRA.” They also demanded to know why Swalwell hasn’t, yet, come out for impeachment. Guest co-host Anna Navarro wondered if it’s “realistic to think that we can pass legislation” to impose gun control. She then wondered if something other than a democratic process could be the solution: “Part of me thinks we should take it out of the legislators's hands and give it to a broader group of people who are not beholden to the NRA.”   Swalwell, who supports gun confiscation, embraced this idea: “I would love that too.” Co-host Joy Behar hit Swalwell from the left, demanding to know why the Democrat hasn’t yet come out for impeachment: On another subject before we run out of time here, 13 of your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are calling to impeach Trump.

SUNN HOSTIN: Well, Democrats are going to have to win back some of Trump's voters in order to beat him, and you might know that better than anyone because your own parents and brother are Republicans from the midwest who voted for trump actually.

Former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High resource officer Scot Peterson, 56, was arrested Tuesday on charges relating to failure to enter the school during the mass shooting there. He was charged in Broward County with seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence and one of perjury after a 15-month investigation, according to a news release from Florida authorities. The charges carry a combined potential prison sentence of nearly 100 years for the officer blasted by many critics as the ""Coward of Broward.""

Peterson faces child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury charges that carry a combined potential prison sentence of nearly 100 years. (REUTERS, File) The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) ""investigation shows former deputy Peterson did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting that killed 17 children, teachers and staff and injured 17 others,” said FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.” Investigators interviewed 184 witnesses and reviewed hours of video surveillance to determine the response of law enforcement, Fox 13 reported. ""It’s never too late for accountability and justice,” Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said. Tony said Peterson has been formally fired, although he announced his retirement shortly after the shooting. Republican Sen. Rick Scott said in a statement: “Had this individual done his job, lives would have been saved. Actions (or inaction) have consequences. We need more accountability, and that includes at the FBI, which has yet to show me a single example of how they’ve improved their processes following the failures in the leadup to the Parkland shooting.” Ryan Petty, the father of slain student Alaina Petty, said in a statement, “Today marks another step in the search for accountability. … Peterson failed in his duty to protect lives that day, standing behind a cement pillar for 48 minutes while students and teachers were slaughtered.” Fred Guttenberg, another father of a victim, tweeted: “I have no comment except to say rot in hell Scott Petersen. You could have saved some of the 17. You could have saved my daughter. You did not and then you lied about it and you deserve the misery coming your way.” Peterson lawyer Joseph DiRuzzo III said in a statement: “We will vigorously defend against these spurious charges that lack basis in fact and law. Specifically, Mr. Peterson cannot reasonably be prosecuted because he was not a ‘caregiver’, which is defined as ‘a parent, adult household member, or other person responsible for a child’s welfare.’"" He added: “President Eisenhower has said that ‘the search for a scapegoat is the easiest of all hunting expeditions.’ Today the individuals who have made this charging decision have taken the easy way out and blamed Mr. Peterson for the actions on February 14, 2018, when there has only ever been one person to blame – Nikolas Cruz.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Alleged gunman Nikolas Cruz, 20, faces the death penalty if convicted of the first-degree murder charges filed in the attack.

Seventy-one percent of registered voters say gun violence is a major problem that needs attention from the government, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

Majorities across the board agree gun violence is a significant issue the government should work on, including those in households with a gun (64 percent), Democrats (89 percent), independents (58 percent), Republicans (54 percent), men (68 percent), women (75 percent), voters under age 45 (69 percent) and those 45 and over (73 percent), whites (68 percent) and nonwhites (82 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Would stricter gun control laws help? Nearly half think they would. Forty-seven percent say ""passing stricter gun control laws"" would make the country safer. That's a slight increase from last year when 44 percent felt that way, but shy of the 52 percent high in June 2016, shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting. VIRGINIA BEACH KILLER'S RESIGNATION LETTER SHOWED NO SIGN OF IMPENDING RAMPAGE Nearly one voter in five, 19 percent, believes stricter gun laws will make the U.S. less safe, up from 12 percent last year. Close to one-third (32 percent) say stricter laws will make no difference either way, down from 42 percent in 2018. Among gun-owning households, 26 percent think harsher laws will make the country less safe, up 11 points from 2018. The shift comes from a 13-point drop in those believing the laws would not make a difference: 37 percent vs. 50 percent last year. Thirty-five percent say they will make the U.S. safer, similar to last year (33 percent). President Trump’s job approval rating on guns remains underwater by 11 points (40 percent approval vs. 51 percent disapproval), a slight improvement from -14 points last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump does worse on health care (-19 points) and immigration (-13), and better or the same on taxes (-11) and border security (-5).

@DennisPrager Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU. This past weekend, Americans learned of another mass shooting, this time by an employee who decided to murder as many of the people he had worked with for years as possible. As of this writing, the murder toll is 12 people. Every American asks why. What was the killer’s motive? When we read there is “no known motive,” we are frustrated. Human beings want to make sense of life, especially of evil. Liberals (in this regard, liberals’ views are essentially as the same as leftists’) are virtually united in ascribing these shootings to guns. Just this past weekend, in a speech in Brazil, former President Barack Obama told an audience: “Our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon any time — without much, if any, regulation. They can buy (guns) over the internet. They can buy machine guns.” That the former president fabricated a series of falsehoods about the United States — and maligned, on foreign soil, the country that twice elected him president — speaks to his character and to the character of the American news media that have been completely silent about these falsehoods. But the main point here is that, like other liberals and leftists, when Obama addresses the subject of mass shootings — in Brazil, he had been talking about the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 — he talks about guns. Yet, America had plenty of guns when its mass murder rate was much lower. Grant Duwe, a Ph.D. in criminology and director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, gathered data going back 100 years in his 2007 book, “Mass Murder in the United States: A History.” Duwe’s data reveal: In the 20th century, every decade before the 1970s had fewer than 10 mass public shootings. In the 1950s, for example, there was one mass shooting. And then a steep rise began. In the 1960s, there were six mass shootings. In the 1970s, the number rose to 13. In the 1980s, the number increased 2 1/2 times, to 32. And it rose again in the 1990s, to 42. As for this century, The New York Times reported in 2014 that, according to the FBI, “Mass shootings have risen drastically in the past half-dozen years.” Given the same ubiquity of guns, wouldn’t the most productive question be what, if anything, has changed since the 1960s and ’70s? Of course it would. And a great deal has changed. America is much more ethnically diverse, much less religious. Boys have far fewer male role models in their lives. Fewer men marry, and normal boy behavior is largely held in contempt by their feminist teachers, principals and therapists. Do any or all of those factors matter more than the availability of guns? Let’s briefly investigate each factor. Regarding ethnic diversity, the countries that not only have the fewest mass murders but the lowest homicide rates as well are the least ethnically diverse — such as Japan and nearly all European countries. So, too, the American states that have homicide rates as low as Western European countries are the least ethnically and racially diverse (the four lowest are New Hampshire, North Dakota, Maine and Idaho). Now, America, being the most ethnically and racially diverse country in the world, could still have low homicide rates if a) Americans were Americanized, but the left has hyphenated — Balkanized, if you will — Americans, and b) most black males grew up with fathers. Regarding religiosity, the left welcomes — indeed, seeks —
the end of Christianity in America (though not of Islam, whose robustness it
fosters). Why don’t we ask a simple question: What percentage of American
murderers attend church each week? Regarding boys’ need for fathers, in 2008, then-Sen. Obama told an audience: “Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools; and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” Yet, the Times has published columns and “studies” showing how relatively unimportant fathers are, and more and more educated women believe this dangerous nonsense. Then there is marriage: Nearly all men who murder are single. And their number is increasing. Finally, since the 1960s, we have been living in a culture of grievance. Whereas in the past people generally understood that life is hard and/or they have to work on themselves to improve their lives, for half a century, the left has drummed into Americans’ minds the belief that their difficulties are caused by American society — in particular, its sexism, racism and patriarchy. And the more aggrieved people are the more dulled their consciences. When you don’t ask intelligent questions, you cannot come up with intelligent answers. So, then, with regard to murder in America, until Americans stop allowing the left to ask the questions, we will have no intelligent answers.

Oppel Jr. and Shreeya Sinha An investigation found that Scot Peterson, a former sheriff’s deputy who was serving as the school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, did “absolutely nothing to mitigate” the mass shooting at the school on Feb. 14, 2018, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. [Read the latest story: Scot Peterson appears in court today] The gunman in the massacre killed 17 students, teachers and staff, and wounded 17 others. Mr. Peterson, who was the only armed guard on campus, was charged on Tuesday with seven counts of felony neglect of a child for not doing more to protect students. He was also charged with culpable negligence and perjury. Here’s what officials said Mr. Peterson failed to do: Mr. Peterson had been trained that officers responding to an active shooter must “immediately go to confront the shooter” and “move directly and quickly toward known threat.” But he did not enter the 1200 building at the school, where the gunman was shooting students and teachers, according to an affidavit filed in support of the warrant for his arrest. Scot Peterson, a former Broward County sheriff’s deputy and school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., faces 11 charges of neglect of a child, culpable negligence and perjury. Mr. Peterson fled to a spot about 75 feet away from the 1200 building, “remaining there during the entire incident” in what the affidavit described as “a position of increased personal safety.” The affidavit also quoted a student, Arman Borghei, who said that as shots were being fired in the 1200 building, he looked out a window and saw Mr. Peterson: “I just saw him standing on the side of the building with his gun drawn, not really doing anything.” At 2:28 p.m. — seven minutes after the gunman entered the building — Mr. Peterson said over the radio: “Broward, do not approach the 12 or 1300 buildings. Stay at least 500 feet away at this point.” During the time Mr. Peterson remained outside the building, the gunman shot and killed six of his victims, including five students, and wounded four others, according to the affidavit. Seven of those victims were students under the age of 18, which is why Mr. Peterson was charged with seven counts of felony neglect of a child. Mr. Peterson was charged with perjury for making a false statement that he did not hear any shots fired after he arrived at the building, except for the first two or three shots he heard, according to the affidavit.

189,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602727336/0/phoenix/nation~Virginia-Beach-hero-yet-another-sacrificial-American-in-yet-another-mass-shooting/,"America's failure to impose a modicum of gun control amid the storm of mass shootings has led average citizens to make wrenching, sacrificial choices when killers open fire. Ryan Keith Cox made that judgment Friday in Virginia. As a gunman opened fire inside a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Cox, an account clerk, led co-workers into a break room and told them to barricade the door. Then he headed back toward the shooting. ""I've got to see if anybody else needs help,"" he said. Cox would be killed with 11 others before police arrived and the rampage ended. Kendrick Castillo, days from graduating from high school, made the same mortal choice last month in suburban Denver. Kendrick had already told his father that in the event of a school shooting, he would be compelled to act: ""You raised me to be a good person."" When a shooter entered a classroom at STEM School Highlands Ranch, Castillo lunged at the gunman and was killed, but not before fellow students had a chance to seek cover. Before that, the fateful choice was Riley Howell's. The college student tackled a gunman in a lecture hall at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte on April 30, knocking the shooter down and saving lives. Howell likewise paid for his heroism with his life. These are choices no ordinary person should have to make, yet they do: Lori Gilbert Kaye stepped between a gunman and her rabbi to take a fatal round during a synagogue shooting outside San Diego on April 27; and Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus rushed into a night club in Thousand Oaks, California, last November as a gunman was slaughtering patrons. Helus was killed. Each should be celebrated as a hero, but with knowledge that their selflessness stands in stark contrast to the cowardly failure by lawmakers to control gun violence. 2ND AMENDMENT FOUNDATION: No gun law would have prevented this tragedy Such action is certainly possible. New Zealand banned most semi-automatic weapons less than a month after a white nationalist killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15. Nor is America's Second Amendment an insurmountable obstacle to commonsense gun safety measures. The late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in 2008 that the amendment is ""not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever for whatever purpose."" Would new restrictions prevent every mass shooting? Of course not. Would they stop some and make some others less lethal? Yes. In Washington, the House of Representatives has passed measures that would expand the period for conducting firearm background checks, and extend those checks to gun show and internet sales. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does nothing to bring them to a vote in the Senate. Last January, Virginia lawmakers rejected a raft of gun bills, including a ban on large-capacity magazines like those used by the gunman who killed Cox and other workers in Virginia Beach on Friday. When a killer is forced to reload sooner, the heroes among us have a chance — just maybe — to overwhelm the gunman without losing their lives. On Tuesday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called for a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the measures. ""Ordinary Virginians showed extraordinary courage,"" Northam said about Virginia Beach. It's long past time that lawmakers, federal and state alike, did the same. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff and the USA TODAY Network.

192,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/06/04/china-warns-citizens-against-traveling-to-us/,"Chinese tourists spent $26 billion in the U.S. in 2016. Topline: China advised its citizens against traveling to the U.S. on Tuesday, citing recent increases in crime and harassment. A professor studying international business at San Diego State University told Forbes the move is clearly aimed at gaining leverage in trade negotiations.        Restricting Chinese tourism may be a move to get bargaining power in trade negotiations, said Dwarka Chakravarty, a professor at San Diego State University. Chinese tourists spent $26 billion in the U.S. in 2016 and are responsible for boosting the sales of many U.S. luxury retailers. While there was a mass shooting in Virginia Beach days before China’s announcement, the tragedy wasn’t a change in the status quo, indicating that there’s no evidence of increased crime or harassment toward Chinese tourists, said Chakravarty. And the timing of the announcement, just has trade tensions between the U.S. and China are heating up, isn’t a coincidence. “This is clearly retaliatory. I don’t think the domestic situation in the U.S. has changed all that much,” he said. “The larger message China is trying to send is that the U.S. is not a safe place to do business.” Will this actually have an impact? Even without the travel advisory, tourism from China started to dip last year. The U.S. dollar has been strong, making it more expensive for tourists. But U.S. luxury businesses have already been suffering without the spending boost from Chinese tourists and worry about what any further decrease in tourism might do to their bottom lines, according to CBS News.  And while the money spent by Chinese tourists ultimately makes up a small part of the overall economy, “it’s not insignificant,” Chakravarty said. It’s unclear if that will be enough pressure for President Donald Trump to reconsider the tariffs currently in place. I’m a San Francisco-based reporter covering wealth at Forbes.

193,https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciagbarnes/2019/06/04/the-virginia-beach-shooting-are-we-ignoring-the-obvious/,"The immediate reaction to the mass shooting of 12 municipal workers in Virginia Beach has been to focus on gun control. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced Tuesday he will ask lawmakers to consider a package of gun-control legislation. He said the Virginia Beach shooting calls for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” But something else may be at play in the rampage that should be acknowledged, if only in the interests of preventing future incidents. We may never know why the 40-year-old Virginia Beach shooter took two semiautomatic handguns to the municipal building and killed 12 of his co-workers, including two supervisors. He died in a gun battle with police. But we know one thing. The shooting occurred at his workplace, and it is unlikely that this is a random coincidence. The shooter had earlier emailed his supervisor a  letter of resignation from his job as an engineer for the utilities department of the city of Virginia Beach. He said he was resigning for “personal reasons” and gave two weeks’ notice. Apparently, no one tried to talk him out of it. Nothing could ever justify or condone the Virginia Beach shooter's actions, but it is worth examining what steps, if any, the city of Virginia Beach could have taken to avert the tragedy and whether it can take any steps to protect future employees from harm. Workplace violence often appears to be a random act that has no logical cause but, upon closer inspection, underlying factors exist that may help to explain it.  In some cases,  the perpetrator showed signs of psychological distress that were ignored or unaddressed by the employer.  Workplace conditions can inadvertently (or intentionally) foment conflict.  Low staffing levels, for example, are known to cause extreme stress to overworked workers. Feelings of unfairness in work assignments and promotions provoke conflict. Heavy-handed management and ill treatment of workers cause alienation and bitterness. Many employers today anticipate the possibility of violence in the workplace. Some employers create multidisciplinary teams to assess and mitigate potential threats. Some employers offer employee assistance plans or education and training programs. Maybe Governor Northam should also call upon Virginia lawmakers to consider a package of worker protection legislation? No Right To Dignity For American workers, the workplace can be a mean, irrational place. This observation in no way excuses workplace violence but it may explain why it occurs. Many U.S. workers labor for long hours for low pay. Wages adjusted for inflation have barely budged in a decade. And when the blush of youth fades, they can be essentially locked out of the workplace, and forced to choose between under-employment or unemployment for the rest of their lives. Sadly, U.S. workers lack some key worker protections found in other developed countries. Consider that: Any episode of workplace violence, especially the extreme violence that occurred in Virginia Beach, should prompt an employer to immediately and reflectively examine what steps, if any, it could have taken to avert the violence and what steps it can take in the future to protect its workers. It’s not enough to put a better lock on the door. The problem may be within. I am an attorney, former judge, and recognized authority on age discrimination in employment.

194,https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/darwin-shooting-weapon-expert,"“They were the weapons of choice in mass killings… that is why Australia prohibited them.” BuzzFeed News Reporter, Australia Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner and police commissioner Reece Kershaw. ""I can confirm it is a prohibited firearm under the Firearms Act, and we believe that that firearm may have been stolen as far back as 1997,"" Northern Territory police commissioner Reece Kershaw said on Wednesday morning. ""We've got the serial number and we know it's a pump action 12-gauge shotgun."" The alleged shooter has been arrested and identified as Ben Hoffman, 45, who Kershaw confirmed was on parole and wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time of the shooting. University of Sydney associate professor Philip Alpers is the director of GunPolicy.org, an online gun legislation research tool. He says what happened in Darwin was the biggest non-domestic shooting in Australia since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which left 35 people dead. “[The Darwin shooting] shows that Australia still has a way to go in confiscating and destroying all of these weapons,” Alpers, who works at the university’s school of public health, told BuzzFeed News. Alpers, who has been researching gun policy for 27 years, said the type of gun allegedly used by the Darwin shooter ""should have been surrendered and destroyed"" in the gun buyback program prompted by the Port Arthur massacre. ""Pump action shotguns were one of the firearm types which were deliberately targeted by the John Howard government because they were the choice of mass shooters,"" he said. ""They were the weapons of choice in mass killings… that is why Australia prohibited them."" After the Port Arthur killings, Australia banned assault rifles and some semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, and tightened restrictions on gun purchases. “Both the Australian public and the Australian police in particular have had a considerable attitudinal shift since Port Arthur and the massacres which preceded it, because remember we had a string of about 14 massacres and Port Arthur was just the last straw,” Alpers said. Unlike in the United States, police in Australia have a broad mandate when it comes to confiscating and destroying weapons they believe are a ""danger to the community"". ""[Australian police] have always had the right under law to enter any premises where they suspect firearms are being kept or stored illegally and to search those premises,"" he said. ""They have always had the right to confiscate, especially in cases of heightened risk such as apprehended domestic violence."" Ben Hoffman. When Alpers started researching gun legislation in the mid-90s, the accepted definition for a mass shooting was five victims, but in 2010 both the United States Department of Justice and the FBI lowered that threshold by one. Under this definition, Darwin is allegedly Australia’s third mass shooting since Port Arthur. The first was in 2014 when a New South Wales farmer shot his wife and three children before turning the gun on himself. The second was a murder-suicide in Western Australia last year when a couple, their daughter and her four children were killed.  Gina Rushton is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Sydney.

The charges come at the conclusion of a 15-month investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that found Broward County Sheriff’s Deputy Scot Peterson, who was the school resource officer present at Stoneman Douglas High at the time, did essentially nothing to stop the shooting that left 17 students dead in a school shooting that transformed into a national trauma. The filing of criminal charges against the 56-year-old Peterson for failing to act while on duty is highly unusual, as such cases are usually litigated in civil court, but the state police department’s findings were unequivocal, according to commissioner Rick Swearingen who said of Peterson: “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.” Peterson was taken into custody for charges including neglect of a child, culpable negligence, and perjury. Another officer on duty during the February 2018 shooting, Sgt. Brian Miller, was similarly found to have neglected his duties and was fired from his job but not charged with a crime. “The Department of Law Enforcement said its inquiry showed that Mr. Peterson did not investigate the source of the gunshots, retreated during the shooting while victims were still under attack and directed other law enforcement officers to remain 500 feet away from the building,” the New York Times reports. “The sweeping investigation included interviews with 184 witnesses, along with reviews of video surveillance, to piece together what officials acknowledged was a slow and chaotic law enforcement response. Officials added a perjury charge alleging that Mr. Peterson knowingly made a false statement while under oath in stating that he did not hear shots fired after he arrived at the 1200 building, except for the first two or three shots he heard.” Elliot Hannon is a Slate staff writer.

Northam is summoning lawmakers back to the state Capitol to consider a package of gun-control legislation after Friday's mass shooting in Virginia Beach. (Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP) BOB BROWN  VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.  — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced Tuesday he will summon lawmakers back to the state Capitol this summer to take up a package of gun-control legislation, saying last week’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach calls for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” Northam, a Democrat faced with a gun-friendly, Republican-controlled General Assembly in the middle of a legislative election year, also said he wants every lawmaker to go on record for or against his proposals during the special session, rather than avoid tough votes by quietly killing the bills in subcommittee. “The nation will be watching,” the governor said, four days after Virginia Beach employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building. Craddock was then killed in a gunbattle with police. Northam’s bills include a ban on silencers and high-capacity magazines, as well as a broadening of the ability of local governments to prohibit guns in city buildings. The governor said he also wants mandatory, universal background checks before gun purchases; a limit of one handgun purchase per month; and a “red flag” law that would allow authorities to seize weapons from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. “I will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,” he said, mocking the usual response to gun violence by supporters of the gun lobby. No immediate date for the special session was set, but Northam said he wants to hold it in late June. In a statement, GOP Speaker Kirk Cox dismissed the governor’s call for a special session as “hasty and suspect when considered against the backdrop of the last few months” — a reference to the blackface photo scandal that nearly destroyed Northam’s career. Cox said the Republicans will instead put forward legislation to toughen penalties — including new, mandatory minimum sentences — for those who use guns to commit crimes. “We believe addressing gun violence starts with holding criminals accountable for their actions, not infringing on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” he said. Another top Republican, Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, noted that the governor is pushing for legislation that already failed earlier this year. “This governor has opted for political posturing over solutions,” Norment said. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker accused Northam of “exploiting a tragedy to push his failed political agenda.” Virginia is generally considered a very gun-friendly state and is home to the NRA headquarters. After the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a student with a history of mental problems shot 32 people to death, the state passed a law prohibiting people adjudicated as seriously mentally ill from buying a gun. But a push at the time for universal background checks failed. Most of the other legislation proposed this time has also fallen short before in Virginia, where Republicans hold slim majorities in the House and Senate. All 140 legislative seats are up for grabs this year, and the Democrats are thought to have a realistic chance of taking back control of the General Assembly. In making the announcement at a state office building, Northam got a standing ovation from gun-control advocates, state workers and elected officials as he said the massacre in Virginia Beach demands that lawmakers put saving lives ahead of party loyalty. Noting that first responders saved lives in last week’s attack, he said: “Now, I’m calling on the elected officials of this commonwealth to become second responders. Your duty is clear: Rush to the scene and put a stop to this violence.” “Show Virginians that it doesn’t matter what party you are in, we all are Virginians first, and we care about the safety and security of every Virginian,” he added. The governor has long advocated stricter gun control and gets an F grade from the NRA. He made the issue a top priority of his 2017 campaign, drawing from his experience as a pediatrician and Army doctor who has treated children and soldiers wounded by gunfire. Craddock appeared to have had no felony record and is believed to have legally purchased his two .45-caliber pistols, authorities said. Friday’s shooting has been Northam’s first major test since a scandal over a photo in his medical school yearbook nearly drove him from office four months ago. Northam denied he was in the picture of someone in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. Democrats, including many who have previously called for his resignation, hailed Northam’s move on guns as strong leadership, and several lawmakers publicly thanked him. A top gun-rights advocate, Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, denounced the special session as “political theater” and said the answer is to make it easier for people to carry weapons. “There’s really nothing other than allowing people to protect themselves until the police get there that would have worked,” he said.

You can keep your recommendations vague, letting your audience fill in the blanks; push the policies you always push, regardless of whether they have anything to do with the latest outrage; or latch onto a detail of that crime, inflating its importance to support a seemingly germane solution. All three of those strategies were on display after a gunman murdered 12 people at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center on Friday. None of them reflected well on the persuasive powers of leading gun control advocates, who long ago abandoned logic in favor of emotional appeals and moral posturing. ""Enough is enough,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden. ""We must act now."" Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who are competing with Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination and have made gun control a prominent component of their campaigns, concurred. ""Enough of excuses,"" Booker said, calling for ""commonsense things."" Harris announced that she was ""sick and tired"" of ""senseless violence."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has supported restrictions on firearms throughout her career, declared that ""it's time for commonsense gun safety laws."" Details TBD. Feinstein's reticence was understandable. The gun control policy with which she is most strongly identified -- banning so-called assault weapons, which are distinguished from other firearms by mostly cosmetic features that do not affect their lethality -- was plainly irrelevant to the Virginia Beach shooting, the perpetrator of which, like most mass shooters, used ordinary handguns. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence was more specific, urging Congress to pass a bill that would prohibit firearm sales unless they involve federally licensed dealers, who are legally required to conduct background checks. But according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Virginia Beach killer bought his weapons legally, meaning he either passed a background check or would have, which is typically true of mass shooters. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nominee, noted that the killer used ""silencing equipment,"" which she thinks demonstrates the folly of loosening restrictions on such accessories. ""The sound of gunfire can save lives,"" she said. So-called silencers, aka suppressors, do not eliminate ""the sound of gunfire."" On average, they reduce the noise generated by a .45 ACP pistol (the kind used in Friday's attack) from around 157 decibels to something like 127 decibels, which is still louder than a siren or a thunderclap. It's not surprising, then, that ""most law enforcement experts say"" the Virginia Beach shooter's suppressor ""likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time,"" as the Associated Press noted. The perpetrator of last week's attack also used ""extended magazines,"" although police have not specified their capacity. A bill that would have imposed a 10-round limit on magazines died in the Virginia Legislature last January, and Feinstein has proposed the same limit at the federal level. As switching magazines takes a couple of seconds, the significance of having to do it more often while attacking unarmed people is debatable. But if having more than 10 rounds in a magazine sometimes matters in such cases, that is even more likely to be true for someone defending himself against armed attackers. When states impose limits on magazines, current and retired police officers always insist that legislators make exceptions for them. They clearly recognize that larger magazines have legitimate defensive uses; they just don't think ordinary citizens deserve the advantage they demand for themselves. In April, a federal judge concluded that California's 10-round magazine limit ""places a severe restriction on the core right of self-defense of the home such that it amounts to a destruction of the right and is unconstitutional under any level of scrutiny."" For advocates of ""commonsense gun safety laws,"" the Second Amendment is just another detail they would prefer to ignore.

A mass shooting by a white supremacist at two Christchurch mosques claimed 51 lives and narrowly missed the Bangladesh players who were arriving for Friday prayers just as the shooting was taking place. But the team's coach now says that the horrifying incident has brought the players closer together, according to News18.com. Now with a surprisingly definitive win over South Africa already recorded, the Tigers face the Black Caps again -- with New Zealand also having won their first match, against Sri Lanka -- in a crucial early-stage Cricket World Cup match that will live stream from London. To find out how to watch a live stream of the Bangladesh vs. New Zealand 2019 Cricket World Cup ninth ODI match, see the streaming information at the bottom of this article. The first ball is scheduled to be bowled at 1:30 p.m. British Summer Time on Wednesday, June 5, at the 25,500-capacity Kia Oval, in Kennington, London, England. The match will also get started at 6:30 p.m. Bangladesh Standard Time and 6 p.m. India Standard Time. Fans in New Zealand, however, can log in to the live stream starting at 12:30 a.m. on Thursday morning, June 6. In the United States, cricket fans will need to set their alarm clocks to catch the ninth World Cup match -- the second for both Bangladesh and New Zealand -- with a start time of 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, 5:30 a.m. Pacific. Prior to the tragedy which cut their tour short, Bangladesh had suffered a three-match whitewash in an ODI series to New Zealand — and in four World Cup matches, the Tigers have never defeated New Zealand, according to CricBuzz. As if heading into the New Zealand match having won five of their last six ODI matches was not remarkable enough for Bangladesh, but in their opener they defeated South Africa by 21 runs even though, as The Dhaka Tribune reported, three of their key senior players, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad, and Mehedi Hasan Miraz, fasted through the game in honor of the month-long Muslim holiday of Ramadan. Clerical authorities often give professional athletes a choice of whether to fast on days that they compete, but the three Bangladesh players went ahead with their fast anyway. Here are the expected teams for Wednesday's Bangladesh vs. New Zealand Cricket World Cup match.

Laquita Brown, Keith Cox, Tara Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alex Gusev, Joshua Hardy, Missy Langer, Richard Nettleton, Katherine Nixon, Christopher Rapp, Bert Snelling, and Bobby Williams should not have died. Their deaths have robbed Virginia Beach of neighbors who served the community and their loved ones of countless future memories. Devastated, distraught, confused, angry, afraid: the adjectives a person, community, state, or even entire nation feels after a mass shooting could fill a large dictionary on their own.  I wish I didn’t have prior experience with this, but I do. When I was governor of Virginia in 2007, a gunman killed 32 people at Virginia Tech. Like the 12 Virginia Beach victims, these 32 people had friends, families, accomplishments, and aspirations, all cut short in a matter of minutes. The emotional weight of that day was overwhelming. Parents learned they would never hold their children again. A Holocaust survivor sacrificed himself so his students could escape. Students, faculty, and staff wondered whether they would ever again feel safe on campus. Read more commentary: After Virginia Beach shooting, don't say it's 'too soon' to fix gun laws: Patti Davis Virginia Beach shooting: Cover gunmen, but don't turn them into celebrity role models My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too. We turned our pain into action then. Despite a judge previously finding the gunman mentally ill and in need of treatment, he was still able to purchase the guns he used in the attack because the court hadn’t entered its finding into the national background check system. Determined to address this shortfall, I signed an executive order requiring courts to report such involuntary mental health commitments and later cemented this policy into law. No one thought that this one fix would prevent all gun violence, but it was an important change that aimed to stop dangerous people from buying weapons. We tried to do more by closing the gun show loophole that allows someone to buy a gun without a background check, but Republicans blocked our efforts. In the same way we examined how weaknesses in our laws led to the Virginia Tech tragedy, we should examine which ones led to the Virginia Beach tragedy. Police have already said the gunman used extended magazines in his rampage. Magazines holding more than the standard capacity enable a shooter to fire repeatedly with fewer pauses to reload, giving potential victims less of a chance to escape and allowing the killer more shots until he’s stopped. Despite this clear hazard, Virginia has no legal limit on magazine size.  (Actually, Virginia and other states do have magazine limitations on hunting rifles. It is not humane to animals if hunters use extended magazines. But I guess we care less about weapons used to kill people.) Earlier this year, a Virginia Senate committee considered a bill to ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds; Republicans defeated it. In recent Congresses, I’ve cosponsored similar bills on the national level; Republicans refuse to bring them up for a vote. We can’t say for certain how Friday might have been different had magazine limits passed and gone into effect in time, but it is entirely plausible that, had the shooter been limited to smaller magazines, he would have fired fewer rounds and some of those victims might still be alive.  We also know of reforms that could have prevented other tragedies. Despite being prohibited from buying a gun, the Charleston church shooter purchased the weapon he used to murder nine people in 2015 because a legal loophole allowed the seller to complete the sale before the background check was finished. (Twenty-two percent of guns are obtained without a background check in the U.S.) The House passed bills to close this “Charleston loophole” and the gun show loophole back in February, but Republican leadership refuses to let the Senate consider them. With all due credit, the Trump administration did the right thing by recently banning bump stocks, the rifle attachment used when a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017. That was a good step, and I hope the president and congressional Republicans will work with us on banning high-capacity magazines and closing the background check loopholes. We should also acknowledge that nearly two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides and strengthen the background check system to stop suicidal individuals from buying a gun. We should pass a bill in Congress to encourage state, local, and tribal governments to adopt extreme risk protection orders that would remove firearms from individuals who exhibit signs of a mental health crisis. We should wake up to the fact that over a million American women have been shot by an intimate partner and pass laws that prevent domestic abusers from keeping a gun.  The bottom line is this — after each tragedy, we have the opportunity to learn and improve. And Americans, even those who own guns, strongly support many of the commonsense measures I mention here. The question is whether we will continue to offer platitudes but refuse to act to protect our communities.  After a high-profile shooting, we mourn the victims and ask questions about the motivations of perpetrators. But we should also look in the mirror and ask something about ourselves. Will we continue to be bystanders, allowing carnage to occur all around us, taking no action to stop it? Or will we muster the backbone to improve our laws? Sen.

202,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/scot-peterson-parkland-shooting.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Audra D. S. Burch and Adeel Hassan FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — One horrific afternoon at a Parkland, Fla., high school changed the politics of this state. For 16 months, Florida has been grappling with issues raised by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. There have been official investigations into what occurred, legislative debates about how to reduce the chances of another attack, and on Tuesday, the dramatic charging of a school resource officer who retreated rather than run into the school. “I can think of few things that have impacted Florida and captured the attention of the Legislature in the way that Parkland has,” said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who helped Parkland students and parents navigate the Legislature. “Parkland still very much has legs in the political discourse.” In the months after a shooting that left 17 dead, the issues of guns and school safety came up in elections across the state. Candidates detailed their positions on how they would help head off a similar rampage. Scot Peterson, a former Broward County sheriff’s deputy and school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., faces 11 charges of neglect of a child, culpable negligence and perjury. [Read more about the charged officer and the role bravery plays in policing.] Faced with Parkland’s grim distinction as one of the deadliest school shootings in American history, some Republicans shifted their positions and signed the state-level gun bill — without paying a political price. “Before Parkland, the idea that the Florida Legislature would pass legislation that contained gun control was unthinkable. And not one of the Republicans that signed the bill lost in their primary,” Mr. Schale said. “Not even Democrats were talking about gun control statewide 10 years ago. This changed the whole conversation.” Jared Moskowitz, a former state legislator who shepherded Florida’s most aggressive gun measures in years, said the Parkland shooting helped to shape contemporary politics. “Maybe we won’t be talking about it in 30 years, but for now, it’s woven into Florida’s fabric,” said Mr. Moskowitz, a graduate of Stoneman Douglas High. “Parkland forced elected officials to weigh in on school safety and gun reform. If you didn’t before, you do now because it’s the right thing to do.” The fallout of the shooting was immediate, both in Tallahassee and in Broward County. Days after the shooting, investigators focused on the action — or inaction — of Scot Peterson, the only armed guard on campus. A far-reaching gun control measure was adopted last year and a new measure to arm teachers was recently approved. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was elected in November, replaced the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, over his handling of the massacre. Much of Parkland’s lingering influence comes from the high-profile activism of the student survivors and the parents of the victims. They demanded accountability from their elected officials and made the case that there were a number of missed signs of the threat posed by the gunman, who was a former student. They also expressed rage at the missteps that were revealed about the official response. The arrest of Mr. Peterson, 56, on seven counts of felony neglect of a child, as well as culpable negligence and perjury charges, was the most significant step yet to hold someone responsible for the mass shooting. [Police officers are trained to confront suspects. But what if they are afraid?] Mr. Peterson made his first court appearance on Wednesday. He appeared for a bond hearing in magistrates court in Fort Lauderdale via video link from the Broward County Jail. Following an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the former deputy, who was the only armed guard on campus but retreated to a position of safety during the attack, was found to have done “absolutely nothing to mitigate” the carnage, according to law enforcement officials. After Wednesday’s bail hearing, Mr. Peterson’s lawyer, Joseph DiRuzzo III, said he expected that his client would be able to post the $102,000 bond and be released. “We are waiting for the case to be assigned to a circuit criminal judge. We intend to file a motion to reduce bond and a motion to modify the terms of pretrial release,” he told reporters, adding that he was “anticipating it shouldn’t take very long.” Parkland parents greeted the news of the arrest with weary relief. “I think it’s a good step forward in our search for accountability,” said Ryan Petty, whose daughter, Alaina, was killed in the shooting.

203,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/05/pratt-virginia-beach-gun/,"Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The calls for more gun control are in full swing. Following the Virginia Beach mass shooting last Friday, Democrat presidential hopefuls are lining up to restrict the rights of honest Americans and to shred the Second Amendment. The comments from socialist Bernie Sanders are typical. In the aftermath of the shooting, he blasted the gun lobby for “controlling Congress” and called for more “gun safety legislation” as the panacea for every societal ill. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam followed with his own calls for specific gun restrictions. But in the midst of all the hyperbole, there was one inadvertent admission. The chief of police in Virginia Beach — a gun control advocate himself — admitted that additional gun control would not have made a difference. Here’s why Chief James Cervera is right on this point. 1) Gun-free zones are a failure. A key premise to the gun control view is that Americans would be safer if guns were banned at various locations. Hence, we see gun-free zones have been imposed at every school in the country, in government buildings, at sporting events, etc. But this won’t make Americans safe. Case in point: the Virginia Beach shooting effectively occurred in a gun-free zone. City employees are prohibited from carrying firearms, so they were sitting ducks when the killer chose them as the targets. This shooting is not an isolated incident, as almost 98 percent of the mass shootings that occur in this country occur in gun-free zones. 2) Universal Background Checks proven totally ineffective. The anti-gun left incessantly argues for running every gun purchase through a background check. But they ignore the fact that 95 percent of initial denials are false positives, stopping people who are not really criminals. Plus, they ignore the fact that virtually every mass shooter in recent memory has passed a background check. This killer was no different — he passed background checks in purchasing his firearms. So how would imposing even MORE background checks make us any safer? 3) Banning AR-15 style firearms misses the mark. Those who hold an irrational fear of firearms are relentless in their calls for banning commonly-owned firearms like the AR-15. But here again, a ban on these guns would have done no good. The Virginia Beach killer used two handguns, which by the way, is the weapon-of-choice for mass shooters — not the AR-15. 4) Suppressors don’t allow “stealth” killing. Anti-gun zealots have seized on the fact that the killer used a suppressor, as justification for banning these items. Yet suppressors are simply a safety device to protect people’s hearing. They are more like a car muffler, rather than the Hollywood notion of a “silencer.” Suppressors don’t reduce the sound to a whisper as so deceptively portrayed in so many movies. Not surprisingly, witnesses in Virginia Beach reported that they “heard” the gunshots, which is a clear indication that the myth of the silencer is just that — a myth. 5) Limiting magazine capacity becomes harmful to the innocent. Finally, the left would have us believe that if standard-to-large capacity magazines were banned, this killer would have been unable to find magazines larger than five or 10 rounds. But to believe that, one would have to believe that Prohibition effectively kept people from drinking booze and that the War on Drugs was equally successful. The truth is that limiting magazine capacity will endanger law-abiding Americans. Consider recent examples of self-defense where Americans needed weapons with so-called “hi-capacity” magazines to protect themselves. When he heard the clicking sound, he turned and savagely beat her. The homeowner survived, but she has promised to buy a new gun — one with a good-sized magazine. Good thing, because she needs it. To hear anti-gunners like Sanders and Northam speak, one would think that the United States is the world leader when it comes to mass shootings. The truth is that our country is near the bottom of the list — placing 64th (in per capita frequency) in a list of 97 countries that have had mass shootings. And what about the worst 63 nations? They all have stricter gun control than the United States, which just goes to show that gun control is a huge failure — not just here, but around the globe, as well.

207,https://pjmedia.com/faith/jerry-falwell-comes-out-swinging-at-pastor-who-prayed-for-trump-with-a-crude-tweet/,"It all started when Franklin Graham, CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan’s Purse, issued a plea to the nation to pray for President Trump. Graham made an announcement on his Facebook page at the end of May, asking Christians to set aside June 2 “as a special day of prayer for the president.” “We know that God hears and answers prayer.” he wrote. “He can soften hearts and change minds. He is all-powerful, and He rules over the affairs of nations. The Bible instructs us to pray for those in authority, “that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior” (1 Timothy 2:2–3).” The Bible commands Christians to pray for those in authority over us — the church I attend does it regularly, no matter the president — so it shouldn’t be a stretch for any Christian or church to do so. Whether or not we agree with the president and his policies, we are to pray for him (for the record, I said the same thing about Obama). In reality, there should be no need for Graham or anyone else to call Christians to pray for Trump. They should already be doing it. Fast-forward to this past Sunday, June 2, when President Trump showed up unannounced at McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Va., clad in khakis, a polo shirt, and a blazer fresh off a round of golf. A spokesperson for the White House said the president was there to “visit with the pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,” where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting on Friday. In a blog post later that day, Pastor David Platt described what happened next: At the end of my sermon at the 1:00 worship gathering, I stepped to the side for what I thought would be a couple of moments in quiet reflection as we prepared to take the Lord’s Supper. But I was immediately called backstage and told that the President of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him. I immediately thought about my longing to guard the integrity of the gospel in our church. As I said in the sermon today, Christ alone unites us. I love that we have over 100 nations represented in our church family, including all kinds of people with varied personal histories and political opinions from varied socioeconomic situations. It’s clear in our church that the only reason we’re together is because we have the same King we adore, worship, fear, and follow with supreme love and absolute loyalty, and His name is Jesus. He said he immediately thought of the verse from 1 Timothy above commanding Christians to pray “for kings and all who are in high positions” and “decided to take this unique opportunity for us as a church to pray over him together.” Platt explained in the blog post that he was in no way endorsing the president, his policies, or his party, rather, he wanted to “to obey God’s command to pray for our president and other leaders to govern in the way this passage portrays.” As he waited for the president to arrive, Platt wrote, “In that brief moment, I prayed specifically for an opportunity to speak the gospel to him, and for faithfulness to pray the gospel over him.” While I won’t go into the details of our conversation backstage, one of our other pastors and I spoke the gospel in a way that I pray was clear, forthright, and compassionate. Then I walked back out on stage, read 1 Timothy 2:1-6, and sought to pray the Word of God over the president, other leaders, and our country… After I prayed, the president walked off stage without comment, and we closed our gathering by celebrating heroes among us, a couple who has spent the last 48 years spreading the gospel in remote places where it had never gone before they came. We then recited the Great Commission as we always do, sending one another out into the city for the glory of our King. Platt’s prayer—faithful, biblical—is worth reprinting in its entirety: O God, we praise you as the one universal king over all. You are our leader and our Lord and we worship you. There is one God and one Savior—and it’s you, and your name is Jesus. And we exalt you, Jesus. We know we need your mercy. We need your grace. We need your help. We need your wisdom in our country. And so we stand right now on behalf of our president, and we pray for your grace and your mercy and your wisdom upon him. God, we pray that he would know how much you love him—so much that you sent Jesus to die for his sins, our sins—so we pray that he would look to you. That he would trust in you, that he would lean on you. That he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice, and good for righteousness, and good for equity, every good path. Lord we pray, we pray, that you would give him all the grace he needs to govern in ways that we just saw in 1 Timothy 2 that lead to peaceful and quiet lives, godly and dignified in every way. God we pray for your blessing in that way upon his family. We pray that you would give them strength. We pray that you would give them clarity. Wisdom, wisdom, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction. Please, O God, give him wisdom and help him to lead our country alongside other leaders. We pray today for leaders in Congress. We pray for leaders in courts. We pray for leaders in national and state levels. Please, O God, help us to look to you, help us to trust in your Word, help us to seek your wisdom, and live in ways that reflect your love and your grace, your righteousness and your justice. We pray for your blessings on our president toward that end. Platt modeled, with his prayer and in his desire to share Christ with the president, what a pastor ought to do in this situation. He neither praised Trump nor criticized him; he prayed scripture over him and prayed that Trump would look to God. Platt had an opportunity to share the gospel with the leader of the free world and he took it. And then he followed God’s command to pray for Trump. But nothing involving Trump is simple. The media freaked out, Twitter went wild, and Platt received complaints from members of his church (which prompted the blog post), saying that they were hurt by what Platt did. “I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision,” he wrote. “This weighs heavy on my heart. I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God’s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God.” Platt said that while he was thankful he had a unique opportunity to obey the Bible’s command to pray for our leaders, “I don’t want to purposely ever do anything that undermines the unity we have in Christ.” He asked his church to pray with him for the “gospel seed that was sown today to bear fruit in the president’s heart.” “I’m guessing that all of us will face other decisions this week where we don’t have time to deliberate on what to do,” he said. “I’m praying now for grace and wisdom for all of us to do exactly what we talked about in the Word today: aim for God’s glory, align with God’s purpose, and yield to God’s sovereignty.” The letter was biblical, pastoral, faithful. But… Twitter again went wild, with some accusing Platt of being a tool of the president who was politicizing his church, and others screeching that Platt was a spineless coward for writing a blog post explaining his actions to his church family. Can you guess which side Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, was on? It probably won’t surprise you that he came out swinging at the pastor who had just shared the gospel with Trump. And he couldn’t resist being crude, his preemptive apology notwithstanding: “Sorry to be crude but pastors like @plattdavid need to grow a pair. Just saying,” Falwell tweeted. https://twitter.com/JerryFalwellJr/status/1135956770931838982 Classy. (Update: the tweet has been deleted.) Platt was in a tough position. He had but a few minutes to decide what to do. He didn’t want to politicize his church, but he also didn’t want to pass up the opportunity to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with the president. He chose to engage with Trump—obeying the Great Commission and Timothy’s command to pray for those in authority as well as Peter’s admonition to “always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.” Sure, he could have declined, could have sent Trump and his polo shirt packing, could have avoided the controversy, but he didn’t—and now, sadly, he’s taking flack from all sides. Whatever Trump’s reasons were for showing up, his surprise visit, which disrupted the flow of the church’s regular Sunday services, put Platt in a difficult position. I hope and pray that if I were ever in that position I would have the presence of mind and temerity to pray such a prayer and to speak truth into the president’s life on a moment’s notice — and I hope Falwell would too, and that he has done so during his many photo ops with the president. But shame on Falwell for heaping scorn on to this young pastor who, through no fault of his own, was thrust into a situation he couldn’t have anticipated when he awoke that morning and made his way to church. Falwell, whose unbridled, unconditional love for Trump has colored his judgment, seems unable to accept that there might be legitimate reasons for Christians to object to seeing a polarizing political figure on stage at their church when they showed up to worship God that day. I suppose that Falwell would prefer to see Platt give his congregation a good thumping for not being sufficiently loyal to Trump (the cruder the better!) but that’s not a pastor’s calling, nor is it the calling of churches. The purpose of the church is to teach the Word of God, edify the body of Christ, and to encourage evangelism among the congregants. Platt did all those things and ought to be praised for his faithfulness to God. As much as it must rankle Falwell to know that not all Christians are equally enamored with the president, he needs to understand that there is room in Christianity for those who don’t approve of Trump—and for those who believe that politics should be kept out of the pulpit.

208,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/05/youtube-says-it-will-take-down-neo-nazi-and-other-extremist-videos/,"Trending: YouTube said Wednesday that it is launching a new campaign to rid its site of extremist political and personal videos, such as those promoting white supremacy and neo-Nazism, as the video publishing platform seeks to crack down on hate speech. YouTube, which is owned by Google, laid out the guidelines of its latest crackdown in a company blog post. No specific video producers or channels were named, but YouTube said that “videos that promote or glorify Nazi ideology” would be targeted under the new policies. “(We are) specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status,” YouTube said in announcing its latest effort to police content on its site. The company added that it would also begin removing videos that deny that violent events like the Holocaust and the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. YouTube said it would begin enforcing the new video policies on Wednesday, but the size of the issue means that “it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up and we’ll be gradually expanding coverage over the next several months.” The size of YouTube speaks to the scale of the task at hand for the company. Approximately 1.3 billion people around the globe use YouTube, and more than 5 billion videos are watched on the site each day. It’s also estimated that 300 to 500 new videos are uploaded onto YouTube every minute. YouTube’s latest move against hate speech comes one day after the company determined that videos posted by conservative YouTuber Steven Crowder, in which he used racial and homophobic language to described Vox writer Carlos Maza, didn’t violate YouTube’s policy usage terms. A report this week from the New York Times also described the proliferation of home videos that include images of children in swimsuits as a “buffet” for pedophiles.

But Claypool rejects claims that Florida school resource officer Scot Peterson was made a scapegoat this week when he was criminally charged with child neglect and culpable negligence, accused of inaction during critical minutes while a gunman was killing 17 students and teachers at a Parkland school last year. “I 100% applaud the arrest,” Claypool told USA TODAY. “It goes way above Peterson, it will send shock waves across the country. It is sending a message that schools must provide security for their kids.” Peterson, 56, faces seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury. He was working on the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High on Valentine’s Day last year when the shooting started, and when he arrived at the freshman building the carnage had not yet ended. The arrest warrant claims Peterson stayed outside, moving several feet to a position of “increased personal safety” before six of the victims were fatally shot. It accuses him of “failing, declining or refusing” to confront the shooter. A judge on Wednesday set bail at $102,000, and defense attorney Joseph DiRuzzo III said he expected his client to be released soon. Claypool said gun restrictions and stronger mental health programs are crucial in the effort to halt the phenomenon of mass shootings across the nation. But he also said school officials must be held responsible for ensuring student safety. Claypool said he would support charges against school administrators for providing security officers that allowed a dangerous former student access to the school – “they failed, too.” “This is  one of the components,” Claypool said. “But Peterson isn’t a scapegoat, he should be a starting point.” More: 'I'm sick to my stomach': 17 dead in Florida high school shooting; former student in custody Peterson has said he believed the shooting was taking place outside and followed protocol. DiRuzzo said Tuesday that his client is being made a scapegoat, calling the charges “nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at politically motivated retribution.” Jonathan Metzl, a professor of sociology and medicine, health and society at Vanderbilt University, says he is in no position to judge whether Peterson’s behavior was criminal. But he says focusing on the actions of one person raises the risk of “overlooking much bigger, systemic issues” that impact mass shootings “There is evidence that they happen less frequently in states with strong gun laws and surrounded by strong gun-law states,” he said. “Potential red flags such as someone’s personal history are obviously important. We should be careful before we lay the blame at the feet of someone who did not rush in.” Claypool was at an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas strip in October 2017 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd, killing 58 people. Claypool vividly remembers stepping over bodies and dodging bullets as they ricocheted around him. The trial lawyer represents more than 100 fellow survivors in litigation related to the shooting. Claypool acknowledges that convictions might be difficult on some of the charges. He said showing gross recklessness and gross disregard would be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Still, he applauds the prosecutors. More: Parkland school shooting panel backs arming teachers, rips responding deputies “I lived through a mass shooting, and I will tell you that any step in the right direction is monumental,” he said. Florida lawyer Mark O’Mara agrees that convictions could be difficult to obtain. O’Mara, who successfully defended George Zimmerman after he fatally shot Trayvon Martin in 2013, says radio transmissions between Peterson and other officers could help determine the officer’s fate. Some of that was included in the arrest warrant. “If they said breach the door and he didn’t, then he deserves a bunch of charges,” O’Mara said. “But it’s very unusual for a cop to be held responsible for not doing something in the face of insurmountable force.” More: These dogs helped Parkland students cope with tragedy. They got their own yearbook page If he were representing Peterson, O'Mara said he would explain to a jury that Peterson was in a “war zone” and provide an expert to testify how people react in times of stress. “Even cops who are trained, the training isn’t always particularly effective,” O'Mara said. Some of the Parkland survivors have expressed strong support for the arrest. Student Cameron Kasky tweeted that he was “thrilled” with the charges, saying it’s nice to know “some evil people get the punishment they deserve.” Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter, Jaime, was among those who died, expressed similar thoughts. “I have no comment except to say rot in hell Scott Petersen,” Guttenberg tweeted. “You could have saved some of the 17. You could have saved my daughter.  You did not and then you lied about it and you deserve the misery coming your way.”",2019-06-05 16:00:35,Parkland resource officer Scot Peterson stayed outside as bullets flew.

212,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-virginia-beach-shooting-20190605-story.html,"VIRGINIA BEACH, VA. — Police responding to the deadly mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building were unable to confront the gunman at one point because they didn't have the key cards needed to open doors on the second floor. Over the radio, they desperately pleaded for the electronic cards and talked of bringing in a sledgehammer, an explosive charge or other means of breaking down the doors. The killer was eventually gunned down, and whether the delay contributed to the toll of 12 victims dead and four wounded is unclear. But the episode last week illustrated how door-lock technology that is supposed to protect people from workplace violence can hamper police and rescue workers in an emergency. ""That's definitely a blind spot that this particular shooting has shown,"" said Gregory Shaffer, a retired FBI agent and former member of the bureau's elite hostage rescue team. ""We need to make sure that first responders have full access to the building."" The attacker, 40-year-old city engineer DeWayne Craddock, went from floor to floor shooting his co-workers in the rampage last Friday before he was finally killed on the second floor in a gun battle with police. It was not clear how police finally got to Craddock. Virginia Beach police spokeswoman Linda Kuehn said police were unavailable to talk about the matter on Wednesday. These are the 12 victims of the Virginia Beach mass shooting. Here are their stories. Police Chief James Cervera said the mayhem at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center lasted nearly 36 minutes from the time the gunman started shooting until police took him down. At about the same time officers were evacuating terrified employees from the third floor, other officers were on the second floor, frantically trying to get to the gunman after he fired at them through doors and walls. On police scanners, officers could be heard becoming exasperated as they tried unsuccessfully to get into locked areas. ""We need access keys. The doors are locked, we need access keys. I know I've got citizens in one area of the second floor I can't evacuate,"" said one officer. Key cards have become a standard feature of building security at workplaces around the country. The technology has been used for decades, but it wasn't until after 9/11 that it really began to proliferate, said Tom Manger, a former police chief in Virginia and Maryland and now senior associate director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. ""It became seen as best practice. And today it is seen by most people as not only best practice but as a necessity,"" Manger said. But in many workplaces, security experts say, police often lack quick access to cards or codes — a situation that could cost them precious minutes in a mass shooting. One exception is schools, which have been at the forefront in ensuring that police can quickly get inside with their own key cards or other methods. Key card technology posed a problem for some of the police officers who responded to a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, according to a report by the city's police. Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist, killed 12 people before being shot dead in the maze-like, 600,000-square-foot building. A Washington police officer ""had the presence of mind"" to take a building access card from a deceased security guard, allowing a team of first responders to get into secure areas, the report said. Police in some cities have made arrangements to install lock boxes containing key cards or keys outside public and private buildings. But Manger said ""there's not enough key cards and lock boxes in the world"" to give emergency responders easy access to every building. ""There's no option that's perfect,"" he said. ""You've got to sort of tailor it the building and the situation. But what you can say universally is that this is a conversation and a discussion that needs to happen ahead of time to make sure that first responders can get to a place they need to go."" In the case of the Virginia Beach shooting, the police department and the operations building where the shooting took place were part of the same complex, and police had to run maybe 300 yards to get there. Both the police and the departments inside the building are city agencies. Shaffer said police are trained to break into buildings and often have the tools to do so, as the radio chatter about sledgehammers and explosives indicated, and he defended the handling of the mass shooting by the Virginia Beach force. He said police ""definitely saved lives through their fast response."" ""They did exactly what they were supposed to do and ran toward the gunfire,"" he said.

Talks between the Vegas Golden Knights and defenseman Deryk Engelland on a new contract have yet to get off the ground, according to David Pagnotta of the Fourth Period, raising intrigue on the 37-year-old’s future with the club. Engelland was a top-four defenseman for the second consecutive season in Vegas. His first year resulted in a 23-point season, an NHL career-high, and his performance was rewarded with a one-year extension worth $2.5 million AAV signed on Jan. 15, 2018. Year 2, however, was a steep dropoff for the longtime Las Vegas resident. His 12 points were his lowest since 2015-16, and he averaged nearly five minutes more of ice time this season than that year. The obvious desire for a partnerhship between Engelland and the Golden Knights is no secret. Vegas selected him in the expansion draft two years ago from the Calgary Flames with the understanding that his residency in Las Vegas would make him valuable to the Golden Knights in that regard. His play in Year 1, as a veteran presence that helped lead Vegas to the Stanley Cup Final, was a bonus. He was also a catalyst in helping Las Vegas heal following the Oct. 1 mass shooting two years ago, giving a speech before Vegas’ home opener Oct. 10 that punctuated with, “We are Vegas Strong.” Engelland also expressed desire, to no surprise, that he would like to come back following Vegas’ stunning seven-game loss to the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference First Round this season. But while the partnership is evident, the numbers and roster space won’t agree. The Golden Knights are expected to be capped out when the new league year starts, and there are more pressing needs Vegas will have to tend to this summer, not limited to William Karlsson’s and Nikita Gusev’s impending restricted free agency.

218,https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/gillibrand-misleads-on-trumps-bump-stock-ban/,"By Robert Farley Posted on June 5, 2019 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand claimed President Donald Trump failed to keep his promise after a mass shooting in Las Vegas to ban bump stocks. Trump may not have moved as quickly as Gillibrand would have liked, but Trump did enact a bump stock ban, which went into effect in March. At a town hall event hosted by Fox News on June 2, the Democratic presidential candidate from New York was asked what she would do as president to reduce gun violence. Gillibrand blamed the influence of the National Rifle Association for blocking popular gun control measures, such as universal background checks. She also said she would “make sure we ban the bump stock, the large magazines, the assault rifles, the military style weapons.” A “bump stock” is a plastic or metal device that can be attached to the rear of a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot almost as fast as a fully automatic weapon. The stock uses recoil to make the weapon bump back and forth between the shooter’s shoulder and trigger finger, causing the firearm to fire rapidly. Fox News host Chris Wallace asked Gillibrand if there’s anything that could have been done to stop the mass shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31. (It was later learned that the shooter had legally purchased the handguns used in the attack. The guns were not enhanced by a bump stock, but the shooter did have multiple extended magazines that allowed him to fire more rounds.) “Yeah, stop being beholden to the NRA like President Trump is,” Gillibrand said. “Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he [Trump] said, yeah, yeah we’re gonna ban the bump stocks. Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.’ It is such a false choice.” Gillibrand was referring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017 perpetrated by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, who used AR-style rifles affixed with bump stocks to shoot people attending an outdoor concert. That day, 59 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. Several days after the shooting, Trump was asked if bump stocks should be banned, and he vowed his administration would “be looking into that over the next short period of time.” The NRA seemed supportive of the idea. NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and NRA political strategist Chris Cox issued a statement saying, “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” The NRA later clarified that it did not support a total ban, and that it was opposed to legislative action, preferring instead a revised regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). (That position led some gun control advocates to speculate the NRA was not sincere about regulating bump stocks, and was merely trying to divert attention from a legislative effort that might have ended with a complete ban.) Two months after the Las Vegas shooting, the Justice Department and the ATF announced that it had begun the regulatory process to determine if bump stocks were prohibited under existing federal laws that ban the use of machine guns. As we have written, the ATF determined several times since 2008 that certain models of bump stocks could not be prohibited under existing gun laws On Dec. 26, 2017, the ATF published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to clarify whether “bump fire” stocks fell within the definition of “machinegun.” According to the White House, public comment on that notice concluded on Jan. 25, 2018, with the Department of Justice receiving over 100,000 comments. The mass school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, 2018 — which left 17 dead — brought gun control back into the forefront of the national debate. On Feb. 20, 2018, Trump announced that he had signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to “dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received, and, as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.” That ultimately led the Department of Justice and ATF to issue a new federal regulation on Dec. 18, 2018, officially banning bump stocks. ATF, Department of Justice Final Rule, Dec. 18, 2018: The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to clarify that bump-stock-type devices — meaning “bump fire” stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics — are “machineguns” as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger. Specifically, these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machinegun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter. Hence, a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger. With limited exceptions, the Gun Control Act, as amended, makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The bumpstock-type devices covered by this final rule were not in existence prior to the effective date of the statute, and therefore will be prohibited when this rule becomes effective. The rule required the owners of any bump stocks to destroy the devices or turn them in at an ATF office prior to March 26, when the rule went into effect. NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said the NRA was “disappointed” with the president’s rule because it did not provide a grandfather clause allowing gun owners who already had the devices to keep them. Giffords, a gun control group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, said the new rule is “a positive step, but it is not enough.” “Congress still failed to take any action and instead passed the buck to the ATF, complicating the situation and opening the door to prolonged judicial disputes,” Giffords Senior Policy Advisor David Chapman said in a press release. “It’s horrifying to think that for over 500 days [after the Las Vegas shooting], bump stocks have remained available for purchase — and in danger of falling into the wrong hands. In that same time, our country’s gun violence crisis has continued unabated, while Republican leadership and the Trump Administration have done nothing to stop it.” Chapman was right that the regulation would be challenged by gun rights groups, but to date, the courts have upheld the rule. So, contrary to Gillibrand’s claim, Trump banned bump stocks and he did so despite the NRA’s objection. We asked her campaign what she meant when she said Trump did not ban the bump stock “because the NRA came crashing down” on him. “Senator Gillibrand’s statement during the town hall referred to the time immediately following the Las Vegas shooting, when President Trump first expressed openness to banning bump stocks, then backed down after being forcefully rebuffed by the NRA, who took victory laps over his retreat,” Evan Lukaske, national press secretary for the Gillibrand campaign, told us via email. Lukaske pointed to a New York Times story on Dec. 18, 2018, that said the NRA’s Cox “bragged in an interview with a gun enthusiast that the organization’s actions had succeeded in slowing down momentum for legislative reform.” “Senator Gillibrand acknowledges that five months after the Las Vegas shooting, bump stocks were eventually banned — much to the NRA’s chagrin,” Lukaske said. “Her statement supports the larger point; the NRA uses money and influence to control members of the Republican Party, and prevent common sense gun reforms that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support.” One can take issue with the speed of the Trump administration’s efforts to ban bump stocks, or fault the president for not quickly rallying Republicans to support legislation to ban bump stocks. But Gillibrand’s comment — “Did he ban the bump stocks? No.” — leaves the impression that the president never enacted a bump stock ban. In fact, Trump spoke consistently about banning bump stocks and his administration did move methodically through the bureaucratic channels and ultimately enacted a regulation to ban them.

219,https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/obama-misrepresents-u-s-gun-laws/,"By Eugene Kiely Posted on June 5, 2019 In remarks at a technology conference in Brazil, former President Barack Obama misrepresented U.S. gun laws, claiming that “anybody can buy any weapon … without much, if any, regulation,” including “machine guns.” Machine guns have been tightly regulated since 1934 and banned since 1986, except for the sale or transfer of such a weapon that “was lawfully registered and possessed before May 19, 1986,” according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. And even then it can only be transferred from one registered owner to another registered owner. Obama made his remarks May 30 at a technology conference hosted by VTEX. During a question and answer period, the former president was asked about his “most difficult day” in office. Obama, May 30: Well, I’ve said this before. The most difficult day that I’ve had was the day that there was a shooting in a school, where 20 small children were shot, as well as some teachers, and you know, my daughters were only a little bit older than these young children that had been shot and I had to go and comfort the parents. And some of you may be aware our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time whether or not (applause) you know, without much, if any, regulation. They can buy it over the internet. They can buy machine guns. The former president is referring to a mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012 that left 26 people dead, including 20 children. A month after the shooting, Obama issued a plan designed to strengthen the nation’s gun laws, but he was unsuccessful in passing any legislation — including his proposals to ban certain assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and expand background checks for gun purchases online and at gun shows. Unable to pass those proposals, the former president announced a series of executive actions in 2016. So, Obama has long held the opinion that U.S. gun laws aren’t strong enough. But even under existing laws it is nearly impossible to legally buy a machine gun, which has been tightly regulated since the passage of the National Firearms Act in 1934, in response to the gangster era. A “machinegun” is defined under existing law as a fully automatic weapon — that is, “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” The 1934 law required machine-gun owners to pay a $200 tax and register their weapon with the federal government. In 1986, machine guns were banned for civilian use under the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act — although the law grandfathered such weapons that were “lawfully possessed” prior to May 19, 1986. Under that law, which remains in effect today, machine guns can be sold or transferred only if they were “lawfully registered and possessed before May 19, 1986,” according to the ATF. As of 2007, there were “approximately 182,600 machine guns available for transfer to civilians in the United States based upon an audit of the ATF-maintained National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record (NFRTR),” according to a 2017 report on gun laws by the Congressional Research Service. We asked Eric Schultz, a spokesman for the former president, what Obama meant when he said “anybody … can buy machine guns.” Schultz said the Obama used the term “machine gun,” which are fully automatic weapons, when he meant semi-automatic weapons that are currently legal to purchase in the United States, such as AR-15 rifles. “He was using ‘machine gun’ as a phrase that everybody understands, especially in a foreign country. He’s obviously not talking about Al Capone tommy guns – he was referring to semi-automatic weapons so people would understand what he’s talking about,” Schultz told us in an email. As for Obama’s remark that “anybody can buy any weapon, any time … without much, if any, regulation,” Schultz referred us to several news articles — including a 2016 PolitiFact article that gave Obama a “mostly true” rating when he said a “violent felon can buy [a gun] over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.” It is illegal for a “violent felon” to purchase any firearm under existing law. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits certain people from buying guns, including someone imprisoned for more than one year. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, federally licensed firearm dealers are required to conduct background checks and cannot sell to “prohibited persons,” such as violent felons. In his 2016 remarks, Obama was referring to those who buy guns online from private sellers, not licensed dealers, and therefore are not required to undergo background checks. While it would be illegal for a violent felon to buy a gun, it still might be possible for them to do so through a private online sale in some states. In this case, Obama prefaced his remarks about machine guns by saying “our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense.” But, in fact, there is a law that bans machine guns — except those that are grandfathered in, as we noted earlier. Obama may not draw a distinction between a semi-automatic and a fully automatic weapon, but the law does. And he misrepresented that law in his remarks before a foreign audience.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Ryan Chilcote reports. WELLINGTON, New Zealand – A New Zealand judge ruled Thursday that media outlets can now show the face of the man accused of killing 51 people at two Christchurch mosques. Two New Zealand courts had previously ruled that television stations, websites, newspapers and other media could only publish images which pixelated the face of Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the 28-year-old Australian white supremacist accused of the March 15 mass shooting. But High Court Judge Cameron Mander wrote in a court note that prosecutors had advised him there was no longer any need to suppress images of Tarrant's face and he was lifting the order. The previous rulings hadn't stopped images of Tarrant from circulating on the internet, and questions remained about whether the court's rulings could be applied to media operating outside of New Zealand's borders. NEW ZEALAND'S NEW GUN LAWS GOING INTO EFFECT LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER MOSQUE SHOOTINGS In this Saturday, March 16, 2019 photo, Brenton Tarrant, the man charged in the Christchurch mosque shootings, appears in the Christchurch District Court, in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
      (AP) Prosecutors and defense lawyers, who have not commented on the case publicly, did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on Thursday. Retired law professor Bill Hodge said the initial argument for suppressing images of Tarrant was likely made to ensure witnesses weren't tainted — that they could identify the gunman from their own recollection and not from seeing a picture in a newspaper. ""I can only assume that neither side is concerned about poisoning the well of identification witnesses,"" Hodge said. The gunman livestreamed much of his attack on Facebook. The chilling 17-minute video, in which he shows his face, was copied and widely viewed on the internet even as tech companies scrambled to remove it. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the accused man's name, and last month helped lead a global pledge named the ""Christchurch Call,"" aimed at boosting efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate, organize extremist groups and broadcast attacks. The White House did not endorse the pledge, citing respect for ""freedom of expression and freedom of the press."" NEW ZEALAND MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT TO UNDERGO MENTAL HEALTH TESTS Hodge said Ardern and other politicians might be making a nice gesture by trying to avoid giving Tarrant the publicity he's likely seeking. But Hodge said that's been somewhat undermined after police decided last month to add a terrorism charge against Tarrant to the charges of murder and attempted murder he already faced. Hodge said the terrorism charge had never been previously tested in New Zealand's court system and it could backfire by giving Tarrant a platform to broadcast his white supremacist views, since defending himself against that charge could give him more scope to express his alleged motives. A spokesperson for Ardern said the prime minister had no comment to make on a matter for the court.

224,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602774664/0/phoenix/nation~Remembering-DDay-Stanley-Cup-Final-Virginia-Beach-shooting-victims-things-to-know-Thursday/,"Like many presidents before him, Donald Trump stood at the edge of Omaha Beach in Normandy on Thursday to commemorate a D-Day invasion anniversary — the 75th, in this case.  But with his ""America First"" foreign policy and his history of criticizing NATO, Trump was unlikely to echo past presidents' ""all-for-one"" message of allied unity, experts said. On Wednesday, Trump attended D-Day events with Queen Elizabeth II in Britain, where he recited a prayer read by President Franklin Roosevelt on June 6, 1944. D-Day was the largest invasion by air, land and sea in history, with more than 5,000 ships, 11,000 airplanes and 150,000 soldiers from the United States, Britain and Canada taking part. Here are five things to know about the day that changed world history. The Virginia Beach city government will hold a remembrance service Thursday night for the 12 victims killed in the mass shooting at a city office building last week. The non-denominational service, which is open to the public, will be held at Rock Church at 7:30 p.m. ET. A longtime Virginia Beach public works employee shot and killed the 12 victims and wounded four others Friday before he was fatally wounded during a gunbattle with police. His motive so far remains a mystery, police said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday called a special legislative session to address gun violence. The Stanley Cup Final now is a best-of-three series following the St. Louis Blues' win in Game 4. With the playoff series tied at two games apiece, it moves to Boston for Game 5 Thursday night (8 p.m. on NBC). The Boston Bruins could be without the services of captain Zdeno Chara, who left the Bruins' Game 4 loss after taking a puck to the face. The Blues, meanwhile, remain relatively healthy as the team chases its first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Veterans will have expanded access to medical care outside Department of Veterans Affairs facilities beginning Thursday under a law signed by President Donald Trump last year. VA officials previously estimated the new rules could increase the number of veterans eligible for VA-sponsored private care to as many as 2.1 million — up from about 560,000. Rules established under the law say the VA will pay for veterans to see non-VA doctors if they have to wait longer than 20 days or drive more than 30 minutes for primary or mental healthcare at a VA facility. For specialty care, they can see private doctors at VA expense if they have to wait longer than 28 days or drive more than an hour to see a VA provider. Spike Lee will honor Denzel Washington’s career by presenting his friend and collaborator with the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award. Lee will present the actor and director with the honor at a gala Thursday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California. The tribute will air on TNT on June 20 at 10 p.m. ET/ PT. The 64-year-old Washington joins the ranks of Mel Brooks, Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Alfred Hitchcock.

Ralph Northam (center) attends a vigil following a shooting in Virginia Beach.Patrick Semansky/AP In the wake of last week’s shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach—which left 12 dead, making it the state’s deadliest shooting in as many years—Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called for a special session of the state’s general assembly to pass stricter gun laws. How the state’s GOP-held legislature behaves in that session, expected to take place this month, could be a bellwether for not only the midterm elections this November, but also the high-stakes elections in 2020. “There’s going to be substantial national coverage looking at Virginia and talking about what it means for the federal election. You’re going to see presidential candidates reflecting on it,” says Kris Brown, the president of the Brady Campaign, a national gun-violence prevention organization. “Whether or not the general assembly passes anything, there’s a huge amount at stake for gun violence prevention in [Virginia’s] upcoming election.” Northam’s agenda for the special session includes laws to limit handgun purchases to one a month, an obligation to report lost or stolen firearms, and a ban on assault weapons and related devices like silencers and high-capacity magazines that the shooter in Virginia Beach used last Friday. He’s most likely to win over GOP supporters in his ask for universal background checks, which more than 90 percent of Virginia voters supported in a 2017 Quinnipiac poll. But exactly what the political landscape looks like when this session convenes is yet to be seen. Virginia hosts its midterm primaries next week, and the GOP candidates who emerge victorious may offer a glimpse of the electorate’s appetite for swift reforms. Time is not on activists’ side: Survivors of mass shootings know how hard it is to keep pressure on lawmakers as the shooting recedes from headlines. A slew of scandals that have plagued Virginia’s Democrats might mean that Republicans, smelling blood in the water, will feel no need to cooperate. Gov. Northam’s approval rating tanked after it was revealed that he might have appeared in a racist photograph in his medical school yearbook, and remained low two months later, dipping below President Trump’s own dismal favorability. The importance of Northam’s efforts extend beyond the state, foreshadowed during the election that brought the governor into power on November 8, 2017.  That’s when something unusual happened. For the first time, gun policy ranked as the second-most important issue to Democratic voters, topped only by health care as a priority. Contrary to conventional wisdom that gun platforms appeal only to one side, Republicans and Democrats were equally represented among the voters for whom guns was their top issue. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the most vocal gun reform advocates in Congress, tweeted an analysis of the race that night as the exit polling rolled in. He attributed that bump to Northam, then Virginia’s governor-elect, for not playing “cute or cozy” with the gun rights lobby. “Yesterday’s Virginia election shows that gun policy is just as big a driver of Democratic turnout as Republican turnout,” he wrote. “Game changer.” Except the game didn’t change. Northam entered office with a legislature held by a narrow Republican majority. For the last two years, attempts to pass stricter gun laws have largely died in committee. But Northam’s special session presents an open question as to whether a perfect storm could finally push Republican lawmakers to pass any gun control measures. Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, suggests it might: “The price of retaining the Republican majority in the legislature will probably involve a serious step toward increasing gun control in the state,” he says. “No action on gun control may very well be the issue that establishes Democratic majority control in both chambers.” That’s a tremendous shift from the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre, when a shooter killed 32 people in a dormitory and an engineering classroom building in April 2007. In the wake of the tragedy, legislation to require background checks for firearms purchased at gun shows died in the state’s Senate Committee. Gun control was a nonstarter among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a state that is home to the National Rifle Association. “One of our priorities over the last decade or so was to make Virginia a state where you can win on guns,” Christian Heyne, now vice president of policy at the Brady Campaign, told me last summer when he worked for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. “It’s a state that historically has been terrible on guns. It was hard to get meetings with the people we needed to talk to.” But as the years wore on, the tragedy at Virginia Tech no longer looked like an anomaly. Northam, a former military physician, described his personal horrors dealing with trauma of gun violence. The October 2017 massacre at a Las Vegas music festival—the deadliest ever on US soil—bolstered Northam’s case just one month before Election Day, with Everytown for Gun Safety, the national gun reform advocacy organization founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pouring at least $2.3 million into his victory. While it’s hard to argue that Democrats’ 2017 successes in Virginia are owed to anything other than antipathy for President Donald Trump, the resonance of the gun issue with Democratic voters indicated a shift. “Ralph Northam differentiated himself on the issue of gun violence prevention—he put it at the top of his candidacy,” Brown, the Brady Campaign’s president, says. “Las Vegas permeated people’s conscious around the need for gun violence protection and getting protections in place.” But what will happen during this legislative session may not result in any party reorientation. Farnsworth speculates that some anti-Trump Republicans representing the commonwealth’s fast-growing, ever-bluer suburban districts will peel off to support gun measures, but not the party as a whole. A similar dynamic played out in the state’s march toward Medicaid expansion in 2017: While the state party maintained a staunch aversion to that provision of the Affordable Care Act, a number of GOP lawmakers backed the popular measures. “While Republicans disagree about gun policy,” Farnsworth says, “there will be high consensus among Republicans that they want to stay in power.” What they can count on is that gun reform activists will be watching closely. When their issue emerged victorious in the state’s 2017 elections, they poured over the results to suggest how the electorate might behave in the 2018 midterms. They will likely do the same when the 2019 ballots roll in, and this time, for even higher stakes with the presidency up for grabs.

229,http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48349638," Last updated on 6 June 20196 June 2019.From the section Cricket Bangladesh are preparing to face hosts England in the World Cup on Saturday, having started the tournament impressively in beating South Africa and pushing fancied New Zealand close in a thrilling finish on Wednesday. There is nothing to suggest the players had a traumatic experience recently but it is less than three months since most of the squad witnessed an attack which resulted in 51 deaths. For head coach Steve Rhodes, who took charge of Bangladesh in June 2018, a daunting challenge in a new country and unfamiliar conditions became even more complex when his team came ""within minutes"" of the Christchurch mosques attack in March. The former wicketkeeper-batsman, who played 11 Tests and nine one-day internationals for England, has found himself part of a group coming to terms with witnessing horror and supporting each other in the process. ""Often in the evening, there'll be five, six, seven guys together in a room just chatting away - communicating things with each other, sharing their thoughts about that event,"" Rhodes, 54, told BBC Sport. ""They have tried to help each other through it, and you know, I've got a lot of respect and admiration for the way they have pulled through. ""There's a lot of smiley faces at the moment, and going back to that day in Christchurch, I was thinking, 'how do we get a team back together after?' ""But they have done it."" His players now have the chance to continue that recovery by springing an upset against Rhodes' native country in Cardiff. On 15 March, Bangladesh had just completed their final training session before the final Test of a three-match series against New Zealand at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. A short walk from the picturesque ground was the city's Al Noor mosque. After captain Mahmudullah's news conference had overran, 17 of the squad and support staff took the team bus for the short journey to attend Friday prayers. It felt like any other day before a Test. Except it wasn't. As they stepped off the team bus and approached the mosque, gunfire could be heard from inside. Unfolding a mere 50 yards away was a mass shooting, as two mosques were targeted. As the shooting continued, the group fled back to the team bus where they were initially held. At the time, ESPN Cricinfo's Bangladesh correspondent Mohammad Isam reported how opener Tamim Iqbal called him on his mobile phone to try and tell him what was happening and what they could see. ""The players were breaking down; they had seen way too much in the 15 minutes they were held up in the bus, there was no security because it is such a peaceful country,"" Isam said. ""The players heard shots being fired, they saw people tumbling out of the gates and ducked under the bus."" Eventually they left the bus and retreated on foot back to Hagley Oval, where Rhodes was among a few who had remained after training. The touring party were secured in lockdown, first at the ground and then their hotel, before flying back to Dhaka and their families the following day after the Test was cancelled. Rhodes said ""cricket certainly got put into sharp focus"" by what happened in Christchurch. Counselling services have been made available but not widely taken up. ""Have the players got over this? I think they're getting there and they feel safe over here and with the security we've got,"" Rhodes added. ""I know that the right thing to do is just to crack on and get on with cricket and that's what the boys have done."" Rhodes said the World Cup is a ""a distraction"" from the ""shock and horror"" of what the players witnessed in New Zealand. ""These guys have got no agendas, they're just cricketers who want to play in a World Cup and do as well as they can,"" he said. ""Hopefully they can win a World Cup - that's their dream. ""That's at the forefront of their minds at the moment and thankfully the events in Christchurch are now slowly, slowly going away from their thoughts."" Rhodes has been able to draw on previous conversations with International Cricket Council match referee Chris Broad, England head coach Trevor Bayliss and Warwickshire sport director Paul Farbrace about their experiences of the attacks on the Sri Lanka team bus in Pakistan in 2009. ""I actually spoke to those three about those events in Pakistan before what happened in Christchurch and it's very sad,"" he said. ""It's also sad to see what happened recently in Sri Lanka on Easter day as well. That's another wonderful cricket-playing country that's going through some struggles. ""It's a worry for the whole world."" Such experiences are a world away from what Rhodes might have expected when he was director of cricket at Worcestershire, having spent most of his life at the west Midlands club as player and coach. However, in January 2018, he was sacked by Worcestershire after an investigation into his conduct. It was reported he delayed informing the county about the arrest of all-rounder Alex Hepburn, who was later charged with two counts of rape in December 2017. In April, Hepburn, 23, was convicted of one of those charges and jailed for five years. Worcestershire's investigation also cost Rhodes the chance to coach England at the Under-19 World Cup after he was stood down by the England and Wales Cricket Board in early 2018. He took time out to consider his options after his 33-year association with Worcestershire came to an end. In May 2018 he was named as one of six scouts by England national selector Ed Smith. But, soon after, Bangladesh offered him a two-year deal to become head coach. Rhodes' first year in the job has seen him guide the Tigers to their first piece of one-day silverware after they won the recent tri-series against Ireland and West Indies. ""Bangladesh have given me this opportunity and I'm grateful to them,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can play my part, albeit very small. The players are the key ones and the important ones. ""We'll all play our little part from the masseur all the way through to the best player in trying our best to do the right thing by Bangladesh and win games of cricket and do well in this World Cup. ""I'm the only English international head coach at the World Cup and that makes me so proud."" Bangladesh can draw on recent inspiration as they prepare to face England in a World Cup again. In 2015 in Adelaide, their 15-run victory eliminated England at the group stage. ""They're playing some amazing cricket at the moment."" Rhodes said of England's class of 2019. ""They're rightfully world number one. Everything's going right for them - it's their back yards, they know the wickets and they're going to have huge support. ""But what comes with that is huge expectation and the favourites' tag. ""It would be great if we can spoil the party at Cardiff."" Bangladesh came into this World Cup with some strong performances in previous ICC tournaments. Quarter-finalists in 2015, they were also semi-finalists two years ago in the Champions Trophy in England. This time Rhodes believes they can put themselves in the mix once again ""Hopefully we can sneak along the rails and surprise a few people,"" he said. ""The international experience of our guys is one of our strengths. A lot have played international cricket for a long period of time now and we've got plenty of ODI caps under our belt. ""We're not going to win every single game, we know that. We're going to have some ups, we're going to have some downs. But hopefully if we can have enough ups that may mean qualification - and then who knows?""

6.6.2019 12:45 PM Former Broward County sheriff's deputy Scot Peterson has been widely vilified for failing to intervene in the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But did Peterson's failure amount to a crime? Although that is what local prosecutors argue, it seems like a stretch. The arrest warrant approved by Circuit Court Judge Andrew Siegel this week charges Peterson with seven counts of child neglect, a felony, and three misdemeanor counts of culpable negligence as well as one misdemeanor count of perjury for allegedly lying to investigators about how many shots he heard while taking cover 75 feet away from the building where a gunman was murdering students and teachers. Only the perjury charge seems like a straightforward application of the relevant statute, while the other charges are novel applications of laws that are generally invoked in very different contexts. As relevant here, Florida defines ""neglect of a child"" as ""a caregiver's failure to make a reasonable effort to protect a child from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person."" A ""caregiver"" is defined as ""a parent, adult household member, or other person responsible for a child's welfare."" Did Peterson, as the resource officer assigned to the high school, qualify as a caregiver, and did he therefore have a legal obligation to risk his life by running into the school? Not surprisingly, Peterson's lawyer, Joseph DiRuzzo, argues that he did not. But other legal experts are also skeptical. ""This is a unique prosecution, pushing the bounds of criminal liability,"" Miami defense attorney David Markus, who is not involved in the case, told the Associated Press. ""While elected prosecutors many times bow to the court of public opinion, our justice system demands that a case like this be tested in a court of law. Legally, this is a tough one for the prosecution."" Michael Grieco, another defense attorney who is also a Florida legislator, agreed that ""the decision to criminally charge Mr. Peterson, although popular in the court of public opinion, will likely not hold water once formally challenged."" The culpable negligence charges seem closer to the mark than the child neglect charges but will still be hard to prove. The Florida Supreme Court has defined culpable negligence as conduct ""evincing reckless disregard of human life or of the safety of persons exposed to its dangerous effects; or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of indifference to consequences; or such wantonness or recklessness or grossly careless disregard of the safety and welfare of the public, or that reckless indifference to the rights of others, which is equivalent to an intentional violation of them."" Peterson is charged not with doing something that recklessly endangered others but with failing to do something (enter the school and confront the gunman) that might have prevented harm to others. The arrest warrant argues that Peterson could have prevented several murders if he had done what he was supposed to do. DiRuzzo argues that Peterson ""was not criminally negligent in his actions, as no police officer has ever been prosecuted for his or her actions in responding to an active shooter incident."" The fact that the prosecution is unprecedented does not necessarily mean it is unwinnable, but it does suggest that the statute is not an easy fit (although you could also argue that Peterson's failure was uniquely egregious). UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh notes that even when people (such as parents) have a special duty to protect someone, they are not legally obligated to intervene if it exposes them to a risk of death or serious injury. ""My quick research has revealed precedents supporting this in Alabama, California, Michigan, Montana, and North Carolina, and no precedents imposing a more categorical protect-even-at-risk-of-death duty,"" he writes. ""Likewise, the few states that purport to impose a more general duty to help even strangers generally limit that duty to safe rescues."" The question is whether Peterson, as a police officer trained to deal with active shooters, had a legal duty that went beyond what would be required of a mother who is afraid to get between her violent husband and the child he is beating. Matthew Mayer, an expert on school violence at Rutgers University, notes that the charges against Peterson assume that if he had entered the school he would have been able to interrupt the attack. The case ""rests on him being in the correct place at the right time and getting there and successfully firing shots,"" he told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ""That is 100 percent speculation."" Eugene O'Donnell, a former NYPD officer and a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, takes a similar view. ""Criminalizing someone for not acting in the middle of a mass murder is built on the preposterous notion that police officers are Navy SEALs in disguise that can spring into action,"" O'Donnell told the Sun-Sentinel. ""You never know what you're going to do when the bullets start flying."" O'Donnell said he could see why a police officer might be fired in a case like this (Peterson resigned), but criminal charges are another matter. ""This is headhunting,"" he said. ""This is trying to make someone pay for a tragic series of events."" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who headed the state commission that investigated the Parkland shooting, disagrees. ""Scott Peterson is a coward,"" Gualtieri said. ""He's a failure. And he's a criminal. No doubt because he didn't act people were hurt and people were killed."" But H. Scott Fingerhut, a law professor at Florida International University, emphasizes the distinction between moral and legal responsibility. ""We don't know what his lack of action legally caused,"" Fingerhut told the Sun-Sentinel. ""What we think morally is one thing. But our criminal justice systems are based on legal liability or guilt, meaning what can be proved."" These dueling views also can be heard in the reactions from people directly affected by the Parkland shooting. Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, was one of the students who died that day, welcomed Peterson's prosecution. ""It's about accountability, and there's to be more in Broward County,"" he told The New York Times. ""We knew all along that this guy did something very terrible. He let my daughter die, and a lot of other victims in the school—teachers and children—and he didn't do his job."" By contrast, Daniel Bishop, who was a sophomore at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when it was attacked and subsequently joined fellow students in campaigning for stricter gun control, questions the charges against Peterson. ""It wasn't his fault,"" he told the Times. ""Who am I to place blame on anyone besides the one person who should be held accountable?""

Well, in an ideal libertarian society, there wouldn’t be any criminal charges at all, only torts. Though I recognize such a position is controversial. In any case, criminal punishment for refusing do to something is slavery. If someone breaks a contract by refusing to do something, they are financially liable, but cannot be compelled. If you pay someone to mow your lawn, and they refuse to do it, you cannot compel them to mow. You can only compel them to return the money, plus any damages determined by the courts. I’m of two minds. On one hand I agree with you, but on the other hand these are not citizens in good standing to use the “just wanted to be left alone” defence; they’re self-styled demigods who purport to have the moral authority to execute anyone at anytime if their razor-sharp spidy senses twinge a single hair on the back of their neck; and call it “justified”. If we have an institution of police at all, might we not at least let’s make them criminally culpable for trying to stop mass murders taking place right in front of them? That’s why taxpayers have to buy them guns and body armor after all…. And if they don’t like it, well, hopefully they’ll all quit. What about a fireman that refused to enter a burning building with his fellow firemen & a few people die in there? In my 60 years on earth, I have never heard of a fireman getting cold feet & refusing to rush in. But, I have heard of several instances like Peterson here & I can see both sides of the argument! Personally, I vote to prosecute! What are you fucking idiots talking about? If we all agree that a cop gets to kill anyone he wants, then it MUST be true that he get to NOT kill anyone he wants. Either way, it is not for us peons to second guess the manifest destiny or papal infallibility of our cops. If this cop wanted to, i’m sure we could all agree that he had the right to shoot and kill every student he encountered. If there was a blind student with a seeing eye dog, well then OF COURSE we would expect that he would shoot the dog (if the blind person reached for her dog whistle, he would of course have to shoot her too). Come on, let’s face facts; his cowardice probably saved lives. He was doing the students a favor. He’s going to get his pension, and he probably stubbed his toe during this regrettable incident, not to mention his mental trauma, so he will go on disability (and if ANY of you naive slobs think this won’t happen, you are stupider than Tony (a fate worse than death). LOL!!! Do you have too much caffeine to day?….I do not agree that a cop gets to kill anyone he wants to! He should’ve done his job….Lives were at stake! – “If we all agree that a cop gets to kill anyone he wants…” If we all agree that you regularly pleasure yourself while viewing images of kittens being tossed into a wood-chipper…. “If you pay someone to mow your lawn, and they refuse to do it, you cannot compel them to mow. You can only compel them to return the money, plus any damages determined by the courts.” Yet if lawn-mower man refuses still to return your money, then what, are you shit out of luck?   No.  Rather, we call that theft, and use the collective power of the state kick their ass, rather than you going over to his place armed to extract your due. Same with this situation.  There was a contract for performance of specific duties in exchange for salary, pension, health benefits, etc.  The contract, being breached, results in some state administered ass kicking. “”Yet if lawn-mower man refuses still to return your money, then what, are you shit out of luck? No. Rather, we call that theft, and use the collective power of the state kick their ass, rather than you going over to his place armed to extract your due.”” Wrong. You take him to small claims court. Failure to abide by the court ruling if you win is still not theft. You can petition the court to have a Sheriff confiscate some of his property. Pretty sure ” use the collective power of the state kick their ass, rather than you going over to his place armed to extract your due” is pretty means pretty the same as “have a Sheriff confiscate some of his property”  seeing as how that sheriff is no doubt armed. I think his use of ‘ass kicking’ was metaphorical. It is wrong to call it theft.  Theft is a criminal act and needs intent.  In a civil matter the concept is conversion: The elements of conversion are[iv]: the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; the defendant’s conversion by wrongful act inconsistent with the property rights of the plaintiff; and damages. In the lawn case and Peterson’s case, however, conversion isn’t even the issue; the issue is breach of contract. Is Peterson is guilty of breach of contract?  Probably not.  That contract was negotiated by his union.  Sure, there is a conflict of interest when the employer (the public) includes the employed, i.e, the employed (and all their public employee friends) get to influence the election and vote for the employer’s negotiators.  But the courts have long recognized public unions’ right to exist, so there is little hope they would recognize the conflict of interest here. Yet if lawn-mower man refuses still to return your money, then what, are you shit out of luck? Pretty much. “I want my two dollars.” go that way, really fast. if something gets in your way, turn. “Do you have any idea the monetary value of the side of this mountain?” >>>Yet if lawn-mower man refuses still to return your money, then what, are you shit out of luck? yes. you shouldn’t have given money until the mower was moving forward and operational. yes. you shouldn’t have given money until the mower was moving forward and operational. I should have just said that. Now, if only the ‘public’ would see that giving someone a gun and a badge is like paying a teenager to mow your lawn 2 months from now. exactly. … also i’d reprimand his attorney or mr. pro se for wasting the state’s time over his own lack of diligence *if* i’m the judge … idea of working for the state creeps me The courts have repeatedly held that police have no duty to perform any public safety services. Negligence that leads to people getting hurt or killed allows for normally innocent behavior to be a crime. End that legal theory or your complaints wont do much. Hit another vehicle and seriously hurt the driver is usually a simple civil case. Drinking alcohol (negligence) and crashing into another vehicle seriously hurting the driver allows for a crime based on criminal negligence. Fail to vaccinate your child and risk losing them to the state forever. IIUC his negligence came from his communications and actions that stopped other Broward officers from entering. Entry was made by another county’s officers that ignored Peterson. That may depend. If he received a stand down order from his command then he was just passing the orders of their superior. Sorry, no.  This guy accepted the terms and conditions of being a LEO.  Cowering outside a building when a mass shooting of children who are essentially held captive by the state pursuant to truancy laws doesn’t cut it. Just like in the military or certain government jobs, he agreed to be subject to special laws.  No one forced him to do any of it. So let him swing for his dereliction of duty. he agreed to be subject to special laws Yeah, like qualified immunity.  I am unaware of any special laws that go the other way.  Unless you want to argue he violated the kids civil rights.  Their right to speak has certainly been infringed by his failure to defend them. qualified liability would be awesome. If you are ever in Utah, I would love to buy you a beer. sweet i ski park city w/locals sometimes i’ll let’cha know. I thought real beer was illegal in Utah. A soldier who did this would be prosecuted for cowardice under the UCMJ; depending on how seriously the court viewed the incident, he might be executed. The same is true for a soldier who told his superior to eff off. Anyone who joined the US military after about 1973 voluntarily agreed to this, but historically it also applied to draftees, and the military was harsher then than it is now. An army cannot fight a war without such special laws. If men can draw pay and consume GI supplies, equipment, and transportation, then quit their job in the middle of a battle because it suddenly got to dangerous for them, the army can only win the easiest battles. Peterson went through training as a cop and drew his salary for many years as a cop, then failed to do the job when it became dangerous – but there is no special law making that illegal for cops. Perhaps there should be. But you can’t prosecute him under a law made after that day. He should receive the maximum sentence for perjury, with that felony conviction ensuring that he is never hired as a cop again, nor can own a gun. Maybe the federal “honest services” law would apply, but it’s penalties are too light for this dereliction of duty. I’d rather see the _other_ special laws and privileges for cops removed to make them the same as other citizens. Make ignorance of the law be no excuse, just like it is for other citizens. Prosecute them consistently for false official statements and perjury, rather than just the 1 in 1,000 times the public becomes outraged at a lying cop. Put them through the same interrogations and investigative tactics as other citizens when they are accused of crime. Prosecute cops who arrest someone for “resisting arrest” but can’t prove an underlying crime for false arrest. Send a cop who panicked and shot someone who was not really a threat up for murder, with a life sentence or a death sentence. But until the cops are treated like us otherwise, their special privileges should come with special responsibilities. If their only excuse for their actions is “I was afraid for my life”, fire the cowards – and if it’s more likely than not that their cowardice resulted in death, execute them! Why perjury? “There should never be any criminal charges against someone that refuses to do something” So,  one cannot negotiate that for oneself?   Ever?  That’s not Libertarian. That’s what “inalienable” means. This is something in which I disagree with Walter Block. He claims you can sell yourself into slavery. I disagree, and so does Rothbard. “I disagree” I can appreciate that.   But it again brings me to who that choice belongs,  and I think the answer is me.   How would you police it?   By invalidating a contract between two willing parties?   I don’t think that holds water. As to slavery,  I think you’re overstating it a bit.   The Military,  for example,  does this, and I believe certain types of engineering require a form of legal liability that ends in jail.   I’ll read the link you sent. How would it be policed? Easy. If you sign a contract for being a slave and later change your mind, you just leave. If the other party comes for you, or prevents you from leaving, you ask the law for help. Since the contract was not valid, the law would be on your side to protect you from the other party. As for military service, Rothbard wrote about this as well. In his eyes, and mine, military service contracts that force you to serve a certain amount of time under penalty of jail time are invalid from a libertarian perspective. If someone decides to leave the military before their time is up, they should be held in breach of contract, but not put in jail for desertion. So,  they shouldn’t be held to the agreement they made because you think it’s not libertarian?  Why do the principals care?   How would you stop them?   Your position is fine as long as one party is looking to get out,  but that wasn’t my question. “How would it be policed? Easy. If you sign a contract for being a slave and later change your mind, you just leave. ” That’s not policing it and not what I am talking about. Two parties agree and abide by a criminal punishment contract.   You a third party have stayed you think it is invalid.   They do not.   They aren’t trying to leave,  nor will they as both sides are happy with the contract. Why do you get a say in it at all? “. If the other party comes for you, or prevents you from leaving, you ask the law for help. Since the contract was not valid, the law would be on your side to protect you from the other party.” This looks an awful lot like you’re saying “I would use force” in answer to my question. That’s definitely not libertarian. And you still haven’t explained WHY it isn’t libertarian.   I own myself.   I can dispose of myself in any manner I choose.   I don’t care what Rothbard thinks about it because I OWN MYSELF.  His opinion literally means nothing. Libertarians aren’t opposed to the use of force, but to the initiation of force. Force to recover stolen property (which is what a breach of contract is), or force in defense of your life or property, are perfectly valid. And yes, you do own yourself. But you own yourself ALWAYS. You can, for example, commit suicide, because your life is your own to do with as you please. You can also have yourself lobotomized, or to have some procedure done to yourself to make you want to obey someone for the rest of your life. Those are acceptable. But if you choose to become someone else, and later change your mind, you have the right to stop being a slave. Because at that moment, you will still own yourself. If you have the capacity to express self-ownership, you automatically have it. The Military is exactly like this.  If I join the military (I did.), and then refuse to do my duty, they can and will prosecute me.  I saw it happen to people. Let’s face it.  Police are just the arm of the military that we accept to “police” the homeland. Police are just the arm of the military that we accept to “police” the homeland. No. No. A thousand times no. DO NOT EVER equate the police with military. That kind of thinking leads to MRAP parades, masked midnight door-kickings and dog shootings, and occupational-force “us vs. them” mentalities. Cops are there to extract property and liberty from the citizenry. They aren’t military. They prosecute you under the UCMJ. That’s an internal disciplinary process. Good discussion here. From “Ethics of Liberty”: A man can alienate his labor service, but he cannot sell the capitalized future value of that service. In short, he cannot, in nature, sell himself into slavery and have this sale enforced—for this would mean that his future will over his own person was being surrendered in advance. In short, a man can naturally expend his labor currently for someone else’s benefit, but he cannot transfer himself, even if he wished, into another man’s permanent capital good. For he cannot rid himself of his own will, which may change in future years and repudiate the current arrangement. The concept of “voluntary slavery” is indeed a contradictory one, for so long as a laborer remains totally subservient to his master’s will voluntarily, he is not yet a slave since his submission is voluntary; whereas, if he later changed his mind and the master enforced his slavery by violence, the slavery would not then be voluntary. The problem with that reasoning is,  the contract doesn’t become involuntary because one party wants out. It cannot be magically converted into an involutary agreement because one party enforced the terms the other party agreed to. Honestly,  as an argument it isn’t convincing at all. The contract wasn’t valid in the first place. Well there are laws that allow for specific performance as a remedy for breach of a contract in certain instances. Ok, then we take away his pension and bill him a set amount for life for not fulfilling the obligations he was paid to perform for 30(?) years. It took a while for us to realize he wasn’t fulfilling the duties he was hired for, but now that we know he wasn’t ever going to protect the public, we’ll correct that mistake. Can we throw Obummy in jail for this? https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/parkland-shooting-school-discipline-policies-limited-law-enforcement-involvement-with-students/ Petesron’s case is different. He swore an oath to uphold the law (like all police officers). I would think the central question is did he follow police department protocol for the situation. If he did he will be hard to convict. If he did not, I can see a jury convicting him of something. Still the case is chilling, because the criminal charges are not about committing  a crime, but about a bad outcome, and that alone should scare us all. IIUC it was Peterson’s follow on actions while cowering that stopped other officers from entering the facility. It was another county’s officers, responding to the call, that ignored Peterson and made entry. Didn’t do what he was paid to do. A jerk, but not a criminal. As a member of government, a part of the criminal justice system, and under oath to protect the people, what he did was indeed a crime. He willfully allowed murders to occur, and ordered his men to allow murders to occur. I don’t expect the same from the common man on the street. But this is not the common man, this was an agent of the state with the authority to intervene and stop a deadly  crime in progress. And he did nothing. As an agent of the state he should be held to a higher moral standard than the common man. But damned progressives have made moral standards obsolete, so that now even conservatives are defending scumbag cops like this. In Florida, I cannot find an oath that includes “protect the people”. While the Highway Patrol oath includes bravery, it is not clear it requires storming into a firefight. The FDLE ethical standards do include the phrase “Police officers shall not, whether on or off duty, exhibit any conduct which discredits themselves or their Department”, but then the context includes nine specific rules, eight of which deal specifically with sexual conduct, use of alcohol, and use of narcotics. The ninth deals with associating with known criminals, but only “where such associations will undermine the public trust and confidence in the officer or Department”  (?) I did find Fort Lauderdale’s oath. “that I will support the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Florida, and the ordinances of the City of Fort Lauderdale;…and that I will faithfully perform the duties of the office upon which I am now about to enter.” Now the oath says “perform the duties”.  I am sure the police department has duties listed that include “protect the people”. Not to mention that Peterson was not only well trained but also a trainer and Broward POC for Active Shooter. That training is very specific and details the priority of life to protect; starting with victims, bystanders, LEOs, and lastly the shooter(s). Violation of an oath is not a criminal offence. See every politician ever. It is a reason to be fired. You should never expect an agent of the state to act with a higher moral standard than civilians. I have run to help people, even as a civilian. The Komen 5k doesn’t really help anyone Decent. 9.7 Especially one that is trained, armed, and given special legal latitude to do so. In my Libertopia they would! You should never expect an agent of the state to act with a higher moral standard than civilians. FTFY You should hold an agent of the state to act with a higher moral standard than civilians, but don’t expect them to live up to that standard, much less the standard they hold us to. He was charged with a crime. In other words the discussion is about a LEGAL standard for a police officer, not a moral standard. Not sure about the FL law as written but if police were generally held to the military UCMJ as well as modern ROE we would all be better off.  Except Officer Peterson of course who would have been shot by firing squad for displaying “cowardice in the face of the enemy” I’m having a split with some of my friends on this.  I contend what he did wasn’t a crime.  A fireable offense, yes.  Open to civil lawsuits… mmmmaybe.  But not a crime. It ought to be a fireable offense not subject to union grievance processes. The union should be subject to civil suits too, for keeping the worst of the worst officers on the force through the grievance process. As should the school district for warehousing the kids as targets, promising to protect them, and failing. Sure. Why not? I would agree that this is both the logical and legal conclusion.  But it fails to mete out any justice to Peterson.  Between the court rulings that police have no duty to perform and the police unions’ relentless defense of the pensions of bad cops, the parents will continue to be forced to pay this coward who took their money to defend their children and then failed utterly when circumstances called upon him to actually do so. It’s a complicated subject that touches on many areas.  I think at a certain level of incompetence an officer should be able to be fired at either a reduced pension or no pension. Would it not be similar to a dishonourable discharge from the military? Can that also came with prison time for failure to fulfill the recruitment contract? The breach of duty of care comes under the tort of negligence.  To prove negligence you are going to have to overcome the ‘reasonable person’ standard.  His lawyer (paid for by the police union) is going to have a field day with a reasonable person confronting an armed gunman. In his case,  does the reasonable person standard become reasonable cop instead? Is his lawyer actually paid by the police union? In other articles, we learned that he didn’t pay union dues. I even read insinuation that he was the union’s sacrificial lamb since he wasn’t paying union dues. I fully agree it should be exactly like the military. That’s my position here. I find it a really bad precedent to  charge someone with a crime for cowardice. If he had specifically allowed the shooter into the school then you can get him for negligence and child endangerment. I find it hard to compel him to go in all cowboy style in an extreme and unanticipated circumstance. That said, he should be fired for failure to perform his duties Put me down in the “not a criminal but certainly guilty of dereliction of duty and should be fired and sued for his paychecks’ return” column. You pay somebody to do something and they don’t do it you at least get your money back, don’t you? My understanding is that even though he resigned in disgrace before he could be fired, because of the police union contract, he’s still entitled to an $8k / month pension for the rest of his miserable, cowardly life.  If he had been fired he would not be entitled to this, at least not at this level.  And if he is convicted of criminal charges, he gets no pension benefits whatsoever. So that might be part of the motivation here. That’s fucking crazy that he’s paid 8k a month.  Nauseating. That was my comment, basically. Correct me if I’m wrong, but haven’t courts agreed that a LEO has no obligation to keep individuals safe? For example, an NYPD officer couldn’t be charge with a crime when he hid while someone was being stabbed on the train. As recently as December last year.  POLICE HAVE NO DUTY TO PROTECT YOU, FEDERAL COURT AFFIRMS YET AGAIN Failure of the courts does not make this crime not a crime. Police have the moral and legal duty to act to protect the people. Period. Notice I said “act to”. They might not succeed, they may be incompetent in their attempt, but they do need to act if they are able. If the system won’t hold them to that then the system needs to be replaced. they may be incompetent in their attempt There’s the rub.  This officer might just be grossly incompetent.  Drawing lines here is hard, and there’s a good chance an injustice will occur. The line is really not that hard. Most cops are grossly incompetent. The courts tend to mistakenly set that line based on what most cops do. Since most of those cops are incompetent, that line is incorrectly set. Hence the trial. “”Failure of the courts does not make this crime not a crime.”” Please point to the criminal code which says it is a crime. Just because you think it’s a crime doesn’t make it one. You’re confusing law with a government imprimatur. If there was a  “legal duty to act to protect the people” FL would not need to get creative by charging him as a caretaker. They would charge him under the law which required an officer to protect. I really wish this was common knowledge. My bet is most people don’t realize this. Then again, many people (it appears) seem to think they are entitled to social security….and that we have a surplus in a “lockbox”…and that Area 51 really has aliens (ok, that might be true). Not quite.  A police officer cannot be sued by the victim (or his/her family or heirs) for failing to keep an individual safe.  The courts have never held, however, that the state is unable to prosecute those officers for the same behavior. Of course, the courts have never held the reverse either.  As far as I know, this is the first time it’s come up for police.  In the context of the military, it’s well-established that the state can prosecute for that behavior.  Since police are a para-military organization, I think the question is whether the court will focus more on the para- or on the -military part of that description. What the military can charge it’s members with under the UCMJ (including executing them for cowardice in battle) is irrelevant. Police are civilians and not subject to the UCMJ. There is no equivalent law for civilians. If anything, I’d say his crime was fraud.  If he’s going to dress like and get paid to be a police officer then he needs to be ready to be a police officer. I’m sure he could shoot dogs like the best of them. Boom! More evidence that Americans are instinctive bootlickers who treat uniforms like sacred vestments. No outrage whenever a demi-god uses lethal violence against a mortal who reached for his wallet after being pulled over for a turn signal violation, because the demigod was scared and mortals are incapable of understanding the pressure demigods feel. But when a demigod fails to use lethal violence in a situation, the mortals quickly form a mob to destroy the imposter who besmirched the reputation of the true demigods who “risk their lives every day” to protect our freedom and precious bodily fluids. All charges are legally bogus. Negligence requires an underlying relationship where the defendant had a LEGAL DUTY TO ACT and failed to ACT, and this failure was the ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE HARM. The actual cause of harm here was bullets passing through flesh. Some or all of these bullets were fired when Peterson was physically too far away to do anything about it, even if he was the selfless heroic demigod Americans believe their cops to be. The cause of the harms here was the shooter firing bullets at humans. It is not negligent to fail to stop those bullets from finding their targets. The job of a police officer, as opposed to a mere law enforcement official, is to stand between the people and the crime. If you’re not willing to put yourself between the bullet and the child, you have no business being in your profession.  Your job is to protect and defend, not to carefully weigh the risks to yourself. OK, I was pretty sure it was criminal (in) action, but you folks have convinced me otherwise. Yep, a cowardly jerk, but not a criminal. POLICE HAVE NO DUTY TO PROTECT YOU, FEDERAL COURT AFFIRMS YET AGAIN Which utterly obliterates every single rationale for gun control. If a cop does not have to protect you…why in the hell would you be disarmed intentionally? See above.  The proper headline should have been Victims can’t sue when police fail to protect you.  All the suits concluding that “police have no duty to protect you” have been initiated by victims or their families.  None of those precedents say that the State can’t prosecute for the same (mis)behavior. All the suits concluding that “police have no duty to protect you” have been initiated by victims or their families. None of those precedents say that the State can’t prosecute for the same (mis)behavior. If they have no duty to protect you, then they have no duty to protect you.  It doesn’t matter that these rulings have been in response to civil suits.  It has been clearly stated that the police have no duty to protect anyone not “in their custody”.   If it is not their duty, then it is not criminal offense to not do it. Notice how the prosecutor has not charged this guy under the criminal code that makes it a crime for a cop to not intervene?  ’cause there isn’t one. Which is why I think they are trying the caregiver angle. The kids were in their custody as a caregiver. Cops as legal caregivers? What could go wrong? Dogs shot? Small kids left in cars to die of heat deaths? Small kids strip searched? There’s more where this came from. To say there is a lot more would be an understatement. >>>Although that is what local prosecutors argue prosecutors gotta prosecute. retards. Any chance the DA in this case is up for reelection? lol Meanwhile back in Tennessee Sullivan Central SRO who confronted a gunman in 2010 was back in the spotlight after Parkland. “Carolyn Gudger was a School Resource Officer at Sullivan Central when a would-be school shooter tried to kill the very people she was in charge of keeping safe. … “”It’s just a situation you expect and you train for, you just hope it doesn’t happen. … It’s just part of our job as a school resource officer protect everybody we can,” she said.” Carolyn Gudger, true professional. Speaking of actual, honest to goodness, heroes, Jake Ryker, the student who stopped Kip Kinkle at Thurston HIgh back in 1998, went on to become a school resource officer. Sadly, I get 17 unique hits on Google for ‘Jake Ryker’ that relate to the hero if the Thurston High shooting and 8 of those are duplicates.  That says something very telling about the state of journalism and the unwillingness of the media to get any kind perspective when a shooting occurs. Obviously the solution is robotic police officers, a la THX 1138 and RoboCop. *** bites lip *** ED-209 would be my choice. I think the prosecutors may be able to make the case that Peterson was a “care giver”. If I were them I’d focus on the idea that, because the teachers and students on the school grounds are “legally” disarmed, a special relationship exists between Peterson and the students. In essence: “No, Ms. Teacher or Mr. Student, you may not bear defensive arms here on school grounds. Instead, the school’s Resource Officer will protect you in the unlikely event of attack.” Of course, I think the prosecutors should have to demonstrate that Peterson was _aware_ of this special relationship. +1 Assaulting a structure is pretty dangerous, and I doubt he had the training for it. Police training — which you have to pass to even BE a cop — routinely features exactly that scenario. If he was legally a police officer, yes, he was trained for that. And as you may recall in the days after the shooting, Sheriff Israel pointed out how great he was at his job because everyone’s training was up to date. So here is the scenario that seems to be preferred to what actually happened. Officer Peterson calls in the report, requests backup and medical support, unholsters his sidearm and charges into the school. He sees furtive movements in a room where gunshots still ring in the air, and fires 7 rounds, wounding 3 students and killing one. He reloads and continues through the building, finally confronting the suspect in a room full of kids. Both parties empty their weapons, and 18 people die, including the alleged suspect, and Officer Peterson. WHY does everyone assume this guy is some kind of crack shot, and has the wisdom of Solomon, and the situational awareness of Wyatt Earp? The best tactical officers on the force seldom are assigned to schools. What would have happened under any other scenario is pure speculation. And speculation is not testimony. “WHY does everyone assume this guy is some kind of crack shot, and has the wisdom of Solomon,” Did you drag that strawman all the way from home? If he had the wisdom of Solomon, he would have just divided the school in half… Peterson not only failed to intervene, he prevented other cops from intervening. Some of them may have been competent. More importantly, nearly every time an armed cop or civilian intervened in a mass shooting, the shooter immediately stopped. Most of them shot themselves as soon as someone fired at them – it didn’t matter whether the intervener was competent. The _single_ exception I can remember where the shooter fought the cops for more than a few seconds was the University of Texas clocktower shooter, over 50 years ago. And there has never been a case where intervening in a mass shooting caused more casualties, except the murderers and maybe some of those intervening. So Peterson was not responsible for the first deaths, but he was responsible for the last ones –  by acts of commission, not merely of omission. If he’d only hid while other cops charged in, it would have ended much sooner with far fewer killed. “”So here is the scenario that seems to be preferred “” Bullshit. I get your point. It could have happened that way. But I don’t see anyone who is preferring that scenario. Oddly enough, your scenario has never actually occurred in an incident where an armed civilian or law officer confronted a mass shooter. I don’t think there is one case you can plausibly claim where the presence of armed opposition likely increased the death count. Your reality may be correct, but so what? The gun-grabbers support this prosecution because the RIGHT person with a gun failed to use its magical powers to stop the bad guy with a gun. The “normal people don’t need guns” argument requires Peterson to have taken decisive action. If Peterson was a decent human man, he’d give back every dime he was paid to protect that school and try to off himself with his duty piece in private. If he is found guilty and it is upheld upon appeal then we’re on a slippery slope with regard to duty-to-intervene. A slippery slope that ends in greater protection for the citizen, and greater accountability for agents of the state? Sign me up. Yeah, I’m not seeing a downside to that precedent either.  We already hold doctors, nurses and other medical staff to duty-to-intervene standards that are relevant to their training and capabilities. They don’t have arresting authority and are actually involved with your care. The idea that cops can become a caregivers is probably not a good idea in freedom loving societies. Ignore Eric, he has proven to be a troll in the past and is apparently completely ignorant that ‘slippery slope’ is the literal definition of a particular class of logical error. More likely there simply won’t be any more on-site protection. If FL State law yes…seems to be a pretty open and shut inquiry. “Matthew Mayer, an expert on school violence at Rutgers University, notes that the charges against Peterson assume that if he had entered the school he would have been able to interrupt the attack. The case “rests on him being in the correct place at the right time and getting there and successfully firing shots,” he told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. “That is 100 percent speculation.”” Funny that the cops who DID enter the school didn’t seem to have a ton of trouble stopping the slaughter. “”It wasn’t his fault,” he told the Times. “Who am I to place blame on anyone besides the one person who should be held accountable?”” Oh…and guns. You should blame guns ALSO. Nice Reason…such an even-handed defense of the police. Odd you seem so incapable of such even-handedness on issues you give a shit about. 50+ reports on Cruz, whom they knew to be a danger, and no action taken. A stand-down ordered by the Sheriff. And Peterson’s the one being charged with negligence?  Yes, he should have ignored the order and gone in, but they probably don’t recruit SROs from retired delta operators. This looks like cover for politicians higher up than him. The sheriff should be standing trial for gross negligence. […] Click here to view original story: Was Scot Peterson’s Cowardice a Crime? […] The case “rests on him being in the correct place at the right time and getting there and successfully firing shots,” He was 100% at the right place and the right time because he was explicitly placed there to protect the occupants of the school. Was that not made clear to him? “He was 100% at the right place and the right time because he was explicitly placed there to protect the occupants of the school. Was that not made clear to him?” “Sure, you pay me to be there. Even let me LIVE there. Give me a gun and everything. NOBODY told me I had to protect anybody!” I think in the big picture this case is a win-win for freedom (except maybe for Peterson himself) 1. If he wins, it is established, yet again, that police are under no obligation to protect people from mass shooters, in which case how dare people propose to disarm the innocent when nobody else is obligated to protect them. 2. If he loses, then police, or at least “school resource officers” are legally obligated to risk themselves to protect the public. The police will find this an unacceptable outcome and work furiously against it, which will reveal the police for exactly what they are — our wardens, not our protectors. If the people are deprived of their right to self defense by the state with the assurance that the state will defend them, then negligent failure to defend the people by the state that results in deaths of the people should be punished. Since I think the biggest failure of Parkland came down to that, then absolutely punish him for cowardice. If that makes anyone uncomfortable, then support the right to bear arms universally. So I think they’ll get him on the perjury charge if nothing else. But I would argue that he IS guilty. Not for refusing to rush in (although that was his job, and we poor peasants are refused the right to self-defense in government education camps I would argue that he should be), but because he directed cops responding to the shooting to stay away. That goes from “refusal to act” to complicity in my opinion. If he was following department policy then he is off the hook there. It’s a major leap down a dark path to make inaction a criminal violation. It’s a similar rationale that justified being charged for not purchasing health insurance If he is criminally responsible so is the idiot that assigned him to the school. This is an absurd feel good public lynching. Being a coward is not criminal. Being incompetent is not criminal. Not in this scenario. What we have here is the equivalent of the meaningless gun control legislation that inevitably follows these crimes. Grow up America. We created this environment, not some incompetent coward in Florida. Being incompetent most definitely can be criminal. If your incompetence results in the death of others, then you can be found criminally liable in court. The question here is whether this officer’s incompetence reaches the levels necessary to find him guilty. I would argue yes, I think Jasonium made a compelling argument higher up the page. Is this the equivalent of a modern-day public lynching? Yeah, you’re right. Does it have no legal ground to stand on? I’d argue against that. And I’d say a lot of the reason the chickens are coming home to roost now is because the police have done as much as possible to try and separate themselves from responsibility for their actions to the point of ridiculousness. They should be prosecuting Sheriff Scott Israel who had a standing stand down order built into  the Standard Operating Procedures and Rules Of Engagement of the department. The standing order was to be softer, gentler, kinder and more politically correct. No doubt his hiring policies were also heavily laced with the politically correct. He is also a gun control zealot. He has political ties to gun control organizations candidates and politicians. His lenient “SOPs” and his politically correct “ROE”S, based on the evidence, led to and or worsened the casualty count at both mass shootings which happened under his watch. He also has deep and close ties to Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. He was trained well in the mantra of victimology, diversity, gun control and government can fix it mentality.  His officers responded similarly during the mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The left loves these mass shooting scenarios.  They think it helps bolster their gun confiscation plan and the ultimate goal of repealing the constitution. Of course they love the shootings in order for them to boost their gun control agenda. Absolutely. They’re evil pricks. This guy certainly should be liable to pay back every penny he got while being the officer on duty to protect the children, as well a forfeit all retirement and additional damages from failure to do his job.  He should be called a coward for the rest of his life.  However, I think it sets a very bad precedent if he is convicted of not shooting the right people in a violent encounter.  If you couple that with qualified immunity, officers have even more incentive to run into a chaotic situation and start blasting with no knowledge of the situation. Let him pay back every drop of blood lost. Cowardice isn’t a crime. Public shaming will be more than punishment for him. WTF happened to “no duty to protect” and Warren v. District of Columbia and all that? In Dante’s Inferno, the deepest layer of hell is reserved for the betrayers of a trust. Not an ounce of pity. The issue here is legal custody.  For those saying he didn’t have a duty to intervene, he did.  The children were in the legal custody of the State at the time.  He was an employee charged with their protection in which failed to uphold.  He had the means and opportunity to stop the crime.  The same goes with prisoners.  If a prisoner is attacking another prisoner, the guards have a legal duty to intervene.  They can’t just let them kill each other because they’re afraid they might get shanked… I’d like to know why Cruz’s psychiatrists aren’t being prosecuted? You know, the ones who prescribed Cruz the psychotropic drugs he was on… the drugs which clearly state, “may cause suicidal and homicidal ideation” on the box. Yeah, why is no one looking at these quacks! I agree with Diane above – seems like at most a civil action, but not criminal. Civil law includes “no police duty to protect”, criminal law is not so clear, so this case is the better approach. And why on earth does this not “seem” criminal? Driving 56 on an empty road, on a clear day and in an entirely capable vehicle is criminal. Telling the tax man that you got a $12 tip instead of a $20 tip is criminal. This is a witch hunt by the rich parents of special Parkland who have to feel like they are doing something…even if it’s wrong. Furthermore, where I might have once had sympathy for these folks once they started the gun control crap…they lost me. Let’s face it, Bozo is being prosecuted for undermining the ‘We don’t need guns, the Police will protect us’ narrative in a gross and impolitic manner. You are probably right. We don’t need guns in school, but we are going to prosecute someone who didn’t bring his gun in the school. Criminal prosecution? No. $100,000 per year pension? Also no. Fire him for cause and cut off the fire hose of public money to a coward who refused to do his job. A lot more people need to be jacked up.  School administrators who knew the shooter was trouble, county cops who responded to calls involving him, etc.  Shooter should have been locked up long before the shooting. His crime was being the arresting officer and covering for Scott Israel’s pedo son who committed statutory rape. What is really needed here is a statute.  A soldier is guilty of cowardice if he fails to march to the sound of the guns.  There is no reason Florida could not pass a statute requiring its law enforcement officers to do the same. He should be fired (had he not resigned/retired first). It’s a big stretch to charge him criminally. That said, the parents of victims should sue him civilly for failing to do his job. […] Peterson’s behavior was clearly cowardly, but to call it criminal “seems like a stretch,” says Reason’s Jacob Sullum. Most of the charges “are novel applications of laws that are generally invoked in very different […] Please log in to post comments Baylen Linnekin

231,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602791930/0/phoenix/nation~Judge-lowers-bond-for-Scot-Peterson-the-former-Parkland-resource-officer/,"NAPLES, Fla. – A former Florida school resource officer facing charges for inaction during the Marjory Stoneman Douglass High School mass shooting last year has posted bond after a judge reduced the amount Thursday morning. During the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting in which a former student stands accused of killing 17 people and wounding 17 others, Scot Peterson, 56, was accused of inaction. Video surveillance showed he failed to enter the school and waited outside the building where the shooting took place. Bond was originally set at $102,000 for Peterson, who was arrested Tuesday on seven counts of neglect of a child and three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury. Judge Christine Scherer, who is also presiding over the Nikolas Cruz trial, agreed Thursday to reduce bond for the first six counts of child neglect from $15,000 each to $5,000. The seventh count was reduced from $7,500 to $5,000. Bond amounts for the remaining charges will remain the same. Total bond is now $39,500. Conditions for bond also originally included pretrial release with GPS monitoring and surrender of his passport and firearms. Scherer’s ruling allows Peterson to surrender his passport within 48 hours and removed the need for GPS monitoring. Scherer, however, did add a condition that Peterson cannot gain employment relating to minors. June 5: Parkland resource officer Scot Peterson stayed outside as bullets flew. Is he negligent or a scapegoat? June 4: Former Parkland deputy Scot Peterson charged after staying outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting The hearing before Scherer came after Peterson’s attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo III, argued in documents submitted to the court that the bond amount was excessive and he was not eligible to be prosecuted for neglect of a child under Florida statutes. “If there ever was a criminal defendant who qualifies to be released on his own recognizance, it is Mr. Peterson,” DiRuzzo III wrote. “There can be no reasonable contention that as a former law enforcement officer he is a danger to the community or that he will fail to appear before this court at all hearings.” Assistant State Attorney Tim Donnelly argued the motion was built upon “fallacies” and said it was not the state’s position to undercut the decision of bond, which was set by an administrative law judge after review of the 34-page affidavit submitted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Peterson’s arrest Tuesday came as a result of a 15-month investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. April 11: Families of Parkland school shooting victims file lawsuits charging negligence Dec. 19: Police, schools had no duty to protect Parkland school shooting victims, judge rules In a news release from the department, it wrote that the investigation included interviews of 184 witnesses, review of hours of surveillance footage and more than 800 hours of work on investigative reports. “The (Florida Department of Law Enforcement) investigation shows former Deputy Peterson did absolutely nothing to mitigate the (Marjory Stoneman Douglas) shooting that killed 17 children, teachers and staff and injured 17 others,” said department Commissioner Rick Swearingen. “There can be no excuse for his complete inaction and no question that his inaction cost lives.” In addition to facing criminal charges, Peterson and Sgt. Brian Miller were terminated by the Broward County (Fla.) Sheriff’s Office for their lack of action and neglect of duty. “We cannot fulfill our commitment to always protect the security and safety of our Broward County community without doing a thorough assessment of what went wrong that day,” Sheriff Gregory Tony said at the time of the terminations. “I am committed to addressing deficiencies and improving the Broward Sheriff’s Office.” Follow Devan Patel on Twitter: @DevanJPatel Dec. 3: Another deputy disciplined over response to Parkland high school shooting June 2018: Parkland parents enraged by 'coward' Deputy Scot Peterson's explanation for not entering school",2019-06-06 13:50:32,"Judge lowers bond for Scot Peterson, the former Parkland resource officer",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
232,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/06/dionne-gun-showdown-in-state-that-once-held-annual-gun-lobby-day-on-mlk-day/,"Trending: If you want to know how things have rolled in Virginia on the firearms issue, consider that Gun Lobby Day is an unofficial but highly memorable event held every year at the state capitol on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. “That was so wrong for so many reasons,” Jennifer Wexton, a former state senator who is now a member of Congress, observed about the timing of the pro-firearms offensive. Wexton, first drawn to politics in part by her desire for tougher gun laws, said that the state Senate’s Republican leadership would “put up all the gun bills on that day and kill them, one after another.” It was quite a spectacle, said State Sen. Janet Howell, who, like Wexton, is a northern Virginia Democrat. “We would have citizens wandering the halls carrying Uzis and other assault weapons,” she said. “That was Virginia, darlin’.” But it may not be Virginia anymore, or so Wexton, Howell and other advocates of gun safety hope. On Tuesday, Gov. Ralph Northam announced he was calling a special session of the state Legislature to take up a package of gun-control bills in the wake of last week’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. They include many measures that Republicans, who narrowly control both houses of the state Legislature, have smothered in committee before. They may try to do this again. But it will be harder with an election looming this fall and the power on the gun issue shifting toward those who favor regulations that only the most fanatical gun-rights advocates would question. They include background checks, restrictions of silencers and bump stocks, and “red flag” laws allowing families to seek the removal of firearms from those they fear pose a danger. Democrats need to pick up only two seats in each body to take control of the House and the Senate, and after years in which opponents of gun-safety laws had the upper hand in mobilizing and organizing, the energy has switched sides. Wexton says she noticed a large shift after the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. “We saw that people were really getting involved in taking on this issue after Parkland,” she said, “and it didn’t go away.” “It’s clear from several recent elections that there’s been a sea change from the old arithmetic that the only people who vote on guns are pro-gun,” said Geoff Garin, who has polled for Democratic candidates in Virginia — Northam among them — for three decades. In his successful 2017 campaign, Garin said, Northam “leaned into support for gun-safety legislation and used his F-rating from the National Rifle Association as a badge of honor.” Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Northam’s predecessor and fellow Democrat, notes that he, too, was elected with an F from the NRA — “I’m proud of it,” he told me. It was a sign, he said, the state had “evolved on guns.” Further evidence for this came from 2018 exit polling. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who also faced strong opposition from the NRA, won 82% among voters who said they cast their ballot on the basis of the gun issue, far exceeding his 57% statewide reelection total. Almost all of McAuliffe’s gun proposals were killed by the GOP, but Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said that the special session called by Northam puts the party’s gun-control foes in a more difficult position. “Entirely of their own making, the Republicans in the General Assembly are in a pincer,” Connolly said. “Either they act on the governor’s proposals, which are going to be sweeping, or they risk the rage of the electorate. … The patience of the electorate on these issues has been tested, strained, and is at the breaking point.” Connolly added that Republicans might look for “the path of least resistance” by passing a few modest measures, such as outlawing silencers. The changing politics on guns reflect a response to the pace of the threats — and to personal experiences. Democratic state Sen. Jeremy McPike told of his daughter’s suburban high school going on lockdown at the end of April after a gun was fired. “As the parent of a kid who was in lockdown, it’s real and it’s frightening to see that nothing’s getting done. “It’s devastating as a parent that we can’t do better,” he added. “Where do you draw the line?” It’s your move, Virginia. The special session calls for a different kind lobbying day, one more in keeping with the spirit of nonviolence that Dr. King preached before he was gunned down. Related Articles

233,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/06/Texas-governor-signs-school-safety-bills-in-response-to-Santa-Fe-High-shooting/1121559846161/,"June 6 (UPI) -- Capping off a years-long effort to prevent another school shooting like the Santa Fe High tragedy, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a series of bills into law Thursday that would, among other things, strengthen mental health initiatives available to children and allot money to school districts that can go toward ""hardening"" their campuses. A sweeping school safety measure, Senate Bill 11, instructs school districts to implement multihazard emergency operation plans, requires certain training for school resource officers, ensures school district employees -- including substitute teachers -- are trained to respond to emergencies and establishes threat assessment teams to help identify potentially dangerous students and determine the best ways to intervene before they become violent.
Advertisement The bill is, in part, a product of Abbott convening lawmakers soon after last May's shooting at Santa Fe High, which left 10 dead and another 13 wounded. Before signing the measure Thursday at the Texas Capitol, Abbott said that SB 11's passage was made possible through the efforts of House and Senate lawmakers and fruitful discussions that came out of a series of roundtable discussions he hosted shortly after the shooting.
Advertisement The legislation addresses ""not only the tragedy that took place at Santa Fe,"" Abbott said at Thursday, ""but will do more than Texas has ever done to make schools safer places for our students, for our educators, for our parents and families.""
RELATED Former deputy arrested for not entering building during Parkland shooting Republican state Sen. Larry Taylor and state Rep. Greg Bonnen -- who both represent the Santa Fe school district -- said they were pleased with lawmakers' headway this session as it relates to school safety and mental health initiatives. ""It is unfortunate that the events such as what happened at Santa Fe occurred, but we are taking action to do everything that we can reasonably do,"" Bonnen said. The law, which Bonnen and Taylor authored, also resurrects this session's largest mental health bill, and creates a Texas Mental Health Consortium aimed at bringing together psychiatric professionals from Texas medical schools and other healthcare providers to connect children to mental health services.
RELATED Dwyane Wade speaks at Stoneman Douglas graduation Aside from SB 11, Abbott signed a separate mental health bill Thursday by state Rep. Four Price, R-Amarillo, that increases mental health training for educators and other school professionals and improves students' access to mental and behavioral health services. ""We are taking a very significant step forward,"" Price said of his legislation. ""We're reducing the stigma that is associated with mental illness, and we're equipping our counselors, administrators and educators throughout the state of Texas to identify children in crisis -- again, all with parental consent.""
Advertisement While both the mental health and omnibus school safety measures garnered bipartisan support in the House and Senate, their success came as a number of other school safety bills drew heavy criticism from Democrats and gun control advocates. The third bill Abbott signed into law Thursday abolishes the cap on how many trained school teachers and support staff -- known as school marshals -- can carry guns on public school campuses.
RELATED FBI: Active shooters killed 85 people in the U.S. in 2018 The signing of that bill disrupted the harmony between Texas Republicans and gun control proponents who, otherwise pleased with the bill signings, lamented that the marshal bill passed and another ""red flag"" law measure -- which would have allowed courts to order the seizure of guns from people who are deemed an imminent threat -- never gained traction at the Capitol. ""I think ultimately that's going to be something we need,"" said Ed Scruggs, vice chairman for Texas Gun Sense. ""In most cases there are signs. There are threats that are made or social media posts -- something is occurring that's tipping people off that we could have a problem here."" Asked by reporters Thursday whether he supports ""red flag"" laws, Abbott said that ""right now"" such a measure wasn't necessary in Texas -- though he asked lawmakers to consider the idea shortly after the shooting. ""We think the best approach is what we passed in the combination of these bills,"" the governor said.
Advertisement Still, Scruggs gave a thumbs-up to lawmakers for their progress on school safety bills and said that ""overall, things were positive."" Gun control groups like Scruggs' weren't the only ones to laud Texas' leadership for their work this session to help prevent -- or at least mitigate -- another mass shooting. Survivors, too, said lawmakers surpassed their expectations as it related to making progress on school safety legislation this year. ""We were really pleased with SB 11. The pieces that were personal to me are in there,"" said Flo Rice, a former Santa Fe High substitute teacher who was shot in both legs last May. ""I'm really pleased. I feel like they worked very hard, they listened to us and the community and made strides to really protect our children."" This article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune.

A Connecticut beer delivery worker irate over being forced to resign opened fire as he was being escorted out of the building, killing eight co-workers. Just a week ago, a longtime municipal engineer submitted his resignation in the morning and within hours went on a rampage inside the building, killing 11 co-workers and a contractor. The Virginia Beach killing is one of 11 mass workplace killings dating back to 2006 in the U.S., according to a database of mass killings maintained through a partnership between The Associated Press, USA TODAY and Northeastern University. In all, nearly 90 people have died in these mass shootings, which are defined as 4 or more people killed, not including the perpetrator. And while such workplace shootings remain rare among the tens of thousands of gun deaths each year, they resonate among Americans who worry they might become an aggrieved co-worker’s next victim. 5 things to know: Remembering D-Day, Stanley Cup Final, Virginia Beach shooting victims The phenomenon steadily seeped into the public’s consciousness following a series of workplace massacres, including a big one at a post office that eventually led to the term “going postal” being coined in the 1990s. The U.S. Postal Service went to great lengths to examine the issue and dispel the notion that its workers were more prone to violence. Here are some of the key takeaways from the data: Several factors have led up to these mass killings: they include disagreements on the job, feeling mistreated by bosses and colleagues and anger in the aftermath of court proceedings. “Most of the time there are all sorts of signs of what the grievances were,” said James Alan Fox, a criminologist with Northeastern University who has studied mass killings for decades. Opinion: Virginia Beach hero yet another sacrificial American in yet another mass shooting Some shooters left behind letters complaining of unfair treatment. In the case of the mass shooting at a Manchester, Connecticut, beer distributorship, the gunman called 911 as police closed in and told the operator that he had experienced racism at the company and wished he’d killed even more co-workers. While the investigation is still young, the gunman who last week carried out the attack at the municipal building in Virginia Beach stands in stark contrast; seemingly well-liked, in good standing with his employer and had not voiced any grievances. Of the 11 workplace shootings tracked in the database, the most lethal was not the result of a workplace grievance. A radicalized couple carried out the attack against the husband’s co-workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California, killing 14. The shootings by employees have occurred in a variety of locations: a military base, warehouses, catering company, beer distributor, RV part manufacturer and plastics company among them. The data show that the four workplace killings with the highest death toll happened in government offices or at a government work event. However, criminologists who study gun violence caution that the number of workplace shootings is too small to draw reliable conclusions. Opinion: No gun law would have prevented Virginia Beach tragedy The government shootings include 13 killed at a military base in Fort Hood, Texas, and 12 at a Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. “There are so many questions we don’t have any answers to,” said Susan B. Sorenson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Ortner Center on Violence and Abuse in Relationships. “The reality is there are millions of people who go to work every day in government buildings and millions of people who go into government buildings every day. And almost every single one of them goes home safely.” In nearly every case, the shooter killed himself or herself, or was killed by police. This has occurred at a higher rate than other types of public killings, where gunmen were more likely to be arrested. Out of the 11 cases, the only gunman who survived is Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was sentenced to death for the Fort Hood massacre. The gunman in Virginia Beach was killed in the shootout. Nearly all the offenders in workplace killings were men. However, the shooting in San Bernardino was carried out by two killers, one of them a woman who accompanied her husband. And in Goleta, California, in 2006, the former postal worker who killed seven people was a woman. Mass workplace killings have been happening for decades in the U.S. and around the world, gaining widespread attention in the 1980s and ’90s. Virginia Beach shooting: What we know about the motive, the victims One of the deadliest was carried out in 1986 by a mail carrier who killed 14 Postal Service colleagues in Edmond, Oklahoma. That incident and others prompted the Postal Service to commission a study in 2000 to examine workplace violence around the time that the term “going postal” was becoming a conversational term. The Postal Service called it “the most comprehensive survey ever conducted of workplace violence in our nation,” including focus groups, interviews with employees and lengthy examination of policies. The report issued several recommendations to flag violent tendencies while claiming that “going postal” is a myth and that postal employees are less violent than the national workforce.

No matter the occasion, whether it be a funeral for a former President, hurricane, sitting Senator, or mass shooting, the liberal media will never stop trying to make news events about President Trump. On Thursday’s Deadline: White House, host Nicolle Wallace went ballistic (along with her panel) over the President “attacking” “American hero” and “Vietnam War veteran, Robert S. Mueller” on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. And to further send fellow Resistance types to spend Thursday night hiding under their beds or doomsday shelters, the MSNBC panel argued that it was another horrid day for “many of us....living through his presidency with clenched stomachs” as he also “smeared Speaker Nancy Pelosi,” “rewr[ote] big pillars of America's history,” and offered takes worthy of the Central and Axis powers in World Wars I and II.    Wallace first opened the show by fretting that “[w]hat we got from Donald Trump today exceeded admittedly low expectations,” which consisted of “a respectful speech” marking D-Day, but it was still another awful day for those “living...with clenched stomachs.” And why was that? Well, here’s Wallace’s nonsense (click “expand”): He honored the heroes of D-Day, but it's never that simple, is it? There’s never a moment when he’s still not the Donald Trump we all know by now. This is why many of us are living through his presidency with clenched stomachs and today — today was no exception because in the hour before he delivered an address meant to honor the heroes of D-Day, he attacked another American hero as well as the highest ranking Democrat in this country. In an interview with Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, taped with the graves of the heroes of D-Day in the backdrop, Donald Trump called Vietnam War veteran, Robert S. Mueller, whose service to his nation spans decades a fool. He also smeared Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That interview and Trump's remarks commemorating fallen soldiers delivered within an hour of each other.  After two Trump clips, Wallace again elevated Mueller to sainthood and placed him beside those who fought on D-Day even though he wasn’t even born yet (click “expand”): So, a reminder at the beginning of that clip he was calling Robert S. Mueller a fool. Robert S. Mueller is a former Marine, he didn't storm the beaches of Normandy but he seems like the type of soldier who might have. For his actions in Vietnam, he received the bronze star as well as a purple heart. He was shot and wounded and air lifted out of the jungle. He once said about his year in combat, “I'm most proud the Marine Corps deemed me worthy of leading other Marines.” And today Donald Trump called him a fool. And then Trump turned his fire on Nancy Pelosi. Here's what she had to say today while she was standing amid the graves of fallen heroes. Going to panelist Eddie Glaude, Wallace was apoplectic, declaring that “the attack on Mueller seemed so senseless, so mindless” and “startling” because Mueller “doesn't have a lot of political enemies” who defended America as FBI Director and as a veteran. Having as much diversity as a Pravda news program, Glaude replied that “Trump lacks the capacity to exhibit solemnity in an number of different occasions” as well as “visceral knowledge of how to behave under such circumstances, because he's a draft dodger.” Again, they’re talking about Vietnam when it’s the 75th anniversary of D-Day. If they want to talk about Vietnam, fine. But don’t use one to make claims about the other. After Wallace hailed Pelosi for being “normal” and having “deprived him of a political battle because she understood where she was,” liberal NBCNews.com reporter Heidi Przybyla agreed that “the contrast here was so sharp” with Trump’s lack “of basic decorum” to condemn Mueller and Pelosi in an interview with the Normandy cemetery in the background. Turns out, however, that the liberal media spent over 24 hours doing that as well, so it’s beyond hypocritical to chastise the President.  At any rate, here was more from Przybyla (click “expand”): What's so stark about this was behind him, moments — this was to come moments before what will be most likely the final ceremony for the men who saved us from the Nazis. From the men who probably this will be their last major attendance at a ceremony like this and I saw from our own Hallie Jackson who was tweeting that the timing of this was all the more outrageous just because it was as the ceremony was about to begin. This is where the President's mindset was, but there's just — there's something not there in terms of his capacity to filter and to organize his thoughts in that way...but in this case, split screen and contrast was one of the sharpest that we've seen. New York Times reporter Nick Confessore joined in by suggesting that the irony of the venue illustrating how White House believes they’re “under siege” and “even the most solemn moment is a chance and platform to carry the attack against your enemies.” Check out the full transcript below, but here are other relevant excerpts (click “expand,” emphasis mine): ROBERT COSTA: And if you listened to the President's speech today, he's making a war against international alliances. So much of this speech was framed with the idea of the nation. Not overt nationalism being underscored by the President. We were looking for that when he was over in England with Nigel Farage and other type, Brexit-type figures. But he's talking about the nation rather than the continent of Europe or international institutions and that's what what was a striking take away from his remarks today. A war against the typical U.S. view of international institutions and the European project. WALLACE: Robert Costa, that is an interesting piece of analysis. I've not heard that other can you talk about who surrounds him when those — this was obviously a speech written by somebody else perhaps with or without the President's participation....I mean, that is, Nick Confessore, the most sort of Manchurian analysis I've heard in this presidency that there are people that are taking these impulses and on a blank canvas that is a teleprompter speech for this President, really, rewriting big pillars of America's history. (....) WALLACE: And Nick, you and — you and Robert Costa are blowing my mind. Let me — let me try to throw out some examples of what you're talking about, shoving aside the leader of Montenegro, disparaging our allies on — on — in North America — disparaging NATO, turning it into a golf club for which he’s — CONFESSORE: Encouraging Brexit. WALLACE: — encouraging Brexit. EUGENE ROBINSON: You know, in the speech he emphasized and seemed to go out of his way to emphasize sovereignty. Sovereignty of the insular, muscular kind that brought us World War I that wasn't fixed and that brought us World War II and then after World War II, they tried to fix it by establishing an international order, by establishing institutions that knit us together by establishing the principle of shared economic prosperity that if — if ruined Europe became rich and prosperous, that would be good for us. That would enhance our safety and that worked really well for 75 years and so now we have a President that doesn't believe in that and who wants to go back to a way of thinking about international relations that led to the — to the carnage and disaster of the 20th century. It just objectively did. To see the relevant transcript from MSNBC’s Deadline: White House on June 6, click “expand.” MSNBC’s Deadline: White House
		June 6, 2019
		4:00 p.m. Eastern NICOLLE WALLACE: No one expected Ronald Reagan and the boys of Point du Hoc. No one expected Peggy Noonan’s soaring prose written 35 years ago for a very different man at a very different point in American history. What we got from Donald Trump today exceeded admittedly low expectations. He delivered a respectful speech. He honored the heroes of D-Day, but it's never that simple, is it? There’s never a moment when he’s still not the Donald Trump we all know by now. This is why many of us are living through his presidency with clenched stomachs and today — today was no exception because in the hour before he delivered an address meant to honor the heroes of D-Day, he attacked another American hero as well as the highest ranking Democrat in this country. In an interview with Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, taped with the graves of the heroes of D-Day in the backdrop, Donald Trump called Vietnam War veteran, Robert S. Mueller, whose service to his nation spans decades a fool. He also smeared Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That interview and Trump's remarks commemorating fallen soldiers delivered within an hour of each other. We'll show you both. First his remarks at the memorial. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They were young men with their entire lives before them. They were husbands who said good-bye to their young brides and took their duty as their fate. They were fathers who would never meet their infant sons and daughters, because they had a job to do. And with God as their witness, they were going to get it done. WALLACE: Here's that afore mentioned Fox News interview, taped minutes before he took the stage for those remarks we just showed you. TRUMP: Let me tell you. He made such a fool out of himself the last time he — what people don't report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong. But Nancy Pelosi, I call her nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn't talk about it. Nancy Pelosi is a disaster, okay? She's a disaster. And let her do what she wants, I think they're in big trouble. WALLACE: So, a reminder at the beginning of that clip he was calling Robert S. Mueller a fool. Robert S. Mueller is a former Marine, he didn't storm the beaches of Normandy but he seems like the type of soldier who might have. For his actions in Vietnam, he received the bronze star as well as a purple heart. He was shot and wounded and air lifted out of the jungle. He once said about his year in combat, “I'm most proud the Marine Corps deemed me worthy of leading other Marines.” And today Donald Trump called him a fool. And then Trump turned his fire on Nancy Pelosi. Here's what she had to say today while she was standing amid the graves of fallen heroes. ANDREA MITCHELL [TO PELOSI]: We are so divided as a country right now. Do you worry about the politics right now, impeachment and everything on the table, and how they can further divide us. HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: With all due respect to your question, I'm not here to talk about impeachment. But I do say on the subject of our veterans, we always strive to work in a bipartisan way. So this is nothing — not a departure from what we said as a wherever we can, we try to be as bipartisan, non-partisan as possible. That's a comfort to veterans. WALLACE: [INTRODUCES PANELISTS] Robert, let me start with you, this is the daily, hourly, second by second existence of covering Donald Trump even when he manages to elevate himself for a few moments he's always, always, always, always Donald Trump. ROBERT COSTA: That's exactly right and this is a split screen of a trip so far for President Trump stirring up all of this controversy from when he was in the United Kingdom to now when he is in France and even in Ireland. Yet at the same time, his public remarks when it comes to his scripted speeches are — have the trappings of what a President would usually say at times like this and he can't resist the pull of domestic politics at almost every turn. WALLACE: Eddie, the — the attack on Mueller seemed so senseless, so mindless, even for Donald Trump. I mean, Robert Mueller is a lot of things, a fool I've never — you know, Robert Mueller doesn't have a lot of political enemies. He doesn't have a lot of domestic political adversaries. He defended the United States as the director of the FBI for Democratic and Republican presidents, the only person in our country's history to have his term as FBI director extended to serve additional years. Before that, he was a decorated veteran. It was just startling to see anyone sit before graves at — at Normandy and call Robert Mueller a fool. EDDIE GLAUDE: Well, I mean, the one thing we do know is that President Trump lacks the capacity to exhibit solemnity in an number of different occasions, right and in a number of ways. The other thing I would say is that he doesn't have a visceral knowledge of how to behave under such circumstances, because he's a draft dodger, right? This is a guy who refused to serve. He didn't refuse to serve out of a principle, because of a principle reason for resisting Vietnam. He had bone spurs. He resisted because he was a coward and so the idea that he could then pass judgment against Robert Mueller, whatever you think about it, makes no sense to me. It is actually — it reveals how he stands in contradiction at every turn, it seems to me. WALLACE: And Nancy Pelosi wouldn't give him that duel today. She — she deprived him of a political battle because she understood where she was. She had some sharp comments for him and we'll get into them later on her way out the door, about seeing him in prison, but I think she just has this — and not — she's normal. I mean, like, again, I want to be careful not to praise her. She acted like a normal politician acts, like a normal human acts a day like this. He seemed either oblivious to where he was sitting. Laura Ingram didn't actually seem to goad him into attacking Mueller or Pelosi, he seemed willing to go there. HEIDI PRZYBYLA: She respects what every other lawmaker that you and I have ever interacted with in terms of basic decorum, but to Eddie's point the contrast here was so sharp. To be sure, we have seen many other instances of Trump on the international stage not respecting our customs and traditions, most recently just last week with his staff trying to remove the U.S.S. John McCain from a shot. This is regular, it happens all the time. What's so stark about this was behind him, moments — this was to come moments before what will be most likely the final ceremony for the men who saved us from the Nazis. From the men who probably this will be their last major attendance at a ceremony like this and I saw from our own Hallie Jackson who was tweeting that the timing of this was all the more outrageous just because it was as the ceremony was about to begin. This is where the President's mindset was, but there's just — there's something not there in terms of his capacity to filter and to organize his thoughts in that way. For instance, he was overseas when he was having discussions with Theresa May, meeting with the royal family and at 1:00 in the morning, tweeting about Bette Midler, so it is — the — the examples abound but in this case, split screen and contrast was one of the sharpest that we've seen. (....) 4:09 p.m. Eastern NICK CONFESSORE: But, just to step back for one second. You know, he chose to give this interview to Laura Ingram at this moment and the White House chose to put him at that place with that host — PRZYBYLA: With the gravestones in the background. CONFESSORE: — that conversation was only going to go one way. To me that's a sign of a white house that sees itself as truly embattled and under siege, when every moment, even the most solemn moment is a chance and platform to carry the attack against your enemies, that’s not actually a great sign of strength and stability going into 2020. It's all warfare all the time. WALLACE: It's such an incredible insight, Robert Costa, from Nick Confessore, it's all warfare all the time. Just that language in a moment where he's literally on a battlefield on which Americans and our allies died in a real war. I mean, how much of this perceived war footing has just intoxicated everyone around him so nobody, nobody ran up to him and said, whoa, I just checked the shot, it's stunning but anything you say will be broadcast on televisions around the world, in front of the — the graves of Americans and our allies who died here? COSTA: There's an ongoing trade war as the president is overseas. He's fighting with Mexico about the tariffs, the deadline is Monday for that five percent tariffs on all Mexican goods to be put into effect, so he's fighting that war while abroad. And if you listened to the President's speech today, he's making a war against international alliances. So much of this speech was framed with the idea of the nation. Not overt nationalism being underscored by the President. We were looking for that when he was over in England with Nigel Farage and other type, Brexit-type figures. But he's talking about the nation rather than the continent of Europe or international institutions and that's what what was a striking take away from his remarks today. A war against the typical U.S. view of international institutions and the European project. WALLACE: Robert Costa, that is an interesting piece of analysis. I've not heard that other can you talk about who surrounds him when those — this was obviously a speech written by somebody else perhaps with or without the president's participation. Who are the architects of that cause what you're describing is almost a rewriting of our own history, who were the architects of that? COSTA: We so often hear about Stephen Miller, the president's speech writer, but the chief of speech writing is Vince Haley, a little known aide that once worked for newt Gingrich. And Gingrich is one of those people in the Republican Party who have tried to channel the president's nationalism and instincts and make some kind of doctrine out of it. Of course, the President does not usually articulate anything coherent in terms of nationalism that would make a clear point but his advisers like Vince Haley, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State to an extent, are always trying to take those instincts and make policy and a message that has — makes sure the presidency has some kind of take away from it. It's not always easy for them when you talk to people familiar with their work, as you would imagine but that is the — the aim of a lot of their efforts. WALLACE: I mean, that is, Nick Confessore, the most sort of Manchurian analysis I've heard in this presidency that there are people that are taking these impulses and on a blank canvas that is a teleprompter speech for this President, really, rewriting big pillars of America's history. CONFESSORE: I mean, people have tried to build a Trump Doctrine from the day he arrived in the White House. It’s very difficult because he changes his mind a lot, but I do think it’s fascinating to consider the man who gave that speech in tribute to the alliances that led to the end of World War II is probably the world's most powerful source for disassembling those alliances and untangling that world order and taking it apart because he does not believe in it. So, it was a — it was a fascinating moment, perhaps a tragic one, to watch this president give what was basically a requiem for the alliances and the relationships that — the kind of made it possible to win that war and win that day. WALLACE: And Nick, you and — you and Robert Costa are blowing my mind. Let me — let me try to throw out some examples of what you're talking about, shoving aside the leader of Montenegro, disparaging our allies on — on — in North America — disparaging NATO, turning it into a golf club for which he’s — CONFESSORE: Encouraging Brexit. WALLACE: — encouraging Brexit. EUGENE ROBINSON: You know, in the speech he emphasized and seemed to go out of his way to emphasize sovereignty. Sovereignty of the insular, muscular kind that brought us World War I that wasn't fixed and that brought us World War II and then after World War II, they tried to fix it by establishing an international order, by establishing institutions that knit us together by establishing the principle of shared economic prosperity that if — if ruined Europe became rich and prosperous, that would be good for us. That would enhance our safety and that worked really well for 75 years and so now we have a President that doesn't believe in that and who wants to go back to a way of thinking about international relations that led to the — to the carnage and disaster of the 20th century. It just objectively did. CONFESSORE: This is a guy — this is a guy whose business career taught him in every deal there's a winner and a loser. There’s a winner and a sucker and he brings that idea to foreign relations with the effects we now see. GLAUDE: Let's be clear, this is — shouldn't be a surprise to us. The blueprint was given to us when Preibus — Reince and Steve Bannon sat down and Steve Bannon said there's three buckets,. We’re going to deconstruct the administrative state. We’re going to emphasize economic nationalism. Deconstruct the administrative state involved appointing people who were going to dismantle the agencies that they were over. Incompetence and ignorance throughout the government. Economic nationalism involved what? Tearing up NAFTA, dealing with globalist — globalist, right? In some ways through tariffs and the like. And then last was national sovereignty, rejecting the post-World War II consensus, right? So he doesn't pivot in that speech to the institutions that were built post the war and so what it really reflects is that — it is in some ways an ideological commitment that Bannon gave voice to that he's still consistently governing by. PRZYBYLA: Do you remember during the election there was one group that stood above all others in terms of their united opposition to Trump and it didn't matter what party you were in, it was national security experts and it was because they saw exactly this kind of a future, where our alliances would be frayed, perhaps permanently, and I think now if you look into the minds of potentially those leaders of Macron and Angela Merkel standing there, the question at this moment is what happens in the next election if Trump is re-elected. How — how — how much damage has been done that cannot be undone? How much of this is permanent? The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

The service to remember Katherine ""Kate"" Nixon, a married mother of three, was among the first for the victims, ushering in the next wave of grief for a city still reeling from the worst mass shooting of 2019. “We hope that now she’s enjoying the Heavenly Father’s blessing,” Eric Vogt, pastor of St. Gregory the Great, said during the homily. Nixon, 42, was a compliance manager in the city's public utilities division and held a degree in civil engineering, advocating for other women pursuing careers in the same field. She was also a regular churchgoer, remembered for her sincere wishes of peace to other parishioners around her during Tuesday Bible studies and Sunday Mass, Vogt said. A 'woman of God,' a Scottish music lover: These are the victims of Virginia Beach shooting Her younger brother, Matthew Lusich, said Nixon was the second oldest of eight siblings and emerged as a natural leader in the family. She met her future husband in Florida while she was still living in California, but wrote him letters every day adorned with Disney characters. Later, the entire family moved Nixon there, traveling together across Interstate 10. ""That's how important Kate was to us,"" Lusich said. Nixon and her husband later settled in Virginia Beach. Lusich said he admired his sister's willingness to move away from Bakersfield, California, to pursue what she truly wanted from life. ""That fearlessness and strength ... showed leadership and inspiration to me,"" he said. ""If Kate can be fearless, I’ll be fearless like Kate."" Services for other victims are scheduled through Sunday. Brent Hobbs, 61, worked with Nixon and attended her funeral Mass to show respect to her and her family. ""She was a great lady,"" he said.

243,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colorado-columbine/colorado-school-officials-consider-razing-site-of-columbine-massacre-idUSKCN1T804U?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Keith Coffman 3 Min Read DENVER (Reuters) - Public education officials in Colorado are considering a plan to tear down and rebuild Columbine High School, saying the site remains a “source of inspiration” for potential gun violence 20 years after a mass shooting there left 15 people dead. The idea was floated on Thursday in an open letter from the superintendent of Jefferson County public schools, Jason Glass, to Columbine staff, students, parents and members of the surrounding Denver suburb of Littleton, Colorado. The proposal calls for placing a bond measure seeking $60 million to $70 million on a future ballot to pay for demolition of the existing school and construction of a new school to replace it just west of the current site. Under the superintendent’s plan, the new campus would still be called Columbine High School, “honoring the pride and spirit the community has with the name,” and its school mascot and colors would remain unchanged. The county Board of Education and administration are “in the very preliminary and exploratory stages” of discussing such a plan, and are seeking public feedback on the proposal, Glass said. He cited numerous instances in which actual or would-be perpetrators of violence expressed a fascination with Columbine, including an 18-year-old Florida woman who shot herself to death in April after she sparked an extensive manhunt by traveling to Colorado days before the 20th anniversary of the 1999 massacre. ‘SOURCE OF INSPIRATION’ In 2010, 29-year-old twin sisters from Australia, obsessed with the shooting, traveled to Colorado and shot themselves at a local gun range in a suicide pact. One of the women survived, and police found among their belongings a photocopy of a news magazine cover depicting the Columbine killers and their victims. The Columbine site, Glass said, “continues to serve as a source of inspiration for potential school shooters, and its lasting impact only seems to be growing.” Fifteen people were killed in the Columbine rampage, which at the time ranked as the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Two high school seniors shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives in the bloodshed on April 20, 1999. The now-retired principal of Columbine during the massacre, Frank DeAngelis, 64, said Glass had sought his opinion before going public with the demolition idea, and he thought it was a “good plan.” “Twenty years ago, we never imagined that there would be people so infatuated with this tragedy years later,” DeAngelis said. “Maybe moving the physical plant would alleviate some of the issues.” Aside from numerous threats and the hoaxes the school has received over the years, curiosity seekers would take pictures of their children in front of the school with the Columbine sign in the background. “It became a tourist attraction,” he said.

245,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/opinion/trump-july-4.html,"Advertisement Supported by From the Justice Department to the military, the president is corroding and destabilizing the institutions of democracy. By Timothy Egan Contributing Opinion Writer It’s hard to work up much sympathy for the hollowed-out husk of a human being that is Mitch McConnell, or Lindsey Graham for that matter. This country is a harder, colder, more meanspirited place because these senators would rather bootlick a bully than stand for the principles they once espoused. Surely, they know the price of their vassalage. To serve Donald Trump is to lose all self-respect. You lie for him. You cover for him. You hate for him. John Boehner, the former House speaker, has more honor as a mercenary for marijuana than the elected Republicans shoveling dirt over the grave of the Constitution. But Americans should care about a more lasting and damaging corrosion — the destabilizing of venerable institutions. It’s one thing to corrupt a politician, the natural osmosis of the species. It’s quite another to debase the foundations of a great democracy. It started on Day 2, when the hapless liar, newly subsidized by taxpayers, tried to conscript the National Park Service into the fantasy that his crowd was the largest ever. The beloved Park Service survived the encounter with the devil, barely. But now the keepers of our national story are facing an authoritarian president who wants to dominate the Independence Day celebration on the National Mall. He would politicize what has long been a nonpartisan family affair, setting up “the angriest July 4 ever,” as Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia delegate in the House, put it. After the inauguration debacle, Trump moved on to bigger targets — the judiciary, the military, the press, and the professional class of bureaucrats who have made the United States a model for competence and incorruptibility in the Civil Service. With William Barr, Trump now has an attorney general who doesn’t care how much lasting damage he does to truth, justice and the American way. His mandate as the nation’s top prosecutor is to carry out Trump’s private vendettas. Next week, the House will vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt for defying the constitutional role of oversight by the legislative branch. Get used to it. Barr is marshaling the enormous legal muscle of the people’s Justice Department as a political hit squad. He’ll use the law, which he ignores when it suits him, to try to imprison public servants who launched an early investigation of Russian attempts to subvert an American election. No matter that an earlier presidential quisling, failed Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, could find no evidence of another of Trump’s fictions, millions of illegal voters. Barr’s job is to muddy the origins of the Russian investigation enough to frame career public servants as traitors. Normally, the courts would be bulwarks against the barbarians. And indeed, many judges have stood up to some of Trump’s most outlandish and illegal behavior. But the Trump effect, turning everything he touches to a cheap commodity, is to denigrate the legal arbitrators as “Obama judges” or “Mexican” judges. You’re with him or against him. This is dangerous stuff. And it gets worse. The most disgusting of the recent corruptions is the attempt to make the military another extension of presidential vanity. The White House wanted to “minimize the visibility” of the U.S.S. John S. McCain while Trump was in Japan. So, a family name synonymous with sacrifice on behalf of country was covered up so that President Bone Spurs would not be offended. Kim Jong-un has to be jealous. Following this desecration, the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, said the military “will not be politicized.” Sorry. That ship has sailed. You would think that matters of the soul would be harder for the soulless occupant of the White House to tarnish. After a round of golf last Sunday, a disheveled-looking Trump abruptly showed up at a church in Virginia. The White House said Trump wanted parishioners to pray for victims of a recent mass shooting. Instead, they were asked to pray for Trump. The pastor later said he had been blindsided. The same cannot be said for the man who oversees the Census Bureau, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He’s trying to use a mandate of the Constitution, the decennial census, to shore up power in the Electoral College and Congress for the aging white men of Trump’s base. Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on Ross’s effort to insert, into the census form that goes out to every household, a citizenship question, something that hasn’t been asked since 1950. It could mean that about 6.5 million people would go uncounted — citizens and noncitizens. This is a blatant abuse of power and of an otherwise benign government agency, affecting not just the number of representatives or electoral votes each state gets, but also the fate of numerous cities dependent on federal billions in mostly blue America. We’ve had a census every decade since 1790, after the colonies threw off a king and created a governing document establishing an independent judiciary, a legislative branch that writes the rules of the land, and asserting that no man is above the law.

246,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/eric-swalwell-gun-control-democrat-2020-for-the-nra-the-gig-is-up-,"Inspired by the Parkland survivors, the California congressman has made gun violence the focus of his 2020 Democratic campaign Last modified on Tue 15 Dec 2020 14.35 GMT It has been two months since the Democratic presidential hopeful Eric Swalwell joined survivors and families of victims of the Parkland high school massacre in Florida to launch a White House campaign specifically targeted at ending America’s epidemic of gun violence. During that time, thousands more people have been killed by weapons around the country, including another 12 exactly one week ago in the most recent mass shooting in Virginia Beach.  It’s what Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, considers a carousel of misery, a seemingly endless cycle of killing, mourning, outrage and demands for change, always followed by sympathy and platitude, but never any action, from lawmakers in Washington DC. Yet he sees hope despite the ever-rising death toll. And he challenges the suggestion that one of the biggest problems preventing action on gun legislation is people either not caring or not believing that anything will ever change. “I know why people may believe that, because we’re on this carousel where loss, grief, anger and then thoughts and prayers from Washington is an alibi for doing nothing,” he said in an interview with the Guardian ahead of national gun violence awareness day. Swalwell pointed at the success of groups like Moms Demand Action, a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures to protect people from gun violence, in challenging the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the 2016 midterm elections. “So there’s hope where hope had died before. That’s what motivates me,” Swalwell said. Swalwell has aligned himself with the families and student survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida, where 17 students and teachers were murdered in February 2018, and their March for Our Lives movement that captured the world’s attention afterwards. He has several proposals to tackle the guns crisis and remove military-style assault weapons from the streets of the US, including a controversial buy-back program that goes further than any of his rivals vying for the Democratic presidential nomination for 2020. “Assault rifles may account for a small number of gun violence deaths but they account for 100% of the fear that kids have. That’s the weapon they saw used in Parkland, they’ve seen used in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas. They’re afraid of this particular weapon. So it’s not just the lives you save, it’s the peace of mind you bring.” In America’s schools, he believes, the threat of gun violence has wreaked an incalculable toll, from the regular lockdown drills that students must endure to passing armed law enforcement officers every day at the campus gates. “I don’t believe it has to be the new normal,” he said. “It’s not just the lives lost but the trauma and anxiety that every kid in America is going through right now, that you can’t quantify so easily, but will have lasting effects on their lives because of gun violence in our schools. “In Virginia Beach, one of the witnesses saw the shooter going through the building and thought it was a drill,” he said, referring to last week’s shooting at a municipal building in the city. “Think about that. We’ve had so many mass shooting drills that when a shooting happens it’s just like a burglar alarm or fire alarm going off, and we’re not reacting the way that we should.” Swalwell believes a majority of Americans supports stricter gun restrictions. “[Most people] believe you can keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, keep your rifles, but get dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people,” he said. If the public has grown immune to the lengthening list of tragedy – from Columbine and Sandy Hook to Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland and now Virginia Beach – Swalwell says he has seen no evidence of it. He recounted an exchange at a recent gun violence town hall in Fairfield, in a rural part of south-eastern Iowa. More than a hundred people showed up, Swalwell said, despite it being a single-issue town hall. ﻿“I asked if this community seems fairly safe, why would you show up to talk about gun violence? This woman said, ‘because I don’t want it coming to my church’,” he recounted. “So there is a recognition that when you look at the victims … they’re black, they’re white, they’re young, they’re old. The victims are starting to look and come from all parts of America, and my hope is that more and more people believe we don’t have to live this way,” he said. One marked change, Swalwell believes, is that the midterm election results have shown the influence of the NRA has diminished. “We figured out in this last election that it’s just noise, that their tactic is to bully and to be vocal, but that they’re a vocal minority,” he said. “They want us to believe it’s a divisive issue. As a tactic it’s been effective for a while. We would always say we’re only allowed to grieve these shootings, we’re not allowed to act, and any time we would try to act we were told, well, you know, you’re touching a very hot issue, it’ll lead to a cultural war in America. “But for the NRA, the gig is up,” he added. If anybody still doubts the strength of public opinion on gun issues in the US, Swalwell says, they need look no further than Parkland. “I saw Parkland as a place where hope died. But in a uniquely American way, owing to the strength and courage of children, it’s a place where hope was reborn, where I believe we have an opportunity to seize momentum to make sure that kids are safe in their classrooms,” he said.",2019-06-07 08:00:54,"'For the NRA, the gig is up': Eric Swalwell on why gun control is a winning issue",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list At the end of May, it happened again. A mass shooter killed 12 people, this time at a municipal center in Virginia Beach. Employees had been forbidden to carry guns at work, and some lamented that this policy had prevented “good guys” from taking out the shooter. This trope – “the good guy with a gun” – has become commonplace among gun rights activists. Where did it come from? On Dec. 21, 2012 – one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut – National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Ever since then, in response to each mass shooting, pro-gun pundits, politicians and social media users parrot some version of the slogan, followed by calls to arm the teachers, arm the churchgoers or arm the office workers. And whenever an armed citizen takes out a criminal, conservative media outlets pounce on the story. But “the good guy with the gun” archetype dates to long before LaPierre’s 2012 press conference. There’s a reason his words resonated so deeply. He had tapped into a uniquely American archetype, one whose origins I trace back to American pulp crime fiction in my book “Hard-Boiled Crime Fiction and the Decline of Moral Authority.” Other cultures have their detective fiction. But it was specifically in America that the “good guy with a gun” became a heroic figure and a cultural fantasy. Beginning in the 1920s, a certain type of protagonist started appearing in American crime fiction. He often wore a trench coat and smoked cigarettes. He didn’t talk much. He was honorable, individualistic – and armed. These characters were dubbed “hard-boiled,” a term that originated in the late 19th century to describe “hard, shrewd, keen men who neither asked nor expected sympathy nor gave any, who could not be imposed upon.” The word didn’t describe someone who was simply tough; it communicated a persona, an attitude, an entire way of being. Most scholars credit Carroll John Daly with writing the first hard-boiled detective story. Titled “Three Gun Terry,” it was published in Black Mask magazine in May 1923. “Show me the man,” the protagonist, Terry Mack, announces, “and if he’s drawing on me and is a man what really needs a good killing, why, I’m the boy to do it.” Terry also lets the reader know that he’s a sure shot: “When I fire, there ain’t no guessing contest as to where the bullet is going.” From the start, the gun was a crucial accessory. Since the detective only shot at bad guys and because he never missed, there was nothing to fear. Part of the popularity of this character type had to do with the times. In an era of Prohibition, organized crime, government corruption and rising populism, the public was drawn to the idea of a well-armed, well-meaning maverick – someone who could heroically come to the defense of regular people. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, stories that featured these characters became wildly popular. Taking the baton from Daly, authors like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler became titans of the genre. Their stories’ plots differed, but their protagonists were mostly the same: tough-talking, straight-shooting private detectives. In an early Hammett story, the detective shoots a gun out of a man’s hand and then quips he’s a “fair shot – no more, no less.” In a 1945 article, Raymond Chandler attempted to define this type of protagonist: “Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. … He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor, by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it.” As movies became more popular, the archetype bled into the silver screen. Humphrey Bogart played Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe to great acclaim. By the end of the 20th century, the fearless, gun-toting good guy had become a cultural hero. He had appeared on magazine covers, movie posters, in television credits and in video games. Gun rights enthusiasts have embraced the idea of the “good guy” as a model to emulate – a character role that just needed real people to step in and play it. The NRA store even sells T-shirts with LaPierre’s slogan, and encourages buyers to “show everyone that you’re the ‘good guy’” by buying the T-shirt. The problem with this archetype is that it’s just that: an archetype. A fictional fantasy. In pulp fiction, the detectives never miss. Their timing is precise and their motives are irreproachable. They never accidentally shoot themselves or an innocent bystander. Rarely are they mentally unstable or blinded by rage. When they clash with the police, it’s often because they’re doing the police’s job better than the police can. Another aspect of the fantasy involves looking the part. The “good guy with a gun” isn’t just any guy – it’s a white one. In “Three Gun Terry,” the detective apprehends the villain, Manual Sparo, with some tough words: “‘Speak English,’ I says. I’m none too gentle because it won’t do him any good now.” In Daly’s “Snarl of the Beast,” the protagonist, Race Williams, takes on a grunting, monstrous immigrant villain. Could this explain why, in 2018, when a black man with a gun tried to stop a shooting in a mall in Alabama – and the police shot and killed him – the NRA, usually eager to champion good guys with guns, didn’t comment? Most gun enthusiasts don’t measure up to the fictional ideal of the steady, righteous and sure shot. In fact, research has shown that gun-toting independence unleashes much more chaos and carnage than heroism. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study revealed that right-to-carry laws increase, rather than decrease, violent crime. Higher rates of gun ownership is correlated with higher homicide rates. Gun possession is correlated with increased road rage. There have been times when a civilian with a gun successfully intervened in a shooting, but these instances are rare. Those who carry guns often have their own guns used against them. And a civilian with a gun is more likely to be killed than to kill an attacker. Even in instances where a person is paid to stand guard with a gun, there’s no guarantee that he’ll fulfill this duty. Hard-boiled novels have sold in the hundreds of millions. The movies and television shows they inspired have reached millions more. What started as entertainment has turned into a durable American fantasy. Maintaining it has become a deadly American obsession. [ Like what you’ve read? Want more?

248,https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/david-limbaugh/david-limbaugh-president-trump-cant-catch-break-even-church,"Some deem President Donald Trump so contemptible that it's morally acceptable, even required, to suspend ordinary rules of civility toward him. I'm not saying Trump should be off limits; no one is, and certainly not the president of the United States. But it's ironic that the very people who sanctimoniously condemn him for his supposed incivility apparently believe they themselves don't have to be civil toward him. This is a recurring issue, but what brings it to mind today is the controversy over Pastor David Platt's praying for President Trump when Trump made an unscheduled stop at his McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Virginia, last Sunday. The president was returning to the White House from a golf outing and visited to pray for the victims of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  During his service, Platt was called backstage and informed that Trump was on his way to his church and would like for the church to pray for him. Trump arrived and stood onstage while Platt prayed for him, and then Trump walked off the stage without comment. Later, Platt posted a statement on the church website explaining his decision to pray for Trump, presumably because some members of the congregation complained about it. When I read about this, my first instinct was to express my disappointment with the pastor's pandering to certain Trump-hating congregants who seem to believe, like many other Trump haters, that all rules of decorum are suspended when it comes to Trump and, in this case, that even God's directives don't apply. Forget God's command to pray for our leaders, because despite His omniscience, He surely didn't anticipate a president like Trump when he inspired that passage and others. After further considering this and reading his statement, I concluded that Platt was in a very difficult situation. He must honor God's Word, but he mustn't harm the Gospel message by allowing confusion among his congregants concerning his motives to cause discord in the church. His statement is not an outright apology because he didn't express regret for obeying God's command that we pray for our leaders. ""I know that it is good, and pleasing in the sight of God, to pray for the president,"" he said. But he went on to say something that does bother me: ""I wanted to share all of this with you in part because I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision. This weighs heavy on my heart. I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God's Word in a way that transcends political party and position ... So while I am thankful that we had an opportunity to obey 1 Timothy 2 in a unique way today, I don't want to purposely ever do anything that undermines the unity we have in Christ."" You see, he didn't apologize for praying for Trump. That's good. It's also good that he affirmed that God's Word transcends politics. I certainly don't want my pastor to preach politics from the pulpit — though some would incorrectly argue that taking a strong stance against certain sins is preaching politics. But where I think Pastor Platt erred is in expressly validating the hurt feelings of some congregants. They have no right to be hurt over his biblically mandated prayer for the president, and they ought to be repentant, rather than accusatory, for implying otherwise. It would have been fine if Platt had said, ""I was simply honoring God's Word. I was not endorsing the president from the pulpit or making a political statement."" That would be a legitimate clarification if some members thought Platt was trying to make an indirect political endorsement. He also has a strong biblical duty to promote church unity, and issuing a clarifying statement can be very helpful. But that's not all that happened, and so we are left with a message, surely unintentional, that Trump antipathy is so justified that Christians have a right to be angry when God's inambiguous Word is followed.  I appreciate Pastor Platt's obedience to Scripture and the difficult situation in which he found himself. I applaud his efforts to honor the Apostle Paul's inspired command that we promote church unity. It's just too bad that he went further and sanctioned the invalid objections of congregants to his prayer for the president. Giving Platt the benefit of the doubt, I assume he meant that they would have had valid reasons to object to his pulpit endorsement of Trump, if that had occurred, but it did not. If that's what he meant, he didn't express it well, whereas the rest of his statement was quite clear — and good. Few people were more politically opposed to President Obama than I was, but I would not object to (and would support) any pastor praying for him. Nor do I think we would be reading about any pastor apologizing for having prayed for Obama. But Trump is different. All bets are off where he is concerned. In our free country, people can treat President Trump as contemptuously as they want, but we should recognize their screaming hypocrisy when they treat him with the same level of incivility with which they condemn him.

02:34 We’re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along! Some key links and events from the day: 1.59am BST
01:59 Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has also confirmed the deal to avoid tariffs in a tweet, saying officials would soon announce details of the arrangement: Gracias al apoyo de todos los mexicanos se logró evitar la imposición de aranceles a los productos mexicanos que se exportan a EEUU. Marcelo Ebrard dará detalles del arreglo; de todas maneras, nos congregaremos para celebrarlo mañana en Tijuana a las 5 de la tarde. pic.twitter.com/Cqd79lSJpu 1.51am BST
01:51 The Mexican foreign minister has confirmed Trump’s tweets saying the US has reached a deal with Mexico to avoid tariffs, after twelve hours at the state department: After TWELVE HOURS at the State Department, the Mexican foreign minister says he's wrapping things up, a deal with the US has indeed been reached, and he'll come out and brief the press soon. For background on the events leading up to the agreement, some details from an AP report earlier today: Companies are rushing to ship as many goods as possible out of Mexico to get ahead of the tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, hurriedly sending cars, appliances and construction materials across the border to beat Monday’s deadline. Mexican-made tiles are piled up on the pavement next to a warehouse in New Mexico. A furniture factory and a jalapeno exporter are fretting about a huge financial hit next week. And hundreds of semi-trailers carrying medical devices, televisions and Toyota pickups idled in line Friday at the truck crossing in Tijuana. Even before the tariff threat, Tijuana shipped $80 million worth of goods across the border every day. Now companies are spending millions to hire freight carriers and secure warehouse space in the U.S. in a massive shift of inventory happening over a matter of days along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200 kilometer) border. 1.34am BST
01:34 Trump has just now tweeted that the US has signed an agreement with Mexico to avoid the tariffs he was threatening to impose: I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to.... ....stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you! Updated

01:21 US officials are planning to open three emergency shelters this month to house 3,000 to 4,000 unaccompanied migrant children who have crossed the border, according to the Washington Post. The shelters will be located on two US military bases and at a south Texas facility, officials told the Post. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will shelter 2,000 children at the military facilities and 1,600 at a temporary emergency influx shelter in Carrizo Springs, Texas, according to the report. A private contractor is expected to run the Texas facility, and HHS will run the military shelters. The news follows reports that the Trump administration is canceling English classes, legal aid and recreational programs for unaccompanied minors staying in shelters. More details on the new facilities here: SCOOP: HHS to house thousands of unaccompanied minor migrants on military bases, at Texas facility (and an update on English classes, soccer spending) https://t.co/YvxNlCRrfV 12.50am BST
00:50 An important update from the Texas Tribune today: There are now more than 5,800 migrant children held in the state. More than 5,800 migrant kids are living in Texas shelters. We've updated our tracker. We're still watching. https://t.co/pobTLHaGet pic.twitter.com/nBvrp67UyG The number of children in Texas shelters increased slightly last month, even as the number of migrants arriving at the border has surged. https://t.co/pobTLHaGet The 5,800 unaccompanied migrant children are now living in 35 shelters across Texas, according to the publication. 12.29am BST
00:29 Trump’s golf vacations have now cost taxpayers nearly $106m in the last two and a half years, according to a new HuffPost report: NEW: That $102 million for Trump's golf vacations?Scratch that.Thanks to a minimum cost to taxpayers of $3.6 million because of Trump's insistence on visiting his golf course in Ireland, the new total is (at least) $105.8 million.https://t.co/1pViciZdmj The figure jumped this week following Trump’s $3.6m detour to his golf course in Ireland. The visit sparked controversy earlier in the day after his golf course in Doonbeg promoted the president’s stay in a tweet, which appeared to be a violation of the Trump Organization’s promise not to reference Trump’s position as president in social media posts. The club later deleted the tweet. 12.11am BST
00:11 Here’s a thread worth reading from Justin Amash, the only Republican in Congress to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump: As you can see from the attached tweet, I initially fell for Attorney General Barr’s March 24 letter of principal conclusions—but then I read Mueller’s report. https://t.co/cBuatwNInE Amash said he “initially fell for Attorney General Barr’s March 24 letter of principal conclusions” until he read Mueller’s report. Some more from his tweets: Mueller’s report describes acts of obstruction by President Trump, and it clearly says Mueller chose not to decide whether Trump had committed a crime because Mueller was prohibited from actually charging him... It’s not that Mueller couldn’t make up his mind, chose not to make a decision, and then said Trump wasn’t exonerated; rather, Mueller had decided that it was inappropriate to make a determination as to whether Trump had committed a crime, and he sought to make that fact clearer... When Barr’s letter came out, the White House abruptly changed its tone. Trump said “the Mueller report was great” and that Mueller had acted honorably, and he touted the report as a “total exoneration.” Kellyanne Conway referred to the investigation as “the gold standard.” But, as we later found out, Mueller’s report is damning for the president. If Barr’s letter had accurately reflected the report, the White House would not have reacted positively. 11.38pm BST
23:38 Trump said “we’re doing all right” when asked now about his talks with Mexico regarding his tariffs threat, according to the latest White House pool report: JUST IN (via WH press pool)#Trump says ""we're doing all right"" re: talks with #Mexico to avoid his #MexicoTariffs threat. He did not elaborate. He gave his answer after returning to the WH tonight.Currently, the tariffs are set to start Monday at 5% on imports from Mexico. pic.twitter.com/5vZCb38shG The Mexican delegation that is trying to stave off the president’s tariff threat has been at the State Department for 8 hours now, per @jmhansler. They showed up just before 9 a.m. President Trump is due back at the White House any minute now. Read background on the tariff threat here. 11.25pm BST
23:25 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned today that that the US Supreme Court is likely to be very divided in some of the “most watched” cases that remain in the coming weeks, CNN reports: Did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg offer some tea leaves today on the remainder of the term? https://t.co/RRBdKGoeal Lots of 5-4 Supreme Court decisions on the way, Justice Ginsburg suggests in speech at 2nd Circuit conference: pic.twitter.com/KsHUTljB4L From her remarks to the Second Circuit Judicial Conference in New York: As of today, we have announced 43 decisions in argued cases. That leaves a large number (27) to be announced in the remaining June days. Of the 43 argued cases resolved so far, only 11, or just over 25%, were decided by a vote of 5 to 4 or 5 to 3.

251,https://www.alternet.org/2019/06/how-the-good-guy-with-a-gun-became-a-deadly-american-fantasy/,"At the end of May, it happened again. A mass shooter killed 12 people, this time at a municipal center in Virginia Beach. Employees had been forbidden to carry guns at work, and some lamented that this policy had prevented “good guys” from taking out the shooter. This trope – “the good guy with a gun” – has become commonplace among gun rights activists. Where did it come from? On Dec. 21, 2012 – one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut – National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Ever since then, in response to each mass shooting, pro-gun pundits, politicians and social media users parrot some version of the slogan, followed by calls to arm the teachers, arm the churchgoers or arm the office workers. And whenever an armed citizen takes out a criminal, conservative media outlets pounce on the story. But “the good guy with the gun” archetype dates to long before LaPierre’s 2012 press conference. There’s a reason his words resonated so deeply. He had tapped into a uniquely American archetype, one whose origins I trace back to American pulp crime fiction in my book “Hard-Boiled Crime Fiction and the Decline of Moral Authority.” Other cultures have their detective fiction. But it was specifically in America that the “good guy with a gun” became a heroic figure and a cultural fantasy. Beginning in the 1920s, a certain type of protagonist started appearing in American crime fiction. He often wore a trench coat and smoked cigarettes. He didn’t talk much. He was honorable, individualistic – and armed. These characters were dubbed “hard-boiled,” a term that originated in the late 19th century to describe “hard, shrewd, keen men who neither asked nor expected sympathy nor gave any, who could not be imposed upon.” The word didn’t describe someone who was simply tough; it communicated a persona, an attitude, an entire way of being. Most scholars credit Carroll John Daly with writing the first hard-boiled detective story. Titled “Three Gun Terry,” it was published in Black Mask magazine in May 1923.   Abe Books “Show me the man,” the protagonist, Terry Mack, announces, “and if he’s drawing on me and is a man what really needs a good killing, why, I’m the boy to do it.” Terry also lets the reader know that he’s a sure shot: “When I fire, there ain’t no guessing contest as to where the bullet is going.” From the start, the gun was a crucial accessory. Since the detective only shot at bad guys and because he never missed, there was nothing to fear. Part of the popularity of this character type had to do with the times. In an era of Prohibition, organized crime, government corruption and rising populism, the public was drawn to the idea of a well-armed, well-meaning maverick – someone who could heroically come to the defense of regular people. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, stories that featured these characters became wildly popular. Taking the baton from Daly, authors like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler became titans of the genre. Their stories’ plots differed, but their protagonists were mostly the same: tough-talking, straight-shooting private detectives. In an early Hammett story, the detective shoots a gun out of a man’s hand and then quips he’s a “fair shot – no more, no less.” In a 1945 article, Raymond Chandler attempted to define this type of protagonist: As movies became more popular, the archetype bled into the silver screen. Humphrey Bogart played Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe to great acclaim. By the end of the 20th century, the fearless, gun-toting good guy had become a cultural hero. He had appeared on magazine covers, movie posters, in television credits and in video games. Gun rights enthusiasts have embraced the idea of the “good guy” as a model to emulate – a character role that just needed real people to step in and play it. The NRA store even sells T-shirts with LaPierre’s slogan, and encourages buyers to “show everyone that you’re the ‘good guy’” by buying the T-shirt.   NRA Store The problem with this archetype is that it’s just that: an archetype. A fictional fantasy. In pulp fiction, the detectives never miss. Their timing is precise and their motives are irreproachable. They never accidentally shoot themselves or an innocent bystander. Rarely are they mentally unstable or blinded by rage. When they clash with the police, it’s often because they’re doing the police’s job better than the police can. Another aspect of the fantasy involves looking the part. The “good guy with a gun” isn’t just any guy – it’s a white one. In “Three Gun Terry,” the detective apprehends the villain, Manual Sparo, with some tough words: “‘Speak English,’ I says. I’m none too gentle because it won’t do him any good now.” In Daly’s “Snarl of the Beast,” the protagonist, Race Williams, takes on a grunting, monstrous immigrant villain. Could this explain why, in 2018, when a black man with a gun tried to stop a shooting in a mall in Alabama – and the police shot and killed him – the NRA, usually eager to champion good guys with guns, didn’t comment? Most gun enthusiasts don’t measure up to the fictional ideal of the steady, righteous and sure shot. In fact, research has shown that gun-toting independence unleashes much more chaos and carnage than heroism. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study revealed that right-to-carry laws increase, rather than decrease, violent crime. Higher rates of gun ownership is correlated with higher homicide rates. Gun possession is correlated with increased road rage. There have been times when a civilian with a gun successfully intervened in a shooting, but these instances are rare. Those who carry guns often have their own guns used against them. And a civilian with a gun is more likely to be killed than to kill an attacker. Even in instances where a person is paid to stand guard with a gun, there’s no guarantee that he’ll fulfill this duty. Hard-boiled novels have sold in the hundreds of millions. The movies and television shows they inspired have reached millions more. What started as entertainment has turned into a durable American fantasy. Maintaining it has become a deadly American obsession.

29 October 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) sees the franchise move back in a promising direction, flaunting stunning graphics, fast-paced action and more multiplayer modes than you can shake a stick at. But the biggest change is in tone, with the campaign shifting to darker, more mature content that has split opinion and tests player's morals. It's uncomfortable at times, but it's the most thought-provoking instalation the series has seen yet - for better or worse. Platform: PlayStation 4 Time played: 10 hours Following a US convoy down the dusty streets of fictional Urzikstan, we scan what's left of the desolate buildings on either side of us for the slightest bit of movement. We're heading towards a hospital to capture terrorist Al-Qatala leader 'The Wolf,' fresh after an attack on London's Piccadilly Circus. It seems like a pretty straightforward Call of Duty level: get down the street, inevitably meet some terrorist snipers on the buildings we're watching, have a big ol' firefight and continue on to victory. Then an IED goes off. Below our feet. Killing several members of the convoy. Taking us completely by surprise. We were watching the roofs. They usually attack from the roofs. It's this which epitomizes Modern Warfare, a shake-up in formula that is far too real and leaves you feeling a bit more than uncomfortable. My father survived an IED in Baghdad - and this in-game moment hitting out of nowhere was a shock, for better or worse. But there's also the question: does Infinity Ward have the right to capture that moment, put it in their game and monetize it? Which is the big draw for the Modern Warfare reboot: it's incredibly provocative. Before you ever lay hands on the game, you'll hear about specific levels which may have gone too far or how it has ripped its missions ""straight out of the headlines"". Take, for example, the already notorious 'Clean House' mission which sees you raiding a Camden town house in London, following the aforementioned terrorist attack on Piccadilly Circus, killing the plain clothes residents and even encountering a mother cradling her baby. However, while the controversy of Modern Warfare is an important aspect, it is not the be-all and end-all. This review will examine the controversial parts of Modern Warfare alongside the aspects we look at in every game review. We questioned whether to do this or not, but at the end of the day it's a question of what Infinity Ward marketed Modern Warfare as, and what it has delivered. In some cases those two things don't match up and, in that case, it's not a political issue but one of whether consumers will get what they paid for. Here at TechRadar, that's what matters: you. We will not be questioning whether Modern Warfare has gone too far, what we will lay out is everything we think will actually be important to you before you consider buying this title - regardless of politics or personal feelings. So, strap in, and let's break the whole thing down. [Warning: Spoilers ahead.]  Let's start with the general premise of Modern Warfare's campaign. Loosely based on the Gulf War, Modern Warfare sees you primarily playing as CIA officer Alex and SAS Sergeant Kyle Garrick (accompanied by familiar face Captain Price) who are working to recover stolen chemical gas that has been hijacked by a terrorist organization in Urzikstan. While Alex is embedded with rebels in the fictionalized country - battling against the Russian forces who have occupied it - Garrick begins by dealing with the conflict's impact on London, in the form of a terrorist attack, before branching further afield. We're trying not to spoil too much. Yeah, there's quite a bit of pro western propaganda in Modern Warfare and even an instance where history has been rewritten to make the US look better. In a mission titled 'Highway of Death', you are told how the Russians bombed this vital road during the invasion and killed those trying to escape. It's a clear reference to the real Highway of Death incident of 1991- which, in reality, the US military slaughtered Iraqi forces who were retreating - but told from a completely different perspective. Herein lies the conundrum of the game, it's very clearly political and yet both Activision and the game's developer say that it's apolitical. This is blatantly disingenuous and, at worst, a clear re-writing what is tantamount to a war crime for the sake of storytelling. Either way, it's impossible to overlook and will ultimately color how you feel about the world and the tragic, multifaceted events that are now being purposely, profoundly obfuscated. And we're not the only ones who feel that way: The anti-Russian propaganda is so over-the-top, in fact, that the PlayStation Store in Russia isn't selling the title and prominent Russian streamers have quit the game over its depictions of some events.  However, despite these clear issues, it is difficult to deny that Modern Warfare is more relatable than other CoD games. Whether that's a good or bad thing will really depend on your own personal experience, but the missions and scenarios portrayed are certainly more familiar than fighting Nazis in World War II - even if they can be hard to swallow. There's one instance when you're trying to fend off Russian reinforcements in a base and the game cuts to you playing as one of the US air reinforcements. You fly over the base, and using thermal imaging, identify and gun down dozens of Russians. But through this view they are seen only as white moving objects. It feels like the point Infinity Ward is trying to make is that this is how the military view the enemy in that scenario but its a dangerous broad stroke. It's also unsettlingly familiar, as we recall the news footage of attacks in Syria showing similar scenarios. We struggled with the fact that we enjoyed the familiarity, despite the many issues with it. This is the type of war we have watched happen from our TV screens and read in the newspapers. Obviously we will feel an affinity to it. However, that doesn't mean that Modern Warfare can ever truly capture that experience. Not even close. For us - or Infinity Ward - to think it could is ignorance. It's worth noting that you don't have to play the campaign if you don't want to. There is still the less troubling multiplayer - a CoD staple - which has a multitude of modes to keep you occupied, including a co-op option. We'll come back to those in more detail later on. However, you won't unlock most of the game's Operators unless you complete the campaign.  Multiplayer is Call of Duty's bread and butter, largely responsible for the franchise's loyal fan base. And while it largely remains unchanged, the game introduces a few features introduced that makes things a lot smoother. For one, Modern Warfare has console-PC cross-play for the first time in the franchise's history. In a blog post Activision confirmed that ""most"" of its post-release content will launch across all platforms simultaneously. So new maps, modes and missions will be available to everyone at the same time - finally. And this crossplay introduction doesn't seem to have affected the matchmaking in a huge way, it still takes only a few seconds to be sorted into a multiplayer match. In addition, there's a couple of new multiplayer modes (on top of the classics like Team Deathmatch) for you to try out. Firstly, there's Gunfight which is an intense 2v2 mode where two teams play in multi-round cage matches across three small custom maps. Every two rounds, teams swap to opposite sides of the map. All four players will have the same loadout which will typically be comprised of a primary and secondary weapon as well as a tactical grenade and a piece of lethal equipment. The first team to win six rounds are the winners. If you prefer bigger teams, then you can enjoy 6v6, 10v10 and 20v20 matches - alongside a new mode called Ground War which supports up to 100 players and is essentially a large scale, much longer match. While these modes are an interesting change, they don't do huge amounts to shake up the Call of Duty formula. So if you're happy with a tighter version of the usual CoD multiplayer with a dash of new content then you should be pleased. Remember, there's no Zombie mode this time around, but killstreaks and perks are back.  In addition to classic multiplayer, there's also Special Ops which can be played by up to four players together, with the main aim being to work together to “stop and sever a global terror organization’s access to weapons, funds, intelligence, and hardware"". Special Ops is divided into two game modes: missions and operations. Operations are multiplayer-only matches that feature unique objectives and a certain amount of freedom in terms of how you approach it. Missions, meanwhile, can be played with others or solo. These missions are less sprawling than Operations and more focused on testing your skills with certain weapons or tools. On completing a mission, your performance will be given a star rating. Special Ops is a nice palate cleanser between quickplay multiplayer modes, when you fancy a bit more direction and narrative but also want to work with others.  Now, let's talk about where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare truly shines: its graphics. Modern Warfare is stunning: every facial expression, each detail-clad environment and beautifully-shot cinematic. We were playing on a standard PS4 and were still blown away by the graphics. Each cinematic feels like stepping into an interactive war epic, while (being a London resident) we can say that the details of maps such as Piccadilly circus are pretty spot on - even if they're largely fictionalized. It's no surprise as Modern Warfare uses a brand new engine for the series, the first time the games have used a new engine in 14 years. And we're definitely big fans. It's worth bearing in mind that if you choose to play on a Nvidia ray tracing capable GPU, then you can enjoy even better graphical performance. Make sure to check out our Call of Duty: Modern Warfare performance test on PC.  Other games have struggled to dethrone Call of Duty as the king of first-person shooters and Modern Warfare is a testament to this. The gunplay in Modern Warfare is tight and incredibly smooth, with each bullet feeling suitably weighty and every kill feeling earned. Likewise, movement is fluid, though the restricted mantling is a bit of a pain, allowing you to quickly manoeuvre through maps with relative ease - there's even the ability to slide now (thanks, Apex Legends). While the UI itself is clean and simple, you have the option in some cases to make things more ""realistic"" by removing it altogether. This means you simply see what your player would see, without any directions on how much ammo you have, what guns are in your arsenal or where you are on the map. It's considerably more difficult, and one for those who appreciate a challenge. What we found most interesting about Call of Duty's combat is how much more aware players need to be of their environment - as you would in a real war. As previously mentioned, one foot out of place resulted in an IED explosion but actually the game - particularly the campaign - is riddled with these scenarios: tripwires, clandestine enemies, and dangers that push you to stay constantly aware.  And the enemies themselves arguably showcase this best. Most of Modern Warfare's enemies don't actually look like a stereotypical enemies at all. There's no malevolent man twirling his moustache or a clearly marked Nazi looming over you, instead you have plain-clothed NPCs - most of the time. This seems like an to attempt to teach you a whole new lesson about being trigger-happy. The immediate reaction in CoD levels is to run and gun, clear rooms and shoot your way to victory. But actually, you need to be a bit more aware of who you're shooting at. For example, in a level involving an incident in the Embassy, you are clearing the building of terrorists, ultimately running from room to room lighting up the bad guys. However, some have grabbed Embassy employees as hostages. Something you maybe don't realize, as you run down halls and immediately shoot everyone on sight before noticing one was a civilian and having to question whether to restart the mission to lift that guilt. This is made even harder in scenarios when the lighting is dim or smokey, where you can often find yourself accidentally shooting members of your own team before failing and being told ""friendly fire will not be tolerated"". The shooting of civilians, on the other hand, will. The civilian casualties feel like a point Infinity Ward is trying to make that once again feels uncomfortable - both in moralism and in practice. Often civilians are almost impossible to avoid, especially when you're in the full swing of things. But it feels like a commentary on how 'easy' it is for military personnel to accidentally kill civilians in those situations. It's an extremely complex issue, and it's not Infinity Ward's place to explore it.  When it comes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the story, obviously, is troubling.  While we can't cover all the aspects of it, we can't help but feel that Infinity Ward overstepped moral boundaries in its quest to deliver something more impactful to players. In our opinion, it is not Infinity Ward's place to be trying to teach people about the 'moral conflicts' involved in war through a videogame, as it will never truly capture that experience. The fact the game was marketed like it's capable of doing so is uncomfortable, but what one person finds morally ambiguous, won't necessarily have the same impact on someone else. That's disappointing because, as a game, it's the best the franchise has ever been. It's a wonderfully tight shooter, with impressive graphics and plenty of much-needed feature additions that shift the series in a promising direction. The change to a darker, more mature tone is what the series needed but the aforementioned issues mean that it falls short in that regard. There's still a way to go. However, if you love Call of Duty primarily first-person shooter - with little interest in its narrative - then you will probably enjoy Modern Warfare. We would definitely warn those who have partaken in active military service to proceed with caution.

                    Associated Press RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia’s governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after last week’s deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Gov. Ralph Northam announced the date Friday. READ MORE: Officials ID Virginia Beach gunman as city employee The Democratic governor says the best way to respond to the May 31 mass shooting at a municipal building is with “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on silencers  Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can’t dictate how it’s conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they’ve said they’ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes. Left:

The latest project from “BoJack Horseman” producers Kate Purdy and Raphael Bob-Waksberg looks to be doing that on a lofty and sweeping scale. “Undone,” the newest animated series for Amazon Prime Video, follows the consciousness of Alma (Rosa Salazar) as she navigates an expansive mental universe. The first two episodes of the series will debut for audiences at the ATX Festival in Austin this weekend, and the series is slated to join the Amazon Prime Video family of programming later this year. The official synopsis for the series explains that Alma’s life is an ordinary one “until a near fatal accident induces visions of her late father, Jacob. Through these persistent visions he urges her to tap into a mysterious ability that allows her to travel through space and time with the hopes of preventing his untimely death. This quest challenges Alma’s relationships and brings into question her mental wellbeing with those closest to her.” Related

These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. At the end of May, it happened again. A mass shooter killed 12 people, this time at a municipal center in Virginia Beach. Employees had been forbidden to carry guns at work, and some lamented that this policy had prevented “good guys” from taking out the shooter. This trope—“the good guy with a gun”—has become commonplace among gun rights activists. Where did it come from? On Dec. 21, 2012 —one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut—National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Ever since then, in response to each mass shooting, pro-gun pundits, politicians, and social media users parrot some version of the slogan, followed by calls to arm the teachers, arm the churchgoers, or arm the office workers. And whenever an armed citizen takes out a criminal, conservative media outlets pounce on the story. But “the good guy with the gun” archetype dates to long before LaPierre’s 2012 press conference. There’s a reason his words resonated so deeply. He had tapped into a uniquely American archetype, one whose origins I trace back to American pulp crime fiction in my book “Hard-Boiled Crime Fiction and the Decline of Moral Authority.” Other cultures have their detective fiction. But it was specifically in America that the “good guy with a gun” became a heroic figure and a cultural fantasy. Beginning in the 1920s, a certain type of protagonist started appearing in American crime fiction. He often wore a trench coat and smoked cigarettes. He didn’t talk much. He was honorable, individualistic—and armed. These characters were dubbed “hard-boiled,” a term that originated in the late 19th century to describe “hard, shrewd, keen men who neither asked nor expected sympathy nor gave any, who could not be imposed upon.” The word didn’t describe someone who was simply tough; it communicated a persona, an attitude, an entire way of being. Most scholars credit Carroll John Daly with writing the first hard-boiled detective story. Titled “Three Gun Terry,” it was published in Black Mask magazine in May 1923. “Show me the man,” the protagonist, Terry Mack, announces, “and if he’s drawing on me and is a man what really needs a good killing, why, I’m the boy to do it.” Terry also lets the reader know that he’s a sure shot: “When I fire, there ain’t no guessing contest as to where the bullet is going.” From the start, the gun was a crucial accessory. Since the detective only shot at bad guys and because he never missed, there was nothing to fear. Part of the popularity of this character type had to do with the times. In an era of Prohibition, organized crime, government corruption, and rising populism, the public was drawn to the idea of a well-armed, well-meaning maverick—someone who could heroically come to the defense of regular people. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, stories that featured these characters became wildly popular. Taking the baton from Daly, authors like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler became titans of the genre. Their stories’ plots differed, but their protagonists were mostly the same: tough-talking, straight-shooting private detectives. In an early Hammett story, the detective shoots a gun out of a man’s hand and then quips he’s a “fair shot—no more, no less.” In a 1945 article, Raymond Chandler attempted to define this type of protagonist: “Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. … He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor, by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it.” As movies became more popular, the archetype bled into the silver screen. Humphrey Bogart played Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe to great acclaim. By the end of the 20th century, the fearless, gun-toting good guy had become a cultural hero. He had appeared on magazine covers, movie posters, in television credits and in video games. Gun rights enthusiasts have embraced the idea of the “good guy” as a model to emulate—a character role that just needed real people to step in and play it. The NRA store even sells T-shirts with LaPierre’s slogan, and encourages buyers to “show everyone that you’re the ‘good guy’” by buying the T-shirt. The problem with this archetype is that it’s just that: an archetype. A fictional fantasy. In pulp fiction, the detectives never miss. Their timing is precise and their motives are irreproachable. They never accidentally shoot themselves or an innocent bystander. Rarely are they mentally unstable or blinded by rage. When they clash with the police, it’s often because they’re doing the police’s job better than the police can. Another aspect of the fantasy involves looking the part. The “good guy with a gun” isn’t just any guy—it’s a white one. In “Three Gun Terry,” the detective apprehends the villain, Manual Sparo, with some tough words: “‘Speak English,’ I says. I’m none too gentle because it won’t do him any good now.” In Daly’s “Snarl of the Beast,” the protagonist, Race Williams, takes on a grunting, monstrous immigrant villain. Could this explain why, in 2018, when a black man with a gun tried to stop a shooting in a mall in Alabama—and the police shot and killed him—the NRA, usually eager to champion good guys with guns, didn’t comment? Most gun enthusiasts don’t measure up to the fictional ideal of the steady, righteous and sure shot. In fact, research has shown that gun-toting independence unleashes much more chaos and carnage than heroism. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study revealed that right-to-carry laws increase, rather than decrease, violent crime. Higher rates of gun ownership is correlated with higher homicide rates. Gun possession is correlated with increased road rage. There have been times when a civilian with a gun successfully intervened in a shooting, but these instances are rare. Those who carry guns often have their own guns used against them. And a civilian with a gun is more likely to be killed than to kill an attacker. Even in instances where a person is paid to stand guard with a gun, there’s no guarantee that he’ll fulfill this duty. Hard-boiled novels have sold in the hundreds of millions. The movies and television shows they inspired have reached millions more. What started as entertainment has turned into a durable American fantasy. Maintaining it has become a deadly American obsession.

To tackle the feat, director Hisko Hulsing enlisted the services of Minnow Mountain, the animation studio that previously worked on the Richard Linklater film A Scanner Darkly and Tower, Keith Maitland’s harrowing documentary on the 1966 mass shooting at University of Texas at Austin. Joining Bob Odenkirk (as Jacob) and Salazar in the show’s voice ensemble are Daveed Diggs, Angelique Cabral, Constance Marie, and Siddarth Dhananjay. Watch the debut teaser for the series (complete with some gorgeous, human-sized flowers) above. Undone will premiere on Amazon Prime Video later this year.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com I am often amazed at how one of our Canine Companions for Independence service dogs can touch so many lives, even beyond their ""normal"" jobs. Some of our service dogs work with a single adult or child while others become a ‘facility dog’ working with a handler helping sometimes hundreds of people at a hospital, courthouse, police department or a victim advocacy center. THE DAILY SPIKE: THE DO’S AND DONT’S FOR LEAVING YOUR DOG WITH A PET SITTER
Murph is one of those facility service dogs and his handler Janet Balser works for the Staunton, Virginia Victim/Witness Program. On a normal day, Murph and Janet aid crime victims, families and witnesses throughout the legal process. Murph’s calm and loving sweetness empowers witnesses to testify. Last week, another horrific mass shooting occurred in this country where 12 people were killed in Virginia Beach, Va. Services and memorials were held this week to honor those killed.
      (Janet Balser) Then last week, another horrific mass shooting occurred in this country where 12 people were killed in Virginia Beach, Va. Services and memorials were held this week to honor those killed.
Janet felt compelled to use her extensive experience to do what she could during the terrible tragedy and Janet’s boss, the Commonwealth’s Attorney Jeffrey D. Gaines, allowed her to leave the office to help.
So Janet got in her car with Murph and drove the three-plus hours to Virginia Beach. “Murph and I are here comforting the victims at the memorial and vigil. He’s doing all the work. He just lets me tag along.” ‘Murph’ is a facility service dogs and his handler, Janet Balser, works for the Staunton, Virginia Victim/Witness Program. On a normal day, Murph and Janet aid crime victims, families and witnesses throughout the legal process. Murph’s calm and loving sweetness empowers witnesses to testify.

When I don’t have the right words to say, he is just there letting people hug him and cry. Whoever he encounters, he helps them work through their pain. They just sit quietly and hug him. It’s truly amazing and so emotional.”
A vigil was held at Rock Church and was very inclusive. A variety of faith communities throughout the Virginia Beach community sent prayers to the victims and family members. Everyone offered messages of healing and unity.
Janet and Murph are leaving Virginia Beach today to go home but say they will be available in the weeks to come as the impact of this terrible tragedy continues to unfold. A vigil was held at Rock Church and was very inclusive. A variety of faith communities throughout the Virginia Beach community sent prayers to the victims and family members. Everyone offered messages of healing and unity.
      (Janet Balser) Janet and Murph graduated from Canine Companions for Independence in May of 2017. Murph was named for U.S. Medal of Honor recipient Lt. Michael “Murph” Murphy, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2005 trying to rescue his unit behind enemy lines.  The story of his heroism was told in the book and movie “Lone Survivor.” FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS
You can’t change the past. This is an awful time for the Virginia Beach community. But just thinking how a pup like Spike, like all the Canine Companions puppies in training, can someday play a role in helping communities heal is just a beautiful thought.  And that is why so many of us volunteer to raise service pups in training - and can give them up. They have a much bigger purpose. Sometimes bigger than we may ever know. Fun stories about food, relationships, the great outdoors and more.

259,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/columbine-high-school-may-be-torn-down-following-morbid-fascination-by-potential-copycats/,"Watch CBSN Live By Sophie Lewis June 7, 2019 / 2:20 PM
          / CBS News Twenty years after the 1999 massacre that claimed the lives of 13 students and teachers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, officials are considering tearing down the school and building a new one. Superintendent Jason Glass said he fears the school remains a source of ""morbid fascination"" and an ""inspiration"" for gun violence. Glass calls them ""Columbiners"" — people obsessed with the shooting who seek out the school for inspiration or curiosity. After two decades of dealing with the aftermath of one of the world's most notorious mass shootings, Glass is asking the Jefferson County community whether the school should be torn down completely. ""Perhaps influenced by the 20th anniversary of the shooting, over the past 11 months the number of people trying to enter the school illegally or otherwise trespassing on school property has been increasing — now to record levels,"" Glass wrote in an open letter to the community Thursday. ""Since the morbid fascination with Columbine has been increasing over the years, rather than dissipating, we believe it is time for our community to consider this option for the existing Columbine building."" Glass told CBS Denver, ""We have hundreds of people who try to enter the building or walk onto the grounds or slow-roll by it. We even have tour buses of people that stop outside Columbine High School."" According to Glass, it is standard for school safety experts to recommend demolishing schools where shootings have taken place. But 20 years ago, there was no protocol on how to move forward, so Columbine High School instead installed a surveillance system and implemented police and security protection. But the increase in schools shootings in recent years has led the district to reconsider. ""School shooters refer to and study the Columbine shooting as a macabre source of inspiration and motivation,"" Glass said. In April, as memorials were held to mark the anniversary, authorities searched the area for Sol Pais, an 18-year-old woman who was ""infatuated"" with the shooting and had traveled from Florida before arming herself with a shotgun and ammunition. (She was eventually found dead in an apparent suicide.) Glass said that was just one example of the hundreds of people who are stopped by local law enforcement from entering the school each year. ""Most of them are there to satisfy curiosity or a macabre, but harmless, interest in the school,"" he said. ""For a small group of others, there is a potential intent to do harm."" The cost of building a new Columbine High School would cost $60-$70 million, Glass said. He proposed keeping the name Columbine to honor ""the pride and spirit"" it holds for the community and preserving the Hope Library — where 10 students were killed — as the cornerstone of the new school. The district released an online survey for members of the community to consider allocating the funds needed for the project. In Newtown, Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary School was demolished 10 months after the mass shooting that took the lives of 20 first-graders and six educators in 2012. Contractors were asked to destroy the materials to eliminate nearly every trace of the building. But just as Glass has proposed, Sandy Hook kept its name.

261,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/rev-ew-jackson-va-gov-northam-god-hater-rejects-christian-prayer,"Rev. E.W. Jackson, the great-grandson of slaves, a Marine, and a Harvard Law graduate, criticized Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's (D) dismissal of ""thoughts and prayers"" following the mass shooting in Virginia Beach, stating that Northam's views reveal he is ""dismissive of prayer, and therefore dismissive of Christians,"" that he does not ""want to hear about God"" and, combined with his leftist policy history, confirms he is ""a God-hater."" On his June 5 radio show, The Awakening, Rev. Jackson said, “This is the thing, I find it almost seals the deal in terms of where these gun-control people are coming from. Here’s what the governor [Northam] said…. He’s going to call the legislature back into session and he says, “I will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” ""He said [that], mocking their usual response to gun violence by supporters of the Second Amendment,"" added Jackson. ""Well, I don’t know if it’s just supporters of the Second Amendment.  I think it’s just people who care about other people and realize that the ultimate answer is God.""  Jackson continued, “So let’s add to Northam’s sordid resume that he is also a God-hater. Because these leftists do this all the time, ‘We don’t want to hear about your prayers.’ They don’t know that prayer is the most powerful force in the universe, besides God Himself, because prayer is how one accesses God. Prayer is how one communicates with and becomes a vessel for God’s power to flow."" “So, prayer is extremely powerful,"" said Jackson.  ""The Bible says the effectual fervent  prayer of a righteous man avails much. Jesus says men who are always praying do not lose heart. Prayer is extremely powerful."" “But not only is this [Northram’s remark] dismissive of prayer—and therefore dismissive of Christians, because it’s mainly Christians who say, ‘We’re praying for you’ mainly—but it’s blasphemous because it is basically saying God is irrelevant. ‘We don’t want to hear about God. We don’t want to hear about God. We’re going to solve this problem with more gun control.’ That’s what he wants to do.” On May 31, disgruntled Virginia Beach city engineer DeWayne Craddock shot and killed 12 of his co-workers. He also shot and wounded five other people. h/t RightWing Watch  Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com. CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.

Richard Vogel/AP Today is National Gun Violence Awareness Day, and the Democratic presidential candidates are lining up to express their support for gun control. Created in 2015 by the group Everytown For Gun Safety, the annual event is intended to draw attention to the shootings that have torn apart families and communities across the country. Many of the White House hopefuls are wearing orange in honor 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was shot and killed shortly after she performed in Barack Obama’s second inaugural parade in 2013. Gun control had been a relatively low-key issue throughout the first part of the Democratic primary campaign, though that may change now that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has convened a high-profile special session of the state legislature to consider how to respond to a recent mass shooting. In a statement, Everytown said that Friday’s show of solidarity by the candidates—so far, 13 have tweeted in support of National Gun Violence Awareness Day—is “yet another indication that gun violence prevention will be a marquee issue in the 2020 presidential campaign.” Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has yet to say anything today about the state of gun violence in the country, but he has managed to tweet some things about Nancy Pelosi and Mars.

Ralph Northam on Friday announced a special July legislative session on gun measures in the wake of last week's mass shooting in Virginia Beach that left 12 dead and several injured. Apparently mocking the usual response to gun violence from gun-rights activists, the Democratic governor said, ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers"" were the best ways to respond to the May 31 rampage by city employee DeWayne Craddock. Craddock used two semi-automatic .45-caliber handguns, a silencer and extended magazines to kill 12 people in a municipal building.

(Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP) Northam wants lawmakers to consider a ban on silencers, like the one used in last week's shooting, and universal background checks. The Republican-led General Assembly appears unwilling to consider tougher gun-control measures. Republican leaders have said they will propose tougher penalties for people who use guns to commit crimes -- including new mandatory minimum sentences.

""But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange â and vote â to protect lives."" According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the Wear Orange campaign was launched in 2013 after 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was shot and killed in Chicago. Following her death, her friends and family wore orange to generate awareness about gun violence, and to honor Pendleton. Pendleton was not far from Obama's home in Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood at the time of the shooting, and she was killed just one week after she performed at his second inauguration, CNN reported. In the years since Pendleton's death, the Wear Orange campaign has taken off across the country. On Friday, lawmakers like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom are running for president in 2020,  joined Obama and other prominent politicians in urging people to wear orange. But that's not all Obama wants Americans to do. In his tweet, Obama urged Americans to speak out and vote âÂ a message echoed by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who in a separate tweet urged elected officials to ""stand up to the NRA."" According to the Wear Orange campaign's official website, an average of 100 Americans are killed with guns each day. There have been 159 mass shootings this year alone, per the Gun Violence Archive, killing or injuring more than 1,400 children and teenagers. In order to commemorate National Gun Violence Awareness Day, hundreds of cities will host nearly 750 events over the weekend, Newsweek reported. In honor of this annual event, which was first recognized in 2015, activists and anti-gun violence groups organize marches and awareness events nationwide on the first Friday of June. This year, a wide range of lawmakers, celebrities, corporate brands, and other organizations are participating in National Gun Violence Awareness Day, as well as in the Wear Orange campaign. According to Newsweek, comedian Samantha Bee, actress Julianne Moore, and companies like Levi Strauss and Penguin Random House have all pledged their support to the Wear Orange campaign. However, it looks like President Donald Trump won't be joining any National Gun Violence Awareness Day events. Although the president published several tweets on Friday about Vice President Mike Pence's birthday and about traveling back to the United States from his trip to Europe, he made no mention of gun violence. Instead, he called on Democrats to put forward a ""good and solid immigration bill"" and suggested that the moon was part of Mars. Although Trump previously suggested that he would push for a few gun control measures following last year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, he quickly reverted to NRA-supported policies like arming teachers and increasing school security, Reuters reported.

								5:51 AM By Christopher Donato, Sruthi Palaniappan and Adam Kelsey Filed under 2020 Election PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES More than half of the Democratic field crowded into San Francisco this past weekend for the California Democratic Convention, where they tried to stand out in the crowded primary as the clock ticks away for the candidates to qualify for the first debates. And with less than a week for candidates to hit the threshold to make the debate stage, the Democratic National Committee announced a rule change that leaves Montana Gov. Steve Bullock on the outside looking in. Bullock had qualified for the first debates, in Miami at the end of June, based on polling, but the DNC said Thursday that two ABC News/Washington Post polls — one of which had put Bullock over the top — would no longer be counted. As of Thursday afternoon, that left 20 candidates who had met thresholds via polling and/or fundraising. Meanwhile, the mass shooting in Virginia Beach last week brought the issue of gun violence to the fore, and former Vice President Joe Biden seemingly set himself apart from the rest of the crowd when he said he supported the Hyde amendment, which blocks federal funding of abortions. On Thursday, however, he appeared to reverse that position. Here’s the weekly candidate roundup: Michael Bennet (D) Bennet met the polling criteria to participate in the first Democratic debate, which is scheduled to take place later this month in Miami. He received 1 percent support in a national CNN poll, the third qualifying poll in which he has earned 1 percent. In the aftermath of the mass shooting in Virginia, Bennet told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” that he thinks the president “can make a difference.” The U.S. House “has passed background checks to close the internet loophole,” he said. “This person bought the guns lawfully, as we know. Every single fact pattern will be different. We should pass those background checks — 90 percent of Americans support it.” The Colorado senator spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina while many other Democratic presidential candidates were at the California Democratic Convention. Joe Biden (D) Biden broke from the other 2020 candidates when his campaign announced Wednesday that he supports the Hyde Amendment but that he would be open to repealing it. Then, on Thursday, he said he no longer supported the policy. “I’ve been working through the final details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,” he said. The Hyde Amendment was first passed in 1976 and says that federal funding cannot be used to pay for abortions. A few years later, Congress made an exemption for cases in which there was a threat to the patient’s life. An exemption for cases of rape or incest was added in the early 1990s. The law largely affects patients who are on Medicaid. Biden also released a $5 trillion climate plan that calls for net zero emissions of carbon pollution in the U.S. by 2050. The plan includes $1.7 trillion in federal spending over 10 years; the rest of the spending would come from the private sector. Cory Booker (D) The New Jersey senator unveiled a plan to make housing more affordable by offering a tax credit to people who spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. According to researchers at Columbia University, the refundable renters credit would benefit more than 57 million people — including 17 million children — and lift 9.4 million Americans out of poverty. Booker’s housing plan also includes measures to expand access to legal counsel for tenants facing eviction, reform restrictive zoning laws, build more affordable housing units and combat homelessness through funding grants. At the California Democratic Convention over the weekend, Booker also addressed the issue of gun violence. “We are seeing the normalization of mass murder in our country,” Booker said. “It is time that we come together and stand together and take the fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like we have never seen before. We can lead that fight, and we can win.” Steve Bullock (D) On Wednesday, Bullock announced the first official policy of his presidential campaign, designed to keep foreign money out of U.S. elections. His “Check the Box” proposal would require all 501(c)(4) groups that aren’t required to disclose any of their donors and super PACs to “check a box” saying that they are not taking money from foreign actors. Lying “will carry the penalty of perjury,” according to Bullock’s policy. In a Des Moines Register op-ed, the Montana governor wrote: “Trump’s dark money loophole is telling these secretive groups that they don’t even have to disclose the source of their funding to the IRS. It opens the door not only to significantly more spending by corporations and wealthy donors, but also to potential spending by foreign entities.” Pete Buttigieg (D) During a MSNBC town hall on Monday, Buttigieg said he “would not have applied that pressure” for Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 over sexual harassment allegations without first learning more about the claims. “I think it was his decision to make,” the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said. “But I think the way that we basically held him to a higher standard than the GOP does their people has been used against us.” At the California Democratic Convention, Buttigieg leaned into his position as a Washington outsider and said the country needs “something completely different.” “Why not a middle-class millennial mayor with a track record in the industrial Midwest? Why not a mayor at a time when we need Washington to look more like our best run cities and towns, not the other way around? And why not someone who represents a new generation of leadership?” the 37-year-old mayor said. Julian Castro (D) The former secretary of housing and urban development unveiled a sweeping police reform plan Monday, with the goals of preventing officer-involved shootings, increasing transparency and ending “police militarization.” “Even though we have some great police officers out there, and I know that because I served as mayor of San Antonio, this is not a case of just a few bad apples,” Castro said on CNN. “The system is broken.” Included in the proposal are restrictions on the use of deadly force, the increased adoption of technology such as body cameras, an end to stop-and-frisk tactics and expanded bias training. Bill de Blasio (D) De Blasio earned his first union endorsement since launching his presidential campaign. The New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council announced their support on Wednesday and said it would campaign for the New York City mayor in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. John Delaney (D) Delaney criticized the DNC guidelines that include a 65,000-donor threshold as one way to qualify for the first presidential debates. He argued that the criteria leaves voters excluded from the process. “I don’t think we should have a donor standard,” he said on MSNBC. “I absolutely don’t think the Democratic Party should be about money. Fifty percent of the American people can’t afford basic necessities. I’m running for those people.” At the California Democratic Convention, the former congressman from Maryland was aggressively booed for denouncing “Medicare for all” as “bad policy.” His proposed health care plan would keep private insurance as an option. Tulsi Gabbard (D) The Hawaii congresswoman reacted to the House passing legislation that which would protect young undocumented immigrants and immigrants with temporary status who were once covered by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. On Fox News, Gabbard said: “The hyper-partisanship around this issue has gotten in the way of delivering a real solution. This legislation and finding a solution for these Dreamers is something that has had bipartisan support.” Kirsten Gillibrand (D) Gillibrand released a plan to legalize marijuana that calls for expunging all nonviolent marijuana convictions. The New York senator said that under her plan, tax revenue from recreational marijuana would be put “toward programs that help repair the damage done by the war on drugs.” During a Fox News town hall, she attacked the network for its coverage of abortion. Gillibrand was asked about her position on “late-term abortion,” and she said that “when it comes to women’s reproductive freedom, it should be a woman’s decision.” She then criticized Fox News, accusing it of creating “a false narrative” on the issue. Gillibrand was cut off by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who said: “Senator, I just want to say we’ve brought you here for an hour.” Wallace continued: “We have treated you very fairly. I understand that, maybe, to make your credentials with the Democrats who are not appearing on Fox News, you want to attack us. I’m not sure it’s frankly very polite when we’ve invited you to be here.” Gillibrand said she would “do it in a polite way” but was interrupted again by Wallace, who said: “Instead of talking about Fox News, why don’t you answer” the audience member’s question? Gillibrand then attacked the network for their use of the word “infanticide,” calling it “illegal” and “not a fact.” She added, “I believe all of us have a responsibility to talk about the facts.” Kamala Harris (D) Harris was rushed off the stage Saturday while speaking at the MoveOn #BigIdeas forum in San Francisco after an activist grabbed the microphone out of her hand. Harris returned to the stage about a minute later to chants of “Ka-ma-la” from the audience. An animal activist group claimed responsibility for the man’s rushing of the stage and identified him as Aidan Cook. The group’s spokesperson, Matt Johnson, told ABC News that Cook was not detained or arrested; he was kicked out of the event. John Hickenlooper (D) The former Colorado governor faced a disruptive crowd at the California Democratic Convention when he said, “If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.” The crowd of Democratic activists responded to his message with a chorus of boos and a massive display of “Bernie” signs. Hickenlooper responded by saying, “You know, if we are not careful, we are going to help reelect the worst president in American history.” Jay Inslee (D) The Washington governor has been pushing hard for the DNC to dedicate one of the primary debates to the topic of climate change. DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa responded in a statement saying that “the DNC will not be holding entire debates on a single issue area because we want to make sure voters have the ability to hear from candidates on dozens of issues of importance to American voters.” Inslee called the DNC’s decision to not host a climate debate “deeply disappointing.” “The DNC is silencing the voices of Democratic activists, many of our progressive partner organizations, and nearly half of the Democratic presidential field, who want to debate the existential crisis of our time. Democratic voters say that climate change is their top issue; the Democratic National Committee must listen to the grassroots of the party,” Inslee’s campaign said in a press release. Amy Klobuchar (D) Klobuchar secured her first Iowa endorsement from state Rep. Ruth Ann Gaines. Gaines said she’s endorsing Klobuchar because of the senator’s “commitment to addressing and prioritizing mental health.” Seth Moulton (D) Moulton said in a CNN town hall that if elected, he would seek to change Justice Department guidelines that prevent a sitting president from being indicted. The comment came after former special counsel Robert Mueller said that a “longstanding” department policy prevents a sitting president from being charged with a federal crime. Beto O’Rourke (D) O’Rourke released a voting rights plan that called for term limits for members of Congress and for Supreme Court justices. O’Rourke is calling for members of the House and Senate to serve for no more than 12 years and for justices to be allowed one 18-year term. O’Rourke said that after justices complete their terms, they would be permitted to serve on federal appeals courts. The former Texas congressman’s plan also includes measures to increase voter participation, including making Election Day a federal holiday and allowing automatic and same-day voter registration. Tim Ryan (D) Ryan flipped his position on impeachment this week, saying that he believes Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The Ohio congressman made his announcement during a CNN town hall, saying that Mueller’s statement last week helped change his mind. Bernie Sanders (D) Sanders spoke at Walmart’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. He accused the company of paying its employees low wages and lobbied for a resolution that would give hourly workers representation on the company’s board of directors. As many Democratic candidates spoke out on abortion rights this week, comments by Sanders in 1972 — before the Roe v. Wade decision — resurfaced via Newsweek. He told a Vermont newspaper at the time that it struck him as “incredible” that the male-dominated state legislature, and politicians in general, “think that they have the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body.” This weekend, Sanders visits Iowa to speak at the Capital City Pride Candidate Forum in Des Moines. He also will march with McDonald’s workers who are seeking higher wages and attend the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame Celebration in Cedar Rapids, among several other events. Eric Swalwell (D) Swalwell talked about his assault weapon ban and buyback plan on ABC’s “The View.” He said he’s the only candidate calling to “ban and buy back every single assault weapon in America.” The California congressman also left the door open to drop out of the presidential race and run for reelection for his House seat. Swalwell said he is open to running for a fifth term in Congress but said he wouldn’t make that decision until December. Elizabeth Warren (D) Warren announced on Thursday that her campaign staff has unionized. “My campaign has submitted their support to join IBEW 2320,” Warren tweeted. The Sanders and Castro campaigns have also unionized, and the Swalwell campaign had previously said they were unionizing. Andrew Yang (D) June is gay pride month, and in an interview with BuzzFeed News, Yang said he thinks his signature universal basic income proposal could help members of the LGBTQ community. “I have many friends in the LGBTQ community, and what they tell me is that they get kicked out of the house at higher levels, that they get fired from jobs at higher levels, so they’re very excited about the freedom dividend,” Yang said, referring to his plan to give all American adults $1,000 per month. That could help people “adjust if they’re economically singled out,” he said. Yang will be among the speakers at the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame Celebration in Cedar Rapids on Sunday.

272,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/WWy1-59dMtY/ct-abn-kane-moms-gun-violence-st-0609-story.html,"Anjum Coffland thinks of her twin daughters, who were killed in St. Charles in 2017, every day. For the longest time, she avoided going into stores. “I wanted to shop for them. This is what we do as mothers, we think about our children 24 hours a day,” she said. Coffland took part Friday as the Kane and Kendall County group of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America hosted a Wear Orange play date in Pottawatomie Park in St. Charles. About 75 people gathered in the park, many of them mothers and fathers with young children. For their kids it was a carefree day to run around the Pottawatomie Park Pavilion along the Fox River, create sidewalk chalk art and blow bubbles into the wind while their parents were having a serious conversation about gun reform. The event was part of National Gun Violence Awareness Day and Wear Orange Weekend. Wear Orange began after Hadiya Pendleton of Chicago was shot and killed shortly after performing in President Obama's second inaugural parade in 2013. Orange is the color Pendleton's friends wore in her honor because it was her favorite color, Moms Demand Action volunteer leader Ellen Gibson said. “Gun violence has to stop. Laws have to change,” she told the crowd. The gun violence prevention advocacy group said their efforts are intended to raise awareness of the problem of gun violence. “The gun violence in the country is staggering,” Batavia resident Silvia Pelech said, as she helped wrap orange ribbons around a tree in the park. The Batavia mother said the mass shooting Feb. 15 at the Henry Pratt Co. has had a far reaching impact beyond Aurora. Five workers were killed and five police officers and one employee were injured in the shooting. “I feel anxiety every time I hear an ambulance when my children are in school,” Pelech said. Pelech was disappointed the Illinois General Assembly did not pass a gun licensing reform bill during its recently completed spring session. The “Fix the FOID” act bill was in response to the mass shooting in Aurora. St. Charles Mayor Ray Rogina said it doesn't make sense that as the city's liquor commissioner he can demand a fingerprint from those seeking a liquor license but that the same isn't done for gun owners. “When we license a perspective licensee, we demand a fingerprint. It seems reasonable to me that we can demand a fingerprint for a FOID card,” Rogina said. Rogina said the “Fix the FOID” measure needs to be approved in Springfield. “I am going to say publicly today that I want the Senate to approve the bill. Move that bill,” he said to applause. Batavia Mayor Jeff Schielke spoke as a family member of someone killed by gun violence. His uncle was murdered in 1978 in an armed robbery outside of a restaurant in Batavia. Schielke was called to the scene as a paid-on-call first responder for the Batavia Fire Department at the time. “I had the ultimate terrible experience of gun violence in my life,” he said. “It leaves a scar on you for the rest of your life.” Schielke said he was appreciative of the Kane and Kendall County group's efforts to raise gun violence awareness. Illinois needs to “tighten the process” for gun purchases, he said. “There's a lot of work to do but if we didn't have a group like this we would be in a much weaker position,” Schielke said. Rob Anderson of Sugar Grove spoke about his son Brendon, 21, who was killed by gun violence in 1998 in Aurora. “When my son died, a lot of me died as well,” Anderson said. The after effects of gun violence took a toll on his family, he said. It took 10 years to find Brendon's killer and five-and-a-half years to get the man convicted to a life sentence, Anderson said. Anderson told the group he was appreciative of their efforts. “You are so appreciated. You are all a blessing,” he said. Coffland's husband shot and killed their 16-year old daughters, Brittany and Tiffany, in March 2017 in his townhouse in downtown St. Charles. He shot his wife in the leg and then fatally shot himself. Coffland said she is doing OK but will “never be 100 percent.” “My girls would have finished their first year in college (right now),” she said after the event. “I never thought that I would lose my babies all at once.” Coffland said the town's support has been wonderful. “After all of this happened, the community has been amazing,” she said. “I appreciate it. I want my girls to be remembered. I will not stop talking about them.” The girls' photographs were on display with a bouquet of orange roses set on a table under the park's small pavilion. Gibson has a daughter who was in high school the year the Coffland twins were killed. “It shook our town,” Gibson said. “We support every step taken to keep people safe,” she said. “We are not against gun ownership. We encourage responsible gun ownership.” Aurora resident David Quiroz came to the event with his two daughters, ages 1 and 3. He is a teacher in the West Aurora School District and his building was on lockdown when police responded to the Pratt warehouse shooting. “People seem to be more proactive,” he said. “The conversations before were more isolated, as though the violence would not happen in our community.” CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-06-07 17:25:00,Fox Valley event looks to raise awareness of 'staggering' gun violence in America,"gun control,firearms,children and youth",9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher cautioned Democrats not to make gun control a prominent issue in the 2020 election, urging them not to ""die on this hill"" if it means losing to President Trump. During his panel discussion Friday night, Maher listed several issues on which Democrats' stands poll better than Republicans,' such as the environment, education and health care. But he noted that Republicans hold a narrow lead over Democrats on gun policy. Maher then mentioned President Trump's recent sit-down with British TV personality Pierce Morgan, where the president mentioned that some people own guns for recreational use. GUN CONTROL RETURNS TO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS 2020 DEMS PUSH SWEEPING PLANS Bill Maher, host of ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" (HBO) ""I don't like guns. Have some, don't like them, have it for [an] emergency, like an antibiotic,"" Maher told the panel, ""but some people do. Lots of people do and their view is, 'Yes there is a violence problem with guns, but not me. And you're going after me.'"" Maher added he had doubts whether solutions proposed by Democrats ""would solve the gun problem,"" and that ""to die on this hill and lose an election"" was a real possibility because ""we've lost elections before on this issue, which is not a winning issue for Democrats."" ""What is the option though, not to make it a central part of the campaign?,"" New York Times columnist Charles Blow asked. ""No,"" Maher responded. ""First of all, liberals should learn more about guns. I don't know much about guns because, again, I don't care, I don't like them, but I hear this from gun people.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Cory Booker took a very long time to be able to answer that question,"" Maher said as he shook his head. Blow dismissed Maher's criticism, saying the ""framing of the question is wrong"" and pointed to the 30,000 deaths per year that involve guns that needs preventing. ""You're seriously saying that he shouldn't be able to answer the question as a politician, 'How will your plan specifically stop this problem?'"" Maher reacted. ""If you did everything that the Democrats wanted... I still think you would have this problem because it's much more complicated than just the mass killers or the type of gun.

274,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-ecn-aurora-elgin-gun-panel-st-0509-story.html,"Stronger gun laws are part of a multi-prong approach that could help prevent mass shootings like the one in February at Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, a panel of experts in Elgin said. Five employees died and five police officers and one employee were wounded during the Pratt shooting Feb. 15. On Thursday, a panel of legislators, police officers and officials met at First Presbyterian Church in Elgin to discuss what can be done to prevent mass shootings at a community meeting titled “Responding to Aurora: A Conversation with Illinois Leaders.” New legislation, improving access to mental health services, training police officers in crisis situations and improving policies and procedures in tracking revoked Firearm Owner Identification cards are all ways to curtail the deadly incidents, panel members said. A mass shooting is “the thing that you train for and prepare for that you think will never happen in your community,” Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said at the event. Ziman was joined by state Rep. Kathleen Willis, D-Northlake; Elgin Police Chief Ana Lalley; Assistant Deputy Director of the Illinois State Police David Byrd; Bureau Chief FOID Division of the Illinois State Police Jessica Trame; and Kane County State’s Attorney Joe McMahon. Willis was working on a gun reform bill when the Aurora shooting at Henry Pratt Co. happened. The shooting “certainly sped up the need to investigate and make sure we could come up with sensible solutions” to gun violence, she said. She reached out to gun advocates, anti-violence groups, local and state police and others to get feedback and find solutions to the problem, she said. An area of concern that came from those discussions was how Illinois handles FOID revocations. There are 35,000 people with revoked FOID cards in the state, Willis said. The Henry Pratt Co. shooter, Gary Martin, had a FOID card despite having a felony conviction that prohibited him from owning a gun. Martin had his FOID card revoked by Illinois State Police in 2014. But he managed to keep both the license and the gun he used in the mass shooting. The bill, dubbed Fix the FOID, originally called for fingerprinting anyone applying for a FOID card, which would help with more thorough background checks, and increasing the application fee to $58 to pay for the checks, Willis said. Opposition to the fingerprint requirement eventually led to it being removed from the bill, Willis said. A different version calling for increasing the FOID fee from $10 every 10 years to $20 for a five-year license and creation of a special fund to help Illinois State Police track down FOID revocations passed the Illinois House but failed in the Senate in the closing days of its spring session, she said. “We’re going to continue to work on the bill,” Willis said. “We are going to continue to reach across the aisle and with law enforcement to see if we can work with the bill in its current form or if there’s some tweaking we can make to it. We’re hopefully going to bring it back.” “This is a complex issue,” Ziman said, of passing stronger gun laws. It’s “interwoven with Second Amendment rights and Fourth Amendment rights. We’re technically at odds with two Constitutional amendments,” she said. The Second Amendment discusses the right to bear arms while the Fourth Amendment prohibits unlawful searches and seizures. Those are two important Constitutional principles, McMahon said. “The issue of public safety naturally butts up against the two. There’s this friction between those two concerns. We want privacy. We want to be safe in our home. We don’t want to go into your home, but we realize there are times we have to,” he said. Byrd said that the State Police are “not trying to infringe on anyone’s Second Amendment rights. What we want is compliance.” Police want to focus on the illegal firearms that are in the hands of people who can’t get a FOID card, he said. Improving access to mental health services was another topic among the panelists. The Elgin Police Department and the Aurora Police Department have both invested in training officers in crisis intervention, but there needs to be funding in crisis stabilization units in the area, McMahon said. Police officers faced with a person having a mental health crisis have the option of making an arrest and transporting him or her to jail or diverting the person to the emergency room, which can’t handle people having a mental health episode, McMahon said. There needs to be a facility where specially trained mental health professionals can evaluate a person and find a long-term solution to help, he said.

Milo Yiannopoulos, the openly gay alt-right figure, has been selected by the secretive group that has planned the controversial parade in Boston. As the New York Daily News reported, the group Super Happy Fun America had planned the parade in Boston ""on behalf of the straight community,"" and initially used the name and image of Hollywood star Brad Pitt. The actor reportedly made it clear to organizers that they were not allowed to use his image, so they were then replaced on the organization's website with ""censored"" and ""redacted"" signs. Instead, the group selected British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos to serve as Pitt's replacement. In a statement on its website, the organization included a quote from Yiannopoulos saying the parade was open to anyone who stands in solidarity with the ""oppressed"" heterosexuals. ""This parade is a gift to anyone, male or female, black or white—gay and transgender allies, too!—who will stand with us and celebrate the wonder and the majesty of God's own heterosexuality. Men, bring your most toxic selves. Women, prepare to burn your briefcases! Because it's great to be straight, and we're not apologizing for it any more. We're Here, Not Queer,"" the statement read. The parade has come under fire from many, calling it a mockery of LGBT pride parades in which these communities stand up against oppression. The ""straight pride"" parade is set to take place during Pride Month, a nationwide celebration of the LGBT community that coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City, which is widely considered a seminal moment in the gay rights movement.'Straight pride' group removes Brad Pitt as mascot after actor threatens it with legal actionhttps://t.co/PptcpmXSuz— ETimes (@etimes) June 7, 2019Milo Yiannopoulos has been known for controversial statements about the LGBT community, including claims that transgender people suffer from a ""psychiatric disorder.""

277,https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/06/08/ap-fact-check-trump-and-the-credit-and-blame-game,"By HOPE YEN, SETH BORENSTEIN and CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press   WASHINGTON (AP) — The apportioning of credit and blame went awry in President Donald Trump’s remarks over the past week. He hailed pristine air quality that isn’t, placed responsibility on Mexico for the entire U.S. drug problem and told Puerto Ricans they should love him because he got them hurricane aid that he’s actually been complaining about for months. In the Democratic presidential campaign, meantime, Trump was accused of breaking a gun-control promise that in reality he kept. A week in review: DISASTER AID TRUMP, on signing a relief bill for multiple U.S. disasters: “Puerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me, they would have been shut out!” — tweet Thursday.   THE FACTS: That’s not likely. The $19.1 billion disaster aid bill, passed by the House on Monday and signed into law by Trump on Thursday, ordinarily would have been approved by Congress months ago. But Trump injected himself into the debate, demanding that money for hurricane-rebuilding efforts that was sought by Puerto Rico’s elected officials, Republicans and Democrats both, be kept out. Trump frequently inflated the amount of aid that Puerto Rico had obtained in previous bills and feuded with the island’s Democratic officials. Congressional Democrats held firm in demanding that Puerto Rico, a territory whose 3 million people are U.S. citizens, be helped by the measure. The legislation ultimately included more money for Puerto Rico, about $1.4 billion, than Democrats originally sought.   The relief measure delivers money to states in the South suffering from last fall’s hurricanes, Midwestern states deluged with springtime floods and fire-ravaged rural California, among other disasters. ___ NATO TRUMP: “We were paying so much. I think we were really paying close to 100% of NATO. So we were paying to protect all of these European nations. And it’s just not fair.” — interview Thursday with Fox News. THE FACTS: It’s not true that the U.S. was paying “close to 100%” of the price of protecting Europe. NATO does have a shared budget to which each member makes contributions based on the size of its economy. The United States, with the biggest economy, pays the biggest share, about 22%.   Four European members — Germany, France, Britain and Italy — combined pay nearly 44% of the total. The money, about $3 billion, runs NATO’s headquarters and covers certain other civilian and military costs. Defending Europe involves far more than that fund. The primary cost of doing so would come from each member country’s military budget, as the alliance operates under a mutual defense treaty. The U.S. is the largest military spender but others in the alliance obviously have armed forces, too. The notion that almost all costs would fall to the U.S. is false. In fact, NATO’s Article 5, calling for allies to act if one is attacked, has only been invoked once, and it was on behalf of the U.S., after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.   ___ DRUGS TRUMP: “Look, I’m dealing with Mexico right now. They send in $500 billion worth of drugs, they kill 100,000 people, they ruin a million families every year if you look at that. That’s really an invasion without the guns. … 100,000 people are killed, dead every year, from what comes through our southern border. They shouldn’t be allowing people to come through their country from Central, from Honduras and Guatemala, El Salvador.” — Fox News interview Thursday. THE FACTS: Trump is inflating the death toll from drug overdoses — more than 70,200 in 2017 — and wrongly blaming all the known deaths on Mexico. Tens of thousands of those deaths have nothing to do with Mexico or Central America. They are from legally made prescription opioids, fentanyl laboratories in China or other sources of international drug smuggling and illicit manufacturing in the U.S. More than 17,000 of the deaths in 2017, for example, were from prescription opioids alone.   Mexico is indeed a significant conduit in the drug trade — it’s a leading source of heroin, for example — but it is hardly the only one. ___ CLIMATE CHANGE TRUMP, asked if he believes in climate change: “I believe that there’s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways.” — interview with Piers Morgan that broadcast Tuesday. THE FACTS: Trump is once again conflating weather and climate, suggesting that global warming can’t be happening if it gets cold outside. But weather is like mood, which changes daily. Climate is like personality, which is long term. The data show Trump also is wrong in that there is a clear one-way warming trend. Earth is considerably warmer than it was 30 years ago and especially 100 years ago.   So far in this decade, there have been 301,292 daily heat records set in the contiguous United States, compared with only 141,892 daily cold records set, according to retired Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton’s analysis of government temperature records. That’s more than two heat records broken for every cold record, a ratio that is the largest of any decade since these types of records started in the 1920s. According to Walton’s analysis, each decade since the 1970s has had a higher hot record-to-cold record ratio than the decade before it. And that’s just the extreme weather. When it comes to global average temperature, April was the 412th consecutive warmer month than the 20th century average, according to records kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   The last five years — 2014 to 2018 — have been the five hottest years on record globally, according to those records. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have been in the past 15 years with records going back to 1880. The White House in November produced the National Climate Assessment by scientists from 13 Trump administration agencies and outside scientists. “Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,” the report said. ___ TRUMP: “We have the cleanest air in the world in the United States, and it’s gotten better since I’m president. We have the cleanest water. It’s crystal clean and I always say I want crystal clean water and air. … We’re setting records environmentally.” — remarks Wednesday with Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.   THE FACTS: The U.S. does not have the cleanest air, and it hasn’t gotten better under the Trump administration. U.S. drinking water is among the best by one leading measure. Trump’s own Environmental Protection Agency data show that in 2017, among 35 major U.S. cities, there were 729 cases of “unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution.” That’s up 22% from 2014 and the worst year since 2012. The Obama administration, in fact, set records for the fewest air polluted days, in 2016. In 2017, after Trump took office, the number of bad air days per metropolitan area went up 20%. The State of Global Air 2019 report by the Health Effects Institute rated the U.S. as having the eighth cleanest air for particle pollution — which kills 85,000 Americans each year — behind Canada, Scandinavian countries and others.   The U.S. ranks poorly on smog pollution, which kills 24,000 Americans per year. On a scale from the cleanest to the dirtiest, the U.S. is at 123 out of 195 countries measured. On water, Yale University’s global Environmental Performance Index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water, the U.S. among them. On environmental quality overall, the U.S. was 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1. ___ GILLIBRAND ON GUN CONTROL SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, Democratic presidential candidate, on Trump: “Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we are going to ban the bump stocks’? Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.”’— Fox News town hall on June 2.   THE FACTS: Not true. Trump kept his promise. A nationwide ban took effect in March on bump stocks, the attachment used by the gunman in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre to make his weapons fire rapidly like machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives outlawed the attachments at Trump’s direction after the shootings killed more than 50 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It is the only major gun restriction imposed by the federal government in the past few years. The Trump administration’s move was an about-face for the bureau. In 2010, under the Obama administration, it found that the devices were legal. But under the Trump administration, officials revisited that determination and found it incorrect.   After the Las Vegas shootings, the National Rifle Association initially said “devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” After the bureau’s ruling banning the devices, however, the gun lobby called it “disappointing” and said it should have provided amnesty for gun owners who already have bump stocks. The government estimates that more than 500,000 bump stocks were sold after they were made legal in 2010. ___ VETERANS TRUMP, on the late Sen. John McCain: “I was not a fan. I didn’t like what he did with health care. I didn’t like how he handled the veterans. Because I got them Choice. He was always unable. He was on committees and could have done it.” — interview Tuesday with Morgan.   THE FACTS: Not so. McCain did, in fact, get the Veterans Choice program passed in Congress. Trump repeatedly claims falsely that he was the first president in decades to get such a private-sector health program passed. But what Trump actually got done was an expansion of the Choice program achieved by McCain and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the main lawmakers who advanced the legislation signed by President Barack Obama. McCain, an Arizona Republican, co-sponsored the legislation following a 2014 scandal at the VA medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for medical appointments. Trump signed the law expanding the program in June 2018. It is named after three veterans who were lawmakers — McCain, Daniel K. Akaka and Samuel R. Johnson.   After helping to pass the program, McCain fought to expand it even more in his last months before dying of brain cancer in August. The original Choice program allowed veterans to see doctors outside the Department of Veterans Affairs system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility. Under the expansion, which took effect Thursday, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes. Still, the VA says it does not expect a major increase in veterans seeking care outside the VA under Trump’s expanded program, partly because wait times in the private sector are now typically longer than at VA.   ___ LONDON PROTESTS TRUMP: “I kept hearing that there would be ‘massive’ rallies against me in the UK, but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me.” — tweet Wednesday. TRUMP: “I heard that there were protests. I said: ‘Where are the protests? I don’t see any protests.’ I did see a small protest today when I came, very small, so a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. …And I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago and it was a very, very small group of people.” — news conference Tuesday with British Prime Minister Theresa May.   THE FACTS: The protests over Trump’s visit were more than just “very, very small,” and some were hard to miss. Thousands of protesters crowded London’s government district, chanting as he met May nearby. While police erected barricades to stop protesters from marching past the gates of Downing Street, they could be heard as Trump and May emerged from the prime minister’s official residence to pose for photos before their news conference. The protests included a giant Trump baby balloon and a robotic likeness of Trump sitting on a golden toilet, reciting familiar Trump phrases like “No collusion” and “You are fake news.”   ___ BREXIT TRUMP, referring to how he stood at his Scottish golf resort, Turnberry, on the eve of the Brexit referendum and predicted the British would vote to leave the European Union: “I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened.” — news conference Tuesday. THE FACTS: He often tells this false story. Trump did not predict Brexit the day before the vote. Three months before the vote, he did predict accurately that Britain would vote to leave the EU. The day after the 2016 vote — not the day before — he predicted from his Scottish resort that the EU would collapse because of Britain’s withdrawal. That remains to be seen.   ___ TRANSGENDER TROOPS TRUMP, explaining his ban on transgender troops in the military: “In the military, you’re not allowed to take any drugs …People were going in and then asking for the operation, and the operation is $200,000, $250,000, and getting the operation, the recovery period is long, and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that …You can’t do that.”  — interview Tuesday with Morgan. THE FACTS: Trump has offered no substantiation for the assertion that transgender military members represent tremendous medical costs and disruption. A Rand Corp. study found otherwise. Nor does the military bar troops from using prescription drugs.   Rand estimates that out of about 1.3 million active-duty military personnel, 2,450 are transgender. Only a subset would seek transition-related care, such as hormone therapy and sex-reassignment surgery. Based on private insurance data, the study estimates a minimal increase in costs from such care for the active-duty armed forces — no more than 0.13%, or $8.4 million annually. As for disruption, members representing less than 0.1% of the total force would seek transition-related care that could affect their deployments, the study says. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Andrew Taylor and Darlene Superville in Washington, Lisa Marie Pane in Boise, Idaho, Nicky Forster in New York, and Jill Lawless and Kevin Freking in London contributed to this report.   ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR’S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

279,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/6aF0ARgUq50/,"Friday on HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher warned Democrats about making gun control a 2020 presidential campaign issue. The left-wing comedian said he didn’t “like” guns, but recognized their necessity. “I don’t like guns. Have some, don’t like them, have it for an emergency, like an antibiotic,” he said. “But some people do. Lots of people do, and their view is, ‘Yes there is a violence problem with guns, but not me. And you’re going after me.'” Maher pointed to Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) unveiling a gun control proposal on CNN, but lacking an answer as to how his proposal would have stopped the mass shooting in Virginia Beach, VA last week. He then said that the issue could be one that would cost Democrats politically in the long-run, and advised those on the left, including 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to “learn” about guns. “First of all, liberals should learn more about guns,” he said. “I don’t know much about guns because, again, I don’t care, I don’t like them, but I hear this from gun people.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor 2nd AmendmentClipsEntertainmentBill MaherCharles BlowGunsHBOReal Time .

Alexandrea Ocasio-Cortez sparred with an FBI counterterrorism official over what she characterized as a double standard when law enforcement charges domestic terrorists inspired by global jihad differently than white supremacists unaffiliated with foreign terrorist groups. In a congressional hearing last Tuesday, the freshman New York Democrat suggested Muslims are treated differently in the U.S., including being charged with terrorism for criminal acts, while white supremacists are not. Michael McGarrity, assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism unit, disagreed.  This hearing was wild.First the FBI witness tried to say I was wrong. I tried to be generous + give benefit of doubt, but then we checked. I wasn’t.Violence by Muslims is routinely treated as “terrorism,” White Supremacist violence isn’t.Neo-Nazis are getting off the hook. https://t.co/RCjp4687by  Ocasio-Cortez referred to the Dec. 2, 2014 mass shooting at a San Bernardino, California health department holiday party where 14 people were killed and another 22 injured. The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan, a U.S.-born citizen of Pakistani descent, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, a Pakistani-born legal permanent resident, were referred to by the FBI as “homegrown violent extremists” inspired by foreign terrorist groups. However, when Dylann Roof, then 21, killed nine African Americans on June 17, 2015 in a Charleston, South Carolina church during a prayer meeting, or when 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. careened his car into crowd of counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed and another 19 were injured, neither incident was characterized as domestic terrorism, but rather as hate crimes. “You’re not going to find a charge of domestic terrorism out there,” McGarrity said. With regard to the San Bernardino shooting, McGarrity added, “They were likely charged with, if there was a connection to a foreign terrorist organization, it would likely fall under 18USC23, A or B.”  The city council in Iowa City approved the first consideration of a hate crime ordinance in the city, directly in response to a number of hateful acts in recent years. https://t.co/IgSXayOA9e  “Doesn’t it seem like because the perpetrator [was] Muslim…that the designation would say it’s a foreign organization?” Ocasio-Cortez said McGarrity repeatedly interjected, “No. No. That is not correct.” “Homegrown violent extremists, who we, most of the people we arrest in the United States, homegrown violent extremists: self-radicalized, born in the U.S., doesn’t matter what religion…” Ocasio-Cortez interrupted, “But the Orlando Pulse Club shooter meets those qualifications…he was homegrown and self-radicalized.” McGarrity ultimately admitted white supremacist violence is not considered domestic terrorism because “the United States Congress doesn’t have a statute for us for domestic terrorism like we do on a foreign terrorist organization like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabab.” McGarrity also agreed white supremacy was a global issue. Ocasio-Cortez went on to ask if McGarrity could see how the discrepancy in how similar acts are codified differently in U.S. law based on the origin of the perpetrator, “even if unintentional,” may result in similar crimes being pursued in vastly different ways and ultimately resulting in differential outcomes.",2019-06-08 17:36:21,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez News: Why Isn't White Supremacist Violence Treated Like Terrorism?,"politics and government,religion and churches,islam,terrorism,crime and criminals",41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

This is outrageous! What is the judge’s magic number for throwing the book at a rapist? 10, 20, 50, 100? One is too many. Period. McClusky showed his total lack of integrity, complete disregard for honorable jurisprudence and his ingrained misogyny. He should be disbarred. Richard Smith; Melvindale, Mich. More: Judge James McClusky gave no jail time to man who raped 14-year-old girl. Now people want him removed Letter to the editor: I, along with many others, am outraged that Judge McClusky felt that an appropriate sentence for raping a young girl was probation. No jail time for raping a 14-year-old girl whom the 26-year-old knew from his route as a school bus driver. This rapist had a job around children and violently took advantage of one of them, yet this judge didn’t think that crime merited jail time. What message does this send to young women about their value in our society? This isn’t justice. Marilyn Latham; San Francisco Letter to the editor: Reading President Donald Trump’s highly critical tweet of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, where he said “(Khan) is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me,” as Trump arrived in London just adds another description for the president: disgracefully rude. More: Editorial cartoons on anything and everything Everyone above the age of 5 has been taught how to be a proper guest and not rudely criticize your host when they have graciously welcomed you to their home. The president’s criticism of the London mayor, the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and others is even more appalling compared with the magnanimous graciousness offered by Queen Elizabeth! Marla Allard; Washington, D.C. Letter to the editor: I get it, many Americans don’t like President Donald Trump. What I don’t get is their refusal to support him when he is actually helping Americans. Especially on immigration. I have seen photos, videos, etc., of people illegally crossing our southern border for years. That “blindness” has led to about 12 million undocumented immigrants in our country. Why is that happening? Is it the president’s fault? Simply stated, Congress doesn’t seem to want to act on this issue! Talker: Aiding migrants can get you 20 years in Donald Trump's America Congress has the responsibility to protect all Americans, but it refuses to do so. There is just no excuse for Congress to avoid doing its job. Our president seems to be the only one willing to take a pro-America stance. Don’t blame our president for filling in. Tom Tyschper; Gilbert, Ariz. Letter to the editor: Anthony Marcum argues in his USA TODAY column that the Senate’s prioritization of judicial confirmations has led to less legislation being passed and undermines the independent judiciary. This analysis is misguided. The Senate’s duty is to maintain checks and balances. An abdication of this role would lead to more judicial activism. Talker: Mitch McConnell cedes Senate powers for political standing While Marcum is correct that “policy is not the job of the courts,” he is wrong about the solution. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham understand that the administration’s judicial nominees can help restore the proper role of the judiciary in our constitutional scheme. A bigger problem is that Congress cedes power to executive agencies as an easy substitute for writing clear legislation. This is a problem that the judiciary can fix. Ashley Baker, director of public policy at The Committee for Justice; Washington, D.C. Letter to the editor: The horrific and deadly mass shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach on Friday has left all of us in Hampton Roads reeling in pain and disbelief. Hours after the workplace shooting, Mayor Bobby Dyer said, “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.” This shooting comes on the heels of a Memorial Day block party shooting in Chesapeake. Before that, a 13-year-old boy died from a fatal shooting that occurred on Mother’s Day in Norfolk.

284,https://nypost.com/2019/06/09/trump-left-his-mexico-critics-stunned-speechless-and-other-commentary/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Opinion By Post Editorial Board Submit June 9, 2019 | 4:35pm From the right: Trump Stuns His Critics on Mexico In The Washington Post, Hugh Hewitt writes: “Because President Trump emerges as a clear winner from his week-long confrontation with Mexico over our neighbor’s lax enforcement of its southern border, reflexive Trump critics will scramble to find some way of containing what is a clear Trump triumph.” The warnings over permanent damage to bilateral relations and investor freak-outs didn’t pan out, which left the president’s opponents “flailing about” and denying the obvious. But, says Hewitt: Such antics say “nothing about Trump and much about those critics.” 2020 watch: Trump’s African-American Bet President Trump won a decent 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 by urging African-Americans to take a gamble on him. Now he is telling them they have “a lot” to lose by voting against him in 2020, given the criminal-justice reforms and historic jobless rates he’s delivered, notes Philip Wegmann at RealClearPolitics. “The campaign knows that gaining majority support is impossible,” but Trump needs only to garner a little more black support than he did last time — or prevent the Democratic nominee from rallying the community. Democrats hope the black community believes accusations of racism against Trump, but the president’s team is working to win black voters who deride him publicly but secretly appreciate his policies. Wegmann concludes: “A second term for Trump hinges on this silent black majority.” Culture critic: Chill Out With Mary Jane Alarmism In recent years, “there has been a steady, uninterrupted trend toward decriminalization and outright legalization” of marijuana, observes Jesse Singal at City & State New York. But “longstanding fears about the risks of using cannabis” have also returned. While the scientific evidence is far from conclusive, opponents of pot legalization can’t help painting “an exaggerated caricature of marijuana’s effects,” Singal contends. Most notably, supposed links between legalization or consumption and an increase in violent crime and homeless rates remain largely unsubstantiated. Until we discover more definitive answers, it’s important to fill the “vacuum of solid research” with “common sense, the science we do have and future research — not with fear mongering.” Iconoclast: Tucker Carlson Is the Future of the GOP The “discontent that Trump tapped into and unleashed in 2016” still simmers, The Week’s Damon Linker suggests, and “the man who may well be best positioned to catalyze” the party’s long-term transformation might just be Tucker Carlson. Whether or not the Fox News personality has presidential ambitions, “the direction he’s been pushing on his show” ­reflects the ideology now ascendant on the right. It combines traditionalist values with the “sweeping attacks on big business” typically associated with the left. That’s not to say that a Tucker-ized GOP will compromise with Democrats: “The culture wars” over immigration, diversity and family values that “have metastasized on both sides of the political spectrum will continue to be a sharp point of contrast between the two parties.” Linker points out that Sen. Liz Warren embodies a leftist analogue to Carlson’s politics, and the two versions of the ideology are likely to go head-to-head “over the next few election cycles.” Libertarian: Cowardice Isn’t a Crime A judge recently approved an arrest warrant targeting former Broward County Sheriff’s Deputy Scot Peterson, who neglected to intervene in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Peterson’s behavior was clearly cowardly, but to call it criminal “seems like a stretch,” says Reason’s Jacob Sullum. Most of the charges “are novel applications of laws that are generally invoked in very different contexts.” The warrant is based on the assumption that Peterson “could have prevented several murders if he had done what he was supposed to do,” which may or may not be true. It places Peterson in the role of a caregiver and suggests he was obligated to risk his life. Sullum explains the “unprecedented” case comes down to whether Peterson “had a legal duty that went beyond what would be required of a mother who is afraid to get between her violent husband and the child he is beating.” — Compiled by Ashley Allen & Sohrab Ahmari Read Next When Albany plays Santa, hold on to your wallet Share Selection This story has been shared 59,371 times.

285,https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/06/10/ap-fact-check-no-sign-of-trump-mexico-deal-on-farm-goods,"By HOPE YEN, JILL COLVIN and CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bragging about a new deal with Mexico that provides for “large” sales of U.S. farm goods, but it doesn’t appear to exist. In weekend tweets, he announced in all capital letters that he had won the agreement to benefit America’s “great patriot farmers,” and that U.S. sales would begin “immediately.” There isn’t any sign of that happening, however. Mexican officials denied that anything on agriculture was included in the deal on border security reached Friday to avert Trump’s threatened tariffs. Trump also unfairly placed responsibility on Mexico for the entire U.S. drug problem, even though many of the known drug deaths have nothing to do with the country.   The statements came in a week where the apportioning of credit and blame often went awry in Trump’s remarks. He hailed pristine air quality that isn’t, wrongly insisted that the U.S. was paying “close to 100%” of NATO and told Puerto Ricans they should love him because he got them hurricane aid that he’s actually been complaining about for months. In the Democratic presidential campaign, meantime, Trump was accused of breaking a gun-control promise that in reality he kept. A look at recent claims and reality: MEXICO DEAL TRUMP: “MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!” — tweet Saturday, retweeted Sunday.   THE FACTS: There’s no evidence that Mexico agreed to “large” purchases of agricultural products from the U.S. as part of the deal to avoid tariffs. Nor did the White House provide any details to show such a deal exists. The joint declaration between the U.S. and Mexico released by the State Department late Friday makes no mention of agriculture. Officials from Mexico deny an agreement was reached on farm goods as part of the talks. “Everything that was negotiated was in the joint statement,” said a Mexican official familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. When Mexico’s ambassador to the United States, Martha Barcena, was asked repeatedly Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” whether there was a new agricultural deal, she demurred, saying such trade between both countries should increase over time.   She referenced instead the potential impact of the separate United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which has yet to be approved by Congress. “Is trade on agricultural products going to grow? Yes, it is going to grow, and it is going to grow without tariffs and with USMCA ratification,” Barcena said. According to the office of the United States Trade Representative, Mexico bought $20 billion in U.S. agricultural goods last year, making it the United States’ second-largest ag export market. ___ TRUMP: “Look, I’m dealing with Mexico right now. They send in $500 billion worth of drugs, they kill 100,000 people, they ruin a million families every year if you look at that. That’s really an invasion without the guns. … 100,000 people are killed, dead every year, from what comes through our southern border. They shouldn’t be allowing people to come through their country from Central, from Honduras and Guatemala, El Salvador.” — Fox News interview Thursday.   THE FACTS: Trump is inflating the death toll from drug overdoses — more than 70,200 in 2017 — and wrongly blaming all the known deaths on Mexico. Tens of thousands of those deaths have nothing to do with Mexico or Central America. They are from legally made prescription opioids, fentanyl laboratories in China or other sources of international drug smuggling and illicit manufacturing in the U.S. More than 17,000 of the deaths in 2017, for example, were from prescription opioids alone. Mexico is indeed a significant conduit in the drug trade — it’s a leading source of heroin, for example — but it is hardly the only one.   ___ DISASTER AID TRUMP, on signing a relief bill for multiple U.S. disasters: “Puerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me, they would have been shut out!” — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: That’s not likely. The $19.1 billion disaster aid bill, passed by the House on Monday and signed into law by Trump on Thursday, ordinarily would have been approved by Congress months ago. But Trump injected himself into the debate, demanding that money for hurricane-rebuilding efforts that was sought by Puerto Rico’s elected officials, Republicans and Democrats both, be kept out. Trump frequently inflated the amount of aid that Puerto Rico had obtained in previous bills and feuded with the island’s Democratic officials.   Congressional Democrats held firm in demanding that Puerto Rico, a territory whose 3 million people are U.S. citizens, be helped by the measure. The legislation ultimately included more money for Puerto Rico, about $1.4 billion, than Democrats originally sought. The relief measure delivers money to states in the South suffering from last fall’s hurricanes, Midwestern states deluged with springtime floods and fire-ravaged rural California, among others. ___ NATO TRUMP: “We were paying so much. I think we were really paying close to 100% of NATO. So we were paying to protect all of these European nations. And it’s just not fair.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.   THE FACTS: It’s not true that the U.S. was paying “close to 100%” of the price of protecting Europe. NATO does have a shared budget to which each member makes contributions based on the size of its economy. The United States, with the biggest economy, pays the biggest share, about 22%. Four European members — Germany, France, Britain and Italy — combined pay nearly 44% of the total. The money, about $3 billion, runs NATO’s headquarters and covers certain other civilian and military costs. Defending Europe involves far more than that fund. The primary cost of doing so would come from each member country’s military budget, as the alliance operates under a mutual defense treaty.   The U.S. is the largest military spender but others in the alliance obviously have armed forces, too. The notion that almost all costs would fall to the U.S. is false. In fact, NATO’s Article 5, calling for allies to act if one is attacked, has only been invoked once, and it was on behalf of the U.S., after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ___ CLIMATE CHANGE TRUMP, asked if he believes in climate change: “I believe that there’s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways.” — interview with Piers Morgan that broadcast Tuesday. THE FACTS: Trump is once again conflating weather and climate, suggesting that global warming can’t be happening if it gets cold outside. But weather is like mood, which changes daily. Climate is like personality, which is long term.   The data show Trump also is wrong in that there is a clear one-way warming trend. Earth is considerably warmer than it was 30 years ago and especially 100 years ago. So far in this decade, there have been 301,292 daily heat records set in the contiguous United States, compared with only 141,892 daily cold records set, according to retired Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton’s analysis of government temperature records. That’s more than two heat records broken for every cold record, a ratio that is the largest of any decade since these types of records started in the 1920s. According to Walton’s analysis, each decade since the 1970s has had a higher hot record-to-cold record ratio than the decade before it.   And that’s just the extreme weather. When it comes to global average temperature, April was the 412th consecutive warmer month than the 20th century average, according to records kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The last five years — 2014 to 2018 — have been the five hottest years on record globally, according to those records. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have been in the past 15 years with records going back to 1880. The White House in November produced the National Climate Assessment by scientists from 13 Trump administration agencies and outside scientists. “Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,” the report said.   ___ TRUMP: “We have the cleanest air in the world in the United States, and it’s gotten better since I’m president. We have the cleanest water. It’s crystal clean and I always say I want crystal clean water and air. … We’re setting records environmentally.” — remarks Wednesday with Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. THE FACTS: The U.S. does not have the cleanest air, and it hasn’t gotten better under the Trump administration. U.S. drinking water is among the best by one leading measure. Trump’s own Environmental Protection Agency data show that in 2017, among 35 major U.S. cities, there were 729 cases of “unhealthy days for ozone and fine particle pollution.” That’s up 22% from 2014 and the worst year since 2012.   The Obama administration, in fact, set records for the fewest air polluted days, in 2016. In 2017, after Trump took office, the number of bad air days per metropolitan area went up 20%. The State of Global Air 2019 report by the Health Effects Institute rated the U.S. as having the eighth cleanest air for particle pollution — which kills 85,000 Americans each year — behind Canada, Scandinavian countries and others. The U.S. ranks poorly on smog pollution, which kills 24,000 Americans per year. On a scale from the cleanest to the dirtiest, the U.S. is at 123 out of 195 countries measured. On water, Yale University’s global Environmental Performance Index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water, the U.S. among them. On environmental quality overall, the U.S. was 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.   ___ GILLIBRAND ON GUN CONTROL SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, Democratic presidential candidate, on Trump: “Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we are going to ban the bump stocks’? Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.”’— Fox News town hall on June 2. THE FACTS: Not true. Trump kept his promise. A nationwide ban took effect in March on bump stocks, the attachment used by the gunman in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre to make his weapons fire rapidly like machine guns.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives outlawed the attachments at Trump’s direction after the shootings killed more than 50 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It is the only major gun restriction imposed by the federal government in the past few years. The Trump administration’s move was an about-face for the bureau. In 2010, under the Obama administration, it found that the devices were legal. But under the Trump administration, officials revisited that determination and found it incorrect. After the Las Vegas shootings, the National Rifle Association initially said “devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” After the bureau’s ruling banning the devices, however, the gun lobby called it “disappointing” and said it should have provided amnesty for gun owners who already have bump stocks.   The government estimates that more than 500,000 bump stocks were sold after they were made legal in 2010. ___ VETERANS TRUMP, on the late Sen. John McCain: “I was not a fan. I didn’t like what he did with health care. I didn’t like how he handled the veterans. Because I got them Choice. He was always unable. He was on committees and could have done it.” — interview Tuesday with Morgan. THE FACTS: Not so. McCain did, in fact, get the Veterans Choice program passed in Congress. Trump repeatedly claims falsely that he was the first president in decades to get such a private-sector health program passed. But what Trump actually got done was an expansion of the Choice program achieved by McCain and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the main lawmakers who advanced the legislation signed by President Barack Obama.   McCain, an Arizona Republican, co-sponsored the legislation following a 2014 scandal at the VA medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for medical appointments. Trump signed the law expanding the program in June 2018. It is named after three veterans who were lawmakers — McCain, Daniel K. Akaka and Samuel R. Johnson. After helping to pass the program, McCain fought to expand it even more in his last months before dying of brain cancer in August. The original Choice program allowed veterans to see doctors outside the Department of Veterans Affairs system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility. Under the expansion, which took effect Thursday, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.   Still, the VA says it does not expect a major increase in veterans seeking care outside the VA under Trump’s expanded program, partly because wait times in the private sector are now typically longer than at VA. ___ LONDON PROTESTS TRUMP: “I kept hearing that there would be ‘massive’ rallies against me in the UK, but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me.” — tweet Wednesday. TRUMP: “I heard that there were protests. I said: ‘Where are the protests? I don’t see any protests.’ I did see a small protest today when I came, very small, so a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. …And I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago and it was a very, very small group of people.” — news conference Tuesday with British Prime Minister Theresa May.   THE FACTS: The protests over Trump’s visit were more than just “very, very small,” and some were hard to miss. Thousands of protesters crowded London’s government district, chanting as he met May nearby. While police erected barricades to stop protesters from marching past the gates of Downing Street, they could be heard as Trump and May emerged from the prime minister’s official residence to pose for photos before their news conference. The protests included a giant Trump baby balloon and a robotic likeness of Trump sitting on a golden toilet, reciting familiar Trump phrases like “No collusion” and “You are fake news.”   ___ BREXIT TRUMP, referring to how he stood at his Scottish golf resort, Turnberry, on the eve of the Brexit referendum and predicted the British would vote to leave the European Union: “I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened.” — news conference Tuesday. THE FACTS: He often tells this false story. Trump did not predict Brexit the day before the vote. Three months before the vote, he did predict accurately that Britain would vote to leave the EU. The day after the 2016 vote — not the day before — he predicted from his Scottish resort that the EU would collapse because of Britain’s withdrawal. That remains to be seen.   ___ TRANSGENDER TROOPS TRUMP, explaining his ban on transgender troops in the military: “In the military, you’re not allowed to take any drugs …People were going in and then asking for the operation, and the operation is $200,000, $250,000, and getting the operation, the recovery period is long, and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that …You can’t do that.”  — interview Tuesday with Morgan. THE FACTS: Trump has offered no substantiation for the assertion that transgender military members represent tremendous medical costs and disruption. A Rand Corp. study found otherwise. Nor does the military bar troops from using prescription drugs.   Rand estimates that out of about 1.3 million active-duty military personnel, 2,450 are transgender. Only a subset would seek transition-related care, such as hormone therapy and sex-reassignment surgery. Based on private insurance data, the study estimates a minimal increase in costs from such care for the active-duty armed forces — no more than 0.13%, or $8.4 million annually. As for disruption, members representing less than 0.1% of the total force would seek transition-related care that could affect their deployments, the study says. ___ Associated Press writers Peter Orsi and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City, Seth Borenstein, Andrew Taylor, Matthew Perrone and Darlene Superville in Washington, Lisa Marie Pane in Boise, Idaho, Nicky Forster in New York, and Jill Lawless and Kevin Freking in London contributed to this report.   ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR’S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

286,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/602906642/0/phoenix/nation~Black-Hills-yaks-serious-senioritis-on-campus-Pony-Express-News-from-around-our-states/,"Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama gave back a philanthropist’s $26.5 million donation and took his name off its law school Friday, a week after he called on students to boycott the institution over the state’s new abortion ban. Hugh F. Culverhouse Jr., a 70-year-old Florida real estate investor, said he has no doubt the board of trustees acted in response to his remarks, and he bitterly complained that the state of Alabama is only reinforcing its reputation as “the land of the backward,” full of “hicks.” University officials emphatically denied the decision had anything to do with Culverhouse’s stand on the abortion law and said it was prompted instead by his attempts to dictate how the money should be spent. They did not elaborate. Within minutes of the trustees’ vote, a maintenance crew had removed his name from the building. Fairbanks: Wildlife authorities are warning residents in the state’s interior to beware of hares. Alaska Department of Fish and Game veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen says tularemia is showing up in hares. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports tularemia can be transmitted to dogs and cats that mouth or catch sick hares. The disease is spread by bacteria through hare and vole ticks. It’s most often seen in summer, when ticks are most active. Late stages of the disease can make hares slow and easy to catch by pets. People can become infected by handling hares or coming into contact with an infected pet’s saliva. The most common symptoms in people and pets are lethargy, high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be fatal if untreated but cured with antibiotics if diagnosed quickly. Phoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed legislation Friday that would have tripled the amount state lawmakers receive for each day they work. Ducey said such a change shouldn’t apply to current lawmakers but rather should kick in only after the next election. Lawmakers in both parties backed the proposal, saying rural lawmakers especially are undercompensated for their costs of traveling to and staying in Phoenix during the session. They also noted that changes to federal tax law eliminated many write-offs for expenses. Ducey seemed to take a dim view of boosting expense payments for lawmakers who live in the Phoenix area but noted that “Arizona is the sixth largest state in terms of land area” and said that for certain legislators living farther away, “there is a strong case to be made” for adjusting the stipend. Little Rock: The state Supreme Court has cleared the way for an 88-year-old bridge to be demolished. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the court’s 6-1 decision dismissed an appeal Thursday to save the White River Bridge in Clarendon. An Arkansas Department of Transportation spokesman says a demolition timeline will be established within four weeks. The bridge and its replacement are in wildlife sanctuaries on the White and Cache rivers overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The department has agreed to restore the site’s natural topography and re-establish native hardwood trees. Supporters of the bridge have been rallying to preserve and adapt it for cyclists and pedestrians. Los Angeles: Three architect-led teams will compete for the job of leading master planning for renovation of the city’s famed La Brea Tar Pits. Officials of the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County announced the beginning of the long-term initiative Thursday. The Tar Pits are an active Ice Age excavation site that has yielded millions of fossils including saber-toothed cat, dire wolf and mastodon skeletons, as well as samples of plants, small animals and insects that give researchers insight into 50,000 years of history. In addition to being an active paleontological research facility, the Tar Pits receive more than 400,000 visitors each year. The teams competing to reimagine the 12-acre campus are Dorte Mandrup of Copenhagen, Weiss/Manfredi of New York and Diller Scofidio + Renfro of New York. Colorado Springs: Fort Carson officials say they are working to improve housing at the military installation after a report documented poor maintenance and squalid conditions. The Gazette reports a survey by the Military Family Advisory Network found problems at more than 160 military locations in the U.S. but recorded the most complaints – 147 – at Fort Carson. According to the survey, 63% of Fort Carson respondents said their units needed better maintenance, repairs or remediation. Fort Carson’s garrison commander, Col. Brian Wortinger, says nearly 11,000 work orders have been submitted since mid-February, with all but 500 completed. He says the company overseeing housing has hired two resident engagement specialists, two quality control supervisors and a specialist to improve communications with residents. Newtown: A festival was held Saturday to raise money for an animal sanctuary that is being built to honor the memory of a 6-year-old Sandy Hook School shooting victim. The 5th annual Catherine’s Butterfly Party on the Fairfield Hills Campus in Newtown was to include children’s activities, wildlife demonstrations, food trucks, music and pet adoptions. It was hosted by the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary. The 34-acre sanctuary is being built to honor Hubbard, who was among 26 people killed inside the Sandy Hook School in December 2012. It is being designed to provide rescue and support services for companion animals, farm animal refuge, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, and educational programming. New Castle: Separation Day commemorates the state’s independence from Great Britain and Pennsylvania, but over the weekend it also brought the community of New Castle together with visitors and local nonprofits. “Is a very important patriotic event for Delaware. It is almost like the Independence Day,” said Cindy Snyder, site manager of the New Castle Courthouse Museum. The 244th anniversary of Delaware’s independence drew thousands to Old New Castle on Friday and Saturday, with a barbecue contest, children’s activities, a parade, fireworks and more. Snyder said the event was slated to see almost 10,000 attendants throughout the two days of celebration, especially during the Saturday concert and fireworks. Washington: Tourists may find it harder to get that perfect snap of the White House after construction begins on a new 13-foot fence, almost double its current height, to help keep intruders out. The Secret Service says a $64 million construction project will begin soon on what eventually will be a 13-foot, 1-inch fence with wider and stronger pickets. The existing fence stands about 6 feet, 6 inches tall. The agency, which protects the president, declined to discuss details of the state-of-the-art features it says will be part of the new barrier. The National Park Service, which provides care and upkeep for the White House and its 18 acres of grounds, has also been involved in the project. Active construction, once it begins in the summer, is expected to continue into 2021, the Secret Service said. Tallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Friday that creates more hurdles for citizens to change the state Constitution through petition drives. The bill requires paid petition gatherers to register with the secretary of state, outlaws paying gatherers based on the number of signatures they collect and creates fines if petitions aren’t turned in within 30 days. The petitions also must include the name and permanent address of the gatherer. Democrats said that will discourage people from collecting petitions in an already difficult amendment process. Republicans said it will help prevent fraud and keep out-of-state interests from meddling with the Constitution. Last year an amendment restored voting rights for most felons once they’ve completed their sentences. In 2016 an amendment legalized medical marijuana. Rome: Classes are optional for hundreds of seniors expected to transfer to the serene campus of Berry College next summer. And once they settle in, they plan to never leave. But cut them some slack: The seniors in question are in their 70s and 80s, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The private liberal arts institution is leasing land on its Rome campus to a nonprofit for a retirement complex now under construction. The college also provided seed funding for the complex. With the opening of The Spires next summer, 350 senior residents will be just a third of a mile from the main part of campus. They’ll be welcome to roam the college’s more than 40 miles of trails, hang out in the student center, attend school football games or concerts, and take classes for free, space permitting. Wailuku: State officials say an introduced caterpillar and moth native to Southeast Asia is eating indigenous plants on Maui that provide important habitat for native species. The Maui News reports a biologist looking for native snails in October noticed signs of unfamiliar caterpillars feeding on mamaki leaves. The caterpillar and moth turned out to be the Ramie moth. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources says it then received reports of the bug from across the island. The Ramie moth is laying its eggs on several plants in the nettles family, such as mamaki and akolea. These plants are food sources for the Kamehameha caterpillar and are valued by Native Hawaiians for their fiber and medicinal qualities. It’s the first documented sighting of the caterpillar in the U.S. Boise: The U.S Air Force says a federal lawsuit seeking to halt coordinated urban air- and ground-training exercises over nine cities in southern Idaho should be dismissed. The Air Force says in documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court that it did not abuse its discretion when giving the OK for up to 160 training events per year. The military says air support for ground forces has been increasingly required in urban combat areas. The training in Idaho involves aircraft flying over cities, including the capital, Boise, and communicating with service members dressed as civilians on the ground to identify targets with low-power lasers. The lawsuit filed by area residents contends that the Air Force did not do enough to inform the public and that the training endangers residents’ health, safety and quality of life. Champaign: A group is recommending that the University of Illinois erect a plaque or monument to commemorate the history of Chief Illiniwek, the mascot who was dropped amid much criticism in 2007. The Chancellor’s Commission on Native Imagery says the site outside Memorial Stadium, as well as a public retirement, could provide “healing and reconciliation.” The group also recommends regular activities involving the university and Native Americans who consider Illinois their ancestral home. A student dressed as Chief Illiniwek performed a traditional dance at sporting events, running the entire 100-yard football field. But many people called the portrayal offensive and would not watch. The university stopped using the chief in 2007. Albany: The former headquarters of the company that oversees licensing for the lasagna-loving cartoon cat Garfield will be auctioned off this month. PAWS Inc. employees have moved out of the complex in this eastern Indiana town, but the business is still in operation, with workers now working from home. Garfield creator Jim Davis donated PAWS Inc.’s former headquarters to the Ball State University Foundation, which will receive the proceeds from the June 24-26 online auction of two parcels totaling 19 acres. The property includes a nearly 43,000-square-foot main facility, a free-standing studio building, warehouse and maintenance buildings, and a commercial greenhouse. PAWS Inc. was founded by Davis in 1981 to support Garfield’s licensing and handle creative and business concerns. Dubuque: The cities of Dubuque, Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa have been awarded federal grants to clean up and redevelop contaminated sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last week that the cities had been selected to receive $1.6 million in brownfield grants. They’re among 149 communities nationwide selected to receive 151 grant awards totaling nearly $65 million. Dubuque will receive $800,000 to revitalize areas across the community, including sites in the South Port, Washington Neighborhood and North End neighborhoods. Fort Dodge is getting $500,000 to clean up the Wahkonsa Annex contaminated with inorganic contaminants, and Oskaloosa will get $300,000 to promote investment in existing neighborhoods, encourage cleanup and reuse contaminated property. Topeka: The state is asking anyone who bought a rhododendron plant at Walmart stores in the state since April to destroy them. The Kansas Department of Agriculture reported Friday that confirmed cases of the sudden oak death disease have been found in rhododendrons sold at 60 Walmarts in Kansas and one Home Depot in Pittsburg. The plant disease has infected trees and native plants in California and Oregon and has also been identified in 10 Midwestern states. It is the first time the disease has been noted in Kansas. The diseased plants sold in Kansas originated from the Park Hill Plants nursery in Oklahoma. The plants must be destroyed because there is no cure for the disease. The plants should be burned or double-bagged and thrown away. The root ball should also be thrown out. The disease poses no risk to humans or animals. Louisville: Officials have unveiled new branding for the city’s airport to go along with a renaming to honor Muhammad Ali. Mayor Greg Fischer and Ali’s widow, Lonnie, unveiled a new logo and designs at the airport during a ceremony Thursday. The Airport Authority Board voted in January to change the airport’s name to the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. The logo shows a silhouette of Ali with arms raised against a butterfly. Officials say the butterfly pays homage to Ali’s famous phrase “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and the context of flight for the airport. The unveiling took place as part of the city’s Ali Week, which is held the first week of June to mark the passing of Ali, who died in 2016. Shreveport: From a falling facade to broken windows, the historic Arlington Hotel in the city’s downtown has been vacant since 1990. But for the first time in decades, the old building will soon see new life. KTBS-TV reports the Metropolitan Planning Commission has voted to approve a special use permit for the Larsen Family LP to turn the former hotel into a distillery, a French-style restaurant and a speakeasy bar. The man behind the project is Shreveport architect Kevin Bryan. It will be called Every Man a King Distilling. The name stems from famed Louisiana senator and former Gov. Huey Long, nicknamed the Kingfish. While seeking re-election in 1930, Long promised to make every man a king. It was a message voters had never heard before. Augusta: The state now has an official ballad that commemorates a unit that fought during the Civil War. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on Friday legislation that named the “Ballad of the 20th Maine” as the state’s official ballad. The ballad was performed at the Statehouse by the group known as The Ghost of Paul Revere. NewsCenterMaine reports the ballad tells the story of the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment through the eyes of Litchfield soldier Andrew Tozier as the unit joined the 20th Maine, which fought valiantly at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War. Mills says the ballad reminds Mainers about important the role state played in the nation’s history. Maine already has a separate state song and state march. Annapolis: Four top executives of the University of Maryland Medical System’s board have resigned amid the continuing investigation into board financial arrangements that led Baltimore’s previous mayor to resign. The Baltimore Sun reports the resignations announced Thursday include chief administrative officer Jerry Wollman, chief compliance officer Christine Bachrach, chief performance improvement officer Keith Persinger and the system’s primary lawyer, Megan Arthur. The changes are effective June 21. Former Mayor Catherine Pugh was a former board member who left her mayoral post last month amid investigations into whether she sold self-published books to the system to disguise hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. Three other members resigned last month, including former board chairman Stephen Burch. Boston: Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has signed a bill providing $200 million to cities and towns for local infrastructure projects. The so-called Chapter 90 funds were given final approval by the Democratic-controlled Legislature last week. Baker said in a statement Friday that the state money is critical for cities and towns for highway construction, road paving and other projects. Under the program, communities submit receipts to the state for reimbursements for costs associated with eligible infrastructure projects. The state Department of Transportation verifies the expenses are eligible for reimbursement. The Baker administration says more than $1.1 billion in Chapter 90 funds have been given since the governor took office in 2015. Eau Claire: The polar vortex that enveloped much of the Midwest early this year nearly wiped out the peach crop in southwestern Michigan, according to experts. Some of the region’s apricot, plum and apple crops may also be affected after the blast of polar air plummeted temperatures to minus 20 degrees in late January, breaking water pipes and ice-jamming bridges in areas around the state. Bill Shane, a tree fruit specialist at Michigan State University, told the South Bend Tribune that Michigan’s southwestern counties will suffer millions of dollars in losses from damage to fruit crops. The polar vortex also may have shortened the life span of trees that were severely damaged, he said. Thief River Falls: Rural communities in the state are scrambling to recruit and retain workers as baby boomers reach retirement age. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that electronic component distributor Digi-Key is among the companies testing innovative strategies to attract workers at all stages of their lives. The Thief River Falls business plans to add 1,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. The expansion plans come during a decade when Pennington County’s over-65 population is estimated to rise from about 18% to 27%. Digi-Key pitches higher starting salaries and low-cost health insurance. But the distributor also offers flexible schedules, training, an onsite medical office, and buses from Crookston and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Jackson: The governor is asking that the federal government declare a fisheries disaster as water from a Mississippi River spillway gushes into what’s normally a saltwater estuary. The unprecedented second opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway last month also has an increasing number of Mississippi officials demanding a voice in when the spillway is opened. That’s because the freshwater from the river that streams through Louisiana’s Lake Pontchartrain and into the Mississippi Sound is bad for oysters, shrimp, crabs and other saltwater-loving seafood. Gov. Phil Bryant announced Friday that he had made the request, releasing a May 31 letter to U.S Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Bryant says 70% of the Mississippi Sound’s already imperiled oyster population is estimated to be dead, with the crab catch down by 35%. Kansas City: Voters in the city will decide Nov. 5 whether to keep a historic city boulevard named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The City Council on Thursday approved an initiative petition seeking to change the nearly 10-mile boulevard’s name back to The Paseo, which it has been called since 1899. That comes after the council voted in January to rename the street, ending a long campaign by black pastors and the local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to name a street in the city for King. A grassroots group opposed to the name change quickly formed and gathered more than 2,800 signatures on petitions to put the issue on the ballot – far more than the 1,700 needed. That made Thursday’s council vote a procedural matter. Helena: Federal, state, local and tribal fire managers say they’re ready for the upcoming fire season, but they stopped short of predicting how many acres might burn. After discussing this winter’s snowpack, runoff, temperature trends and expected weather patterns, meteorologist Colleen Haskell said most of the state has “normal” potential for significant wildfires. Northwestern Montana’s potential is “above average.” Haskell cautioned that wasn’t suggesting how many acres would burn, just conditions that could lead to fires. Sudden drought and thunderstorms are less predictable. Agency heads told Gov. Steve Bullock on Friday their personnel were trained, their equipment was ready, and they were prepared to work together to fight fires. Officials suggested more resources needed to go into preventing catastrophic fires such as conducting prescribed burns, forest management and community preparation. Lincoln: Visitors to two state historical parks can see a reenactment of the Pony Express this week. The rides will take place Tuesday and Wednesday at Rock Creek Station and Fort Kearny state historical parks. Each year, members of the National Pony Express Association re-create the Pony Express with a commemorative ride over 10 days. Riders carry letters over the original trail. The 1,966-mile, eight-state event is conducted 24 hours a day until the mail is delivered. Riders will hand the letters to a fresh team at Rock Creek Station State Historical Park near Fairbury at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. Another handoff will take place at Fort Kearny State Historical Park at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Free biscuits and gravy will be available for visitors at 5:45 a.m. Las Vegas: A new state law allowing the Silver State to test out a limited marijuana banking system is expected to bring some relief to the state’s booming cannabis industry, where dispensaries and other businesses are forced to deal in cash. The measure, signed into law Wednesday by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, would let the state treasurer’s office set up a three-year pilot program for cannabis businesses. State Treasurer Zach Conine, who pushed for the program, said the system would try to remove the large amounts of cash that Nevada’s pot industry must deal with and instead set up an online system where digital currency could be sent and received. Conine likened the system to gift cards or digital wallet apps like Venmo and said the program would not include broader banking services like loans. Littleton: Fans of Pollyanna have something to be extra glad about this year – a state law recognizing the eternally optimistic fictional character. Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill last week designating the second Saturday in June “Pollyanna of Littleton New Hampshire Recognition Day.” Eleanor H. Porter, author of the 1913 book “Pollyanna,” lived in Littleton, where a bronze statue of the beloved character welcomes visitors. The town has been hosting “Pollyanna Glad Day” in June for years. Saturday’s event featured a pancake breakfast, a celebration near the sculpture, a sing-along and a walking tour. The event’s motto is “Be Glad. Be Cheerful. Eat Cake!” Salem: A 600-year-old oak tree known as the tallest in the state has uprooted. The Salem oak came down Thursday evening, drawing people to mourn its loss. The Salem Religious Society of Friends owns the tree and a graveyard that surrounds it. Society member Jim Waddington tells NJ.com the tree has been in declining health over the past 100 years despite efforts to preserve it. The group will meet to decide what to do with the remains. It is believed Quaker John Fenwick, who brought the first English settlement to West Jersey in 1675, brokered a treaty with a Native American tribe under the tree’s branches. The Environmental Protection Department said it was the largest white oak in New Jersey. Albuquerque: Police are investigating damage to a rainbow-colored crosswalk created in honor of Albuquerque Pride after videos emerged of several motorcyclists trying to deface it. One video posted online shows dozens of bikers riding along Route 66 before a couple of them take turns burning rubber over the crosswalk, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Another biker appears to suffer a blowout from the effort and duckwalks his bike to the curb, its back tire flopping around on the rim. “The facts will determine the appropriate charges, including whether damages amount to misdemeanor or felony charges,” Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said Thursday. The crosswalk was just days old at the time of the episode, having been installed in honor of Pride Week and the city’s LGBT community. New York: With Puerto Rican pride on full display along Fifth Avenue, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday that he’s appointing a commission to oversee the construction of a memorial in Manhattan’s Battery Park City to victims of the 2017 storm. This year, for its 62nd iteration, the parade sought to promote the economic development needed for the island to fully get back on its feet. Grand marshal Ricky Martin, the singer known for his stint in Menudo and his hit “Livin’ La Vida Loca,” was celebrated alongside his foundation, dedicated to fighting human trafficking. As New York City marks Pride Month, the parade paid posthumous tribute to Sylvia Rivera, an LGBTQ rights activist who took part in the Stonewall rebellion 50 years ago this month. Others honored in the parade were singers La India and Jose Feliciano, golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez and Hall of Fame-bound baseball slugger Edgar Martinez. Wilmington: The Coastal Land Trust has completed the purchase of one of its “Top 40” priority conservation projects on the state’s coast. Trust officials said in a news release Friday that the group purchased more than 700 acres along the banks of the Neuse River across from the city of New Bern. The trust then transferred the property to the state for management by the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. They say the area’s significant natural resources made it a priority for the trust to save. The property’s resources include freshwater marsh, cypress-gum swamp, and forests of bottomland hardwoods, loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Funding for the purchase came from state and federal agencies and grants. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed. Fargo: The idea for the next Fortnite or Risk could come from a group of game developers meeting at a video game store here. KVRR-TV reports Kyle Weik started the group Fargo Game Makers to help other game designers develop their ideas into products. Members meet once a month at Replay Games. Weik owns startup game studio Beach Interactive in Fargo. He says it can be difficult to follow through on developing a game when you’re doing it alone. He says he’s enjoyed seeing how members have shaped their games since the group started nearly five years ago. Davin Loegering is among the game designers who have brought their ideas to the group. He’s getting close to releasing his first board game, Imagine Majesty. Loegering says it’s helpful to discuss the game and gauge people’s reactions. Columbus: An arts district that Ohio State University envisions as the new “front door” to its Columbus campus is a step closer to reality. A committee of university trustees late last month approved $147 million for design services and construction for a project estimated to cost $162 million. The Columbus Dispatch reports the district would be located near 15th Avenue and High Street. Plans include a renovated Weigel Hall to house the School of Music, as well as a new building for the Department of Theatre that will house a Moving Image Production program. Renderings shared with the trustees’ Master Planning and Facilities committee showed a new black box theater, a recital hall for the School of Music, a proscenium theater and rehearsal spaces. Oklahoma City: Medical marijuana sales are continuing to climb in the state, topping $23 million in May and marking the eighth straight month of growth for the new industry. Figures from the Oklahoma Tax Commission show the state collected more than $1.6 million in May from the 7% excise tax on marijuana. Another $2 million was collected in state and local sales taxes. To date, medical marijuana sales have generated nearly $10.7 million for state coffers. Sales have grown significantly each month since dispensaries began selling cannabis in October. The number of people eligible to obtain the drug also is continuing to skyrocket. The Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority says it has approved nearly 130,000 patient licenses since August. Salem: Wildlife commissioners have approved the state’s long-overdue Wolf Management Plan after years of revisions, contentious meetings, an outside mediator and half the stakeholders abandoning talks. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the plan, meant to govern how wolves are handled in areas of the state where they don’t enjoy federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, was approved Friday by the commission of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The state’s first wolf plan was issued in 2005 before any wolves had come back to the state after decades of extirpation due to hunting and trapping. The plan’s second version came out in 2010. The plan finally approved Friday came after hunters and ranchers squared off with environmentalists and wolf advocates over when, why and by whom wolves can be killed. Fort Indiantown Gap: The lieutenant governor is opening the pool in the official residence he doesn’t use to children who typically wouldn’t have access to one. Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced Friday the new access to the pool at the State House. The residence is on National Guard property, about 25 miles from Harrisburg. Fetterman’s wife, Gisele, will run a program to teach water safety and coordinate wider use of the 30-by-40-foot pool. Any Pennsylvania group can request to swim there, but it must provide its own transportation and lifeguard. General Services built a ramp for disabled access, patched the pool, built a lifeguard stand and painted safety messages. Two diving boards were removed, and the pool basin was repainted. The site has a small picnic pavilion, changing rooms and bathrooms. Warwick: Rhode Islanders have commemorated their ancestors’ role in helping spark the American Revolution. The annual Gaspee Days celebration began Saturday with a road race and a parade marking the 247th anniversary of the burning of a British ship – a daring act of rebellion that happened more than a year before the Boston Tea Party. On Sunday, costumed actors planned to recreate the June 9, 1772, torching of the HMS Gaspee by setting fire to a smaller model of the ship. Historians say the Gaspee’s burning was an important, if relatively little-known, event that helped touch off America’s war for independence from Britain. A local ship captain lured the schooner into shallow waters in Narragansett Bay a few miles south of Providence, where it ran aground. Charleston: The state is warning beachgoers to beware after a small number of Portuguese man-of-wars have been sighted. News outlets report the state Department of Natural Resources says people should avoid making contact with the highly venomous creatures – even if they’re dead. Experts say a dead man-of-war can create a sting strong enough to require medical attention. Authorities say the sting to humans is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly. The creatures, which are marine hydrozoans and relatives of jellyfish, have recently been spotted on Sullivan’s Island and in Hilton Head. The DNR says the man-of-wars are pushed ashore by strong winds and have recently washed onto beaches from Florida to North Carolina. Rapid City: An area farmstead is raising animals more accustomed to the cold, high-altitude areas of Tibet and central Asia. The Rapid City Journal reports that Julie and Jim Smoragiewicz are raising 10 yaks at their Pennington County business, Yak Ridge Cabins and Farmstead. Julie Smoragiewicz says the yaks enjoy climbing the Black Hills, where they can cool down in creeks and under trees. The animals may get too hot in other areas of South Dakota. They also turn yak milk into soap and use their hides and fiber for throws and rugs. Smoragiewicz calls yaks sustainable animals because they eat less food and create less waste than cattle. The animals can also give birth on their own. She says yaks have unique personalities, and they’re fun to be around. Clarksville: There tends to be lots of laughter in the home of DJ and Shanieke Pryor – after all, DJ is a professional stand-up comedian.But now, thanks to a video that’s gone viral of DJ and their 19-month old son Kingston Jierre chatting up a storm about the season finale of the TV show “Empire,” much of the world is laughing alongside them. The two say they shot the video about a month ago. It shows DJ lounging on the couch watching TV, with his young son sitting beside him, seemingly striking up a conversation about the show. “They need to work on that, right?” Pryor starts out by saying. “Yes,” Kingston says decidedly. “Did you understand it, though?” Pryor asks the child. Kingston responds: “No.” They go on to have a full-fledged “talk” filled with hand gestures and gibberish. Finally, DJ tells his son: “That’s exactly what I was thinking! We think a lot alike.” Dallas: Fifty years after desegregation separated classmates at Booker T. Washington Technical High School, the class of 1969 turned its recent reunion into a belated convocation. The Dallas Morning News reports although some alumni had graduated from the all-black trade school, others had begun the process of desegregating the Dallas Independent School District by attending historically white schools closer to their own homes. Dozens of former students of the class of 1969 gathered to share memories in the state-of-the-art auditorium behind what is now Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. The celebration also honored students who would have graduated in 1970 had officials not closed the school that year. Their unofficial commencement ceremony came complete with red-ribboned diplomas and candles to honor friends who had died. Magna: A gathering at the Great Salt Lake in hopes of making it into the record books fell way short. Utah park officials invited people to a beach on the lake’s south end Saturday in an attempt to set the world record for the largest number of people floating together, unassisted, in a line at one time. The lake’s high salinity makes it easy to float on the water. According to the Guinness World Records website, Argentina holds the current record after 1,941 people successfully floated together on the surface of Lago Epecuen de Carhue in 2017. Utah State Parks manager Jim Wells said only about 300 people showed up for Saturday’s event, but “everybody had fun, (and) it ended up being a beautiful day.” Springfield: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is urging anglers and others not to disturb spawning sea lamprey in the Connecticut River and some of its tributaries. They are not to be confused with a separate population of sea lamprey that are controlled as a nuisance species in Lake Champlain. The department says sea lamprey spawn each spring in the main stem of the Connecticut River and in many tributaries. Officials say adult sea lamprey die shortly after returning to freshwater to spawn. The department says the larval lamprey live in freshwater for a few years burrowed in sandy substrate. At age 5, they move downstream to the ocean, where they feed on fish as parasites. Richmond: The governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after a recent, deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who announced the date Friday, says the best way to respond to the May 31 mass shooting at a municipal building is with “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on silencers. Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can’t dictate how it’s conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they’ve said they’ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes. Seattle: What should the city do with its public golf courses and the 528 acres of mostly green space they occupy? That’s a question being asked by the city, which commissioned a study looking at the future of the city’s municipal courses, the Seattle Times reports. Mayor Jenny Durkan insists it’s a question that has not been answered but said, “It would be a breach of our duty to the people of Seattle not to be really looking at what is best use of those golf courses, from everything to continuing as golf courses, to finding a way to use part of them as parks, to use part of them for affordable housing.” No one is suggesting, yet, that Seattle ditch one or more of its courses, but the fact that it’s even a topic of conversation has golfers worriedly making the case for their sport. Morgantown: A West Virginia University robotics team has won a NASA competition for the second time in three years. The college on Friday announced the team’s win in NASA’s Moon to Mars Ice & Prospecting Challenge. WVU’s Mountaineer Ice Driller Automated System III beat out other machines made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stevens Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech. The contest has the drilling systems extracting water from a test bed of ice, rock and soil. The competition is meant to help inform approaches for space exploration and development. Madison: Flying a gay pride rainbow flag over the state Capitol for the first time Friday drew backlash from conservatives, including a pair of state lawmakers, who said it was divisive, while Democrats hailed it as a sign of inclusivity. The flag flap erupted after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers ordered the raising of the flag to recognize June as “Pride Month.” The move drew a fast rebuke from state Rep. Scott Allen, who tweeted, “Is this any more appropriate than erecting the Christian flag over the Capitol?” Democrats praised the raising of the flag, including state Sen. Tim Carpenter, one of five openly gay state lawmakers. Dozens of people stood outside the Capitol’s east wing Friday afternoon and cheered as the flag was raised on a pole just below the U.S. and Wisconsin flags. Yellowstone National Park: The park has recorded its third-busiest visitation during the month of May as the park began opening up for the busy summer tourist season. The National Park Service says the park recorded 434,385 visits last month. The total is 2.8% less than May 2018, which was the busiest May on record. So far in 2019, Yellowstone has counted more than 576,700 visits, which is up 1% from the same five-month period last year. The park in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho typically sees its most visitors during the summer months.

287,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-guns/supreme-court-rebuffs-bid-to-expand-legal-protections-for-gun-silencers-idUSKCN1TB1PD?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Lawrence Hurley 4 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid to widen legal protections for gun silencers in a case involving two Kansas men convicted for failing to register the devices as required by federal law, as the justices again sidestepped a chance to rule on the scope of the right to bear arms. The justices declined to hear appeals by the two men, Shane Cox and Jeremy Kettler, and left in place their convictions in cases brought by federal prosecutors. The men had asked the court to decide whether silencers - muzzle attachments that suppress the sound of a gunshot - are covered by the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The court’s action came in the aftermath of a May 31 mass shooting in the Virginia coastal city of Virginia Beach in which a gunman who killed 12 people used weapons including a handgun equipped with a silencer. President Donald Trump, a Republican with a close relationship to the National Rifle Association pro-gun lobby, said in an interview aired on June 5 that he does not like silencers and would be open to considering banning the devices. His administration this year imposed a ban on “bump stock” attachments that enable semi-automatic weapons to be fired rapidly, with the Supreme Court in March permitting the policy to take effect. Kettler and Cox were prosecuted together in 2014 after Kettler purchased a silencer from Cox’s military surplus store in Chanute, Kansas. Both were prosecuted under a federal law called the National Firearms Act, which requires registration of certain firearms, with silencers included in a list of covered items along with grenades, machine guns and bombs. Cox was convicted of possessing an unregistered silencer as well as an unregistered short-barreled rifle and transferring unregistered silencers. Kettler was convicted of possessing an unregistered silencer. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld both men’s convictions last year, prompting them to appeal to the Supreme Court. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear its biggest gun rights case since 2010, taking up a challenge to New York City’s strict limits on handgun owners transporting their firearms outside the home. New York officials are considering revising the measure, which may lead to the Supreme Court case becoming moot before the justices hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October. The court in recent years has been reluctant to take up gun cases and has yet to decide whether the Second Amendment protects a right to carry guns in public, a question left unanswered in its two most recent gun-related decisions. In its 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller ruling, the court held that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual right to bear arms. In its 2010 McDonald v. City of Chicago ruling, the court held that the earlier ruling applied to the states. The court currently has two appeals pending that ask for the justices to rule that the right to bear arms extends outside the home, as well as two other gun-related cases. The justices may be waiting for the New York case to be resolved before deciding what moves to take on the other cases.

Mina, now the Orange County, Fla., sheriff, says after the attack, police officers were equipped with another layer of body armor that stops rifle rounds. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) ORLANDO, Fla. – Only days before the third anniversary of the worst attack on gay people in the U.S., members of central Florida's congressional delegation said Monday they were introducing legislation that would designate as a national memorial the gay nightclub where 49 people were massacred by a supporter of the Islamic State. U.S. Reps. Darren Soto and Stephanie Murphy, both Democrats, said at a ceremony outside the former nightclub that the designation will preserve and protect Pulse for future generations and give it the federal recognition it deserves. It will be three years on Wednesday that gunman Omar Mateen opened fire at the Orlando gay nightclub on Latin night. Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, was killed in a shootout with police after a three-hour standoff inside Pulse. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. However, the mass shooting in 2017 along the Las Vegas Strip became the deadliest when 58 people were killed. Pulse owner Barbara Poma has established a nonprofit to open a memorial and museum at the site. About $14 million has been raised for the $50 million project. Six design firms have been selected as finalists and the winner will be chosen in the fall. The permanent memorial and museum are scheduled to open in 2022. Soto said the national memorial designation would allow the Pulse site to become part of the national park system while still allowing for the nonprofit to maintain control over it. Also backing the bill is U.S. Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. ""This is an important step in preserving an LGBT historic landmark at a time when many of these sites are being destroyed,"" Soto said. After the ceremony, several of the participants joined other activists at the local Supervisor of Elections office to present 103,000 petitions supporting a constitutional amendment on the 2020 ballot to ban the sale of assault weapons in Florida. A petition must be signed by 766, 200 voters in at least 14 congressional districts to appear on an election ballot. Once 10 percent of that threshold is met, it can be sent to the Florida Supreme Court for review. Organizers from the Ban Assault Weapons Now coalition said that important threshold was met Monday. The coalition is made up of survivors and family members of victims of the Pulse shooting and the massacre at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in Parkland, Florida. The ceremony at Pulse was interrupted briefly by the mother of Christopher ""Drew"" Leinonen, who was killed at the nightclub. Christine Leinonen began shouting at Poma when she came to the speaker's podium. Two police officers escorted her out of the ceremony, and they were followed by two state lawmakers and a city commissioner who talked to Leinonen for several minutes while the ceremony continued. Afterward, Leinonen blamed Poma for inadequate security at the nightclub. Authorities say an extra-duty police officer working at the nightclub fired at Mateen from two locations outside Pulse, but didn't pursue him inside. Last year, some survivors and victims' relatives, including Leinonen, filed a federal lawsuit, claiming the city and police didn't do enough to try to stop the shooter. The lawsuit was dismissed in November, but the survivors and families are appealing. Leinonen and other families also have sued Poma and her husband for negligence and wrongful death in state court and that lawsuit is pending. ""My son's blood is on her hands, and she's walking around like she's the hero,"" said Leinonen, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. ""This is Orlando. This is where everyone wants to be in a fairy tale. Well, guess what? My son wasn't in a fairy tale. My son was in a real-life horror movie."" When asked later about what Leinonen had said, Poma said, ""Christine is a grieving mom. Everyone does it differently, and this is a rough week for every mother, every survivor and every first responder."" ____ Follow Mike Schneider at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

289,https://www.gazettenet.com/gun-violence-Massachusetts-general-26181136,"Attorney General Maura Healey spoke at the opening of Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Gun Violence Prevention Monday alongside Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was one of 26 victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. SHNS/Katie Lannan Speaker Robert DeLeo said Reps. Liz Miranda, Chynah Tyler, Andy Vargas, and Dan Cullinane, clockwise from top left, are ""hard at work"" on the issue of preventing youth gun violence.  SHNS/Sam Doran BOSTON — Doctors and state officials on Monday called for a focus on addressing the causes of gun violence as well as its aftereffects as they marked the opening of a new gun violence prevention center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Peter Masakios, an MGH surgeon who will lead the Center for Gun Violence Prevention with Dr. Chana Sacks, said the approach doctors take to stemming gun deaths and injuries should be no different than past efforts to prevent deaths from car crashes and smoking. ""We have been trained to care for the worst traumatic injuries in some of the worst circumstances to save lives, and we are doing this well,"" Masiakos told a crowd who gathered on the hospital's campus Monday morning. ""However, many of my fellow health care providers believe that we are not only in the business of preventing death after injury. We also share a special obligation to better understand the causes, the social determinants, of these injuries, and to prevent them from occurring in the first place."" House Speaker Robert DeLeo suggested youth gun violence as one specific area lawmakers will explore, saying Reps. Chynah Tyler, Liz Miranda, Andy Vargas and Dan Cullinane ""are already hard at work on this issue."" ""Legislation relating to firearms and supporting behavioral health among young people will be part of our discussion as we move forward,"" he said. ""This session we expect further conversation on what we can do in Massachusetts on our legacy of progress strengthening our gun laws."" After the event, DeLeo told the News Service he did not have any specific bill in mind at this point in the two-year term. ""But some of the members have spoken to me that they have ideas in terms of how we can better what we've done here in Massachusetts, and so I told them that we're looking forward to discussing it with them,"" he said. On the heels of a 2014 reform that gave police chiefs more discretion over gun licensing, Massachusetts in 2017 banned bump stocks like the ones used in the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and last year passed a ""red flag"" law that allows family members to petition the courts to suspend gun ownership rights of someone they believe to be a danger. ""Looking ahead, we're looking into how we can better trace weapons, deal with weapons and guns from out of state, and support ongoing efforts to ensure safe and supportive schools,"" DeLeo said. DeLeo said afterwards he thinks the conversation about preventing gun violence ""is going to be an ongoing issue, unfortunately very similar to the opioid discussion that we're having."" Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins called gun violence a ""public health epidemic"" and said that there have been 17 homicides, including 14 with guns, in the six months she has been in office. She told Mass. General officials she would be a ""loud and active"" partner in their efforts. ""Guns steal more lives than any other weapon combined, and that number doesn't even begin to quantify the harm that gun violence inflicts on communities,"" she said. Dr. Monica Bharel, the state public health commissioner, said her department is for the first time ""explicitly addressing gun violence through a public health and racial equity lens."" She said a black youth in Massachusetts is 32 times more likely to be hospitalized for a firearm injury than their white counterpart. ""Where you live or the color of your skin should not determine whether you develop asthma any more than it should determine whether you face premature death as a consequence of gun violence,"" Bharel said. Earlier this month, the DPH awarded a two-year, $700,000 grant to Lowell's UTEC Inc. to establish a Gun Violence Training Center for Excellence to help 10 community organizations create pilot prevention programs in neighborhoods with higher rates of gun violence. The new Massachusetts General center will focus on research, clinical care, education and community engagement, according to the hospital, which provided $1.2 million in seed funding. Harvard Medical School is providing an additional $200,000. Sacks, one of the center's two directors, is a cousin of Mark Barden, whose son 7-year-old Daniel was one of the 20 students killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. After that shooting, Sacks said, she ""witnessed the worst pain I've ever seen up close."" She said the issue of gun violence breaks down into four different problems -- the mass shootings that ""grip our national attention""; the homicides and assaults that disproportionately affect communities of color and ""way too often don't make the news""; unintentional injuries; and suicides, which she categorized as ""the least talked-about type of gun violence."" Mark Barden, who spoke alongside Attorney General Maura Healey, said he was ""filled with so much hope that families won't be having to endure the pain that our families will endure forever thanks to the good work that's being done today."" The event occurred the morning after retired Red Sox legend David Ortiz was shot in the Dominican Republic. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh told reporters after the event that he expected Ortiz would be transported to Boston for further treatment ""when the time is right"" and that he looked forward to ""seeing him at Fenway Park, standing on the mound and getting the crowd loving him.""

290,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/10/supreme-court-rejects-challenges-to-gun-silencer-laws-days-after-virginia-beach-massacre/,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request to take up a pair of cases challenging a federal law requiring the registration of gun silencers mere days after a gunman used one in a shooting rampage in Virginia Beach which left 12 people dead. The justices, in an order issued without comment or recorded dissent, said they would not take up the cases of two Kansas men challenging the National Firearms Act of 1934 after they were convicted for failing to register their gun silencers, firearm attachments designed to suppress the sound of a gunshot. The two men — Shane Cox and Jeremy Kettler — had separately appealed their convictions to the nation's highest court and asked the justices to consider if gun silencers are protected under the Second Amendment. They argued that their constitutional right ""to keep and bear arms"" includes silencers. President Donald Trump reportedly asked the court to stay out of the case and leave the convictions in place. Cox, owner of ""Tough Guys"" army-surplus store, was convicted of manufacturing and selling unregistered silencers, while Kettler was convicted of possessing one. The two men were sentenced to one year of probation. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld both of their convictions last year, ruling that a silencer is not a ""bearable"" arm protected by the U.S. Constitution. The National Firearms Act requires individuals to register silencers and pay a federal tax of about $200 ""upon the manufacture, importation or transfer of an NFA firearm."" In the wake of the May 31 mass shooting in Virginia, Trump said he would ""think about"" banning noise suppressors. ""I'd like to think about it. I mean nobody's talking about silencers very much,"" he said. ""I'm going to seriously look at it. I don't love the idea of it."" Trump has faced criticism throughout his White House tenure over a lack of action to curb gun violence, despite the epidemic of mass shootings and the rising number of deaths from firearm injuries in the U.S. ""What's happening is crazy. It's crazy what's going on with schools and not only in our country,"" Trump said earlier this month when asked about recent gun violence. There have been 165 mass shootings in country in 2019, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Trump, who recently spoke at the National Rifle Association convention, has defended guns. ""Gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger,"" he told NRA supporters in April. Following a mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival in October 2017, which killed 59 people and injured at least 527 others, the White House banned bump stocks, a device prominently used in the massacre, which allows a semi-automatic to work like a machine gun. Trump had urged the federal government to ban bump stocks after the Valentine's Day shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 dead. The president, at the time, also vowed to take action to limit gun violence, noting his support for raising the age for purchasing a firearm. Trump, however, ultimately walked back his support for raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms after he met with NRA leaders who forcefully opposed that proposal, along with Trump's earlier endorsement of universal background checks for gun purchases.

293,https://www.bustle.com/p/the-black-mirror-smithereens-ending-is-ambiguous-but-its-message-couldnt-be-clearer-17991741,"Entertainment  Black Mirror is known for its bleak, dystopian messages about humanity's fraught relationship with technology, and in the newly released fifth season, ""Smithereens"" is by far the most depressing episode. It begins with distraught app user Chris (Andrew Scott) taking a young intern named Jaden (Damson Idris) hostage, then builds to a tense standoff with police. The ""Smithereens"" ending cuts to black before we can see which of the two men were hit by the single gun shot that closes the episode, but ultimately, it doesn't matter; the final scene may be ambiguous, but Black Mirror's messaging couldn't be clearer. The series usually relies on a piece of exaggerated technology in order to create a social critique: simulation dating apps, a personality rating system, real-life censorship controls. In ""Smithereens,"" the tech is much more mundane but immediately recognizable: the big bad here is social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. As police pressure Chris to surrender, he reveals over the phone to Smithereen CEO Billy Bauer (Topher Grace) that the reason he kidnapped Jaden was to talk to Billy and ensure he understands the damage his platform has done to his life. Both Chris and his fiancÃ©e Tamsin were obsessive Smithereen users, and Chris' inability to keep from glancing at new updates on his timeline proved to be life-destroying. While he was driving late at night, Chris got a notification that someone liked a comment he made on their dog photo. When he glanced down to check it, the distraction caused a car crash that killed Tamsin. Billy is mostly speechless, admitting that he doesn't know how to reign in his own company now that it's become so big and stockholders are constantly demanding new user engagement goals, but Chris cuts him off; he doesn't want answers or even solutions to lessen the platform's addictive nature. He just wanted to say his piece before committing suicide. Chris hangs up and tells Jaden he can go, but Jaden is moved by Chris' misery and attempts to stop Chris from shooting himself. A scuffle ensues, and assuming Chris is trying to hurt Jaden, the sniper takes aim and shoots. We never learn who is shot, but at that point it's irrelevant to the message of the episode. The point is that this traumatic event happened, and it deeply affected the people involved. Yet as the song ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" plays over the end credits, we see people getting notifications about the event (likely saying ""Tense Standoff Ends in Kidnapper's Death"") and instead of pausing to read the particulars, or to feel bothered that someone is dead, they simply shrug it off and continue scrolling. One man even lets the notification distract him while he's driving. Meanwhile Billy looks distraught for a moment, but then shuts his eyes and goes back to meditating. The ending is simultaneously an indictment of social media, its founders, and society's inability to muster a proper response to daily tragedies, as the 24-hour news cycle keeps our timelines flooded and our emotions muted. In a video interview with IGN, showrunner Charlie Brooker said the episode is a commentary on the detachment we feel while using communication platforms: There's a few messages that viewers can choose to take away from ""Smithereens."" One is the issue of gun violence, as breaking news of a mass shooting now barely registers more than a few ""thoughts and prayers"" tweets. Miami Herald writer Carl Hiaasen, who lost his brother in a 2018 shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper, recently mourned the state of media by pointing out some outlets don't even cover shootings now unless ""the body count hits double digits."" The boys filming on the side of the road while the standoff occurred, only to finally look up from their screens when the shot rings out, can also be seen as a criticism of the modern day manifestation of the bystander effect. Recording injustices to post on Twitter is one of the ways that social media has been used to positively raise global awareness, but they've also created the problem of the disembodied bystander: a band of people simply recording an injustice, rather than actually trying to intervene, as you see in the case of David Dao being dragged off the United flight. And then there's the issue of tech CEO accountability, and why Billy is so frustrating. Billy is both intelligent and powerful, and yet his answer to whether or not Smithereen can be redesigned to force users to be more socially aware and responsible is to shrug and return to his luxury silent retreat. His failure to promise to make any changes on behalf of the consumer (that may then affect the company's bottom line) mirrors IRL situations where politicians are now having to pass laws banning all phone use in the car, since distracted driving is more dangerous than drunk driving, while tech CEOs have done little to curb the use of their own products. In the end, ""Smithereens"" leaves us with a terribly saddening message. The commonly used saying ""blown to smithereens"" means to break or destroy something into tiny, fragmentary pieces. These social media platforms were created as a way to share news, disseminate information, and connect people, but their overuse has now created the opposite effect, and Black Mirror tells us we're more broken than ever as a society and a nation. Speaking to NPR, Hiaasen acknowledged that while people are desensitized to the onslaught of tragic news, ""if we don't shine a light on it and write about it and react with some humanity and horror every time it happens, we'll never get past it. We'll never get better as a society."" ""Smithereens,"" at the very least, accomplishes that goal.

Ms. Nuckols' 4th grade class at King’s Grant Elementary School has been taking a detour from the lesson plan.  “We first wrote to Virginia Beach General, the medical staff there, then we did police officers, then city workers in Building 1 because we talked about how hard it was for them to have to go back to work. After that, EMS and then firefighters,” says Laura Nuckols. Faces of the Virginia Beach mass shooting “Thank you for keeping our community safe,” wrote 4th grader Abigail Riley. “Thank you so much for being so brave and strong and being a wonderful helper to our community” wrote Kayla Drummond. With a few kind words, some markers, crayons and colored paper, her students have been creating heartfelt cards of gratitude and appreciation for a week. Monday’s cards are being sent to Virginia Beach firefighters. “Inside it says, 'Firefighters, thank you' and it says 'God bless'” says Emily Lantrip as she describes her handwritten card. “I have a heart with puzzle pieces because the puzzle pieces represent all the things that people do in our community,” she goes on to say. “I think those thoughts coming from 9- and 10-year-olds is really meaningful, and I’m proud that I could offer my class this opportunity to contribute,” says Nuckols. Like many people who are reeling after the municipal center shooting, Nuckols was looking for a way to make a difference while teaching her students the power of giving back. “If I can teach them that giving back is important, then that is one of the most important lessons that they’ve learned this year,” she says. Nuckols says the class decided each morning who they want to write cards for that day. They will continue to write cards until Friday— the last day of the school year.

297,https://people.com/crime/3rd-anniversary-pulse-shooting-nightclub-owner-memorial/,"Six teams are finalists to build a memorial at the site of the Orlando nightspot that witnessed the largest modern-day attack on the LGBTQ community Three years later, the inside of her closed Pulse nightclub looks just as the FBI left it after investigating the murders of 49 people shot there while out dancing on a Saturday night at an inclusive gay nightspot in Orlando on June 12, 2016. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in U.S. history. It remains the largest modern-day attack on the LGBTQ community. But outside of Pulse, its co-founder and owner, Barbara Poma, can imagine something uplifting — a memorial to those lives lost, displaying artifacts left in tribute and exhibits themed on acceptance, linked to a nearby lake via a serene walkway illustrating “the journey from hate to remembrance and hope.” Those words come from the written guidance given to potential architects of the memorial. Poma states it in more personal terms specific to the LGBTQ community, including her older brother, John, whom she lost to AIDS in 1991, and in whose memory she opened the club. “Every tragedy has its own story, and we at Pulse have to tell our own story,” she tells PEOPLE. “It was a terrorist attack,” she says. “It happened to a community that was already disenfranchised.” Amid an epidemic of mass shootings, “the loss of our 49 does not diminish or replace the loss of every other life lost,” she says. “Schools should be safe, and churches should be safe, and marathons should be safe. We should all be safe. But for the LGBT community, they’ve had to do this forever; they had to find safe spaces forever. That’s why this attack is different.” “When we address this issue, we talk about how safe spaces were needed in the first place, how important they were to this community. We talk about what an invasion of a safe space looked like.” “But I think the most important thing we have to cover,” she says, “is how the world responded. They responded with love, unity and acceptance.” RELATED: Owner of Orlando Nightclub Speaks Out After Deadly Shooting: ‘It Was Supposed To Be a Safe Place’ With $14 million already in hand, the onePulse Foundation with Poma as CEO is seeking to raise $50 million to build the memorial and museum, which it hopes to open in June 2022. Six design team finalists have been chosen, representing prior work on projects including the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in London. At the start of a week of remembrances on Monday, two members of Congress from Florida said they would push to declare the nightclub site as a national memorial, reports Associated Press. At the same time, a pending lawsuit accuses the club’s owners of negligence for not providing proper security prior to the attack, and of allegedly hiding assets to protect themselves from claims by survivors and victims’ families. “Since the tragedy, we, like others directly impacted by this unimaginable act of violence, have been targeted by out-of-state personal injury lawyers pursuing us in this frivolous case,” Poma wrote in an emailed response to the Orlando Sentinel. “To question my intent or motives based on the mistaken assumptions, suggestions or speculation of others who have no knowledge of our circumstances or of our character is misplaced and unjustified.” RELATED: Two Years After Pulse Nightclub Shooting Killed 49, Friends Embrace a Victim’s Legacy of Love Initial funds collected by the club’s owners for victims went to the OneOrlando Fund created by the city of Orlando that raised and paid out more than $31 million to those affected. The effort going forward will be focused on telling their stories in context. When Pulse opened, it had two goals — be a place for everyone, and be a place you could bring your mother. “That really was our mission,” says Poma, who recalls her own mom finding her brother in bars that were not so welcoming. “It was important to me that every mother walk in and go, ‘Oh, I get it.'” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Among the victims, “there were two mothers there that evening, one of them dancing with her son and the other one celebrating her first girls’ night out after she had her second child,” she says. “You also had very many of them who were allies or straight who just came for the music, who just knew that Pulse was a place you could come to, no matter what. That is what made Pulse extremely different.” “What happened at Pulse started so many conversations,” she says. “It started LGBT conversations, gun violence conversations, hate conversations. The list goes on, and if we don’t take advantage of the conversations it started, then those 49 died in vain.” “We will never let that happen,” she says.

298,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/pulse-shooting-survivor-brandon-wolf-explains-why-he-speaks-out-for-gun-policy-reform-17996133," June 12, 2019, is the third anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting, the second-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. In the early hours of  Sunday, June 12, 2016, an attacker entered Pulse, an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and killed 49 people. Brandon Wolf, now 30, survived the attack by hiding in the bathroom until he could escape. His friends, Andrew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, were killed in the shooting. After the shooting, Wolf helped found The Dru Project, which provides scholarships to LGBTQ individuals and supports gay-straight alliance groups in schools, in Leinonen's memory. A member of Everytown For Gun Safety's Survivor Network, he shared his story with Elite Daily's Lilli Petersen for Everytown's Moments That Survive campaign during Gun Violence Survivor Week in February 2019. On the third anniversary of the shooting, these are his words. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. [Before the Pulse shooting] I was fairly complacent. I was the person who sat on the couch and thought that by watching a debate, I had done my civic duty. Posting on Twitter or Facebook was enough to be involved. And then, one fateful night, a few of my best friends and I went to Pulse nightclub. It was a usual spot for us to be ... kinda in our little group, unwinding from the week. We each had pretty stressful jobs at the time, so it was kind of our ritual on the weekends to unwind together. It started like any other night. We went to the club, it was busy. As the night wore on, we kind of ended up right out there on the patio. My best friend, [Leinonen], he would always get so sappy when he was drunk, so heâd had a few drinks, and he put his arm around me, and he said, ""You know what we never say enough in the world? That we love each other."" And so, then and there, he said, ""I want you to know youâre my best friend in the world and I love you very much."" That was the last conversation we would ever have. Iâll never forget, standing there in front of the sink, terrified people crowding around me, and I got the first smell of blood and gun smoke. Thatâs when it felt real to me. I remember shortly after that, the gunfire started again, and this time it was relentless. It didnât stop. And there was this debate in the bathroom about whether or not we should stay, we should go, try to hide. Ultimately, a group of us decided that we needed to leave. So, there was nowhere to hide, and if we didnât try to make an escape we wouldnât make it out. So we linked arms with each other, we grabbed hands with whoever we could, and we made a run for an emergency exit. Luckily, someone had propped a door open as they ran out. So there was an exit. I didnât really look around. People ask me all the time if I saw the shooter ... To be honest, all I can remember is staring at that door, staring at the light from outside at that parking lot, and just praying and hoping that whatever was in the building wasnât [close] enough [to] me that I could get out without getting hurt. The sensation that sticks with me, the memory that sticks with me [from] the initial moment when I figured it all out is panic. All I can remember is that feeling in the pit of your stomach â for people who donât like roller coasters, when you go over that first drop and youâre not sure youâre going to make it. Itâs that feeling in the bottom of your stomach, a knot. And every time I get into a situation where I feel like something [is] going to happen, that sense of panic comes back. For me, thatâs one of the most vivid memories of the shooting. A feeling of sheer panic. Iâl never forget, Monday morning, getting the call that [Leinonen] had not even made it out of the club that night. You think about that grief that is so overtaking, itâs so overwhelming. I think from that moment for the next 24 to 36 hours, I donât remember anything. [After the shooting, people] were talking about, ""Where does this fit in a national landscape?"" talking about a presidential election. And I remember in that moment making a decision that, if I didnât speak up, if I didnât say something or do something, that my friends would just forever be two of 49 victims. That no one would ever know their names, no one would ever know what they meant to the world, or their passion for other people. So I made a choice that week that no matter what happened, no matter how low I felt, no matter what the world around me said or did, I was going to make sure that people knew who they were. There is plenty we can do about this issue. Weâve been told for way too long that thereâs nothing we can do. And now we realize that the only people telling us that are the ones who stand to make money from us gunning each other down. And weâre just not doing it anymore. One of the really pressing things we have on our plate right now is HR8, which would expand background checks. [Editor's Note: HR8, also known as the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, passed the U.S. House of Representatives mostly along party lines on Feb. 27, 2019. As of publication, it has not yet been voted on in the Senate.] Ninety-seven percent of Americans agree that we need expanded and universal background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole. Thatâs a really big deal. Thereâs a ton of other legislation we can be coalescing around. I helped to elect Rep. Stephanie Murphy out of Orlando. She worked really hard to end the Dickey Amendment, which prevented the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] (CDC) from studying gun violence as a public health crisis. Now we just need money allotted to the CDC. We could talk about red flag laws, which allow family members or courts to temporarily take away firearms from people who are deemed a hazard to themselves or others. Thereâs a lot of common sense legislation that if you sit down, and it doesnât matter what side of the aisle youâre on, if we just talk about health and safety in this country, we all agree on it. In terms of regular, everyday people, what can you do? You can continue to hold your legislators, your lawmakers, accountable. We elected them. Itâs not as if they donât have a responsibility to us. These are people we are paying, every single day, to do whatâs best for us. And that means itâs our responsibility as citizens to call, to write, to show up, to march, to sit in, to do whatever we have to do to remind them that if you want to get paid, if you want to sit behind that desk, if you want to represent me, then you need to represent me. I had an incredible opportunity to speak at the Democratic National Convention ... I had numerous opportunities to be a surrogate on campaigns, to fight really hard for gun violence prevention measures. To give really momentous speeches in front of large groups of people. Those are the moments that stick out to other people. What sticks out to me are the quiet moments. The ones that make me feel something are the ones where Iâm all alone, Iâm sitting down, Iâm doing something that Leinonen and I would have been doing together. I almost feel a sense of peace. As if heâs come back and put his arm around me again.",2019-06-12 10:10:26,Pulse Shooting Survivor Brandon Wolf Explains Why He Speaks Out For Gun Policy Reform,,70102,http://elitedaily.com/#spider

In an e-mail to supporters memorializing the victims, Buttigieg — after a “trigger warning” of the sort that has become common on liberal college campuses — noted that the shooting had been carried out by “an ISIS-inspired terrorist.” Former vice president Joe Biden used the word “terror” but did not connect it to radical Islam, and added a note about “gun violence”: Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 12, 2019 The Pulse nightclub shooting, which killed 49 and wounded 68, was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. It was carried out by Omar Saddiqui Mateen, the son of immigrant parents from Afghanistan. In a 911 call during the attack, Mateen pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the so-called “Islamic State,” or ISIS. Almost immediately, Democrats and left-wing media began obscuring the role of radical Islamic terror in the attack. A year later, the media — and the LGBT rights movement — had transformed the event from a terror attack into a “hate crime.” Many LGBT activists criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday for omitting mention of the fact that the victims were members of the LGBT community in his proclamation commemorating the event. However, as even liberal Vox noted in 2018, evidence since the attack has suggested that anti-LGBT hate was not a motive: “There’s now conclusive evidence that the shooter wasn’t intending to target LGBTQ people at all. … Instead, the new evidence suggests, the Pulse nightclub shooting was intended as revenge for US anti-terror policies abroad.” The nightclub was a “gun-free zone.” Joel B.

304,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/66qA1loXkvY/,"Three years after 49 people were shot and killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, efforts headed by the OnePULSE Foundation are underway to build a memorial and museum to commemorate the victims. But the plan has been met with criticism by some parents of the victims, survivors of the shooting and local lawmakers concerned that the foundation behind the plan could be profiting off the massacre’s aftermath. Those concerned are requesting an audit of the foundation. In a statement to TIME, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a co-sponsor of the proposed legislation marking Pulse as a memorial space (and whose district includes much of Downtown Orlando), said that the foundation should welcome any protocol “that increases transparency and accountability to the public.” OnePULSE became an official nonprofit in late 2016 to begin efforts to build a memorial and museum dedicated to those who were killed. One of the founding members, Barbara Poma, also owns the Pulse nightclub, and declined to sell it to the city. Board members, volunteers and advisors include Mayra Alvear, the mother of a victim, and Lance Bass of the boy band NSYNC. The foundation plans to build a memorial at the site of the June 12, 2016 attack, and a museum intended to be a “dignified place for remembrance, education, inspiration, and hope,” according to its website. Both are intended to open in 2022. The foundation also plans to build a “Survivor’s Walk” at the site, which will follow some of the paths that many of the survivors took to get to safety the night of the shooting. A temporary memorial already exists at the site. How to best memorialize the sites of mass shootings (or move past the infamy thereof) in the United States remains a thorny issue. In Colorado, Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Jason Glass recently asked the local community to consider a potential proposal to tear down Columbine High School; in Newtown, Conn., Sandy Hook Elementary School was demolished in 2013, less than a year after the murders of 20 students and 6 educators — a new school was later rebuilt on the site. In Aurora, Colo. the Century Aurora movie theater reopened six months after a gunman killed 12 moviegoers. At a Monday morning news conference about the plans for the memorial and museum, Christine Leinonen, whose son Christopher “Drew” Leinonen died during the shooting on June 12, 2016, was removed from the event after interrupting and shouting at onePULSE Foundation CEO and Executive Director Barbara Poma, who owns the nightclub. Leinonen is accusing Poma of profiting off the death of her son, and has been vocal about her requests for an in-depth audit of the foundation. “My son is earning zero now, while Barbara Poma is earning an executive salary year after year after year on my son’s death,” Leinonen tells TIME. According to the most recent tax information available, the only paid employee on the foundation’s roster is Poma, who reported a salary of $43,269 in 2017. (Leah Shepherd, the OnePULSE Chief Operating Officer, tells TIME there are now four paid staff members.) The foundation, which was established in 2016, also reported $893,910 in revenue and $921,181 in total expenses in 2018. Norman Casiano, 29, who survived the June 12 shooting, said he shares some of Leinonen’s concerns. “The feelings that she has are feelings my family and I have been feeling,” Casiano tells TIME. “It’s hard to see people monopolize a situation like this and grow a name for themselves out of this after such a terrible thing.” But Brett Rigas, 34, who also survived the shooting, said that onePULSE has always been a source of help — be that financially, advocacy, and in terms of growing a support network for those connected to the shooting. Rigas says that the foundation regularly corresponds with survivors, via newsletters, a private Facebook group, and monthly in-person meetings. The onePULSE foundation says an audit is already underway to examine the 2018 fiscal year, and has been in the works since January 2019 by auditing firm Holland & Reilly, which Shepherd says will be an extensive breakdown of each cost by the foundation. “The audit will cover everything,” she says. “This is a four to five month audit that is completely thorough on every bank statement, every expense and every single income, every donation that’s coming to the foundation.” She adds the foundation will undergo an audit every year, which will be made available on the foundation’s website. Leinonen says a general audit won’t be enough to make her feel assured that money isn’t being mismanaged. At the Monday press conference, the foundation and local lawmakers announced Orange County, Fla., would allocate $10 million from its hotel tax to help fund the museum portion of the project, and that the Florida State Legislature is working on allocating an additional $500,000. “It’s three years now that she’s collecting money,” Leinonen says. “And still she wants the tax payers to fund the memorial that she has been collecting money for for three years.” Shepherd says the OnePULSE foundation is following the same business model at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City and the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, which are public and private partnerships funded by the government and individual donors. A spokesperson for onePULSE tells TIME that the hotel tax funds would not be handed over to the foundation in a lump sum. Instead, it could receive up to $10 million in contracts. The spokesperson also says that the $500,000, which is awaiting approval by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, would go towards construction and administrative costs. DeSantis is facing his own controversy for not initially mentioning the LGBT community in a proclamation to commemorate the nightclub shooting. “The leadership and staff of the onePULSE Foundation take their mission and work very seriously, and any statement that the foundation has not been transparent with our finances and the work involved in fulfilling our mission is misguided,” said Earl Crittenden, Board Chairman of onePULSE Foundation, in a statement to TIME. “We also want to emphasize that if a member of the public, a family member, survivor, or public official has questions about our finances, they are welcome to contact us. To date no member of the public has contacted our leadership about this issue.” “Orlando is the world of Disneyland and everyone has this perception that there’s such a thing as a happy ending,” Leinonen says. “There’s no fairy tale, it’s a horror movie. There will never be a happy ending for the Chris Leinonen team.” Leinonen lost Christopher, her only child, at the nightclub when mass shooter Omar Mateen opened fired, killing 49 and injuring 53 others. Christopher’s boyfriend, Juan Ramon Guerrero, was also among those killed. One of the survivors is Casiano, who was shot twice in his lower back. He was 26 at the time. “I had my career going, I was making money and I was on my own two feet,” he says. “Now I receive disability.” Casiano says he has permanent nerve damage and experiences pain regularly, or loses feeling in his lower body. But he is used to the pain — it’s his mental health that plagues him the most. Two of Casiano’s close friends didn’t survive the attack. Both Casiano and Leinonen have discussed their feelings about the onePULSE memorial together, and found a lot of common ground, though Casiano says he doesn’t harbor any negative feelings toward Poma. “Them doing all these fundraisers and receiving all this money from all these different types of sources does make it seem like it is being mishandled,” Casiano says. “And we’re not at the receiving end of this help. They continue to say that they’re raising money for this, they’re raising money for that, but the survivors and the families who lost people there, they’re still grasping for air trying to make it back to where they were prior to Pulse.” Leinonen, an attorney and former state trooper, says she harbors a lot of anger, including towards Poma, who she feels should have provided proper security at the nightclub. She is part of a group of 129 survivors and family members of dead loved ones who are suing Barbara Poma and her husband Rosario, as co-owners of Pulse, alleging they did not provide proper security at the nightclub. Orlando police Officer Adam Gruler, who was off-duty and working a shift as a security guard, was armed and the only security on duty the night of the shooting. He fired at Mateen, but did not pursue him into the club. In a statement to Orlando Weekly shortly after the suit was filed in 2018, Poma said “What is important to Rosario and me is that we continue to focus on remembering the 49 angels that were taken, the affected survivors and to continue to help our community heal.” As of June 2019, the Orlando Sentinel also reports she had labeled the suit “frivolous.” (On this matter, neither Poma nor onePULSE representatives responded to a request for comment from TIME prior to publication.) “The bottom line is we think the Pomas are just trying to dump liability here,” Keith Altman, a lawyer representing the 129 plaintiffs tells TIME. “On the one hand, she talks in support of the victims, on the other hand she’s profiting from it, and on the third hand she’s trying to keep the assets and not accept responsibility.” “What I am upset about is that Barbara Poma gets to make all of the decisions,” Leinonen says. “What I want is a democracy. For the families of those affected and the survivors to vote on how to handle this tragedy. We are the Pulse tragedy, not the nightclub owner.” onePULSE’s Leah Shepherd says the families, survivors and first responders have always been a part of the foundation’s process, and have been a part of every decision made. She says the current interim memorial was built based on feedback by those impacted the night of the shooting and that the foundation hosts a family day twice a year, offering updates on the foundation’s progress. “They come first in everything we do,” Shepherd tells TIME. “Ms. Leinonen has been invited to have a seat at the table at every single thing that we do.” “I have so much respect for that woman,” adds Brett Rigas. “I don’t know how she sleeps, she does so much.” “There needs to be something to make sure this isn’t forgotten,” Rigas continues. “Even yesterday, the mayor talked about how there are little kids in the city who don’t know what happened. There needs to be something to make sure that what happened to us isn’t forgotten after we’re gone.” Three federal lawmakers, Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla. Darren Soto, D-Fla. and Val Demings, D-Fla. have sponsored legislation to designate Pulse as a national memorial. On Wednesday, Demings tweeted that she hoped Poma’s “vision for a Memorial allow us to remember the past and provide hope for the future.” Murphy also agrees with auditing the foundation, though. “Like any other nonprofit, the OnePULSE foundation should undergo regular, independent audits so that the families of the victims can have confidence in their work and their mission,” she said in an email to TIME. “The foundation will have an important role to play in keeping the memory of the victims alive, and for that reason they should welcome any action that increases transparency and accountability to the public.” Several other state lawmakers have been vocal supporters of Leinonen and have called for an audit of the foundation. In the comments of a post Leinonen made on Facebook calling for an audit, Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-District 49, wrote, “I think based on the amount of taxpayer money the OnePULSE Foundation has received from state and county funds, they should be required to go through an independent audit. That would expose any misspending or it would give the public confidence in the financial stewardship of the organization.” The Sentinel reported that state Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-District 47, had similar views. With these types of public dollars being spent, and because this was such a uniquely tragic event for our community, there has to be an audit. And it has to be external,” Eskamani told the newspaper. And I say this not from place of malcontent, but just because of the need for transparency, especially when you have so many families impacted.” “The mission of the OnePULSE Foundation is to tell the story on behalf of the families and the survivors and the first responders,” Crittenden tells TIME. “But then there’s confusion, as we have said, as to what our mission is, and we’re focused solely on scholarships and building the museum — the national museum— and the memorial. Because we have to keep telling the story and make sure that this doesn’t happen again.” Write to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.",2019-06-12 21:22:07,"Concerns, Controversy Surround the Planned Construction of a Memorial and Museum at Pulse Nightclub, Site of 2016 Mass Shooting",,4419,http://time.com

They huddled together, dozens of her closest family and friends, wearing ponchos against the heavy rain, and tossed handfuls of multi-colored sugar on the wooden box. The colors swirled atop the water-slicked casket as family and friends traced hearts and messages in the residue. A friend played the ukulele and sang ""Over the Rainbow."" The crowd joined in, singing young Dorothy Gale's song about longing for a happier place, about yearning in the face of reality. In a word, Josie's mother said, it was beautiful. No one word could describe the 28-year-old woman they buried that day in Greensprings Natural Cemetery, near Josie's home of Ithaca. Beautiful — certainly, in spirit most of all, those who knew Josie Berrios say. She was generous, compassionate, colorful, bigger-than-life. That casket? Josie's mother Judy said they wanted it ""decked out like the diva she was."" Josie, they say, exuded light — a light extinguished by her murder June 13, 2017, at the hands of her boyfriend, Michael Davis. The man and their volatile relationship had unnerved Josie's family, and the violence she suffered at his hands is horrifyingly familiar: More than half — 55%, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — of all female homicide victims in the United States are killed by an intimate partner. Because Josie was a transgender woman 1 — murdered in the heart of a city that prides itself on inclusiveness and opportunity — her death also carried with it the specter of another horrifying truth: 54% of transgender people have experienced intimate partner violence.

Her memory has brought others forward, emboldened by Josie to be themselves. It's rallied crowds at Take Back the Night events against domestic violence. And it's inspired Josie's mother to speak out about her daughter's life — and death  — in the hopes of preventing another brutal act of domestic violence. Even now, two years after Josie's murder, Judy says she can feel her daughter urging her to share her story. As a performer, Josie adopted the stage name Kimbella Rosé. To family and friends, she simply went by Josie. Among her future goals: to legally change her name to Kendra Adams.

That's important, her mother says. ""None of the letters could ever contain how big she is."" For the past year, Ithaca Journal staff have studied law enforcement documents, spoken with friends and family of Josie Berrios and sought advice from experts in the LGBTQ community. We've spent a year working to answer two crucial questions: What happened June 13, 2017 — and who was Josie? Josie's murder was a product of domestic violence. In that sense, her narrative was all too familiar: a young woman trapped in a toxic relationship that turned deadly. But Josie was also a transgender woman, a part of her identity that added another layer of complexity to the telling of her story. We wanted to do everything possible to make sure we reported and wrote this important story with sensitivity, awareness and respect. As a matter of ethical principle, we generally do not allow outside sources to review our work before publication. In this case, however, we felt the need to tell Josie's story in the fairest, most accurate way possible over-ruled that policy. We turned to Luca Maurer, Ithaca College's Center for LGBTQ Education, Outreach and Services director, who in addition to being an expert voice also knew Josie personally. Maurer reviewed our story before publication and contributed valuable insight into accurate terminology, pronoun usage and context regarding barriers faced by the transgender community. With Maurer's guidance, we were able to make several key decisions designed to honor Josie's legacy and memory, such as omitting the name she was given at birth and not including childhood photos that did not depict Josie in her affirmed gender. We have also included a list of definitions to help readers understand the terms used in the story, as well as resources and links to more information about topics that are central to it. Lastly, we spoke in depth with Josie's family and friends after the story had been written to ensure this portrait of Josie is fair, accurate and — most importantly — a story she would have wanted told. We welcome your feedback and ideas on how to keep a broader community conversation going. Email reporter Katie Sullivan Borrelli at ksullivanborrelli@ithacajournal.com or Executive Editor Kevin Hogan at khogan@ithacajournal.com ► Telling Josie Berrios' story: How Josie Berrrios' truth was shared   It's one year after Josie's murder, in which her boyfriend set fire to a construction site in Ithaca's Collegetown neighborhood. Her mother, Judy, sits on an L-shaped couch in the living room of her Ithaca home. Her curly blond hair falls to her shoulders, and a large moonstone dangles from a chain around her neck. It's Josie's. She looks to the doorway and smiles as she pictures her daughter there, striding in: Five-foot-11 before slipping on five-inch heels, decked out in a spaghetti-strap top and jeans and colorful layers of makeup, shouting ""Hi, Mom!"" on her way inside. There was no ignoring Josie when she entered a room. ""She was so bigger than life,"" Judy said. That's part of what she and so many others loved about Josie, that wild energy, ever-present smile and infectious laughter she'd had since she was a child. Josie, who was assigned as male when she was born on April 28, 1989, and given a masculine name, was 4 when Judy and her husband, Marlon Berrios, who is Josie's biological uncle and whose family hails from Puerto Rico, adopted her. They were 20 and 21, respectively, living with Judy's mother and with no children of their own. That would change in the years to come, as the Berrios family moved to a new home a few miles west of downtown Ithaca and welcomed into it Josie's younger sister, Gigi; Judy and Marlon's son, Chantz; and their daughter, Raylin. More: A beloved trans woman was brutally murdered by her boyfriend. Her story reveals a nationwide problem Josie, their eldest, always dressed to a ""T,"" in button-up shirts or crewneck sweaters. She was a creative child, fashioning dresses from pencils and paper napkins, and doing ""every craft in the world you can think of"" with Judy. As young parents, Judy and Marlon weren't sure what to make of it when Josie started asking for an Ariel doll from Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" for Christmas. Judy asked herself, ""Why am I going to make this kid feel like she's doing something wrong just because she wants to play with a doll?"" At Caroline Elementary School, situated on a rural stretch of Route 79 in the Town of Caroline, Josie was picked on by some of the students for dressing up ""like the mom"" in a playhouse area of their classroom. Josie was fun-loving, said her childhood best friend Ashley Austin, and antics were routine. Austin recalled racing Josie through the hallways in a wheelchair after she'd hurt her leg. ""Her laugh was infectious,"" Austin said, ""and her wild energy just radiated from her."" As a teen, Josie joined a theater group. She began wearing her hair longer in braids and resisted the obligation to wear suits for formal occasions. Many of her classmates at Lehman Alternative Community School liked her, Judy said, but she still seemed to ""have a tough time with people."" Raising Josie wasn't always easy. She'd always had the attitude of the loud, fierce woman she grew up to be, and it sometimes got her into trouble. Judy sent her to counselors and therapy sessions, hoping it would help. As a 16-year-old, she dressed smartly in a black-and-white suit for a family wedding, then made a firm, true statement to her loved ones: ""This is the last time you will see me in a suit and tie."" Josie didn't care what anyone thought about her, Marlon recalled, and she knew who she wanted to be. That was also the year Josie was sent to train with Job Corps in Oneonta, a career education program administered through the U.S. Department of Labor. Judy Berrios says she's always wondered whether that was the right choice, but of one thing she's certain: It gave her daughter the space to become who she wanted to be. ""She was able to transition out of town"" and return fully expressing and embracing her female identity. Returning to Ithaca as an 18-year-old, this ball of energy with a sharp tongue, a fierce attitude and a big dream — to attend cosmetology school — introduced herself as Josie to the world. It was 10 years before the world would lose her. In 2017, Josie was entangled in a tenuous relationship with a 45-year-old man named Michael Davis. There were arguments. There were fights. And there were threats. Josie wasn't happy in her relationship with Davis, her friend of 10 years told police. She'd seen them argue, and told police Josie went on ""dates"" with other men for money. Sometimes Davis would go with her; sometimes the ""dates"" made him angry, the friend said. ""They were always fighting,"" she told police, according to records. Davis also carried a criminal record of three decades that spanned four New York state counties: 40 arrests since 1987, 26 convictions. When questioned by police, Davis' ex-wife had even said she was scared of him. She annulled their marriage after finding out he was already married to another woman. As police recounted after interviewing her: ""Davis told her that he had done things and not gotten caught. One of these things was to burn down a house."" Since May 19, 2008, Ithaca police had been investigating a fatal fire at 506 W. Clinton St., which killed 29-year-old Michelle Morey in the burning residence. Ithaca firefighters found Morey dead on the second floor of the side-by-side, two-story duplex. Davis had been associated with people who lived in that house, including Morey, police learned nine years later. Morey died of smoke inhalation, but authorities weren't able to determine the cause of the fire. The investigation of Josie's homicide yielded for police some leads to suggest Davis might have set the 2008 fire, according to police records, but he was never charged in that case. According to police documents, Josie's friend told police Josie was afraid Davis was trying to kill her. The week before her death, Josie had visited a friend staying at the Ithaca Meadow Court Inn and discussed her troubled relationship with Davis. One night, Josie told her friend, she suspected he had spiked her drink and stolen $500 from her. She didn't hear from him for three months. Then, improbably, they reconnected. Josie's friend advised her to escape the relationship. Josie told her: ""(It's) hard to walk away from someone you love."" On June 12, 2017, Davis had a different message for one of his own friends, according to police. He was ""sick of Josie,"" he said. And he had to get rid of her.   ""There are some ways in which (Josie's) story is categorized as partly about her gender identity 2, and in some ways her story is very similar to many other women,"" said Luca Maurer, the director of Ithaca College's Center for LGBTQ 3 Education, Outreach and Services. ""Josie experienced this because she is a woman. And as a transgender person 4, she had increased risk."" In 2017, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported 27 transgender and gender non-conforming people were killed in the United States. Josie was one of the 22 transgender women of color. Even in Ithaca, home to movers in LGBTQ history such as HIV/AIDS activist Cleve Thomas 5 and musician Julius Eastman 6, and where a peer-led transgender support group has existed since 1995, Josie at times confided to her mother that she struggled to feel accepted as a transgender woman. Josie's parents never heard the word ""transgender"" when their daughter was growing up. Neither had Josie. Today, her father Marlon Berrios notes, television has broadened its scope to include LGBTQ characters, even in children's programming. Josie didn't have that. She had no point of reference, no one to whom she thought she could relate. ""She didn't have any friends like her,"" Josie's aunt Jody Lawrence said. ""Not a single one."" In its fourth season for 2018-19, CW's ""Supergirl"" debuted its first transgender character, Nia Nal, played by transgender actress Nicole Maines. The character is also a superhero called Dreamer, a crime fighter dressed in a shiny silver and blue suit who boasts seemingly magic powers rooted in dreams and is also adept at hand-to-hand combat. ""Imagine,"" Jody said, ""if Josie had someone like that on TV growing up."" An estimated 0.6% of adults, about 1.4 million, identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a 2015 National Center for Transgender Equality survey, respondents' unemployment rate was three times that of the national average, 29% of respondents were living in poverty, and 30% experienced homelessness at some point in their lifetime. Josie had been taking steps to combat those statistics. After she graduated from Job Corps, certified in data processing, Josie moved back and forth between Ithaca and New York City. In the city, she hoped to find the acceptance as a transgender woman she longed for in her hometown. Instead, as much as her family can surmise, she found toxic influences that pushed her toward drug use, embittered her relationships and led her to a boyfriend who, much like her killer, Michael Davis, had a sordid criminal history. She came home to start anew. But it's tough, Judy says, to build yourself up when you're surrounded by people bringing you down. In 2017, Josie was sharing an apartment on Ringwood Road in Dryden, about seven miles from Ithaca. She didn't have a driver's license and had bounced around part-time jobs at Piercing Pagoda, Bath & Body Works and Dunkin Donuts. Some nights, she couch surfed instead of finding a ride home. Josie was a frequent stage presence at The Range bar in Ithaca with the House of Merlot drag performance group she helped found. Though Josie was a woman, not a man dressing as a woman as many other performers were, performing gave her an opportunity to step outside the typical dress code of everyday life. On stage she could be bold, putting on extra makeup and dressing up in fun costumes. She had solid plans, detailed dreams: to legally change her name to Kendra Adams and get her driver's license, then to apply for cosmetology school and become a licensed professional. Something always seemed to get in the way. She had no transportation to the Rochester cosmetology school, she fell behind in the paperwork, and there were constantly more immediate needs for the money she and Judy had set aside. ""(Transgender people) need opportunities,"" Maurer said, ""and in my mind, those opportunities are things many transgender people face barriers to: public employment, education, easy ability to obtain identity documents. It's not because of you and your identity; it's because of the conditions around you."" When Josie met Davis, her sister, Gigi Berrios, took stock of his age, his cryptic past and his unsettling behavior. She distrusted him immediately. ""Something wasn't right,"" Gigi said. ""His vibe was like he wasn't right in the head. You could tell by the way he stood; something wasn't right about him."" At her most fearful, Josie's mother worried something terrible could happen. On June 13, 2017, her nightmare came true. ""That's one 'I told you so' a mother should never have to say,"" she said.   After Josie's murder, some 300 people gathered in the dregs of a torrential downpour on the Ithaca Commons to celebrate her life. They wrote messages by the dozen on multi-colored Post-Its, sharing their memories and their grief. ""She always made me smile when I was down."" ""She was the sunshine and center of every room."" ""She made everyone feel so welcome."" ""Just being there amongst so many people from so many aspects of her life that cut across all areas and experiences in the community, was really just amazing,"" Maurer said, ""and really was a testament to how many lives she touched."" Until then, Judy hadn't realized what a positive force Josie had been for so many. She'd been a shoulder to cry on, a smile lifting them up, a fierce protector. ""I got the broken one,"" her mother said. ""I got the vulnerable one, the one that needed assistance, the one that needed guidance and the one that could feel like she could talk to me about her woes."" Josie's community was diverse: They were her classmates growing up, the neighborhood families who'd always known hers, her coworkers at various jobs, and her fellow performers with House of Merlot. Kimbella Rosé, the name Josie used on stage, was a commanding, energetic presence during her performances. She was confident in herself and took the time to spark that confidence in other performers, as House of Merlot founders recalled in a memorial Facebook post: ""A proud trans woman of color, she always tried her best to make new performers feel comfortable in our spaces. She recognized the realness in all of us without question and made us feel beautiful."" That was typical of Josie, her childhood friend Ashley Austin says: ""She would stand up to anyone for anybody."" Josie and Austin attended different schools after they finished fifth grade, but Josie wasn't an easy person to forget. ""What I will always remember most about Josie was how loving, sassy, vivacious and kind she was,"" Austin said. ""She was a beautiful and caring friend."" When it came to defending her friends, Josie was steel. Soon after the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando in 2016, Josie's friend Vanessa Taylor, who is also a transgender woman, accompanied her to an Ithaca bar where an event was being held to commemorate the victims. When Taylor had to use the bathroom, Josie offered to go with her. Heading toward the women’s room, Taylor recalled, two drunk college-aged young men ""started giving me garbage."" Before Taylor said anything, Josie stepped in and fired back: “She’s going in the ladies' room and you’re not going to have a problem with it — are you?” The hecklers, visibly flinching upon being confronted, fell silent. ""I think that because Josie had a tough life, she tended to champion the underdogs a little bit and people that maybe didn’t fit with the norm,"" recalled Taylor. Josie never outright told Taylor she'd faced challenges in life, but Taylor had her suspicions. ""Life,"" Josie had told her, ""doesn’t always give you sunshine, lollipops and rainbows."" Davis' guilty plea in Tompkins County Court to second-degree murder in 2018 left little chance that any explanation for why he committed this crime would ever come to light. But law enforcement officials learned the story during their investigation. Davis walked them through his version of that night when they questioned him after Josie's death. Josie had helped land Davis his night job as the ""fire guard"" at a Collegetown building on Dryden Road that was under construction, he told two investigators at New York State Police barracks in Dryden. But after just two nights of working, he was already in trouble. There had been complaints the ""fire guard"" was nowhere to be found on site, according to police reports. The complaints were enough to bring Davis’ boss, Maurice Hamm, to Ithaca and take selfies of himself and Davis — just to prove Davis was at work. The night of June 12, 2017 — hours before Josie died — Davis and Josie showed up at the site together around 6; Davis grabbed a newspaper and did his rounds, then they left to make stops at Walmart and Wegmans. While at Wegmans, Josie’s cellphone was flooded with messages from Hamm asking where they’d gone. Davis and Josie caught a bus to get back to the site quickly. With Davis back at work, Hamm and Josie stopped by a 7 Eleven on College Avenue around 10:16 for snacks, and Josie went back inside 10 minutes later to buy some cigars. Together, they walked back toward the building. Sometime after 11:30 p.m., Davis said, his boss texted Josie, told her Davis had been fired and Josie could have the job instead. Davis told police he spent the next 90 or so minutes — the time in which Josie was killed — walking from the Collegetown site to East Hill Plaza. Around 1 a.m., he said, he hitched a ride home. A passerby's account would refute that: The witness had seen Davis walking on Ellis Hollow Road around 5:45 that morning. One of Davis’ housemates, Joy Gray, was awakened by Davis entering the house sometime between 6 and 8, after sunrise. Gray met Davis in the kitchen. He told her he’d ""caught another body,"" she told police. He said Gray ""would not have to worry about Josie stealing from (her) again"" and that ""he did something to the body that would make it hard to identify,"" Gray told a Tompkins County Sheriff’s Office investigator. If police turned up at their door, Davis said, Gray was to say they had been together between 1 and 1:30 that morning. Hamm, he claimed, was the last person Josie had been with — at the 7 Eleven. Davis wanted to drive to his other apartment in Enfield for a while to avoid contact with police. But once authorities caught up with Davis late on the morning of June 13, he texted his Adult Protective Services worker: ""I think this has to do with one of Josie’s tricks,"" and ""I am starting to think this is a set up and I am getting agitated."" The APS worker told Davis to “stay calm,” assuring him, ""You did nothing wrong."" But by then, police had already started building their case in the murder of Josie Berrios. Along with his boss, the general foreman of the construction job on Dryden Road had just returned from breakfast on June 13, 2017, when they heard about the fire on the sixth floor of the building. A worker had been installing an electrical box in an office space when he noticed a burned, circular pattern on the carpet at the base of a charred door. The door was locked. The foreman arrived and, peering through the soot-stained glass, made out the shape of a body under a table. The workers kicked in the door and dialed 911 as one of the workers checked the body for signs of life. As the investigation unfolded, the fire was ruled arson. Josie's body was taken to the Onondaga County Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy conducted on June 14, 2017. She died from smoke inhalation and burns caused by the intentionally set fire, according to the medical examiner. Her death was declared a homicide. At the crime scene, investigators found a gallon can of Tru Fuel 50:1 2 cycle gasoline and something else: Davis' duffel bag. Surveillance video from earlier that night showed him in uniform carrying the bag, then showed him leaving the area without the bag and no uniform. During a search of Davis' home, police found a plastic shopping bag with corduroy pants and a T-shirt. Both smelled like petroleum. Investigators believed they'd linked Davis to Josie's murder. Less than 24 hours after the crime, he was arrested. On the surface, Josie's murder seemed to carry all the trappings of a hate crime: a victim who identified as a transgender woman of color had been slain in horrific fashion. Despite the public's initial perception, the Tompkins County District Attorney's Office determined there was no evidence that hate was the motive in Josie's homicide. The true motive was clear, prosecutors maintained: domestic violence. ""Josie's life was not tragically taken from her by anything she did or did not do,"" said Andrew Bonavia, the deputy district attorney who led Davis' prosecution. ""As was the case here, the only person responsible for domestic violence, in whatever form, is the abuser."" Josie's family agrees, and they hope the community takes the true story to heart. What truly matters, Tompkins County District Attorney Matthew Van Houten said after Davis was sentenced in March 2018 to the maximum penalty of 25 years to life in prison, is that Josie ""was loved and she was wanted."" ""She was a bright light in our community who helped countless people with her positive energy, confidence and courage,"" Van Houten said. ""She will never be forgotten."" In the time since her daughter's death, Judy says she's let Josie's energy direct her actions: sprinkling colored sugar on Josie's casket at her funeral; agreeing to speaking engagements like Take Back the Night, an event challenging domestic violence; and telling her daughter's story. ""I have this belief like, 'I need to speak for her,'"" she said. ""She wants me to tell her story; she wants me to be her voice."" In her Take Back the Night speech, Judy compared Josie and her killer. Both faced hardships in life, but Josie's memory is one of love, of standing up for people, of being their friend. She shared a Native American parable with the crowd, about a grandfather discussing an internal fight of two wolves — one good, one evil — inside of him. When the grandson asked which would win, the grandfather replied, ""The one you feed."" ""We can simplify this,"" Judy said, ""Love or hate? Which will you choose to feed? ... Josie chose love. She loved and accepted everyone. So, I say choose love. Because together, with love, we can dismantle the systems that have broken our hearts.""   On the day of Josie's funeral, in the pouring rain, Pastor Shirley Reeves placed a cross made of flowers atop the casket, prompting the mourners to then add single-stem flowers of their own, one atop the next. ""She would've loved it,"" Judy said. The final strains of ""Over the Rainbow"" played as the crowd sang along. In the ""Wizard of Oz,"" just before Dorothy begins to sing the iconic song, she wonders wistfully: ""Someplace where there isn't any trouble ... do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or train. It's far, far away ... behind the moon ... beyond the rain."" Josie's mother says her daughter always carried with her a bright energy, but since her death, Judy believes that energy has manifested itself in powerful ways. Two years ago, those who loved Josie best bathed her casket in a cascade of color, sang their farewell, then lowered her body to its final resting place. As they did, the rain abruptly stopped.",2019-06-13 06:13:27,A beloved trans woman was brutally murdered by her boyfriend. Her story reveals a nationwide problem,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

308,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/603043660/0/phoenix/nation~ATF-was-supposed-to-destroy-thousands-of-guns-Instead-a-guard-stole-and-sold-them/,"ATF agents across the country are working to track down thousands of guns and firearms parts that were seized by law enforcement and supposed to be destroyed but were stolen first. The agents are searching for some of their own retired service weapons as well as guns from other federal law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI and DEA. All of the weapons were sent to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' National Firearms and Ammunition Destruction Branch in Martinsburg, West Virginia, to be shredded, according to court documents and congressional letters. A longtime contract employee at the ATF facility admitted carting off thousands of firearms, gun parts and ammunition and selling them over several years. Guard Christopher Yates was charged in federal court in West Virginia. He pleaded guilty in April to possession of a stolen gun and stealing government property. Yates is set to be sentenced in August. He faces up to 10 years in prison on each count, but is unlikely to get the maximum under federal sentencing guidelines. The ATF has recovered more than 4,000 guns and parts that had been reported missing while Yates worked there, according to Yates' plea agreement. Yates admitted stealing at least 3,000 slides, a key part of a gun allowing it to fire, from Glock semiautomatic handguns. He also admitted stealing dozens of guns, including at least four fully automatic machine guns, which are closely regulated by the ATF. It's not clear from the plea agreement whether all of those machine guns have been recovered. Yates told prosecutors that when he was alone at the facility, he stole the weapons and parts and then sold them. In a March 28 letter to U.S. Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Gary Peters, D-Mich., then-acting ATF Director Tom Brandon said he could not say much because of Yates' open case. Johnson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, and Peters, the committee's ranking member, had written a letter in March asking for answers from the agency, saying they had been told that about 600 guns and parts were stolen. ""We cannot at this time characterize the scope of the thefts from the Martinsburg facility,"" wrote Brandon, who retired from the agency at the end of April. Less than two weeks after Brandon's letter was sent, many details of the case were laid out in Yates' plea agreement filed in federal court in West Virginia. The agency is still not saying publicly how many guns and gun parts have been taken, disclosing only that the loss was ""significant."" On Wednesday, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell noted in an email that ""the total number cannot be released pending the ongoing investigation & recovery operations."" Asked why the agency did not disclose details to Congress that were in Yates' plea agreement, Langwell wrote, ""The investigation was ongoing and the timing of the release of information was a result of the regular judicial process."" In a statement issued Wednesday, Johnson and Peters said that ""the ATF is tasked with protecting our communities and the theft of a substantial amount of weapons, parts and ammunition from ATF facilities raises significant concerns. Our committee is seeking a full accounting of this situation, and we hope the ATF will be as transparent as possible while we continue to pursue answers.” More: 4 gunmen on run, one dead, after Washington-area gun store break-in More: A year after Vegas shooting, ATF emails reveal blame, alarm over bump stocks Agents have been ""running around the clock"" trying to find the weapons, which has taken time from other investigations, according to several sources familiar with the effort to find the stolen guns. Each of the 25 ATF field offices around the country was assigned to look for the stolen guns. In his letter to the senators, Brandon said that ATF has applied ""necessary resources to maximize recovery of stolen property."" The agency also beefed up security at the gun-destruction facility, he wrote. On Wednesday, Langwell, the agency spokeswoman, wrote, ""Most of the property has been recovered; however, the investigation is ongoing so we cannot provide additional details."" She also said the ATF was not authorized to compensate people who may have unknowingly bought the stolen guns or parts. It is not clear the process by which agents are getting the guns from those individuals. Sources familiar with the ATF's efforts say stolen guns and parts have been recovered across the country, in Mexico and the Caribbean, including at crime scenes. Several investigations have been launched into what happened. The ATF has assigned a team to look into how Yates was able to brazenly steal the weapons and parts for years. They also are examining why a number of the guns were listed as being destroyed when they had not been. Also investigating the case are the inspector general for both the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, along with at least one congressional committee. The agency reported the theft to both inspectors general. ""We continue to work closely with the Office of Inspector General to ensure full accountability in this review,"" Langwell wrote. Last year, the Justice Department's inspector general published an audit of the ATF's controls over weapons and ammunition, but did not find problems with the agency's practices. The review apparently came before Yates' theft was detected. ""We found that ATF generally maintains effective control over the disposal of seized firearms"" but the auditors acknowledged how ""inherently risky"" it was for the ATF to ship all seized weapons to one location. It added, ""we believe that utilizing a centralized destruction facility with all seized firearms is an effective control."" The report  said that guns are destroyed using an industrial shredder. The process is witnessed by an ATF special agent and ""credentialed employee or contractor"" who signs a report certifying the weapon was destroyed. The investigation into Yates began in February, when Philadelphia police recovered a gun during a traffic stop. They recovered a Glock .40-caliber slide that was from a gun that had supposedly been destroyed, according to the plea agreement. Yates had access to the whole ATF facility and soon became the focus of the investigation. He later admitted he had been stealing firearms and parts since 2016. He sold the stolen guns, parts and ammunition to others including Anthony Miller, a maintenance worker at the ATF facility, and Adam Schreiber, a gun dealer in Pennsylvania. Schreiber, in turn, sold the guns across the country, according to Yates' plea agreement. Neither of the other two has been charged. Langwell, the ATF spokeswoman, said more details would be released by the agency once the investigations are completed. ""There are lessons to be learned from everything,"" she wrote. ""No business or organization is immune to the damage that a corrupt contractor, especially a security guard, can inflict.""

FILE - In this June 2, 2019, file photo, a volunteer prepares to place crosses for victims of a mass shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va., at a nearby makeshift memorial. Police responding to the deadly mass shooting were unable to confront the gunman at one point because they didn’t have the key cards needed to open doors on the second floor. Whether the delay contributed to the death toll is unclear, but the episode illustrated how door-lock technology that is supposed to protect people can hamper police and rescue workers in an emergency. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) NORFOLK, Va. – Officials in Virginia Beach pushed back on Thursday against what they described as ""rumors, innuendo, conflicting theories and speculation"" about last month's mass shooting in a municipal building. But police in this coastal city of nearly half a million people were also no closer to offering a possible motive behind the nation's deadliest mass shooting in 2019. And the family of one the 12 people who died is demanding an independent investigation. Following days of relative quiet, the city released a lengthy explanation for where its investigation stands nearly two weeks after civil engineer DeWayne Craddock opened fire in the large city building where he worked. The statement outlined police efforts, including plans to interview 240 people, but it also sought to rebut misinformation about a tragedy that remains particularly inscrutable and ripe for conjecture. City officials said police investigated a report that Craddock, 40, was being ""confrontational, argumentative and engaging in fights"" before the rampage. But officials said police have ""not uncovered evidence corroborating these allegations."" The city's statement also addressed what it said were ""suggestions"" about one of the victims, Kate Nixon, an engineer who worked with Craddock. Officials said Nixon did not receive Craddock's resignation email, which he had sent on the day of the attack, and said Nixon ""was not a supervisor in the shooter's chain of command."" The denial comes more than a week after the city released Craddock's two-sentence, emailed resignation letter. The names of the recipients were redacted. So was the time it was sent on May 31. Craddock's email gave his two weeks' notice, citing ""personal reasons."" But it offered no clues that he was unhappy at work or had held a grudge against anyone. Since Craddock's resignation letter was released, Nixon's family has spoken about concerns they say Nixon had about Craddock. She ""had written him up in the past and thought he had a poor attitude,"" Kevin Martingayle, an attorney for the family, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. ""We don't know if he was facing discipline or termination when he resigned, but the resignation email he sent and reply he got suggest that something was going on,"" Martingayle wrote. He added: ""The shooter's complete employment records should be released immediately as permitted by law, and a comprehensive independent investigation should be pursued without further delay."" The records that the city has released on Craddock have revealed little. In response to a records request from The Associated Press, the city said Craddock earned $83,283.20 a year. But the city withheld nine performance reviews, citing exemptions for personnel information. Police search warrants have also been sealed. And Craddock's 2017 divorce filings were about as boilerplate as his resignation letter, citing ""irreconcilable"" differences. He and his wife had two dogs, Jackson and Carbon, which she took possession of, the filings said. He kept the house and agreed to pay her $25,000. Officials in Virginia Beach said police are ""looking into every lead and examining every avenue in search of the facts"" ""(W)e understand the intense interest in finding out why one of our own conducted this deadly rampage,"" the city said. ""No one wants answers more than we do. We, like the families, co-workers and community, want to understand the circumstances that played into this tragedy as best we can."" ___ This story has been corrected to show that Craddock's divorce was filed in 2017.

311,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/christchurch-massacre-brenton-tarrant-pleads-not-guilty-to-all-charges,"Trial to be held in May 2020 for Australian man who faces 51 murder charges, 40 of attempted murder and one terrorism charge Last modified on Fri 14 Jun 2019 09.29 BST Australian Brenton Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to all charges in relation to the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. Tarrant, 28, is facing 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one of engaging in a terrorist act. The trial, estimated to take six weeks, will go ahead on 4 May, 2020.  Wearing a grey sweatshirt and flanked by three prison officers, Tarrant appeared via video link on a large screen at the high court in Christchurch on Friday morning, from a high security prison in Auckland where he is being held. Tarrant’s lawyer, Shane Tait, entered the pleas on Tarrant’s behalf. Tarrant smirked as Tait informed the court that he would plead not guilty to all charges but otherwise showed little emotion. His audio link had been muted, and he didn’t attempt to speak. About 140 members of the public attended the hearing. There were some quiet gasps when the not guilty plea was entered by the Tarrant’s lawyer. The decision sparked anger among relatives of the victims. Speaking outside the court after the hearing Yama Nabi, whose father was killed in the mosque shootings, said the prospect of a trial was “hurtful for the families”. “They don’t need any more. They got their hearts broken.” Janna Ezat, whose son was killed at the Al Noor mosque, cried after learning the trial would go ahead, saying “I’m so frustrated”. Abdul Aziz, who confronted the gunman during the Linwood shooting, said the hearing “wasn’t a good, pleasant thing to see.” The judge, Justice Cameron Mander, said the accused had been assessed and declared mentally fit to stand trial. He lifted suppression on the identities of the complainants, which means all alleged victims, apart from the three aged under 18, can now be named. Mander has also allowed the use of Tarrant’s image in the media, lifting an order from 16 March that his face must be pixellated. This was Tarrant’s third formal court appearance since the attacks at the attacks on Al Noor and Linwood mosques on 15 March. At his last appearance on 4 April, Tarrant was charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 for attempted murder. One of the attempted murder charges has been upgraded to a murder charge after one man died from wounds sustained in the mosque attacks. Two additional charges of attempted murder and the terrorism charge were filed on Friday. It is the first time someone in New Zealand has been charged under the country’s terrorism suppression act, which was introduced after the 9/11 attacks. After initially indicating he would represent himself in court, Tarrant retained Jonathan Hudson and Shane Tait, both Auckland-based lawyers. One man was arrested outside the court on Friday after he was accused of making racist remarks. The massacre on 15 March was New Zealand’s worst peacetime mass shooting, prompting the Labour-led coalition government to make swift and comprehensive gun reforms, banning military-style semi-automatics and assault rifles, including related components.

The Office of the Special Counsel recommended that Conway be removed from her position. Special Counsel Henry Kerner released a letter Thursday claiming that Conway's ""disregard for the restrictions the Hatch Act places on executive branch employees is unacceptable."" The White House accused the agency of flawed reasoning and said its actions were violating Conway's right to free speech. The special counsel laid out several occasions dating to 2017, including posts from her Twitter account @KellyannePolls and broadcast interviews, in which Conway spoke out about the 2018 midterm election and 2020 Democratic candidates. Her comments range from criticizing Former Vice President Joe Biden to calling on voters to head out to the polls in the 2018 election. She also repeatedly predicted that the president would win re-election. 'Egregious, notorious and ongoing': Watchdog agency urges firing of Kellyanne Conway over political remarks Here are all the instances – places and comments – the special counsel said Conway violated the Hatch Act: Conway, in her official capacity as a senior aide, was asked to respond to the Trump Administration's withdrawal from a nuclear pact with Russia during a Feb. 1 Fox News interview. During the interview, Conway was also asked to give the Trump Administration's official reaction to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., jumping into the 2020 race as a Democrat. Conway, who is a New Jersey native, questioned whether Booker was qualified and criticized him for running against a record number of women seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Who are all the 2020 candidates? Meet everyone who's running for president in our interactive guide ""Welcome, the water seems warm. Welcome to dive in along with I don't know, 10, 15, 30 other Democratic candidates. I would ask him a couple of questions today as he runs from a native of New Jersey. One is, what's wrong with the candidates that are already in there? ""What's your objection to Kamala Harris running, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, these others who have already announced? Tulsi Gabbard, maybe,"" Conway said. ""If he were a Republican running against them, they would immediately call him a sexist for running against these women in the Democratic field."" ""But I'd also ask him what exactly have you accomplished that qualifies you to be the Commander-in-chief and President of the United States,"" she said. During a separate interview on Fox News on Feb. 11, Conway gave an interview where she discussed negotiations between the White House and Congress on border funding to end the government shutdown. During the interview, Fox News host Steve Doocy named eight Democratic candidates who had announced their bids and commented that the list could still continue to grow. ""Keep it coming,"" she responded. ""Just remember, anything times zero still equals zero. If you don't have good ideas that matter to the country, if you can't connect with people the way now-President Donald Trump did all through 2015 and '16."" Campaign cheat sheet: What you need to know about the 2020 election so far Conway also commented specifically on some of the presidential candidates, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. ""Amy Klobuchar seems to be a very nice person, I guess unless you're on her staff,"" Conway said. ""But you can change the A to an O and get 'O my' instead of Amy there."" ""Elizabeth Warren spent decades, folks, decades, appropriating somebody's heritage and ethnicity... and she's been lying about it,"" Conway said. Conway also criticized Gillibrand for waiting ""for the cameras to roll"" to eat fried chicken for the first time ever. ""I mean this is just silly stuff,"" Conway said. Conway joined Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" on March 13 to give the White House response to criticisms from lawmakers, including Republicans, on Trump's national emergency declaration to obtain funding for his border wall. But, once again, Conway criticized 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. The stage is set: See who made the cut for the first 2020 Democratic primary debate Unprompted, the White House senior aide criticized Warren, saying ""she tried to appropriate somebody else's ethnicity."" ""I don't see any presidential timber yet, just presidential woodchips,"" Conway said. During an interview on March 18 on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends,"" Conway gave a White House response to a mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand, as well as border security. Conway was also asked about criticisms from Axelrod on Trump's 2020 campaign. She defended the president's reelection strategy and then questioned ""which Democrat, in fact, is going to bust through Trump's 306 electoral votes."" ""Now we have 13, we have the baker's dozen running. Biden maybe will get in because I guess none of them think the other can actually beat Donald Trump,"" she continued. ""There's no strategy I see."" She added: ""You've got Beto O'Rourke and you've got Cory Booker promising that they would nominate a woman to be the VP. Do they not think the women running are good enough to be president? ""So there's a whole hot mess in the Democratic Party beginning with right over the bridge here in Virginia,"" she concluded. Conway during the White House's Easter Egg Roll festivities on April 22 gave an interview to Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" to comment on a mass shooting in Sri Lanka, First Lady Melania Trump's ""Be Best"" anti-bullying campaign, and the former special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russia interference in the 2016 election. However, Conway, unprompted, brought up the 2020 candidates while talking about Mueller's investigation. She noted that Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., had jumped into the race. ""Whether it's one, whether it's nineteen, whether it's fifty, anything times zero equals zero. Simple multiplication,"" she said. ""So fifty Democrats can run. Twenty of them, nineteen are now running. But if your message is zero, it's a big zero."" Conway during another Fox News interview, this one on April 24, gave a White House response on Trump's attempts to resist subpoenas from House Democrats for administration officials, such as Attorney General Bill Barr. In addition, Conway spoke about the push by some House Democrats to impeach the president and the White House's actions to end the opioid crisis. Conway was also asked about Biden expecting to officially announce his presidential bid. When asked what the president thinks about a potential contest against Biden, Conway said: ""Bring it on, bring them all on."" “I think Biden's timing actually benefits him because the Democrats seem really desperate to find an alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is the clear announced frontrunner right now in the polling and on the ground,"" she said. ""Bernie Sanders has a lot in common with Donald Trump, which is he doesn't really care what his party thinks about his candidacy at this point in the primaries. ""The only difference between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is Bernie Sanders' ideas are terrible for America and Donald Trump is a much better candidate,"" she said. During an interview on CNN's ""Smerconish"" on April 27, Conway spoke about Trump's previous comments on the 2017 protests in Charlottesville, which included a white nationalists march. The president at the time said there were ""fine people"" on both sides. She went on to talk about Biden, who criticized Trump's response to the protests in Charlottesville in the announcement of his presidential campaign. ""He doesn't want to be held to account for his record, or lack thereof,"" she said of Biden. ""I found his announcement video unfortunate, certainly a missed opportunity. But also just very dark, and spooking. He doesn't have a vision for the future."" Just one day later, Conway was on CNN again to talk about what the administration is doing to fight back against the rising rate of anti-Semitic crimes in the United States. She later in the interview once again defended Trump's comments on Charlottesville. She again brought up Biden, saying that the former vice president ""brought it up because he has no vision and he doesn't want to be held to account for the Obama-Biden legacy."" CNN host Jake Tapper interrupted Conway, saying he wanted to go back to his question about the ""fine people"" Trump was talking about at the Charlottesville marches. Conway, once more, brought up Biden. ""For Joe Biden, who has been in public life, who was elected at 29, to come out and have no vision, no accountability for the Obama-Biden record, didn't even mention President Obama, but mentions Charlottesville to try to use that for political purposes,"" Conway said. Tapper again tried to direct the conversation away from Biden. However, Conway kept going back to the 2020 Democratic candidate. According to the Kerner's report, Conway was speaking to reporters outside the White House for about 30 minutes. A reporter asked Conway: ""You brought up Joe Biden several times unprompted. Do you guys see him –?"" ""How was it unprompted? He's the frontrunner!"" Conway replied. She went on to call the Democratic electorate ""sexist"" and ""racist"" because Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were the frontrunners. She said that ""two old white straight men career politicians"" have been leading in polls because the electorate has ""a problem with the rest of the field."" Kerner's report also cites another gaggle outside the White House on May 1, where Conway brought up Biden unprompted. ""So thanks for the free commercial about all the things Joe Biden didn't get done for the eight years he was vice president,"" she told reporters. Several of Conway's tweets were also flagged by the special counsel for her support of Republican candidates during the 2018 midterm elections. ""Missed you, #Michigan!"" she wrote. ""The stakes are high. The choice is clear."" Missed you, #Michigan!The stakes are high.The choice is clear.Vote on Tuesday for @SchuetteOnDuty @JohnJamesMI@MIGOPto protect prosperity and freedom.Get to the polls! pic.twitter.com/CU5rKGo3mE Just three days before the election, Conway sent out another tweet saying to vote for the GOP. Since February, Conway has also repeatedly tweeted about Democratic presidential candidates. She questioned Booker's decision to run for president in a tweet on Feb. 1. Several days later, Conway also tweeted about the president's re-election, saying ""I'mWithHim"" – a diss to his former 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. Clinton's campaign slogan was ""I'm With Her."" Conway also repeatedly criticized Warren in tweets posted on Feb. 11 and March 13. In a tweet on March 31, Conway also bashed Biden. That same day she also retweeted a video from Fox News Sunday, that quoted Conway saying ""If anybody just types in 'Creepy Uncle Joe Videos' you come up with a treasure trove."" She also replied to a tweet on May 7 from Donald Trump Jr., who was criticizing Obama's economy compared to his father. ""You mean the Obama-Biden economy,"" Conway wrote.",2019-06-13 20:11:35,All the times Kellyanne Conway ran afoul of a federal watchdog over the Hatch Act,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

A lone gunman armed with semi-automatic weapons attacked Muslims attending Friday prayers in Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island on March 15, killing 51 people in the country's worst peace-time mass shooting. The attacker broadcast the shooting live on Facebook. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern introduced tough new firearm laws banning semi-automatic weapons after the attack, which also wounded dozens more people. Brenton Tarrant, 29, a suspected white supremacist, appeared by video link from a maximum security facility in Auckland while his lawyer entered not guilty pleas on his behalf. The accusations against him include one terrorism charge. About 80 members of Christchurch's Muslim community and dozens of media representatives attended the hearing in a packed courtroom, with many seated in another room watching by video. High Court Justice Cameron Mander said the trial would begin on May 4. The prosecution expected the trial would take around six weeks, although Mander said defense lawyers believed it could take considerably longer. Courts normally try to bring cases to trial within a year but Mander said ""the scale and complexity of this case makes this challenging."" Tarrant has been remanded in custody until Aug. 15, when the next case review hearing is scheduled. Mander said Tarrant was fit to stand trial after the court ordered him on April 5 to undergo a mental health assessment. ""No issue arises regarding the defendant’s fitness to plead, to instruct counsel, and to stand his trial. A fitness hearing is not required,"" Mander said in a statement released after Friday's hearing. The court lifted an order last week suppressing the publication of pictures of Tarrant. An interim suppression order barring the publication of the identity of survivors also lapsed and will not be reinstated. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2019-06-13 21:46:30,"Christchurch mosque attack suspect pleads not guilty, trial set for next year",,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

News By Associated Press Submit June 14, 2019 | 5:47am RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is announcing a series of public talks his administration will host in the run up to a July 9 special session on gun laws. Northam’s office said Thursday that Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran and Secretary of Health and Human Resources Daniel Carey are hosting the roundtable discussions around the state. U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine will join some of the events. Northam announced the special session after a May 31 mass shooting in Virginia Beach. He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider several gun control measures. But Republicans have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they’ve said they’ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes. Read Next Japanese operator: Sailors saw 'flying objects' before oil...

They eventually walked around the block, processing their emotions and remembering their friend. “Neighbors started coming out in evenings at the spot and would walk through neighborhood, and the numbers started growing,” said Sherialyn Byrdsong, Ricky’s widow. “It was a healing time to share thoughts and feelings. We just realized the power and the healing of coming together from neighborhood walks. I saw that and experienced that.” A woman Sherialyn had met called her later in 1999 and said, “Let’s have a discussion about starting a race to commemorate his life.” Twenty years later, the Ricky Byrdsong Memorial Race Against Hate in Evanston brings in 5,000 runners every Father’s Day. Byrdsong, the former Northwestern basketball coach, died July 2, 1999, at age 43 after a white supremacist shot him in the back — in front of two of his young children — while he was out for a jog. The Race Against Hate — which includes 5K and 10K runs, walks and a youth mile — helps raise money for anti-racism and violence-prevention programs sponsored by the Evanston YWCA, which has hosted the event since 2007. “I don’t think of it as a fundraiser,” said Kelley Byrdsong, who was 10 and riding her bike — along with her 9-year-old brother, Ricky Jr. — next to her father when shots rang out on that fateful day. “You come for a cause that’s important and bigger than you. They’ve done a good job of continuing that message: ‘We won’t tolerate hate here. We stand against it.’ We all have different beliefs and values but we’re running this race together.” The race’s message has felt more urgent to participants in recent years, the Byrdsongs said. The number of hate groups in America rose to a record 1,020 in 2018, according the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that monitors domestic hate groups and extremists. It marks the fourth straight year of hate-group growth — a 30 percent increase since 2016 after three years of decline — the organization says. There was a 50 percent increase in white nationalist groups in 2018, according the SPLC. And there have been 167 mass shootings and 6,296 gun-related deaths this year, according to Gun Violence Archive. Before the 2015 and ’16 races, organizers held moments of silence to commemorate victims of mass shootings — the murders of nine at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., and the deaths of 50 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. “Every month — if not every week or every other week — there’s some kind of horrific mass shooting, hate crimes. It just has escalated so much,” Sherialyn Byrdsong said. “There’s a quote I ran across years ago. It says: ‘The only thing necessary for the spread of evil is for good people to do nothing.’ That gripped me. Those have been my marching orders ever since. “This Race Against Hate seems like it will be race of a lifetime, unfortunately. Our only hope is to continue to do all we can and just keep believing, keep hoping, keep acting. That’s the only choice.” Ricky Byrdsong was fatally shot by white supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, who went on a shooting spree targeting minorities over that Independence Day weekend in 1999 Smith, 21, also killed Won Joon Yon, a Korean-American college student on the campus of Indiana University; and wounded six Orthodox Jewish men in nearby West Rogers Park, two African-American men in Springfield, a Taiwanese man in Urbana and another African-American man in Decatur. Smith later fatally shot himself as police closed in on him during a car chase. Sherialyn Byrdsong said she made the choice after her husband was killed to devote her life to positivity. “Tragedy to victory” became her life motto. When she told her three children that their father had died, she read to them Bible verses Ecclesiastes 3:1-2: “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die.” Family and friends immediately surrounded her children. “You have so many people around you, you sort of forget that you’re in this tragedy,” Kelley Byrdsong said. “You have friends over the next day and you’re playing basketball outside in the driveway. How else would a 10-year-old come to grips to being shot at, your brother shot at, your dad shot and falling to the ground and that’s the last time you see him?” For Kelley Byrdsong, who recently turned 30, the coming month is especially emotional, she said, acknowledging she is still healing. The Race Against Hate and Father’s Day are Sunday. Her father’s birthday is June 24. And the anniversary of his death is about a week later. “This year has already felt harder than most years,” Kelley said. “It’s another milestone missed with my dad.” As a sixth-grade teacher in Humboldt Park, she said her students learn about the tragedy via the internet. She said many of her students have lost loved ones to gun violence and she strives to create a trauma-sensitive learning environment. But mostly she tries to live her life the way her father did. She remembers him as a “giant” with a massive smile. No matter his busy schedule, as Northwestern’s coach from 1993-97 and later as the vice president of community affairs for Aon, he set aside time to take his kids and their friends to the park or to go to events such as a Bulls game. “He had the biggest smile,” Kelley said. “He always made you feel like you were the only one in the room even when you weren’t. I never heard anyone tell a regular story about him.” She recalled stories of him helping a homeless man find a job or buying shoes for a child who attended his basketball camp. He never charged for his camps, which he made sure were diverse and incorporated personal development and cultural education. She said “God protected my heart,” noting she harbors no hatred for her father’s killer. “I always say if my dad were to have met Benjamin Smith, the man who shot and killed him, that I think he could have changed his life,” she said. Kelley also has worked for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence — a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control — confronting politicians about accepting money from gun lobbyists and failing to pass comprehensive background-check laws. “I would like to see every single person, whether you buy a gun online or in a store, have to pass a background check,” she said. “I would like to see heavy penalties for people who sell unlicensed guns or sell to people who have not passed a background check or would knowingly fail a background check. I would like to see us not sacrifice people over profits.” When the U.S. House in late February passed stricter gun-control measures, Kelley Byrdsong was invited to the signing and said that it felt like an accomplishment. But she also wondered about poor communities that often are left out of the conversation about gun violence. “I feel we can’t forget about our low-income, black and brown communities ravaged by gun violence,” she said. “When I’m in a room like that and there’s very few minorities in the room, whether politicians or people there as victims, I’m kind of disappointed. All voices need a seat at that table.” While she has been vocal and advocates for societal changes, Kelley said her greatest hope is that the world can improve through one-on-one relationship building. She wants the Race Against Hate to continue to spread a message of love, unity and acceptance. “I’m grateful for it because it does shine a light,” she said. “Something beautiful can come from something tragic. … I hope people in their everyday lives will treat other people with kindness. That’s how big movements start. That’s harder than being loud about it. When you’re protesting on the street, you’re with like-minded people. When you’re out in your community or grocery store or you see a man or woman who’s homeless on the streets, those are your opportunities. How do you live your everyday life?” That’s what her father did, she said. “Every single day was an opportunity for him to do something for someone,” she said. “It’s just how he lived.” The Race Against Hate, his family said, is a testament to how he lived — and how they want the world to be. “I feel like the race has really become one of Evanston’s trophies in terms of showing how a community can respond to a tragedy,” Sherialyn said. “An event that is hateful, we turned it into a unifying and positive response. It’s a living demonstration of the power of love over hate.” sryan@chicagotribune.com Twitter @sryantribune CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-06-14 08:00:00,"20 years after Ricky Byrdsong was murdered, the Race Against Hate continues in Evanston: 'It's a living demonstration of the power of love over hate'",,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

(Courtesy The WTA Group)  It says a lot when a young filmmaker works for free to focus on forgiveness. It says even more when survivors of a mass shooting by a white supremacist forgive the killer. Yet that is exactly what several survivors did just 48 hours after Dylann Roof murdered nine people four years ago in a Charleston, S.C., church. Now, a feature-length documentary focusing on those who were in the Bible study class when the shooting happened will debut Monday and Wednesday, June 17 and 19, in 900 movie theaters across the nation. Called “Emanuel” for Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where the tragedy occurred, the film is produced by actress Viola Davis and Golden State Warriors basketball star Stephen Curry. Appropriately sober and somber and with a theme of forgiveness, the movie also promises to be uplifting. Perhaps more than anything, however, it allows us to reflect on our own thoughts and struggles with forgiveness — a hallmark of nearly every religion on Earth. Even the band The Dixie Chicks examined the issue in a song called “Not Ready to Make Nice.” “Forgive, sounds good,” Natalie Maines sings. “Forget, I’m not sure I could.” Brian Ivie, the director of “Emanuel,” is so spiritually distant from typical Hollywood it’s difficult to believe he lives in Los Angeles. But the 28-year-old graduate of USC’s film school does and manages to thrive. You see, Ivie’s made of sturdy stuff. He’s even brave enough to admit that he believes — really believes — in God. He also lives his faith. Although he qualifies as a struggling filmmaker, he declined pay on “Emanuel” because he didn’t want to profit from other people’s suffering. I first met Ivie nearly a decade ago when he was a teenager and had just made a movie that he managed to show at a local cineplex. Three years later, this auteur wrote, directed and produced a film called “The Drop Box” (available on Amazon), about a pastor in South Korea who put out a box for abandoned babies, nurtured the children and found them homes. Raised in San Clemente, Ivie put together a volunteer crew for “Drop Box,” flew 6,000 miles and slept at the orphanage because he was broke, but also because he wanted to be close to his subjects. How close? When the kids got sick, Ivie got sick. He ended up winning the grand prize of $101,000 at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival, meaning he pretty much broke even. While in Korea, Ivie explains, something invisible was born that remains priceless to this day — an intimate connection to the Gospel. Back then, Ivie boldly promised “to go into the belly of the beast in Hollywood” and make films about faith. “We need,” he said, “to change the whole game.” Fat chance, I thought. Hollywood is just too seductive. Just a few days before his latest film debuts across America, Ivie recalls his reaction when he first learned about the Charleston shootings. He was on his honeymoon in Cancun and was reading his Bible on the balcony when he heard his wife crying. He ran inside and found her watching television. Two days before, they learned, a racist had slaughtered a group of African Americans during Bible study. For people of faith, the act felt especially evil. “There is something particularly heartbreaking,” President Barack Obama told the nation, “about death happening in a place in which we seek solace.” Ivie goes back to that dark day and allows, “It was one of the greatest times of my life clashing with one of the worst times for other people. “I really didn’t know how to process it.” At the time, his wife, an account rep for Snapchat, told her husband, “You don’t understand. The family members are forgiving the killer in court right now.” Ivie quietly offered, “I hope whoever tells their story doesn’t skip that part. “It’s something supernatural.” Ivie never forgot that day. But because he wasn’t African American, it didn’t feel right to presume he was the right director for the project. A year later, he flew to New York for a different project to talk to Pastor Dimas Salaberrios, founder of Infinity Bible Church and a worldwide preacher. But Salaberrios sensed Ivie’s heart wasn’t in the topic they were discussing. “What story do you really want to tell?” Salaberrios asked. Ivie immediately replied, “I want to tell the story of what happened in Charleston.” Salaberrios understood. He had traveled to Charleston immediately after the shootings to help console the grieving. With the backing of a group of people Ivie met at a home in Connecticut, Salaberrios and Ivie were soon on their way to Charleston to lay groundwork for bringing in a film crew. At first, it was, well, awkward. But when the survivors learned that forgiveness was the theme, Ivie was welcomed with tears of gratitude. “Some died,” Ivie explains, “with Bibles in their hands.” Ephesians tells us, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” It’s a simple sentence, but an exceptionally challenging one. Ivie shares he, too, struggles. “In my life I am always trying to find where God is when life doesn’t make sense.” There are times, he admits, “I wonder how God allows things to go on.” Yet over several months of filming in Charleston, Ivie found insight. One of the witnesses, Polly Sheppard, shared — just as she shares in the film — her feelings about the killer, “I wasn’t going to let it eat me the rest of my life, you know? So I had to forgive him.” Nadine Collier, who lost her mother, Ethel Lance, in the bloodshed, was another of the first to forgive. “I knew that’s what my mom would want,” she explains. “Not to have hatred in your heart, despite what people do to you.” Still, as most of us know first-hand, forgiveness can be elusive. Collier’s 52-year-old sister, Esther Lance, a year after the shooting said publicly, “I’m still grieving too much to forgive.” Regardless, Lance continues to attend the landmark African American church founded in 1816 and when she does, she always thinks of her mother. “I go through that room,” Lance confides, “and say, ‘Hey, Mama, I made it to church.’” As filming continued, crew and church members built bonds. Survivors even invited Ivie over for dinner on several occasions. “These people live out that kind of faith and love on a daily basis,” Ivie shares, “and I got to see that up close and personal. “Instead of having their faith shattered,” he explains, “they found empowerment to help heal others.” At a recent screening at Howard University, Curry offered his own personal perspective. “I try to picture myself, like, would I have the awareness to respond that way? “Would I have the maturity and the courage and the strength to say, ‘This isn’t going to defeat me’?” Although “Emanuel” also will be available in September through iTunes and Amazon, Ivie hopes people watch it in theaters. “Cinemas are one of the few places where you can experience something together at the same time,” the director points out, “and that can lead to healing and change. “People praying together, black and white.” June 17 marks the anniversary of the killings. June 19 honors the day survivors walked into court and told the killer they forgave. For more, go to emanuelmovie.com. Get the latest news delivered daily!

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Former DEA Special Agent David Katz breaks down the details of a deadly shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The night before Kate Nixon and 11 others were murdered by a disgruntled co-worker, the decade-long Virginia Beach city employee talked with her husband about bringing a gun to work for self-defense -- a decision that was taken out of her hands by the city's ban on employees carrying firearms at work, a Nixon family lawyer said. Now, Nixon's family is calling for an independent investigation into events leading up to the May 31 shooting and what could have been done differently before and during it, particularly given the explicit concerns about shooter DeWayne Craddock. “Kate expressed to her husband concerns about this individual in particular, as well as one other person,” Nixon family attorney Kevin Martingayle told WHRV's ""HearSay with Cathy Lewis"" radio show Monday.  “In fact, they had a discussion the night before about whether or not she should take a pistol and hide it in her handbag -- and decided not to, ultimately, because there's a policy apparently against having any kind of weapons that are concealed in the building."" The casket of Virginia Beach shooting victim Katherine Nixon is wheeled to a hearse after a funeral service at St. Gregory The Great Catholic Church in Virginia Beach, Va Thursday, June 6, 2019. Nixon was killed along with eleven others during a mass shooting last Friday. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) The city of Virginia Beach prohibits employees from carrying ""any weapon"" while working or on city property, unless authorized by a supervisor. The city policy notes: ""The prohibition against possession of a weapon applies even if a member has a permit to carry a concealed weapon."" FAMILY OF VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING VICTIM CALLS FOR EXTERNAL INVESTIGATION An employee violating the policy would not be in violation of the law -- but they would be breaking rules set by their place of employment. ""Employees who violate this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal,"" the city policy states. Julie Hill, Director of the Communications Office at Virginia Beach, said some on the City Council were considering making it illegal rather than just a policy violation if employees carried a gun at work. In Virginia, however, cities aren't allowed to make it illegal for licensed permit holders to carry, so the City Council would merely be considering recommending the state allow them to impose legal penalties on such employees. ""There is an item on next week’s City Council meeting for the Council to discuss a resolution to support a bill to allow localities to prohibit the carrying of firearms in governmental buildings,"" Hill told FoxNews.com. She also pointed to a statement the city released about the shooting. Va. GOV RALPH NORTHAM ANNOUNCES JULY LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON GUNS IN RESPONSE TO VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING Martingayle, meanwhile, is still focused on figuring how that shooting could have been prevented in the first place. “We've heard a lot of information out there suggesting there were a lot of concerns about the shooter well before this happened,"" he told WHRV. ""We need to know more about that. An outside investigation is the perfect vehicle to get to the truth. That's it. This is a search for truth by a grieving family."" Nixon was a widely respected member of the community, as Martingayle noted on the radio show. “She was president of her civic league, she was involved with the swim team... she would have been celebrating her 20th Anniversary next month.” Nixon left behind a husband and three young daughters.

(Courtesy City of Virginia Beach via AP) Gun rights advocates say armed citizens are important for preventing mass shootings. “A so-called “gun free zone” does not make people safer, because the only person who’ll have a gun is the person who violates the policy...it’s really a ‘Victim Disarmament Zone’,” Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told Fox News. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE ZERO IN ON SHOOTER'S WEAPONS CACHE AND JOB BACKGROUND In Virginia Beach, the murders took place in an area that required an employee keycard to access, so anyone with authorization to enter was required to be disarmed. Gottlieb says he often hears from public employees who are frustrated that they can’t defend themselves at work. “I get a lot crossing my desk of employees who work in state or city governments who are upset that they can't bring a gun to work protect themselves and want to know if their rights are being violated,"" he said. ""They contact the Second Amendment Foundation all the time.” Several groups advocating more restrictions on guns didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment. But such groups have said previously the best way to prevent shootings is additional gun laws. Brady United praised Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for proposing new bans in the wake of the shooting, “including action on suppressors, a ban on assault weapons, and expansion of local authority to regulate firearms.” Brady United, in a press release, added they “applauded [Northam’s] announcement, hailing it as an opportunity for Virginia legislators to take action to prevent the next mass shooting.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Gottlieb says allowing civilians to carry is often the best line of defense against mass shootings and decried how long it's taken for Nixon's story to come out. “Nobody in the media picked up on that,"" he said, ""And quite honestly I would have to assume that’s agenda driven -- a lot of people in the media believe that, you know, firearms are evil, so they wouldn't report on the fact that somebody wanted to have a firearm to protect themselves,"" Maxim Lott is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.

327,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/15/trump-comedy-political-satire-daily-show-stewart-colbert-bee-227151,"POLITICO Illustration; Getty Images; iStock Culture Club Once, wry satire ruled. Today itâs all outrage and punching upâand itâs not always clear where the joke is. By JOANNA WEISS June 15, 2019 Joanna Weiss is a writer in Boston and the editor of Experience magazine. President Donald Trump likes to think of himself as a statesman, an author, an A-level negotiator, but at heart, heâs one thing: an insult comic. Every day in D.C. is a roast, the insults and belittling nicknames wielded like tiny comedy bullets. And if you havenât seen enough of the fusillade on Twitter, all you need to do is turn on late night TV. Television comedy has a strange, symbiotic relationship with the real political world, something between a feedback loop and a funhouse mirror. The Smothers Brothers flirted with the subversive side of the 1960s; the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal of the â90s was filtered through Jay Lenoâs guffawing misogyny. And then, from 1999 through roughly the start of the Trump administration, the prevailing comedy tone was a kind of ironic detachment, perfected by Jon Stewart on âThe Daily Show.â Odds are, even if you barely watched the show, you can still picture the Jon Stewart repertoire: the knowing pop culture references, the sharp satire, the wry take on America at large. His go-to move was perplexity at the absurdity of it all, and the message was detached and a little self-deprecating: If politics was absurd, well, so were we. âYou have to remember one thing about the will of the people,â he once said. âIt wasnât that long ago that we were swept away by the Macarena.â Stewart did make fun of both parties, but his style was fundamentally liberal, says University of Delaware communications professor Dannagal Young: playful, subversive, at once cynical and weirdly optimistic. It was far different, she argues, from the tone of Fox News talk-show hosts, who draw an audience for reasons that are âalmost physiological.â Social science research has shown that liberals and conservatives are (on average) wired differently, with social and cultural conservatives personally more attuned to danger, worried about intruders, primed to protect an establishment under threat. Thereâs no greater threat to the liberal establishment than Donald Trump. And in the past three years, something about comedy has shifted. In class, Young has her college students diagram late-night jokes and label the incongruitiesâthe hidden arguments that arenât actually stated in the text. When they come to the May 2018 moment when Samantha Bee, in a rant about immigration on her TBS show âFull Frontal,â called Ivanka Trump a âfeckless c---,â the exercise breaks down. The line drew a laugh, but there was nothing to puzzle out. No irony, no distance. She just meant it. âThere was no incongruity in what she did,â says Young, whose upcoming book, Irony and Outrage, examines the psychological underpinnings of political entertainment. âI donât care sheâs used the c-word a bunch. I care that she, like, didnât make a joke.â Or maybe Bee had made a joke, but a joke for the era of Trump. Like the red meat at Trumpâs rallies, it was pitched to the base, satisfying in the way that calling someone a âlibtardâ feels for people on the right; less a wry observation than a hard push back against a persistent enemy or a looming threat. If Trump has changed the tone of the presidency, heâs done the same for TV humor, creating a kind of insult comedy for the Resistance: less subtle, less civilâand, strangely, more conservative. *** Jon Stewart is often tagged as left-leaningâand itâs true that he was secretly invited to the Obama White Houseâbut what he really represented wasnât a political perspective so much as a distance from the fray. His âDaily Showâ persona was fit for a deeply cynical age: a naïve, detached observer, trying to navigate the news, who kept stumbling across absurdity. His signature move was a reaction shot: after a news clip would play, the camera would return to Stewart, his eyes popping out as if his innocence were shattered by some fresh horror. His targets werenât only politicians; he skewered the media, lobbyists, the whole self-aggrandizing, self-perpetuating system that made politics so frustrating. And he could be mercilessly bipartisan: In one 2015 segment that predicted Trumpâs nickname, he mocked Joe Bidenâs handsiness. One punchline was a faux book called âThe Audacity of Grope.â Then along came Trump, who wasnât part of the system at all, and thus didnât fit into Stewartâs man-versus-the-machine framework. The day Trump descended a Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy, in June 2015, Stewart was ecstatic. He treated the real-estate-mogul-turned-reality-star not as a viable player, but a professional clown. âAmericaâs id is running for president!â he gushed. At the end of the segment, he and two âDaily Showâ correspondents mimicked having orgasms. Stewart left the show a few weeks afterward, part of a long-planned retirement. He wasnât on the air to document the ongoing campaign, the collective realization that Trump wasnât just a punchline, and the joke was on the establishment. Still, he was onto something about Trump. The 45th president is undeniably funnyâinnately entertaining, whether he intends to be or not. Partly, thatâs because heâs more ridiculous than anything the sharpest writerâs room could cook up. (The final season of âVeepâ felt like a loose transcription of the 2016 race; there was no better material.) Even Trumpâs rare moments of public self-awareness can be legitimately amusing: he drew chuckles at the United Nations last September, when he said his administration âhas accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,â but he got a big, fully appreciative laugh with his ad-libbed follow-up: âDidnât expect that reaction, but thatâs OK.â By and large, though, Trumpâs humor is different from droll, intellectual wit. âItâs impulse-based and itâs hyperbolic,â Young says, and its broadness is a key to his political appeal. His insanely impolitic language sends the media reaching for Xanax, but to his fans, itâs ongoing proof of his authenticity. At the start of his administration, many speculated that Trump would turn more measured and sober once he felt the gravitas of the office. But his insult-comic persona isnât artifice; he canât be shamed or cajoled into being anyone but himself.  Thatâs great for his base. Most conservatives, love him or not, have found ways to brush off his rhetoric as Trump being Trump. But liberals see the language as not just authentic, but dangerousâthey draw a straight line from the speeches and tweets to the murderous white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, caged kids on the Mexican border, and nuclear retaliation threats directed toward Kim Jong Un. So the chorus of left-leaning comedians who evaluate Trump every night has switched from detached amusement to sounding the warning bells. And in posture, if not politics, the language often matches what Young has observed about conservative outrage. Not only is it positioned against fighting a threat, itâs also straightfoward in perspectiveânot a multilayered critique of a system, but a blunt road map for politicized anger. âWhen satire is doing a good job, itâs not just punching up. Itâs reminding us of our complicity,â Young says. But thereâs no double meaning in outrage: âOutrage tells you, âHere is the thing, here is the thing thatâs bad, here is the thing thatâs good. â¦ It says exactly what it should conclude. You donât have to draw conclusions.â That change might be personified, these days, by âDaily Showâ veteran Stephen Colbert, whose Comedy Central show, âThe Colbert Report,â was a masterpiece of cynical-age satire: a sustained, high-energy, high-wire parody of Fox Newsâ Bill OâReilly, in which the comedian played a blowhard conservative host named âStephen Colbert.â The show ended, and the character was retired, before Trump entered the 2016 race. And a few months into Trumpâs candidacy, Colbert took over CBSâ âThe Late Show,â this time appearing as himself. Candidate Trump was one of real Colbertâs first guests, and while the appearance didnât produce a moment as iconic as Jimmy Fallonâs hair-mussing, Colbert cheerfully let Trump repeat his campaign lines about building a wall that Mexico would pay for. The humor, at the time, was in the contrast between Trumpâs unapologetic Trumpiness and Colbertâs bemused reaction. But these days, when he talks about Trump, Colbert isnât so easygoing; his jokes are more vicious and often less surprising. In a mid-May âLate Showâ monologue, Colbert described a recent Trumpian insult: comparing 2020 Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg to the MAD Magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. âI see the similarity,â Colbert said, âin that they both are more qualified to be president than Donald Trump.â The audience roared, the band played a little victory tune, and Colbert, smiling, muttered under his breath, âThey all came for that joke.â Colbert has changed less than Bee, his fellow âDaily Showâ alum. In 2015, Bee was part of the âDaily Showâ sketch that mocked Joe Biden for groping. She played a star-struck, self-deluded reporter who had just come from a one-on-one interview with Biden, and now had brightly-colored hand marks on her chest and rear end. (She cheerfully explained that the then-vice president had just been touching chalk, strawberry preserves, motor oil and Cheetos.) The joke lay, again, in the disconnect: The audience knew Bidenâs behavior was wrong, but the establishment, represented by Bee, pretended it was perfectly normal. Today, Beeâs faux innocence is gone; her âFull Frontalâ persona understands everything thatâs happening. Her fury is directed not just at Trump, but at everyone on the right; she apologized for the c-word episode, but her anger hasnât faded. A recent segment on Alabamaâs stringent new abortion law, âSex Ed for Senators,â explained that when a woman is designated six weeks pregnant, it actually measures the number of weeks from her last period, not from the moment of conception. âBet you didnât know uteruses were also time travelers,â Bee said. âThatâs science, bitch!â Like many late-night comedians, Bee has also become more didactic, delivering researched lessons about the dangers of Trumpâs favored policies. On HBOâs âLast Week Tonight,â John Oliver, another âDaily Showâ veteran, offers up even more facts: The central component of his show is a weekly Rachel Maddow-style lecture, only slightly more lighthearted, sprinkled with jokes that are often hilarious, but are also basically non sequiturs. The Netflix show, âPatriot Act with Hasan Minhajâ (starring another âDaily Showâ alum), and Seth Meyersâ âA Closer Lookâ segment on NBCâs âLate Nightâ serve up similar material. Itâs comedy, in the sense that it contains setups and punch lines. But it isnât necessarily fun. As the tone has shifted, itâs not hard to find a clamor for old Jon Stewartâa longing on the part of partisans, critics and fans that even has bled into academic research. Ethan Porter, an assistant professor at The George Washington University, notes that multiple studies have documented Fox Newsâ influence on conservative Americansâtracking how increased Fox News ratings have correlated not just with Republican shares of the vote, but with judgesâ likelihood to impose longer prison sentences. âWhat you think of as âsoft media,â whether itâs humor or celebrity journalism,â Porter says, âpeople can actually be impacted by that, in ways that are interesting and surprising.â In May, Porter and his colleague Thomas Wood, an Ohio State political scientist, published a paper in the journal Electoral Studies with the irresistible headline, âDid Jon Stewart Elect Donald Trump?ââthough, as with most clickbait, the actual point was more nuanced: the authors claimed that the decline in âDaily Showâ ratings after Stewart left correlated with a higher share of Republican votes in 2016. But that turned out not to be true: After they found a computational error in their data, the authors retracted their study a week after publication. But the absence of hard proof, Porter says, doesnât mean the theory isnât trueâand theyâre continuing to explore ways that the changing landscape of TV comedy has altered the outcomes of American elections. They may just need to factor in the fact that comedy has changedâas has Stewart himself. Itâs not just his increased likelihood to deliver dead-serious congressional testimony, as he did this week before a House Judiciary subcommittee, pleading for compensation for 9/11 first-responders. Itâs not just the regret heâs voiced for treating Trump as such a joke in the beginning. He also sounds different when he pops up from time to time for a comedy bit, appearing as a kind of sage, greying Jewish Yoda who pretends to be living under Colbertâs âLate Showâ desk. In one Colbert appearance last summer, Stewartâs comic timing was as good as ever, but his rhetoric was less playful. âNo matter what you do, it always comes with an extra layer of gleeful cruelty and dickishness,â he said, looking into the camera and addressing Trump directly. Then he turned to immigration, saying, again to Trump, âBoy, you f---ed that up.â The audience laughed and cheered. But it wasnât the kind of sharp satire that had made Stewart such a meaningful cultural figure in the first place. As outrage, however, it does contain something that satire lacks, Young says: a consistent call to action. That feels like the purpose of this brand of late night comedyânot to wryly observe the world and encourage us all to do better, but to harness peopleâs anger, make them ready to revolt. What effect that will have is open to debate; historically, itâs hard to draw a straight line between jokes and votes. But comedy, like all entertainment, can broaden awareness, rile up the base, focus attention on issues that drive emotions. It could be that this new tone will be a left wing mobilizing force. The midterm elections drew unusually high numbers of Democratic voters; some predict a similar wave in 2020. Late night comedy could be a small part of that movement. But if that happens, it will be because comedians were less like Jon Stewartâthe original versionâand more likeSean Hannity and Trump. California By Jeremy B.

Tate said she was by the meat section Friday when she heard “about six or seven shots.” She dropped to the ground and crawled toward her daughter, who was at the other end. They huddled until they and more than 100 others were able to escape. Inside, Kenneth French, 32, of Riverside lay dead next to two of his relatives, who remain in critical condition. French was shot after he attacked an off-duty Corona police officer who was holding his child, according to the Corona Police Department. The officer, whose name is being withheld, suffered minor injuries and was released; his child was not injured. Corona is an inland Southern California suburb about 50 east of downtown Los Angeles. Police have opened an investigation. Not surprisingly, the sounds of shots ringing out inside the cavernous bulk-shopping store caused shoppers to panic. Many stampeded for the doors, and others dived for safety amid the aisles stocked with food and household items. Witnesses said they saw a man with a Mohawk haircut arguing with someone near a freezer section when shots thundered at least six times. Shrieks from inside the store were heard on video recorded by shopper Tate, who had her daughter in tow. “I saw people and heard shots and my first thought was, ‘Jesus, is this another mass shooting?’” she said. “I didn’t know if this was a random thing or a domestic thing or if this was a mass shooting. Everything was happening so fast, I just wanted to get me and my kid to safety.” In the video, her daughter says, “Mommy, we need to go.” Christina Colis told the Riverside Press-Enterprise that she was in the produce area when she heard six to seven shots and hid with other shoppers in a refrigerated produce room. She said her mother saw people injured on the floor. “I thought maybe someone dropped a bottle of wine, but then I kept hearing shots,” Will Lungo told the Press-Enterprise newspaper. “An employee came in and helped us out through the emergency exit.” Witnesses told KCAL-TV that shoppers and employees rushed to the exits. The station reported that more than 100 people were outside the store at one point. Left behind inside the store were purses, cellphones and backpacks from panicked shoppers, Corona police said. The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement Saturday that it was launching its own investigation into the shooting. Lt. Jeff Edwards of the Corona Police Department told reporters just after the incident that police believed the shooting resulted from a dispute of some kind. ""From my understanding, from some people we talked to, there was apparently an argument inside,"" Edwards said.

The officer fired his gun, hitting French and two of French's relatives, the department said. French was killed, the department said. The relatives are in critical conditions at hospitals. The officer, whose identity is being withheld, was treated and released at a nearby hospital, and the officer's child was not injured, the department said. The officer was the only person who fired shots in the store, the department said. The shooting prompted a stampede of frightened shoppers to flee the store east of Los Angeles and seek cover inside.

Correspondent-At-Large New details have emerged in the deadly shooting Friday night inside a Southern California Costco. Police now say an unnamed off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer shot and killed 32-year-old Kenneth French while holding his own child in his arms after French allegedly attacked him in an unprovoked incident near the Corona, California, store’s freezer section, according to NBC News. Two of French’s family members were also injured in the shooting. Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said Sunday it will be up to LAPD Chief Michel Moore whether to put the unidentified officer on leave. The police have made no statements about his condition or his status with the department after the shooting. The LAPD is conducting an internal investigation into the shooting while Corona police and the Riverside County district attorney’s office conduct a criminal probe. According to a preliminary investigation, the officer fired his weapon six times after French allegedly “assaulted” him “without provocation” as the officer held his child, Corona police said Saturday. French was the lone person killed in the incident and the officer’s gun is the only weapon involved in the shooting, according to Tobias Kouroubacalis with the Corona Police Dept. Several people, including the LAPD off-duty officer, were hospitalized with injuries. The officer’s child was unharmed. Initial reports suggested that French had opened fire inside the store, but police have now clarified that the gun involved in the incident belonged to the police officer, Corona police said. It is unclear if the off-duty LAPD officer fired his own weapon or his department-issued gun, and why. The LAPD allows off-duty officers to carry concealed weapons as long as they are authorized for on-duty use, according to the police manual, the Associated Press reported. “The Department has initiated an Administrative Investigation and is working with the Corona Police Department to learn more about the incident,” Los Angeles police said in a statement published by CNN. “From my understanding, from some people we talked to, there was apparently an argument inside,” Lt. Jeff Edwards of the Corona police department told reporters. “Some type of argument and ensued into a gun shot.” Most of the injuries occurred when shoppers scrambled to leave the store and became stuck when the emergency doors were blocked, according to local news reports. Shoppers described scenes of panicked chaos as they fled the store. Customer Nikki Tate described to NBC how she hid her young daughter when shooting erupted. “I crawled around to where she was and it was hysteria,” she said. “I didn’t know if this was another mass shooting.”",2019-06-16 10:10:31,Off-Duty LAPD Cop Holding Child Shot California Costco Shopper Following Argument,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

338,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/16/how-stephen-curry-produced-documentary-explores-forgiveness-in-charleston-church-shooting/,"Trending: By Jamie Aten | Special To The Washington Post Monday marks the four-year-anniversary of when nine members of a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, were shot to death, setting off a national debate about gun violence. The documentary “Emanuel,” which will be in theaters nationwide Monday and Wednesday, focuses on the surviving family members, who shocked people when they stood in court just 48 hours later and offered forgiveness to shooter Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old self-professed white supremacist. The film, executive produced by Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis and NBA superstar Stephen Curry, explores the untold stories after the 2015 shooting at the historic black church Mother Emanuel AME. In an interview that has been edited for length, documentary director Brian Ivie discussed how “Emanuel” handles the complex tensions around the familiar Christian tradition of forgiveness. Q: What first drew you to the “Emanuel” project? A: I had just gotten married in June 2015, and I was on my honeymoon in New York. I walked into the bedroom, and my wife was crying. She told me nine people had been shot in their Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. Then she looked at me and said, “You don’t understand, they’re forgiving him. The family members are forgiving the murderer.” I remember looking at her and saying, “I hope whoever tells that story doesn’t skip that part.” It was that moment for me — encountering this radical, scandalous forgiveness and love for the murderer — that drew me into the story. I wanted the world to know that part of the story. Q: What was different in this story? A: It was that they loved him. It was this moment when (survivor) Felicia Sanders said something to him that really changed me: “We enjoyed you.” When I go out and talk about the film, I’m not just talking about them forgiving him because they wanted to be emotionally free from him. I’m talking about a kind of love you rarely see. Their love for the shooter was a love that said, “I will bear the full weight of the wrong,” which is the highest kind of love — a love for your enemy. Q: Stephen Curry and Viola Davis are billed as producers. Can you tell me a little bit about their involvement with the film? A: Viola is a champion for justice for the oppressed, for the marginalized, disenfranchised and for those who have no voice, so she comes at this story in that way. But Viola is also from South Carolina and is a Christian woman. So she was deeply moved and broken by the story and wanted to ensure that the world didn’t forget about it. In her heart, she’s an activist. Stephen, who is known very widely as a Christian athlete and a voice for faith, wanted to align himself with a story that shared his faith in a way that he really felt was compelling and authentic and not typically what you see in a lot of Christian media, which is typically very neatly packaged and doesn’t really feel like real life. This is his first film he’d done in Hollywood and a way for him to make a statement. Q: Throughout the interviews many of the survivors and people you interviewed had talked about the past and present challenges around race issues as well as other injustices that the mass shooting put a spotlight on. Can you talk about these? A: We usually say we’ll never forget things like 9/11 or the Boston bombing, or the Holocaust, but many really want to forget about slavery and Jim Crow laws. It’s too close for comfort. Many white people get defensive whenever racism is brought up and say, “I’m not a racist.” Racism is a systematic problem, burned into our systems of criminal justice. I think a lot of people in the African-American community feel like there’s never going to be any true healing, because there’s never been any true repentance. White privilege is part of a legacy in our country of white supremacy. Q: You include a few short segments of the shooter, including him entering and exiting the church, being pulled over and later interviewed by police, and at trial. What would you say to individuals who might disapprove of footage of the shooter being used in the documentary? A: It’s important for people to know that the families were the first people to see the film. The movie you’ve seen is the movie they saw way before any other audiences. We were able to go through a process of accountability so they felt personally like this was the way the story should be told, and they all loved and blessed the movie. It’s the same reason people, when they make war movies, have to show the carnage, because that’s part of honoring the suffering that people went through and showing that evil itself. I wanted to expose the problem. It’s what life is actually like. You see a lot of good, you see a lot of bad. There is a deep dichotomy, a deep duplicity in the human condition. Q: What do you hope that the viewers will take away from the response of Mother Emanuel AME? A: There is a sense that God is present and that he has also promised that there will be a day when there will be perfect justice and that he will wipe away every tear and that he will bring to pass the kind of world and kingdom where we won’t have to have security guards at our doors. We won’t have to frisk people as we hug them in our church services. Q: What do you think might be some ways people of faith can address gun violence? A: Something has to change. For the film, there wasn’t enough surface area to deal with that issue head-on, because it would have taken over the movie entirely. There are a lot of key nonprofits that I follow like March for Our Lives. People like Tom Hughes is leveraging his privilege and influence to try to end gun violence and try to lobby for that. I recommend connecting with organizations that are doing it and are close to the issue. Q: How can churches balance being welcoming with safety concerns? A: Many of the family members (at Emanuel) would say they would still welcome anybody. That is a mind-bending idea. But that church also has more security. Related Articles

Greg Abbott enacted a two-year spending bill this weekend that included a $1 million public safety campaign for firearm storage opposed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun rights activists. Abbott, a Republican, approved the $250 billion budget without any line-item vetoes. The money would go to the Texas Department of Public Safety to design and deploy a campaign promoting safe gun storage, similar to those warning against drunk driving and encouraging motorists to use their seatbelt. A bill to write the program into state law was opposed by the NRA and gun-rights activists and did not reach a vote.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images, File) An NRA lobbyist told lawmakers that a campaign designed by Texas state police could be corrupted by anti-gun rhetoric. However, the money was approved by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives and later supported by Senate budget negotiators by mid-May. TEXAS GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL LEGALIZING KIDS' LEMONADE STANDS The program comes into effect following a mass shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston that killed 10 people and wounded 13 others in May 2018. Investigators said the then-17-year-old gunman took his father's weapons before opening fire. After that shooting, Abbott said he wanted to ""encourage the millions of law-abiding, gun-owning Texans to embrace their personal responsibility for gun safety.""

CONCORD, Calif. – A San Francisco Bay Area man posted anti-Semitic threats in an online chatroom and threatened to commit a mass shooting at a synagogue, police said. Ross Farca, 23, of Concord, is charged with making criminal threats, possession of an illegal assault rifle and manufacturing an assault rifle, Concord police said in a statement posted to Facebook on Friday. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, according to The East Bay Times. Bail was set at $125,000. Authorities found an illegal AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, Nazi literature, camouflage clothes, a sword and high-capacity magazines in his home last Monday, the statement said. Police said records showed that Farca legally purchased an incomplete AR-15 rifle frame earlier this year, which was later used to construct a complete weapon. The FBI found Farca's comments online, which included threats to shoot law enforcement and claims that he had an assault rifle, Concord police said. Farca did not specify any locations. The East Bay Times reported Farca used Steam, a popular video game platform, where his screen name ""Adolf Hitler (((6 Million)))"" was an apparent reference to the number of Jewish people killed during the Holocaust. Farca reportedly wrote about being inspired by the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, calling the shooter there a ""hero,"" and the Poway synagogue shooting in San Diego, according to The East Bay Times. ""I would probably get a body count of like 30 (Jews) and then like five police officers because I would also decide to fight to the death,"" court records say Farca wrote in one post. Court records show that Farca was placed in a mental health hold in 2011 after fighting with police who had responded to a family dispute at his home. A worker at the Regional Center of East Bay, a facility that helps people with developmental disabilities, told authorities in 2015 she believed Farcia fit the profile of a school shooter. It was not immediately clear if Farca had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

346,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jun/17/migrant-children-s-lockup-protested-man/,"Migrant children'slockup protested HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Clutching signs and umbrellas against a downpour, scores of people protested Sunday outside a South Florida facility that has become the nation's biggest location for detaining migrant children. A coalition of religious groups and immigrant advocates said they want the Homestead detention center closed. Lucy Duncan, an official with the American Friends Service Committee, asked protesters for a moment of silence to remember children who have died in federal custody, though not at the Homestead facility. Organizer Kristin Kumpf said 800 people from 22 states had RSVP'd for the protest held on Father's Day. Advocates have filed legal documents trying to force President Donald Trump's administration to quickly release migrant children from the Florida detention center, which officials said in April could house up to 3,200 migrant teens. The advocates accuse the administration of violating a decades-old settlement that they say requires migrant children to be promptly released to relatives or other sponsors, or sent to child care facilities. The migrant advocates have filed court papers with hundreds of pages of teens describing ""prison-like"" conditions endured in the Homestead facility. Man impersonatedofficer, police say A Virginia man was charged with impersonating a police officer after a Maryland State trooper saw him attempt a traffic stop on Interstate 695 near Baltimore on Saturday, police said Sunday. Timothy Ervin Trivett, 54, of Yorktown was wearing body armor, a badge, uniform and what appeared to be police equipment when a state trooper pulled up behind his 2012 black and white Chevrolet Impala on the outer loop of the interstate Saturday night. State police said Trivett stopped a gray Honda Accord about 8:30 p.m. near I-695 at Green Spring Avenue and attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the driver. His Impala had blue and white flashing lights. The trooper had been watching Trivett's vehicle weaving in and out of traffic and followed him. When Trivett succeeded in pulling the motorist over, the trooper pulled in behind him and spoke with him, according to state police spokesman Elena Russo. ""He noticed something just wasn't right,"" Russo said. ""There was something about the way the individual responded to the trooper's questions about what he was doing there on the scene. Trivett couldn't show credentials that he had any police powers."" According to court records, Trivett was charged with impersonating a police officer, which is a misdemeanor. He also faces four gun charges. State police are still investigating. Gun-storage fundscleared in Texas AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has approved a spending bill that includes a $1 million public safety campaign for firearm storage. The Republican signed a $250 billion two-year budget Saturday without any line-item vetoes. It includes money for the Texas Department of Public Safety to promote a safe gun storage campaign.

347,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/oj-simpson-police-chases-los-angeles.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Tim Arango and Inyoung Kang Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A quarter-century ago today, much of Los Angeles, and the nation, was transfixed with a white Bronco speeding along the city’s freeways. Four days after Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were murdered in Brentwood, O.J. Simpson was a fugitive. The police pursuit of him that played out on national television became an indelible “where were you when …” cultural moment. Car chases have long been a fixture of the zeitgeist of Los Angeles, a phenomenon that perhaps reached its apex with the O.J. Simpson pursuit and endures today, with near-daily coverage on local television news — often broadcast with footage from helicopters zooming across the skies of the city. Viewers pause, unable to look away from their televisions or their social media feeds. L.A.’s fascination with high-speed pursuits has been the subject of cultural commentary, with writers across the years delving into what it says about the city and its inhabitants. An entertainment lawyer who spoke to The Los Angeles Times several years ago called June 17, 1994, the day of the O.J. chase, in which broadcast networks interrupted an N.B.A. playoff game to show live footage, “the day Los Angeles stopped.” The O.J. chase is sometimes described as the beginning of the city’s obsession with car chases. The Twitter feed @ChaseAlert, which alerts high-speed chases in Los Angeles, recently wrote, “Happy 25th anniversary of the dawn of the car chase!” But Los Angeles Magazine traced the first live police pursuit on local news to 1992, when a station interrupted a rerun of the legal drama “Matlock” to show officers chasing a red Volkswagen driven by a killer. “The police pursuit found its audience,” according to the article. “Over the next decade the car chase — high speed, low speed, or, when a tire has flattened and the fugitive is running on sparks and stupidity, virtually no speed — would become another peculiar symbol of the city, an ‘Only in L.A.’” Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and author of a book on police pursuits, likened the public fascination to watching Nascar. “Thousands of people in a stadium waiting for a crash,” he said. “That’s the fascination.” But Professor Alpert held the O.J. Simpson chase slightly apart from the public’s obsession with highway pursuits. “The O.J. chase was a slow-speed chase,” he said. “It wasn’t your typical high-speed, risky pursuit. It was a celebrity issue.” (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

The officer, whose name was not released, fired, killing French and wounding French's parents, Russell and Paola. The off-duty officer's gun was the only firearm involved in the incident, police said. Rick Shureih told the The Press-Enterprise in Riverside that French, his cousin, had ""to be pretty much monitored"" and was always with his parents. Shureih said his cousin struggled with mental issues for years but had never been violent. Shureih expressed outrage in a post on Facebook that included a picture of French and his parents. ""I’m not keeping quiet about this! People need to know!"" Shureih wrote. ""This is my family! These are the victims of the Costco shooting the other night."" Shureih said the public narrative described his family members as suspects and the officer as the victim. He said he was ""sure this (shooting) was a misunderstanding"" that needlessly escalated. ""Do they look intimidating to you? Did he really have to shoot them all?"" Shureih wrote.

6.17.2019 12:46 PM Harvard University has rescinded its offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a Parkland survivor and conservative teen activist due to racist comments he made several years ago in group chats with other Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School students. Screenshots of the offensive statements surfaced about a month ago when Kashuv's critics in both lefty media and far-right circles teamed up to destroy him. Kashuv acknowledged responsibility for having once been a ""petty, flippant kid"" but explained that subsequent events—including the mass shooting that killed many of his teachers and classmates—forced him ""to mature and grow in an incredibly drastic way."" The comments were all made before the shooting, and before Kashuv became a nationally-recognized conservative figure, Second Amendment advocate, and coordinator for Turning Point USA. (He has since left the group.) Kashuv had planned to attend Harvard in fall 2020 after completing a gap year, but shortly after his past racist comments became public, administrators advised him that his acceptance could be withdrawn ""if you engage or have engaged in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character."" He was asked to provide a full explanation for his behavior, which he did. He also emailed Harvard's Office of Diversity Education and Support, vowing to make amends. This office told him ""we appreciate your thoughtful reflections and look forward to connecting with you upon your matriculation in the fall of 2020."" Alas, it was not to be: The dean of admissions decided to rescind Kashuv's admission. A spokesperson for Harvard told Reason that the university does not comment on the admissions status of individual applicants. Harvard is a private institution, and is within its rights, of course, to change its mind about admitting a specific student in light of new information. Nonetheless, this decision is troubling. For one thing, it represents a major victory for the online mobs of cancel culture. One way to discourage Twitter trolls from dredging up old dirt on their enemies would be to ignore them. By giving the bullies exactly what they wanted, Harvard has only emboldened them. Indeed, gun control activist David Hogg—a fellow Parkland survivor—is currently a trending topic on Twitter, in part because some on the right would like to find a basis on which to argue that Harvard should de-admit him as well. (Inappropriate and conspiratorial claims that Hogg isn't smart enough have occasionally flooded social media.) Harvard's decision here is also an endorsement of the position that people should be shamed and punished for their worst mistakes as kids. But moving forward, as technology gives everyone the ability to record every moment of our lives, this will be an untenable position—all embarrassing moments will be preserved forever, available for re-litigation. This is excessively punitive, and counterproductive to the healthy socialization of young people. Kids are not perfect: They must be given the opportunity to fail, and to learn and grow from their errors. ""As personally painful as this is right now, I'm concerned about the impacts this has on the broader conversation,"" Kashuv told Reason. ""It makes it a lot less probable that people will apologize for past wrongdoings. Even more so, it's about whether the core educational principles that one can grow, can change, can mature are still intact or if past mistakes brand you as irredeemable."" No one is entitled to placement at Harvard, and if you say racist things to people, you should not be surprised when someone calls you out. But, as with the efforts to cancel James Gunn, Kevin Hart, Sarah Jeong, Kyler Murray, and so many others, we should be concerned about where this corrosive impulse to seek and destroy is leading us.

VIST THIS SITE RIGHT HERE >>=====>>>> http://www.Employment10.com “It’s not racist when you do it to Whitey” Absolutely correct Sir! Harvard targeted Kashuv because of his political ideology.  Requital can be had in kind. If private conversations are fair game to ruin someone, then there won’t be any more private conversations.  People will be afraid to be honest with each other and will censor themselves at all times.  There will be less community and more secrecy. That’s the goal. Once family and friends are suspect, Big Brother is all you have left. Don’t worry too much about private conversations. But learn to distinguish them from published remarks. Follow this rule: never, ever, publish anything you wouldn’t be okay seeing on the front page of the NYT—whether or not you are publishing under a pseudonym. Teach that rule to your children. And please, explain to them that it is not an oppressive rule, but a wise one, which protects both the speaker and free speech generally. 1984 in 2019 is up ending the whole of our Enlightenment freedoms to speak, to think, to do and you’re counseling submission? More, it won’t work.  Where will you have the seclusion for any private communications when we live in “smart homes”? “We” have already received two reports from your refrigerator and one from the blue suit hanging in the closet and “we” are not amused. Not only don’t publish. Don’t say out loud anything that could be recorded by a friend with a cellphone, or Alexa, or security camera at the the quickimart. Don’t ever wear clothes that could could be racist (appropriation). Don’t ever attend any event at which a speaker or performer may later be found to have been offensive. Best just to stay home in a medically induced coma, lest you think improper thoughts. Reminiscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolution (and it was not pretty).  If these (Lib) communists get in we will lose every freedom we have.   We MUST vote them ALL out!   There will be a ‘social’ rating system like they have in China.  Big Brother will tell us what to think, what to eat, how to dress, how long we can live.  George Orwell was incredibly prescient. Your ardent defense of stale bigotry is noted and disdained, especially by your betters. Shut the fuck up, racist sexist asshole.  The only person you’re ‘better’ here than is Tony, and that’s on his bad days. You should be beaten to death with a brick and your corpse thrown onto a highway, you useless retarded cunt. I have no problem with Harvard choosing to not admit a prospective student who posted racist comments. I’m sure no other students at Harvard ever posted anything dumb online as teenagers. The main problem is that he was clearly targeted for having the wrong political views and ruining the narrative around gun control and school shootings. The secondary problem is that people say dumb shit as teenagers and it’s insane to judge people by things they said when they were stupid kids. Yes. We need a statute of limitations on writings, and it should be short for youngsters, but longer for adults. As teenagers?  Kyle is 18.  He was 16 when he made that comment.  It wasn’t that long ago. I don’t know about you, but most people grow exponentially during that time period. You go from being a little kid who relies on parents and others to take you places, to driving, going on dates, and having a lot more freedom. You begin to start thinking about your future more concretely versus it just being some future point that takes forever to get to. It’s the time where you start to become independent. If it was like 18-20 or something, I’d get it. But 16-18 is a huge leap. Yes it makes perfect sense for a school to avoid an opportunity to teach a child. Elite colleges aren’t good at teaching, they’re good at selecting. It’s a useful skill but way overvalued by people like you who don’t understand the product colleges sell. I have no problem with Harvard choosing to not admit a prospective student who posted racist comments. Only as long as it was a white guy, amirite? Or Asian. Bigots gonna bigot. And stick together. And continue to get stomped by good Americans in the culture war Carry on, clingers. Fuck off, slaver. Shove a shotgun down your throat and pull the trigger, you worthless cunt. They had accepted him.  He now is past the deadline for other college admissions and turned down many scholarships to go to Harvard.  I hope he sues the shit out of Harvard. I’ve been told that he has no case.  Of course that person threw a tantrum when asked why soooo….. He wasn’t planning on attending till Fall of 2020.  He has time. That’s Hogg. Kashuv was admitted for the class of 23. Try not to mislead people. it almost seems like you do it in purpose. “nicmart” is the type of libertarian who prunes his hedges while the Soviet army positions tank all around his house and points a thousand rifles at him, insisting that no NAP violations have yet occurred! Not to worry; I no longer usually refer to myself as a libertarian since the movement became hospitable to racists and their apologists. Starting with Ron Paul. That you still think of American homes surrounded by Soviet tanks is amusing, though. I no longer usually refer to myself as a libertarian since the movement became hospitable to racists and their apologists. Starting with Ron Paul. If you think it started with Ron Paul, you’re dumber than Mr. JD has portrayed you as being. The delight of the Reason discussion section is its utter absence of civility. We are far removed from the quality of Inquiry magazine. The great libertarian intellectuals are gone and the movement, if it can be called that, is a dump. Why did you change from “Normandy?” You care about politeness no matter how stupid the substance. Some of us prefer reality and reasoned thought and are tired of dating with the Jeffs of the world. Dealing with not dating.  Fucking gay autocorrect. That’s homophobic. Or are you using the traditional definition of gay? Because my autocorrect sure seems happy to fuck things up… Stop calling insensitive or offensive comments racist. There is no implication of perceived superiority or ideology. at this point, ‘racist’ has lost all meaning. Anti racism is slowly but surely making a racist of me. Then you have no character. To be honest, I doubt anyone cares why you stopped lying about being a libertarian. A legitimate journalist would have informed the reader with respect to the relevant statements rather than offering whitewash by euphemism. A decent reader would recognize this fledgling bigot’s statements as racist and bigoted Carry on, clingers. You don’t seem to understand the libertarian position here. A private entity can make its own admittance standards, period, unless the person is a racist, then they must be given affirmative action. Because racists are in danger of being oppressed by society. Proof tony is too intellectually lazy to read the comments before saying something stupid. A private entity can make its own admittance standards, period, Harvard receives massive amounts of federal dollars for its educational functions; if it gives those up, then it can make its own admittance standards. As long as it wants to keep receiving them, it has to conform to the conditions the US government attaches to those dollars. Furthermore, even fully private entities are required to honor the contracts and promises they make. They admitted him, he fully and honestly complied with their admission procedures, he did not deceive or defraud them, and that means that they ought to keep up their side of the contract they entered into with him. Because racists are in danger of being oppressed by society. He’s not a racist; he just used insulting language. You, Tony, on the other hand are a racist through-and-through. If social media had been around when I was a kid, no  one in my generation would have gotten into Harvard. Sucks to be young and stupid–like we all were–in the Panopticon Era The thing is, it isn’t that you can’t get into Harvard if you ever made some racist joke as a teen.  It’s that you can’t get into Harvard if the mob decides you are the wrong kind of person.  Doesn’t matter what you have done, they will find some way to smear you. “you are the wrong kind of person” He’s Asian? The other kind of wrong kind of person. Male Cis? Warmer. White male cis who refuses to get with the right narrative. The other kind of wrong kind of person. That was very nicely played, Zeb(ulon), sir. So it’s really just a difference between Tony’s informed stupid comments and his uninformed stupid comments. “Harvard deplatforms Parkland gun violence survivor” “When we said listen to the children, this isn’t what we meant!” It’s pathetic.  The kids who build the right narrative are brave heroes with wisdom beyond their years.  But this kid must be expunged. Remember when we wren’t allowed to call David Hogg a cunt because he was outside when a shooting happened? I don’t remember that.  Must not have got the message.  Woops. You can put lipstick on a Hogg, but it is still a Hogg! Didn’t know that.  And here I’ve been calling Hogg a stupid weaselly slimy gutless cunt all this time. Fuck Harvard.  They’re a bunch of incestuous cunts anyway. Enjoy your fucking echo chamber, cunts. Have fun relying on Liberty, Grove City, Regent, Ave Maria, Hillsdale, and the rest of the conservative-controlled campuses. And enjoy the rest of the culture war, clingers. Isn’t there something you can do to get cancer quicker? Sniff asbestos, eat moldy peanut butter, look at naked Lena Dunham pics, take steroids? Anything? ’cause I’m getting tired of waiting. I’m enjoying watching him ineffectually rage against a world run by people he hates. He’s losing more often every day, and his increasing level of frustration with that comes across in his posts. How about crossing his heroes, the Clintons?….That should put him 6 feet under!!!! Will you finally do the world a favor and fucking kill yourself, you retarded inbred gimp? NOOO!! I don’t want him dead, I want to keep hearing his inane comments as he is The Poster Boy for the Lefty Propagandized Sheeple!….He supplies much needed levity in these intense times! Arty should be tortured endlessly. Enjoy Detroit. Yeah, pigfucker, I luckily don’t teach at any of those campuses.  Mine ain’t great, but at least we beat fucking Harvard at crew. Color-thieving bastards the bunch of fucktards at Harvard.  Don’t trust those ass-munchers for a minute. Enjoy having Trump as YOUR President for another five years, dickless. Yet somehow Northram is still governor of Virginia. Impeaching a governor is a lot harder than coercing an admissions board to reject a qualified student. And it’s not about the “racist” comments or behavior.  It’s about being the wrong kind of person. Right. Northram isn’t the “wrong kind of person.” So he can keep his job. At least until there’s a candidate with a higher intersectional score. Not quite. They were calling for his resignation until it surfaced that his Lt Governor had run afoul of #metoo, and might have to resign as well, which would then cause the governorship to fall to the speaker of the house, a Republican. Can’t have that! Much better to have a racist or a misogynist in power. This. Did they find out he’s secretly Asian? Oh you beat me by a minute. “Inappropriate and conspiratorial claims that Hogg isn’t smart enough have occasionally flooded social media.” Well said Robby.  It’s outrageous that haters pounced on Hogg’s 1270 SAT score as if it “wasn’t good enough.”  In fact, when considered in light of his activism for common sense gun safety legislation, 1270 is more than adequate for the Ivy League. #LibertariansForHogg #StopSAT-ShamingHim That activism is viewed/evaluated very asymmetrically, which, of course is Harvard’s right. Is it?  They take federal money. I take your point and agree with the sentiment, however, I doubt there’s a legal case that can be made. Maybe Prof. Volokh can give his legal opinion here. ” I doubt there’s a legal case that can be made” I appreciate that you acknowledge you are not informed enough on the subject to be an expert and render an expert opinion.  I am in the same boat. But, accepting federal money = respecting free speech rights is a fairly well established standard, no? Accepting that there is a wide gulf between our knowledge and relevant caselaw, please explain why you doubt a case can be made.  It seems fairly straightforward to me. They SAID it was because of his speech.  That in my mind ( if I were on a jury) is retaliation, and so the only hurdle is that they are private.  Accepting federal money makes that a verry muddy proposition I think. “Maybe Prof. Volokh can give his legal opinion here.” I’d prefer someone who knows what they are talkimg about and doesn’t let their peraonal ideology cloud their opinions. “I’d prefer someone who knows what they are talkimg about and doesn’t let their peraonal ideology cloud their opinions.” I know, I know, we’re really scraping the bottom of the legal barrel with Prof. Volokh but we’ll just have to make the best of it I suppose… He’s wrong and often as right.  I stand by my assessment. Weren’t you going to nap? You’re devastating reposte and saber-like wit has cut me to the quick… Only because you’re tired. “Your” Dude, whatever… Protest more milady. “But, accepting federal money = respecting free speech rights is a fairly well established standard, no?” That explains the Planned Parenthood chapter at Liberty University  . . . but how did they manage to kick the College Democrats off campus? Planned Parenthood would never open a clinic at Liberty University, there aren’t enough black babies to kill there. Liberty does not take federal money! Without federal funds, Liberty would be a much smaller but no less shoddy school. Asshole that can’t read says what? But, accepting federal money = respecting free speech rights is a fairly well established standard, no? No. Weird how you’re utterly wrong about that, being an unrepentant liberal trool and all. Kashuv has direct harm caused by this rescission as the other college admission deadlines have now passed.  He has a hell of a case and will probably win. Nuh uh. Precisely. I wouldn’t object if Harvard accepted a privileged white male with an 1100 SAT score, if he also was the leading teen voice for impeaching Drumpf. Don’t forget he co-wrote a book to co-opt the Never Forget saying we use to remember the Holocaust, all for fame and money.  Hogg should be your hero OBL. 1270 is waaaaaaay below Ivy League standards, unless you have a great skill like being a great athlete or violinist, etc…Becoming a great SJW/Cultural Marxist after surviving a mass shooting?…..Nah, not so great a skill!!! Shit, how not a great skill? He’s been on TV way more than me, is going to Harvard more times than me, and is probably already making more money than me. Seems like a great skill to have. SAT scores are racist anyway. And ableist. I scored higher than 1270 at age 12. Harvard: Yet another university whose graduates I will not hire or recommend for hiring. The way we fight this bullshit is to let it be known that attending such milquetoast universities is a Black Spot on the resume. That, and defying the elites’ fancy standard English, particularly with respect to capitalization. Here’s the running joke… most of the people at Harvard aren’t elite.  They come from wealthy, mostly white rich families.  They aren’t elite in thought or education. Elite in power. A country boy comes to Harvard to visit his cousin. He runs into a professor and asks “Hey, where is the MU at?” The professor looks down at the boy with obvious disdain and tells him “Here at Hahvahd, we don’t end our sentences with a preposition.” The country boy thinks for a second and replies “OK. Where is the MU at ASSHOLE?!” So you’re insisting on perpetuating racist power structures and white privilege, huh?  You’ll be up against the wall when the Revolution comes, too. Paraphrased Kirkland: “I never read *Treasure Island* as a kid because I was too busy jacking off to pictures of Gloria Steinem.” English is racist, hermano. You should stop that. I think a lawyer could make a pretty compelling case that this facility which accepts federal money retaliated against him for exercising his right to free speech. (I mean, it’s bullshit, but that hasn’t stopped the Roundup debacle…) I doubt there’s a legal case that can be made. Kyle Kashuv is obviously an extremely bright kid and has a very bright future, success and high achievement will be his best revenge. “I doubt there’s a legal case that can be made.” I laid out why I disagree.  You didn’t.  Would you mind trying? Because I’m not a legal expert and am not familiar with any of the relevant case law. Oh ok so you don’t have a reason for your opinion, unlike how I had one for mine. Fair enough. Yep, big pat on the back for you and here’s some milk and cookies…now off you go and remember to be good… I’m sorry that upset you, but twice you’ve said you doubt a case could be made without giving anything like a reason why.  Don’t get snotty because you got called. And by the way, I was being sincere.  You gave no reason.  That you took it personally is kind of silly. I think someone’s feeling a little cranky and needs a nap… See?  Silly. Now settle down, don’t make me come up there… I thought you said you were going to nap? I agree that there is no case to be made, and that I’m not an expert on the subject, or even a lawyer.  I will justify my opinion though. The admissions agreement is a contract, and I think it probably has language that alllows Harvard to rescind the admission for reasons like this. It MIGHT be unenforceable, because of the reasons you gave, but that’s a total guess. I suppose that makes sense.  I still think there is a potential case, but I bristle against intervening in a voluntary contract between two parties. ‘bristle against intervening in a voluntary contract between two parties’ . . .  but if there’s to be an exception to your principle, might as well be one that benefits a young man who uses racial slurs? Past tense, asshole. I would agree if Harvard had never accepted him, but once accepted the contractual obligation between the student and college commences.  Unless the Harvard by laws state no student should ever have stated anything in the past, Kashuv has a case.  It is a contract violation as well as direct harm as he now has to sit out at least a semester due to the lateness of this rescission.  This won’t even be about free speech, it’s going to rest on contract law. Harvard has now made my list of schools where my kids will not be attending unless they have a very specific and valid reason why it’s the right place for them, and everything is covered by scholarships. I will not send one thin dime to that neo-Soviet clown show. Thank goodness for Franciscan, Oral Roberts, and Ouachita Baptist! Or Hillsdale, Chicago, even Yale hasn’t gone traipsing this far down the road of forthright and completely unreflective political correctness. I guess you could say that Harvard is teaching kids a lesson though — one they may return with heavy interest someday, when the first generation that’s been subjected to Twitter mobs its entire life gains political power. You might wish to take another look at Yale on this. Princeton was formed many years ago because Harvard and Yale were too corrupt. Little has changed since then, I work at one of the top engineering firms in the world.  The only ivy league school I know we have hired from in the time I’ve been there is a few from Johns Hopkins since we have an agreement with them for some other stuff.  Technically JHU isn’t even an ivy league, but falls in the catch all of other programs such as MIT. I’ve talked to hiring managers before and they all basically flatly state that Ivy Leaguers are Millennial children on steroids and not worth the time. They get hired into the Federal Bureaucracy; so that they are virtually guaranteed to eventually earn $150k per year with a nice pension and generous benefits.  All that and they get to meddle in the lives of normal people, which is what the educrats want anyway. This is the world virtue signalling progs have built for themselves, can’t take credit for everything without also taking responsibility for everything. No SJW points are awarded for letting people stand or fall on their own merits. What a world — virtue signaling progs and bigotry signaling clingers. Poe’s law is a bitch in Reason’s comments section. You mean you can’t tell the diff between the real RALK and a parody account? Join the growing club. Rev. Asshole is a self-parody. I would have thought that Harvard would have seen Kashuv’s attendance as a golden opportunity to turn him to the Dark Side. After all, don’t they regard themselves as the intellectual superiors of those hick conservative types? Hell, if they’re scared of one conservative kid what does that say about them? Why does the Left flap their gums about racism if, as it appears here, someone who sees the light and changes their views is still going to be punished (for rest of life?) for what he or she believed before their thinking matured? Because it feels so good to see them squirm. It’s not about making the world a better place, it’s about exacting revenge and feeling superior. The fact that he supports the Second Amendment proves he is still racist and is only pretending to have reformed himself.  Duh. The teenager, in acknowledging his mistakes and seeking to learn from them, shows he better understands the purpose of a college education than do its guardians at the nation’s most prestigious university. And once again, Robbie, smart piece…. but we’ve come to expect that from you.  (Indeed, as soon as I heard about the story, I toggled over to Reason to see if you had offered your observations.) I thought libertarians were on the “college is for job skills, not becoming a well-rounded person” train. Now suddenly college is back to being a fancier finishing school? I thought libertarians were on the “college is for job skills, not becoming a well-rounded person” train. I studied medieval literature in graduate school and now work in construction.  Do I have to hand back my libertarian card?  Or is it maybe the case that not everyone who isn’t you shares the exact same opinion on every single thing? “I thought libertarians” Stop right there Tones. No one cares what your sock puppet ass thinks. I thought libertarians were on the “college is for job skills, not becoming a well-rounded person” train. Now suddenly college is back to being a fancier finishing school? Were you not around for the decades of lecturing on is/ought fallacies? The progressive moral standard: judgement without mercy or absolution, with permanent internal exile pariah status. How did it come to this? Even medieval inquisitors let people off when they admitted the error of their ways and recanted their heresy. OSHA. It let the stupid ones live long enough to breed. Come to this? “Progressivism” started like this. For one thing, it represents a major victory for the online mobs of cancel culture. I’m pretty sure it only represents a victory for online mobs of a particular political orientation.  I suspect Harvard would have more of a spine if conservatives started to troll through the youthful statements of people with more acceptable opinions.  Shoot, I bet you could be hired as a Harvard professor if you bombed the right buildings. I suspect Harvard would have more of a spine if conservatives started to troll through the youthful statements of people with more acceptable opinions. A little Che Guevara, anyone? Homophobic. Does not qualify. Behind every fig (tree) is a great man. Karma’s a bitch. When abortion is made illegal I expect everyone who has ever had one or advocated it in any way any way receives the same treatment. Imagine all the new openings there will be. When abortion is made illegal You’re delusional. You’re delusional. Ask him about the Holocaust! You are referring to the narrative that is protected by censorship laws from any scientific or logical scrutiny. To protect your delusions and get Jews anything they want. You are referring to the narrative that is protected by censorship laws from any scientific or logical scrutiny. Not in this country, it ain’t.  Have at it, baby – spill your truth out on us! You’ve done it before, and you’re still here, aren’t you? This website is a welcome anomaly, much to the chagrin of the delusional. I have shared the truth and watched it rape your delusions. You feel raped. I’ll do it again and again and again. I’ll be right every time and you’ll have the same feeling. Enjoy your post truth. “I’ll do it again and again and again” Then fire away, cause it seems like all you’re doing is running your dicksucker about having already done it. You are referring to the narrative that is protected by censorship laws from any scientific or logical scrutiny. To protect your delusions and get Jews anything they want. Who knew, Rob, that when you called yourself a “Christian”, you mean that you were an adherent of Positive Christianity and an admirer of Roehm. But, see, people don’t have to rely on narratives; your friends were excellent record keepers and proud of their handiwork. On top of that, you can see the camps, the gas chambers, the mass graves, the expropriated buildings and art yourself, and you can talk to survivors as well as the families of those who were killed. Of course, all of that would require reason and compassion, both qualities you are lacking. You’re regurgitating a soundly refuted narrative. Read it for yourself. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23629458-breaking-the-spell You’re regurgitating a soundly refuted narrative. To you, it’s a “narrative”; to others, it is first hand experience. Logic and science prove that a new human life is created at conception and as such has the right to continue living. Who’s delusional? People valued slavery, but it wasn’t until they were forced by law to recognize their delusion and accept blacks as fellow humans that the concept of racism was understood. So you’re still working on accepting pregnant women as full humans. Logic and science don’t have anything to say about when an embryo or fetus or person receives personhood rights. So you’re still working on accepting pregnant women as full humans. FTFY, Tony.  Don’t give Misek more credit than he deserves. Our rights are human rights and are not based on some nefarious idea of “personhood” designed to discriminate against the unborn. Personhood is not a concept in science, but law. The beauty of that indisputable fact is that intelligent humans get to decide for themselves what it means. Saying science requires us to imprison or execute women for getting abortions is to give yourself just a wee bit of extra credit. Wheres your line Tony?  Can a mother let their 3 year old die of starvation because the child is a burden?  That seems to be most pro abortion nuts standard, that the mother is inconvenienced. So what is the line? The nefarious line is wherever the murderer draws it. To them your rights are only what the current government affords you. If it’s murder, so be it. All dissent from their agenda, post truth be worshipped, to be censored. Not anywhere religious fundamentalist assholes can get at it, if I had my way. We do have legal traditions about these things. Then in your effort to justifying denying moral status you leave open that anyone can decide that anyone else is not a person or that society can judge anyone or any demographic category are not persons.  You have just thrown away human rights as an absolute standard.  Congratulations, you have just thrown a couple millenia of the development of moral philosophy out to gain a victory in the one area, which is only supported by how society feels from moment to moment. Remember, that any argument you make that someone has rights is only based on your feelings since you have reasoned away personhood as a moral absolute. The idea that a fetus has full personhood rights is hardly millennia old. In fact it’s a tacked-on post-hoc justification for banning abortion when the original “we want to control what women do with their vaginas” one started to become unpopular. Tony is right on this (I know!) The word/concept “person” is liberally sprinkled throughout our law, constitution, common law, philosophical musings, and Church canon. Here is the actual definition of person. 1. A living human. What was your point? So it should be illegal to pull the plug on brain dead grandma on a ventilator? Oh, get a room you two. You know you want to have sex with each other. The only thing that I’ve shoved up your ass and down your throat is the truth. You’re welcome. Your truth is as impotent as the rest of you, Rob. Now do more about the Joos. Wish I had a multibillion dollar company, so I could refuse  to hire Harvard grads, due to their school’s pattern of bigotry. But, as with the efforts to cancel James Gunn, Kevin Hart, Sarah Jeong, Kyler Murray, and so many others, we should be concerned about where this corrosive impulse to seek and destroy is leading us. Weren’t these cancellations unsuccessful because these people are loved by “the left”? Are these types the only cancellation attempts that should make us concerned? Did any of those people actually get cancelled? I know Gunn is back on Guardians 3. Did any of those people actually get cancelled? In fact, no. No, they were unsuccessful attempts. Bigots hate it when bigotry has consequences. Yes you do, don’t you, bigoted fuckwit leftist. One day soon there will be a massive data dump made publicly available linking IP and MAC addresses to web searches and social media accounts. That’s going to be a horribly embarrassing day for most of us. That’d be the best thing that could happen. Exposing all the hypocrites would end the inquisition. You know full well that it wouldn’t. Leftism is the rationalization of self-interest. The thing about rationalization is, it doesn’t have to make sense! The definition of rationalization is corrupt. It describes the use of logic that is faulty. That isn’t logical and it isn’t rational. So it is a meaningless word. Unworthy of argument. I don’t dismiss your motive, just your method. So… uh… hmmm. Can I just ask if you’re high? Some people want to know when they’re repeating garbage. Not you apparently. Fuck off Jeff. I’m not Jeff dumbass. Sure Jeff.  Now fuck off. I think jeff got caught in that mass pedo arrest last week. He hasnt graced us with his stupidity ad much lately. He was here today, both as jeff and with his “eric” sockpuppet What do you think would have happened to him at Harvard? His fellow students and faculty would have made his life a living hell. He should consider himself lucky to have gotten out just in time. He should consider himself lucky to have gotten out just in time. This. If he can detach some money off the Harvard Trust or whatever, good for him; but his main win is not getting into that toxic environment. administrators advised him that his acceptance could be withdrawn “if you engage or have engaged in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character.” If that’s their standard, Harvard must have an incredibly boring campus. And not very populated. I’m pretty sure harvard has paid to host oscar rivera Lopez.  They dont seem to be a good judge of any of those traits. It bears repeating: Never apologize, Mister. It’s a sign of weakness. “if you engage or have engaged in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character.” So the whole faculty has resigned? >>>” … brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character.” so which is it? did *words* define his “moral character”? It’s clearly his maturity.  Because, of course, he can’t possibly have matured in the couple years since he wrote that. Harvard is not the government so it can do whatever it wants to whomever* it wants for any reason it concocts and if you don’t like it, go make your own university. *With exceptions for members of properly qualified aggrieved minority groups. Someone doesnt understand how contracts or law works. They may not do so for illegal reasons. Don’t worry about it, Mr. Kashuv. The dirty little secret the Ivy League assholes don’t want you to know  is that you can get just a good an indoctrination in socialist ways in many other re-education camps across America with a much smaller price tag. Apparently Kashuv’s parents did not pay a big enough bribe. I didn’t get admitted to Harvard despite an outstanding academic record, and I never used the word “nigger,” so fuck that guy. Yeah, but did you ever get shot at at school? When I was in high school that sort of thing only happened in Colorado. Are you so angry since you cant claim victimhood to the levels kids do these days? I have no interest in being anyone’s victim. I’m not a Trump supporter for God’s sake. How much victim points do I get if the school shooting was a suicide in another classroom? “I didn’t get admitted to Harvard despite an outstanding academic record,” Grade inflation is such a tragedy. We’ve seen your posts.  Harvard probably had similar evidence. I never used the word “nigger,” um Keep it going Tony. You don’t realize it but you’re the best speaker for how morally and intellectually bankrupt modern fake progressives like yourself really are. And you regularly emphasize your sympathy with white supremacists. You shouldn’t throw stones in glass gas chambers. Well, I guess maybe you should. By giving the bullies exactly what they wanted, Harvard has only emboldened them. I think Harvard is them. As to whether or not Kashuv has a case the more important issue is where the case is tried. If Kashuv can get to court, I think he has an very good chance of some extremely worthwhile damages. As the Oberlin case just demonstrated, private universities have been acting like asses for decades towards the general public. If Kashuv can get a jury out of Boston, Harvard is probably screwed. I cannot imagine the local population in and around Harvard is treated any better than Oberlin is. And the locals near Harvard have been putting up with the school’s crap for far longer. Good.  Perhaps he will be able to get a decent education now Well I’ve reached the conclusion that social media is a malevolent force in the culture. But when I consider what was done to Kavanaugh when social media consisted of whatever you could scribble in your friend’s yearbook I think the problem is much deeper. As Kashuv notes ” it’s about whether the core educational principles that one can grow, can change, can mature are still intact or if past mistakes brand you as irredeemable.” The idea of redemption is an ancient part of western civilization. But leftists are happy to discard it because it interferes with the unbridled hatred that is the basis of their worldview. Redemption is possible…all you have to do is accept progressivism into your life. Are you a former Klansman? Former advocate of locking people up based solely on race? Did you drown a young woman? It’s OK – just seek sanctuary in the Temple of Progressivism, grasp the horns of the altar, and the pursuing Furies will be turned away and you will be able to redeem yourself. Just leave any wrongthinking tendencies behind. Hallelujah! […] In this view, the real threat aren’t the racist comments themselves — which can be overcome — but the impulse to punish people for them. If you penalize people for every past politically incorrect comment, the logic goes, then people will have no room to grow. You might even punish the innocent. […] Harvard’s decision here is also an endorsement of the position that people should be shamed and punished for their worst mistakes as kids. Huh, and that’s precisely what you advocated during the Kavanaugh confirmation. Of course that was even worse because there was literally no evidence to support any of the claims. Down the memory hole we go once again… But those were credible accusations. Since Kyle Kashuv is jewish, could harvard’s action be seen as anti-Semitic ? Don’t they accept federal money? “engaged in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character.”, a lot of politicians who went to Harvard fit that description. Kyle Kashuv will be fine. Can Virginia cancel Gov. Northam and AG Herring for their blackface antics, or Lt. gov. Fairfax for his rapes? I feel sorry for the kid. All white parents need to have “the talk” with their kids—don’t ever let the n-word come out of your mouth or allow your white fingers to type the n-word. […] In this view, the real threat aren’t the racist comments themselves — which can be overcome — but the impulse to punish people for them.

353,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/we-build-the-wall-oath-keepers-three-percenters-guardian-patriots,"“We Build The Wall,” the private GoFundMe-powered border wall project, made its outreach to armed right-wing groups even more explicit over the weekend. In a cell phone video live-streamed Saturday, “Foreman Mike,” a motormouthed spokesperson for the group, gave a tour to a man wearing a black eyepatch and cowboy hat: Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of Oath Keepers, an anti-government group oriented toward veterans and first responders. Oath Keepers is perhaps best known for its members’ armed patrols on the rooftops of Ferguson, Missouri during the protests of the police killing of Mike Brown and subsequent non-indictment of officer Darren Wilson. Rhodes has since found a partner in We Build The Wall (WBTW). “We’re going to have a ceremony here, we’d like any of our Oath Keeper friends to come on in, any of our Three Percenter brothers, all of them. More than welcome to come in for a question and answer period,” Mike told Rhodes at one point, as the Oath Keepers leader filmed his own video. Rhodes was sold. “They’re going to do the official flag-raising next week, that’s the 24th, 25th and 26th. So I’ll be here for that, absolutely it would be an honor to be here,” he said in a separate live-streamed video posted to the Oath Keepers Facebook page Saturday. In addition to their Ferguson patrols, the Oath Keepers have long injected themselves into national debates. After the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, a writer for Oath Keepers said in a group webinar that pro-gun-control students were “the enemy.” The Oath Keepers have also engaged in disputes over federal authority, namely the Bundy Ranch standoff. Rhodes, a former Ron Paul staffer, is particularly outspoken. In 2015, he said then-Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) should be tried for treason, then executed. Later that year, attorneys for Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who denied marriage licenses to gay couples, declined Rhodes’ offer for an Oath Keepers security detail to prevent her arrest by federal agents. TPM has reported on WBTW’s unofficial relationship with Guardian Patriots, a renamed splinter group of the United Constitutional Patriots, which gained international infamy for its armed mass “arrests” of migrants crossing the border. Guardian Patriots member “Viper,” or Steve Brant, was seen near the wall in the Oath Keepers’ video. Guardian Patriots spokesperson Jim Benvie, whose live-streamed Facebook videos sparked the massive outcry, has become a de facto videographer of sorts for WBTW. In his video of Foreman Mike, Rhodes and another Oath Keeper, John Siemens, Benvie implied he was responsible for inviting the Oath Keepers onto the private property. “They came down, they asked if they could get a tour of the wall, and I said sure,” he narrated. “So we brought them out with Foreman Mike. They’re up here checking it out, but also they’re checking out setting up operations on the border.” WBTW spokesperson Jennifer Lawrence didn’t respond to TPM’s questions about the group’s relationship with several militias. Neither Oath Keepers or Rhodes responded to TPM’s questions. Rhodes and Siemens were recently seated directly behind President Donald Trump in the VIP section at his political rally in El Paso. At several points Saturday, Rhodes alluded to a potential effort to invite his own militia members to the border. At one point, he said his group was doing “spot and report” in Eagle Pass, Texas but that it was “frustrating.” He urged the President to further deploy the military to the border and, at various points, said Oath Keepers were considering getting more involved. “We were talking to some of the county commissioners in the border counties, we’re hoping to get them and the sheriffs to come on board, either to form posses, or otherwise to have some sort of volunteer… under the county’s authority so that they have a little bit more legitimacy and some liability protection,” he told Benvie at one point. “So we’re working on things like that.” And later: “We were considering an operation, we still are, in the Coronado National Forest up in the mountains. That’s where the cartel has carte blanche.” Foreman Mike, in salesman mode, bragged about the wall’s effectiveness at the top of its half-mile length, where steel bollards meet small cliff face on Mount Cristo Rey. “We had some coyotes try to get through there,” he recalled. “They sent seven people through. They were near death when we got to them. Just begging for water. They gave us all the information we needed.”  The morning after a federal judge in Texas halted new applicants to the Obama-era Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program,… Two California men have been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly plotting to attack the Democratic Party headquarters… An Arizona judge on Thursday denied Republican senators’ motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking records on the financial backers and… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

        Antjuan Seawright Posted on June 17, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. ET A Nov. 22, 2010, photo of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. It’s very hard for me to talk about South Carolina without talking about the day a white supremacist walked through the doors of the Mother Emanuel AME Church and murdered my friend. It was four years ago today — June 17, 2015 — when he sat down with the Bible Study group that met there every Wednesday night. He didn’t look like them and didn’t share their background, but they welcomed him into their circle. They talked with him and prayed with him, and he repaid their kindness by pulling out a gun he should never have had and killing nine men and women, including Mother Emanuel’s pastor, my dear friend Sen. Clementa Pinckney. It was four years ago, but it still hurts so much. It hurts the people of South Carolina and all of us because this white supremacist was trying to start a race war by massacring men and women — Christians who were simply doing their best to worship their God. It hurts because this racist took my friend from me, took a father from his children, took a husband from his wife, took a dear uncle and brother from his family. Clementa Pinckney's wife, Jennifer, and their daughters, Eliana and Malana, with Antjuan Seawright, the author of this article. Several things come to mind as we reflect today. We’ve seen 1,424 mass shootings in this country since that horrific day. We’ve seen a significant rise in hate crimes — a 17% increase over the last year alone, and a more than 30% increase since 2014. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have said that white supremacist extremists are responsible for more homicides and attacks than any other domestic group in America. Our places of worship continue to be targeted by those seeking to fan the flames of division and hate. And as in the days of my sharecropping grandparents, public praise of white supremacy and racism is becoming a norm. And sadly, when we look to our leaders to help us stem the tide of hate and prevent another mass shooting from taking place, we hear crickets. Thankfully, the 116th Congress, led by Democrats under the leadership of Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and Rep. Joe Cunningham, recently passed legislation that would close the “Charleston loophole” that allowed this murderer to have such a deadly weapon in the first place. But that bill hasn’t seen the light of day in the Republican-controlled Senate. I wonder why that is? It has been said that life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. So how do we react when the people with the power to do good choose instead to do nothing? What happens next? How will we respond to a new generation of racism and bigotry and stand against the white supremacists and the violence they bring with them? Can we even prevent another Mother Emanuel tragedy? How will we protect our families, our communities, and our great nation from tumbling down this black hole of hate? Thinking back to that moment four years ago, I can’t help but be reminded that we are not the first to feel that the obstacles before us are too great to pass. South Carolina has had more than its fair share of triumph and tragedy. Yet there is a spirit that runs deep in my home that still sings “We Shall Overcome.” It is that spirit that reminds me that, despite all the heartache past and yet to come, our state motto remains Dum spiro spero: “While I breathe, I hope.” So today, because I yet draw breath, I find it in myself to hope. I hope that this American experiment will be judged on our ability to repair our fault, to plow through the filth of racism, bigotry, hate, gun violence, and, yes, white supremacy and emerge stronger and cleaner on the other side. And I know this hope is shared and so becomes stronger. This is our story. This is our shared memory, not of tragedy, but of grace. Antjuan Seawright is the founder and CEO of Blueprint Strategy.

Travis Long/The News & Observer/AP; Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA/AP; Diedra Laird/TNS/Zuma In the old photos, the ones taken right after he was arrested for gunning down three Muslim students in their North Carolina home, Craig Stephen Hicks appears as a dumpy, chinless man with a mousy beard cut too high above the jawline. The style, if you can call it that, looks reasonable from the front but ridiculous from the side. It’s often worn by men who are terrified of being laughed at for letting hair grow on their throat, but who can only ever see of themselves what they find staring back in a mirror. He looked different at his long-awaited plea and sentencing hearing on Wednesday. More than four years of jail food and life away from the sun had broken down the fat. His spotty, pasty skin hung limp around a baggy orange jumpsuit. The neckbeard he’d once fought so hard to hide now sprouted across his jowls. When Hicks murdered Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha, and Razan Abu-Salha, on the frigid evening of February 10, 2015, much of what we are now living through was also under the surface. America’s first black president was still in the White House. The massacre at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church was four months away. The Nazi rampage through Charlottesville lay more than two years in the future; the mass shooting inside Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue further off than that. Donald Trump would not launch his campaign with a racist tirade about Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese, Muslims, and others until that following summer. At the time, that is to say, it was still possible for many to pretend—or at least, easier than it is now—that the obvious had not occurred in Chapel Hill. It was possible for police, politicians, and much of the media to look directly at an angry white man who’d barged into a young Muslim neighbor’s apartment and executed everyone inside, including two women in hijab, and see something other than a clear and unmitigated act of Islamophobic terror. They could see a man who’d amassed an arsenal in his condominium, including an AR-15 that he told police the night of the murders was “loaded up and ready to go,” and see a “sudden, shocking spasm of violence,” in the words of the Washington Post. They could see a man who posted anti-Muslim memes on Facebook and had a record of flashing guns and seething epithets at neighbors of color and repeat, uncritically, his soon-to-be-ex-wife’s assertion that “the incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims’ faith.” They could regurgitate her self-delusion—freshly disproven as forcefully as anything has ever been disproven—that he was merely “a champion of Second Amendment rights” who “believed everyone is equal.” His motive could be cast as a great unknowable. In a pattern that would repeat itself in the white supremacist massacres to come, tastemakers went looking for anything that could complicate the narrative. Many seized on the fact that Hicks called himself an “anti-theist,” and in addition to anti-Muslim memes had denigrated Christianity and Judaism on his Facebook page. Once he said it would be okay if Obama were Muslim. Another time, he said of all three Abrahamic faiths: “I wish they would exterminate each other!” This proved, the Associated Press said, that he was “a man of contradictions.” That’s when the Chapel Hill police stepped into the breach. Less than 24 hours after the murders, they announced the erroneous excuse that would spread around the world: that Hicks may have been motivated by “an ongoing dispute over parking.” Thanks to the evidence produced at the hearing, we now know the truth: That was a lie, based on nothing more than the word of a man who had just walked in off the street and confessed to a triple homicide. After the murders, Hicks had driven to a nearby lake in a state park, possibly contemplating suicide. (Investigators found a sealed envelope in his car marked “Cops.” It was torn open and had nothing inside.) Then he drove to neighboring Chatham County and turned himself in. His confession was videotaped. Sitting in a 2008 Pittsburgh Steelers conference champions T-shirt, relaxed despite wearing handcuffs and his victims’ blood, he bantered with the officers as if they were meeting over a barbecue. Hicks seemed eager to win the white authorities’ friendship, apologizing for occasionally having to turn his head because of deafness in his left ear. “I didn’t want you to think I was looking away out of disrespect,” he said. The officer told him not to worry. The cops seemed comfortable, too. When Hicks started talking about the gun he’d used, the officer asked for details. “I’m a gun guy,” the officer added. They talked for a while about the pros and cons of the Sig Sauer P229 with which Hicks had massacred Razan, Deah, and Yusor. Hicks had bought the gun used. It was a former highway patrol edition—$425, “everything included.” A pretty good price these days, the officer responded, knowingly. In a bored, resigned tone, Hicks unspooled a version of the myth he’d apparently been telling himself for years: He and his wife had wanted to sell their condo in the Finley Forest community, in a slice of Chapel Hill just over the Durham County line, but got stuck by the recession. Now, he said, their property values were being driven down by “renters” who threw parties and disrespected parking rules. He did not mention that the supposed “renters” who he targeted most violently were almost always people of color. In fact, Hicks had caused most of his own financial problems, in part by quitting a string of jobs and accruing at least $14,000 in unpaid child support, according to court records. He spent his days playing video games—Assassin’s Creed was his choice on the day of the murders—and posting memes on Facebook. His wife would soon file for divorce. If anything, the neighbors he hated most had probably improved his property values. Barakat’s father, a wealthy Syrian immigrant to Raleigh, had bought his son the condo two years earlier. He and Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Palestinian American psychiatrist and father to Yusor and Razan, had just renovated the condo as a wedding gift for their newly married children. As other neighbors described them, the students were quiet and respectful. The victims’ text messages described Hicks staring menacingly at Yusor in her hijab. At least once he’d flashed his pistol at Barakat. Nonetheless, the young couple hoped to get by without provoking him, even distributing a map among their friends about where they could park without angering the menacing neighbor. The murdered couple had made a map showing friends where to park, to avoid angering their eventual killer. Indeed, Hicks admitted to the police that no one had even parked in his reserved spot that day. Hicks’ most self-serving lies came when he described the 36 seconds in which he committed the murders. He claimed, falsely, that his victims had cursed at him. He speculated, speciously, that Barakat might or might not have come at him with a knife. Unbeknownst to Hicks, Barakat had answered the door with his cellphone video running, planning to record evidence of harassment. The video was aired to a horrified courtroom packed with friends and family. Hicks banged on the door and said something about too many cars being parked in the lot. Deah tried to respond—nervous and forceful, but polite. There was nothing in his other hand. Hicks then spoke words that have resonated with white supremacist killers from Reconstruction to Christchurch: “If you’re going to keep disrespecting me,” he said, according to his confession, “I’m going to start disrespecting you.” Before he was even finished speaking, he pulled out his gun like an action hero (one of his favorite films is the white-supremacist fantasy Falling Down) and shot Deah multiple times in the gut. Then he walked into the house. Off camera, the women screamed in terror and pleaded for their lives. According to forensics, Hicks shot Yusor and Razan individually with the barrel of his gun pressed against their foreheads. He then walked back and shot Deah, the dental student, in the mouth. Then he went outside and reloaded. When Hicks described all this to the police, he mimicked Yusor’s and Razan’s screams. He acknowledged, sheepishly, that he’d probably overreacted. The idea that police would have thought Hicks’ explanation was worthy of sharing with the public would have been baffling in any other circumstance, especially one in which the roles had been reversed. The police had no investigative reason to announce a potential motive. The only purpose was to influence the international attention surrounding the murders. Moreover, Hicks’ implied motive made no sense: Even if, somehow, there had been an ongoing, mutual beef with Deah and Yusor about anything, and even if that excuse were a plausible excuse for killing somebody, how did it explain Hicks’ decision to execute Razan, a 19-year-old who had never even been to the complex before? Did he need to kill a witness to the crime he was about to confess to? Or was it because she, like her sister, was wearing a Muslim headscarf? That false conditional—may have been a parking dispute—gave editors a valuable commodity. Because there was never any question about who’d done the killing, and the victims themselves quickly proved to be such resolutely unimpeachable pillars of their community, they needed a mystery motive as a narrative engine. And because that question did not foreclose the possibility that it might have been a hate crime, it even felt journalistically responsible. I shared a byline on one of the most prominent of those “question” stories. I don’t know if the fact that, after weeks more of investigation, I followed it up with a solo effort that dismantled the “parking” narrative makes up for that or not. For years, media and various officials have allowed white supremacists of all stripes to operate in the space opened up by that false conditional. The man who committed the slaughter at Mother Emanuel in Charleston may have just come from a broken home. Maybe the people who chanted “build the wall!” and cheered Trump when he promised to ban Muslims from America just shared Hicks’ economic anxiety. Maybe if you watched hours of video, or trusted their own diocese, something out there would exonerate the Covington Catholic boys. Maybe Trump knew something that no one else did when he declared that an expressly, emphatically, and uniformly violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville had included some “very fine people.” Meanwhile, the racist laws get passed, the camps fill up, and those amassing the arsenals go out and kill again. I was in the Durham courtroom when the killer pleaded guilty to all counts on Wednesday and was sentenced to three life terms without parole. I’d gotten the last available seat in the packed room: directly behind him, within an arm’s reach of his pallid neck. I could see the entitled annoyance in his shoulders when he complained to the judge about how long the process had taken, how he’d wished he could have just gotten the death penalty and been done with it. For a long time he’d enjoyed the best thing America has to offer a white man—the presumption of racial innocence—and now part of his punishment was to have it rescinded in public. The trial was “about exposing the hate, bias, and privilege that substituted for the lives of Razan, Yusor, and Deah,” said Satana Deberry, who was elected Durham County district attorney last year. “It was not about parking.” “What we all know now and what I wish we had said four years ago is that the murders of Deah, Yusor, and Razan were about more than simply a parking dispute,” Chapel Hill’s police chief, Chris Blue, said hours later in an apology. “To the Abu-Salha and Barakat families, we extend our sincere regret that any part of our message all those years ago added to the pain you experienced.” The apologies were, under the circumstances, what the Abu-Salha and Barakat families had wanted. During the sentencing portion of the hearing, family members took the stand to confront the killer and, it seemed, the nation outside the window. Mohammad Abu-Salha described an atmosphere of rising hate, fueled by blatant hate speech coming from Fox News and the network’s patron in the Oval Office, in which a disappointed white man had been radicalized. “These people with the white gloves do not do the dirty work,” the grieving father said. “They leave that to the feeble-minded.” “The murders of Deah, Yusor, and Razan did not happen in a vacuum,” said Suzanne Barakat, Deah’s older sister and a physician as well. They happened during an election season in which it had become “not only acceptable but politically advantageous to demonize Muslims” even before Trump had formally entered the race. Because of my strange positioning behind the killer’s back, I sometimes had the uncomfortable feeling that the witnesses were speaking directly to me. The rows behind us were packed with friends and relatives, American Muslim professionals in business suits and hijab, who’d come despite the horror to watch justice handed down. There were no illusions in that room about the daunting work to be done. Fixing the narrative had to be a part of a larger cure. The deadly false conditional had to be locked away as surely as the killer finally was. Top image credits: Travis Long/The News & Observer/AP; Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA/AP; Diedra Laird/TNS/Zuma.

356,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/harvard-parkland-survivor-n-word-offer,"The Harvard admission offer to a Parkland shooting survivor and pro-gun advocate was rescinded earlier this month following outcry against the student over racist comments he made in a private chat before the massacre. According to the student Kyle Kashuv’s Twitter thread, Kashuv was contacted by Harvard admissions in late May asking for an explanation of screenshots that had surfaced online that showed him using the n-word and other “idiotic comments.” Kashuv, who has become a darling of the National Rifle Association over his calls for arming school teachers and met with President Trump, said he responded with an explanation for his remarks, suggesting he was an immature teen who made the comments “for their shock value.” “My intent was never to hurt anyone, and to do so would have magnified the harm immensely,” he said. “I also feel I am no longer the same person, especially in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting and all that transpired since.” Kashuv has emerged as a conservative activist since the Valentines Day mass shooting, pushing a conservative alternative to ending school shootings. He gave a speech at the NRA’s 2019 leadership forum, pushing to arm teachers and get rid of gun-free zones, pro-Second Amendment platforms embraced by President Trump. 5/ I responded to the letter with a full explanation, apology, and requested documents. pic.twitter.com/yWd6FeKWOJ — Kyle Kashuv (@KyleKashuv) June 17, 2019  Kashuv also said he reached out to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion for guidance, but Harvard notified him that it had rescinded his admission. Kashuv said he asked for an in-person meeting to discuss the decision, but his request was denied. A Harvard spokeswoman would not confirm whether Kashuv had gotten the boot and would not comment on Kashuv’s Twitter thread. “We do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants,” spokeswoman Rachael Dane told TPM. “More broadly to our admissions policies, Harvard College reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission under the following conditions, which are clearly expressed to students upon their admission,” she said, pointing specifically to policy that shows Harvard can revoke admission “if an admitted student engages or has engaged in behavior that brings into question their honesty, maturity or moral character.” It’s not the first time Harvard has revoked admission to an incoming student when racist remarks surfaced online. Kashuv called it “deeply concerning” that the school believes “someone can’t grow, especially after a life-altering event like the shooting,” he said. 11/ Throughout its history, Harvard’s faculty has included slave owners, segregationists, bigots and antisemites. If Harvard is suggesting that growth isn't possible and that our past defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently racist institution.

Kyle Kashuv, who became a pro-gun conservative activist after the mass shooting in March last year, tweeted on Monday that Harvard “has decided to rescind my admission over texts and comments” made before the massacre.  1/ THREAD: Harvard rescinded my acceptance. Three months after being admitted to Harvard Class of 2023, Harvard has decided to rescind my admission over texts and comments made nearly two years ago, months prior to the shooting.I have some thoughts. Here’s what happened. Kashuv’s comments were made while using a Google Doc with schoolmates in December 2017. A video of his edits to the Google Doc, and those of other school students, were recorded in a video and posted online by a former classmate earlier this year. The video showed Kashuv using comments he later described as “abhorrent racial slurs” in his correspondence with Harvard. “A few weeks ago, I was made aware of egregious and callous comments classmates and I made privately years ago - when I was 16 years old, months before the shooting – in an attempt to be as extreme and shocking as possible,” Kashuv tweeted on Monday. “I immediately apologized,” Kashuv wrote, claiming that “former peers & political opponents” had then pressured Harvard to rescind its offer. Kashuv posted a letter to Twitter, dated 24 May, from Harvard that demanded an explanation from him within 72 hours, and said it “reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission”. Kashuv posted correspondence between himself and the college, which resulted in a letter from Harvard, dated 3 June, revoking an offer of a place to study there. “As you know, the [Admissions] Committee takes seriously the qualities of maturity and moral character,” the letter from William R Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions, reads. “After careful consideration the Committee voted to rescind your admission to Harvard College.” Asked for comment, Harvard said “we do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants”. In its coverage of the comments in the Google Doc, the New Yorker described the initial edits as “attempts at humor”, but said “Kashuv’s contributions were more unhinged”. “He referred, in capital letters, to ‘my jewish slaves’. Elsewhere, he wrote the N-word eleven times in a row,” the New Yorker reported. “‘I’m really good at typing” the word, he explained. ‘Practice uhhhhhh makes perfect.’” After the video was posted on Twitter, Kashuv stood down as high school outreach director with Turning Point USA, a group that promotes conservative ideas on school and college campuses.",2019-06-17 16:20:18,Parkland survivor says Harvard revoked his admission over racist remarks,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Arguably, Virginia’s 66th District is the precise epicenter of the nation’s political wars—and the Supreme Court, with the help of two of its most conservative judges, just tilted it toward the Democrats. In a somewhat unexpected decision, the Court dismissed the challenge to a lower court ruling in which the judges said 11 districts in Virginia were racially gerrymandered. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch sided with the liberal wing of the Court—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—in arguing that Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates didn’t have the legal standing to challenge the decision of the Eastern U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Virginia’s 66th was redrawn. Its representative is Republican Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Kirk Cox, who has represented the district for 29 years. Cox led the House Republican effort to overturn the lower court’s decision, at the cost of millions of dollars to Virginian taxpayers. In a January interview with the Washington Post, Cox slammed the new map as “legally indefensible” and designed to “target senior Republicans” like himself. In the wake of the court’s decision, the Republican is expected to face his first tough race in decades in his redrawn district, which is expected to be a full 32 percentage points more favorable to Democrats this November. By pure accident, Cox drew the national spotlight earlier this year when Virginia’s top three political officials, Democrats, were besieged by scandal. Within the span of five days, Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring both admitted to wearing blackface and a college professor accused Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. (Fairfax denied the allegations.) Had all three resigned, the next in line to the governor’s mansion would have been Cox, who only ascended to his leadership position thanks to a literal luck of the draw. The scandals had given the Trump campaign ambitions to flip the state in 2020—but the Supreme Court decision once again puts Republicans on the defensive. The person who is happiest about the verdict is Cox’s challenger, Sheila Bynum-Coleman. “With this particular district, it’s like a circle around my community. With the previous district, it was like over the river through the woods. It definitely cut out Democratic voters. The people who live down the street from me were not able to vote for me. And now I go to the grocery store or the corner store and people are excited to know that they can,” she told me. “When you divide communities, you disenfranchise people.” Virginia Democrats will now face a much more favorable map this November and hope to build on the legislative gains they made in the Commonwealth in 2017 and 2018. “We’ve seen that Virginia is a big indicator of national trends. We’re the only southern state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Then in 2017, it was really the start of the blue wave, right? Our 15-seat pickup was the biggest pickup in over a hundred years in Virginia. The Democratic Party lost the majority in Virginia back in 1999 so it’s been a really long time serving in the minority in the house of delegates here,” Kathryn Gilley, the communications director for the Virginia House Democrats, told me. “Now we’re seeing the blue wave is really coming back to Virginia and we’re here to finally flip the house. Which is going to be momentous to have a Democratic majority for the first time in 20 years.” Another blue wave in Virginia could spell trouble for Donald Trump in 2020. “Historically, at least up until now, we’ve seen, as Virginia goes so does the nation,” said Kristian Denny Todd, a political and crisis communications strategist. And the Democratic Party is betting on an electoral shellacking for Republicans in 2019. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced that it would invest $1 million in Virginia, where the hope is to flip two seats in both the House and Senate to win back the majority in the statehouse. And despite the scandals that plagued the executive branch earlier this year, Democratic General Assembly candidates out-raised Republicans by more than $1 million in April and May. The race for Virginia’s 66th is, in many ways, a microcosm of the political trends and battles that have come to define the Trump era. Bynum-Coleman is a pro-choice woman; Cox voted in favor of a House resolution that declared the anniversary of the passage of Roe v. Wade a “Day of Tears” and has compared aborted fetuses to fallen soldiers. Bynum-Coleman wants to increase Virginia’s minimum wage from $7.25 an hour; during Cox’s time as speaker, Republicans have blocked all legislation to raise it. Bynum-Coleman, whose daughter is a gun violence survivor, is an advocate for gun control legislation; Cox has called efforts to study the issue after the Virginia Beach mass shooting “hasty and suspect”. The list goes on. “I think the party is out of touch as a whole,” Bynum-Coleman told me. “The reason for that is because they don’t have to be in touch. Because when you draw district lines that favor you, then you don’t have to be in touch. You don’t have to really participate with your constituents.” In a sense, then, Bynum-Coleman has already won. Until now, she told me, Cox “hasn’t had to run a race, he hasn’t had to be accountable to anyone because the district was drawn for him.” After Monday’s Supreme Court ruling, she hopes, power will be back in the hands of the people—so long as she can get them out of their homes and to the polls. “To me the biggest challenge is going to be just making sure that we’re able to get people out to vote.” This story has been updated.

Jones denied the allegations during his web show last Friday and accused one of the lawyers involved of framing him.  Lawyers say the imagery was among documents they had requested from Jones as part of the discovery process of the lawsuit. The families of eight victims of the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and an FBI agent who responded to the massacre, are suing Jones, Infowars and others for promoting a theory that the shooting was a hoax. Jones, of Austin, Texas, has since said he believes the shooting occurred. A court hearing on the documents is scheduled for Tuesday. Jones, who lives in Travis county, Texas, has used his media platform to call the mass shooting at an elementary school that killed 26 people a hoax and suggested a political cover-up took place by leftwing forces seeking to take advantage of the shooting to support their causes, such as gun control. In 2013, he called the massacre “staged” and continued to stoke his conspiracy theory for years. “Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufactured,” he said in a January 2015 broadcast. Although his theory is false, people who believe Jones have for years harassed and taunted families of the victims, court papers showed and the families have said. Some families said they have been subjected to death threats and been forced to move several times in an effort to escape harassment. On 14 December 2012, a gunman killed 20 young children and six adults at the elementary school in an attack that ranks among the deadliest mass shootings by a single gunman in US history.",2019-06-17 17:00:36,Lawyers claim Infowars’ Alex Jones sent child sex abuse images to Sandy Hook victims,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

364,https://www.theroot.com/parkland-shooting-survivor-kyle-kashuv-loses-his-place-1835596941,"Sometimes, life comes at you fast. And Kyle Kashuv, the pro-gun teen who was among the survivors of the mass shooting at Parkland, Fla.’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, seems to be learning that lesson the hard way. On Monday, Kashuv shared his astonishment that Harvard had rescinded his admission because of his use of racial slurs in texts he sent two years ago, HuffPost reports. The texts included repeated use of the word “nigger,” including the uhm, observation: “like im really good at typing nigger ok like practice uhhhhhh makes perfect son??!!” HuffPost reported last month on the existence of the racist messages, for which Kashuv, now 18, apologized, saying: “We were 16-year-olds making idiotic comments, using callous and inflammatory language in an effort to be as extreme and shocking as possible.” But in a case where actions seem to have had consequences, Harvard apparently decided to nix Kashuv’s acceptance into the Class of 2023. In a series of tweets Monday, Kashuv posted what he said was an image of the letter he’d received from Harvard announcing its decision, which read in part: “We are sorry about the circumstances that have led us to withdraw your admission, and we wish you success in your future academic endeavors and beyond.” Kashuv—who’s had speaking engagements before National Rifle Association forums and, according to HuffPost, once had a leadership position with Turning Point USA, a college Republican group with what HuffPost referred to as a “white supremacy” problem—called out Harvard’s decision as shortsighted, tweeting: “Throughout its history, Harvard’s faculty has included slave owners, segregationists, bigots and antisemites,” he said. “If Harvard is suggesting that growth isn’t possible and that our past defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently racist institution. But I don’t believe that. I believe that institutions and people can grow.” Harvard wouldn’t comment on the specifics of Kashuv’s admission decision, but told HuffPost: Asked to confirm the letter’s authenticity, a Harvard spokesperson said the college doesn’t comment on individual cases, but provided a list of reasons the school might rescind admission, including “behavior that brings into question their honesty, maturity or moral character.” Meanwhile, conservative punditry practically had a conniption fit upon learning of Kashuv’s fate, with reactions that bordered on the insanity a notion that probably could be best summed up as, “If it’s wrong to say ‘nigger,’ I don’t want to be right.” As commentator Ben Shapiro opined, according to HuffPost: “Harvard’s auto-da-fe sets up an insane, cruel standard no one can possibly meet.” Yeah, it’s sooo hard to avoid saying that racial slur. Just impossible, right? I said it when the texts first broke weeks ago, but he is exactly who his classmates said he was, without saying it in so many words. They were in fact being kind. He is also who he showed himself to be even before we knew this particular little nugget. He’s an asshole kid well on his way to becoming an asshole adult. But, hey, Fox News and the NRA got your back, Kyle.  You’ll be fine.  Meanwhile, David Hogg is waving at you from Harvard, you little prig.",2019-06-17 20:00:00,Parkland Shooting Survivor Kyle Kashuv Loses His Place at Harvard After Racist Text Messages Surface,,368082,http://theroot.com/

        Salvador Hernandez Last updated on June 18, 2019, at 10:48 a.m. ET Posted on June 17, 2019, at 10:20 p.m. ET Alex Jones, the infamous conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder, handed over several emails containing child pornography to the lawyers for families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims who have filed a lawsuit against the far-right media figure. The child pornography was found in 12 emails of more than 57,000 messages that were turned over by Jones to lawyers representing families of the school victims, Jones' attorney Norm Pattis said. One of the images was discovered when consultants hired by attorneys for the Sandy Hook families began to review the files, prompting them to contact the FBI, according to court documents. On his radio show Friday, Jones insinuated he had been the victim of a conspiracy that involved attorneys on the opposite side of the lawsuit planting child pornography in his emails. ""You're trying to set me up with child porn!"" Jones said, while announcing a $1 million reward to his viewers to find and prove the material had been planted. ""Imma get your ass,"" Jones warned. ""One million dollars, one million, you little gang member. One million dollars to put your head on a pike."" Families of students killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012 have sued Jones and Infowars for defamation over his repeated claims that the shooting was a hoax. The lawsuit alleges that Jones and his guests continuously suggested the mass shooting had been faked and that relatives of the victims who spoke out about their loved ones' deaths had been “crisis actors.” Jones has said he believes the shooting occurred, but that it is his right to be able to question the events from the shooting. “I am proud of questioning Sandy Hook,” Jones said during his show Friday. ""I was not the progenitor, or the daddy of it. The public questioned it, so it was the tail wagging the dog.” As part of the lawsuit, Jones had been ordered to turn over thousands of Infowars emails referencing the shooting as part of the lawsuit's discovery process. Ana Márquez-Greene, pictured, was one of 26 people killed in a shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. The trove of data containing the child pornography was handed over to the FBI, which reviewed the material and found additional images in the cache. According to court filings, FBI investigators told attorneys that the pornography — which would be a crime to possess — ""had apparently been sent to Infowars email addresses."" Jones' attorney, Pattis, told BuzzFeed News the emails had not been opened by anyone at Infowars, including Jones. ""Neither he nor his defense, nor for that matter lawyers for plaintiffs knew the material was embedded in emails until a big data processing firm found them,"" Pattis said in an email. It's still unclear where the emails or the images came from, Pattis said, adding that Infowars had seen a ""spike of this sort of thing"" after the 2016 election. But on his show Friday, Jones insinuated the discovery was part of a conspiracy to peg him as a pedophile, and singled out one of the attorneys representing Sandy Hook families. ""We all know who did it,"" Jones said on his show as the camera focused on a Wikipedia entry for Chris Mattei, a trial lawyer for the firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, which filed a suit against Jones. Jones was also seen pounding on the picture of Mattei with his fist. ""What a good American, what a good boy,"" Jones said of Mattei. ""I'm gonna kill..."" he said before trailing off. During the segment, Jones repeatedly denied being being aware of the images and tried repeatedly to link pedophilia and child abuse to Democrats. ""I like women with big giant tits and big asses. I don't like kids like you goddamn rapists,"" Jones said. ""I literally would never have sex with children, I don't like having sex with children, I would never have sex with children. I am not a Democrat. I am not a liberal. I do not cut children's genitals off like the left does."" In a court filing Monday afternoon, attorneys representing Sandy Hook families asked the judge in the case to review video from Jones' show and accused him of threatening Mattei and his firm. Pattis denied that the Infowars host was threatening anyone and said ""to suggest otherwise is to engage in precious pleading."" The day after the show was broadcast, Jones apologized for cursing and backtracked from his accusations suggesting that the images had been planted. ""I'm not saying that the lawyers for Sandy Hook families set this up or did this,"" Jones said. ""Whoever sent this, for whatever reason, this shows the escalation and the insanity of all of this."" Jones also backed off his $1 million reward offer for those he suggested planted the pornography, saying he ""did become unhinged"" during the rant Friday. “Technically, I did not issue the offer correctly,” Jones said. “(Pattis is) going to explain this. So the original press release they put out stands: $100,000.”  Salvador Hernandez is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

Some Of Them Contained Child Porn.,,6218,http://www.buzzfeed.com
366,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/06/17/alex-jones-getting-bad-rap-story-know-one-mean/,"“Lawyers for Sandy Hook families say Alex Jones sent them child porn,” blares the headline at the CT Post. When I first saw it, I missed a breath. Why the hell would he mail evidence that he’s into child porn to people who are already suing him? Did he miss a memo that possessing and transmitting child porn will get you hard time in a federal pen? But read the story. He didn’t mail it, and it wasn’t sent to the families. It was sent to their lawyers in the course of discovery for the defamation suit he’s facing. The law firm representing the families of the 2012 mass shooting, stated in court documents filed Monday they have contacted the FBI after discovering child porn in electronic files Jones recently turned over to the Sandy Hook families as a result of their lawsuit against him for calling the tragedy a hoax… Court documents stated that the Sandy Hook lawyers had begun reviewing the electronic files that Jones had turned over when they found child pornography in the files. They immediately contacted the FBI. “The FBI advised counsel that its review located numerous additional illegal images, which had apparently been sent to InfoWars email addresses,” they stated. Wait a sec. The child porn was attached to emails sent to Jones, not from him? As in, it might — emphasis: might — have been sent unsolicited, by someone who dislikes him and wanted to slip grounds for his imprisonment onto his server possibly without him knowing? And if he did know, why did he produce it? Surely he’d have realized that getting caught with child porn would carry much stiffer consequences for him than the defamation suit. If he loses the suit, he might go broke; if he’s nicked with kiddie porn, he might never see daylight again. The rational, albeit illegal, thing to do if a discovery request required you to produce material which you *knew* contained child porn would be to destroy the material and risk whatever comparatively lesser penalty that carried. Jones didn’t do that, though. Which suggests to me, and to lawyer Max Kennerly, that he didn’t know what was in those files. 4) The FBI asks for the whole dump of emails, which plaintiffs give them. 5) The FBI reports back it found numerous child pornography images, apparently sent to InfoWars addresses.6) As far as we can tell, nobody claims Alex Jones solicited or even knew about them. /2 — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) June 17, 2019  9) The plaintiffs have filed a motion. Thus far, they haven't sought specific relief, but presumably it's some sort of sanctions and or a gag order to preclude Jones from talking about them or the case. You can read it here: https://t.co/BJjcvrq9PN /4 — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) June 17, 2019  That is the big ""if,"" and I have to assume he didn't know. If he did know and had any semblance of self-preservation, he would've set his servers on fire or told his lawyer or done *anything* other than turn them over for production to the plaintiffs. https://t.co/L4Rti6FXeO — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) June 17, 2019  That’s not to say “destruction of evidence is good!” It’s bad! But I find it unlikely Alex Jones’s respect for non-spoliation of evidence outweighs his love for himself. If he knew there was child pornography, I assume he’d have done anything to avoid producing it. — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) June 17, 2019  In the history of the United States, has anyone ever knowingly provided evidence that they possessed child porn to someone whom they had reason to believe would turn them in? The only scenario in which Jones seems likely to be guilty of a crime here is if he had received the images, looked at them, and then just … forgot that they were in the Infowars archives somewhere. A bona fide pervert would have better opsec than that, I suspect. His lawyer, Norm Pattis, told the site Law & Crime today that “I spoke to federal prosecutors last week. They report that there is no indication anyone at InfoWars knowingly possessed child pornography. The items were embedded in emails sent to folks at InfoWars without ever having been opened.” I believe it. Can you imagine the sort of people who email Alex Jones? Here he is with Pattis a few days ago responding to the allegations. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved.",2019-06-17 22:41:53,Is Alex Jones getting a bad rap on that story?

          / CBS/AP A Christchurch businessman who shared a video of worshippers being slaughtered at a New Zealand mosque has been sentenced to 21 months in prison. Philip Arps had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of distributing the video, which was livestreamed on Facebook by a gunman on March 15 as he began killing 51 people at two mosques. He was one of six people charged with sharing the footage. Judge Stephen O'Driscoll said that when questioned about the video, Arps had described it as ""awesome"" and showed no empathy toward the victims. The judge said Arps had strong and unrepentant views about the Muslim community, and had compared himself to Rudolf Hess, a Nazi leader under Adolf Hitler. ""Your offending glorifies and encourages the mass murder carried out under the pretext of religious and racial hatred,"" the judge said. O'Driscoll said Arps had sent the video to 30 associates. The judge said Arps also asked somebody to insert crosshairs and include a kill count in order to create an internet meme, although there was no evidence he'd shared the meme. Arps' lawyer Anselm Williams told the judge that Arps should not be sent to prison. ""It's my submission that this court needs to be very careful to sentence Mr. Arps based on what it is that he has actually done, and what he accepts he has done, not on the basis of the views that he holds,"" Williams said. After the hearing, Williams said Arps had filed an appeal against his sentence at the High Court, but declined to comment further. Arps' sentencing comes days after the suspected gunman, 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant, pleaded not guilty to 92 charges related to the mass shooting. If Tarrant does not change his plea, his trial is set to begin in May 2020. His next hearing will be Aug. 15. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has helped lead a global pledge named the ""Christchurch Call,"" aimed at boosting efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate, organize extremist groups and broadcast attacks. New Zealand has also tightened its gun laws and banned certain types of semi-automatic weapons since the attack. First published on June 17, 2019 / 11:36 PM © 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

Filed under: Anonymous users are being sued by Twitch If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Twitch is suing malicious users who took over the streaming platform’s Artifact category and flooded it with gore, pornography, copyrighted content, and even a video of a mass shooting. The lawsuit, which was filed on June 14 in a U.S. District Court in Northern California, is against unidentified streamers listed as “John and Jane Does 1 through 100.” The lawsuit alleges trademark infringement, breach of contract, fraud, and unlawful use of the company’s platform. “Twitch’s success is due in part to the measures it has taken to create a safe and accessible community for its millions of users,” the lawsuit reads. “Twitch does not tolerate harassing or dangerous content, nudity and sexually explicit content or activities, or physical violence (including gore).” In May, streamers noted that Artifact, the Dota 2 collectible card game, only had a small base of a few hundred viewers at any given time. This is notable for a game from a large studio like Valve, and once users noticed how quiet the section was, they began to stream copyrighted material, memes, and blatantly offensive content. The darker streams included footage of the Christchurch mosque shootings, self-mutilation, and hardcore pornography. Some banned users would simply use a new IP address with a fresh account to keep streaming the offensive content. The lawsuit cites these attempts, reading: Twitch took down the posts and banned the offending accounts, but the offensive video streams quickly reappeared using new accounts. It appears that Defendants use automated methods to create accounts and disseminate offensive material as well as to thwart Twitch’s safety mechanisms. Such methods are often referred to as “bots.” Defendants also use bots to artificially increase the popularity of the streams broadcasting the offensive conduct, making those streams more easily discoverable by users browsing Twitch. To protect the Twitch community, Twitch took the extremely disruptive step of disabling streaming for all newly created accounts for almost two days before imposing two-factor authentication for certain accounts. In response, Defendants sought to evade these steps using old accounts as well as accounts purchased from other users. Twitch alleges in the lawsuit that the raid lasted so long because users coordinated off-site using channels like Discord and Weebly to continue broadcasting streams. Twitch suspended the ability for new users to stream and proactively banned any user in the Artifact section not streaming Artifact on May 28 in order to get the situation under control. While it appears that Twitch does not know exactly who is responsible for the attack, the company says it will amend its lawsuit with the identified parties “if and when the legal names of such persons or entities become known.” The lawsuit may serve as a legal warning to other Twitch streamers who might attempt the same trick elsewhere on its site. Twitch has provided a statement to Polygon via email, which reads: Over the weekend of May 25, we became aware of a number of accounts engaging in a coordinated attack targeting the “Artifact” game directory to share content that grossly violates our terms of service. We worked with urgency to remove the offending content and suspend all accounts engaged in this behavior, and are taking measures to prevent this from happening on our service in the future. We take these violations extremely seriously — we are pursuing litigation to identify these bad actors, and will take all appropriate actions to protect our community.

Located beside an interstate highway downtown, the structure is now nothing but a steel frame and roof. Work is being done under the constant watch of security guards. The new facility could be complete around November, the same time the new state law will take effect unless blocked by courts. Abortion critics vow to oppose the opening, but a spokeswoman for the women’s health organization says neither the new law nor opponents were a factor in the project. “We are a doctor that Birmingham has counted on for decades, and we are committed to continuing to provide that care,” says Barbara Ann Luttrell, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based Planned Parenthood Southeast. Anchorage: Sealaska Heritage Institute officials say they are collaborating with a university that is studying how the DNA of indigenous people might have been affected by trauma linked to European colonization. Researchers from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign will be at the Juneau-based institute this week for the project focusing on Tlingit people with ties to Hoonah. Another research trip to Hoonah is planned for later this year. Institute officials say researchers anticipate recruiting 50 volunteers to give blood samples and take a survey. Participants will receive $50 Amazon gift cards. Officials say individual information by participants will be anonymous, and the institute is consulting on the effort with the Hoonah Indian Association and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium. Phoenix: State officials and architects are pondering the future of newly vacated space in the Capitol complex. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that ideas for the state library’s former home on the third floor of an annex sitting between the 118-year-old copper-domed Capitol and the nine-story Executive Tower are percolating. The ideas include adding a dignitary reception venue and a neutral meeting ground for legislative leaders and executive branch officials. Such facilities are common among states, but Arizona’s setup of separate House and Senate buildings leaves little extra space for joint activities. When legislative leaders want to meet with the governor, they usually go to the governor’s office. The current planning includes refreshing plans drafted in the mid-2000s that were put on the backburner by the Great Recession. Little Rock: Lockheed Martin says it is spending $142 million and hiring 326 new workers over the next few years as it expands its south Arkansas facility. The Maryland-based company on Monday announced the expansion of its plant in Camden, about 85 miles southwest of Little Rock. The Camden facility currently employs about 700 workers. The expansion will support new construction and improve existing facilities for products such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, Army Tactical Missile System and others, plus new machinery and equipment. The company and Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the expansion at the Paris Air Show. State Economic Development officials say the company is receiving a performance-based income tax credit and cash rebate for the expansion. Palm Springs: It’s little surprise that the former playground of pianist Liberace, actor Rock Hudson and entertainer Tab Hunter is gaining a reputation as a great place where older people from the LGBTQ community can live and feel welcome. Palm Springs recently was named the world’s best place for LGBTQ seniors to travel to or retire. Other cities on the list, created by AARP Travel Center and Expedia, include well-known, gay-friendly places like Provincetown, Massachusetts; Minneapolis; and New York. LGBTQ seniors can find a number of resources in Palm Springs that other cities might not have, like the Stonewall Gardens Assisted Living home. Other highlights mentioned on the list include many of the town’s notorious pastimes that have helped turn it into a gay mecca, like its pool parties, drag shows, mid-century shopping and spectacular scenery. Denver: Thousands of people turned out for the Denver Pride Parade on Sunday. Gov. Jared Polis, the nation’s first openly gay governor, and his partner, Marlon Reis, served as grand marshals along with Colorado’s first transgender state legislator, Brianna Titone, Out Boulder executive director Mardi Moore and drag performer Peppermint. The parade headed past the state Capitol decorated with a rainbow flag with the Colorado state logo on it. The parade was part of a weekend long PrideFest and marked the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York City. The Denver Post reports that festival organizers expected attendance this year to exceed last year’s estimated crowd of 425,000. Hartford: The state Department of Agriculture has been busy processing applications from dozens interested in growing industrial hemp as part of a new research pilot program. The state’s goal has been to get the licenses approved for the new growing season. As of Friday, the agency had approved 35 licenses for growers. An additional 24 applications were undergoing a review. Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt says in total, the approved licenses and completed applications equate to 130 acres approved for growing hemp. A handful of people so far have sought permits to process the hemp or manufacture hemp products. Connecticut’s program will ultimately need final federal approval, which is expected in 2020. After that, hemp growers and processors will no longer be required to “research” hemp. Dover: State senators are set to vote on a bill expanding the decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana to juveniles. Possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is currently a civil violation for anyone over 21 but a criminal misdemeanor for those under 18. Nineteen and 20-year-olds currently are subject to a civil violation for a first offense but misdemeanor charges for a second or subsequent offense. A bill to be voted on Tuesday makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil violation for a first offense in all cases. The bill would make a third or subsequent offense for anyone under 21 a misdemeanor. Washington: A locally based group called Make Integrity Great Again has refiled a complaint to the D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board asking the board not to renew the Trump International Hotel’s liquor license, WUSA-TV reports. The organization initially wrote the ABC Board last June protesting the renewal of the liquor license, according to the board’s ruling documents. In its statement, Make Integrity Great Again argued that D.C. law states that applicants of a liquor license must be of “good character and generally fit for the responsibilities of licensure.” According to the group, President Donald Trump doesn’t embody those requirements. The ABC board declined to take the 2018 case, stating the group of D.C. residents filed their petition after the hotel had already been granted its license. But the group refiled the petition before the license was up for renewal. Fort Lauderdale: A South Florida man thought he snagged a deal when he paid $9,100 in an online auction for what he thought was a villa. What he got was a 1-foot-by-100-foot strip of land. Valued at only $50, the land starts on a curb and goes under a wall separating two villas in the Spring Lake community and then out to the back of the lot. An official tells the South Florida Sun Sentinel there’s not a lot Kerville Holness can do about his purchase. Holness says he was deceived. He says property appraiser photos linked to the auction site show a villa being on the parcel for which he made a bid. But the newspaper says the appraiser’s site and information on the county’s tax site show no building value. Savannah: The number of sea turtle nests along the state’s coast is on pace to set a record this year. Kris Williams, director of Caretta Research Project, a sea turtle conservation organization, told the Savannah Morning News that beach patrols along the Georgia coast between Tybee and Cumberland islands had recorded 1,726 nests by early last week. Last year’s season total was 1,742. Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Biologist Mark Dodd said if nesting continues increasing, he expects up to 4,500 nests by the end of the season. The previous record, set in 2016, is 3,289 loggerhead nests. Loggerhead sea turtles are the species seen most often in Georgia. Nesting season usually reaches its peak in June and continues into early July. Less intense nesting usually lasts through August. Honolulu: The popular Kalalau Trail and Haena State Park are reopening on the Hawaiian island of Kauai this week but will have fewer people. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports only 900 visitors a day will be allowed inside the park starting Monday. That’s down from an estimated 3,000 people who used to visit daily. The 11-mile Kalalau Trail, which begins inside the park, is heralded as one of the world’s most beautiful hikes. The limits are outlined in a new master plan developed over two decades. Park users must now make online reservations. Visitors are encouraged to ride a shuttle to the park due to limited parking for private vehicles. Also reopening is Kuhio Highway leading to the park. The road suffered severe damage when record-breaking rains triggered mudslides last year. Boise: A federal judge has ruled that work can go forward on a trail crossing private land that connects the popular central Idaho tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley. U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale late last week rejected a request by the owners of Sawtooth Mountain Ranch to halt construction of the 4.4-mile trail for pedestrians, cyclists, horseback riders and snowmobilers. The U.S. Forest Service has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that allows a trail 30 feet wide to cross about 1.5 miles of private property. Ranch owners David Boren and Lynn Arnone filed the lawsuit in April seeking to halt work, contending the plan needs additional environmental reviews. But Dale ruled that Boren and Arnone failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their arguments. Peoria: A recent retirement party at a medical center looked like a typical farewell celebration. Co-workers posed for pictures, shared a cookie cake and said their goodbyes. But the guest of honor sat silent as the small crowd gathered to celebrate 10 years of service. The retiree also weighed 12,000 pounds and was hoisted from the facility by a forklift. The Pekin Daily Times reports that the OSF HealthCare center in Peoria recently celebrated the retirement of its MRI machine. The old medical imaging device was removed from the facility last week, and it’s being replaced by a new, wide-bore MRI this summer. Jamie White, a manager at the center, describes saying goodbye to the machine as “bittersweet.” She says it was the first open MRI machine the center acquired. Indianapolis: A historic, one-of-a-kind covered bridge is going to the Geist neighborhood, thanks to some quick dealmaking between Hamilton and Jackson county commissioners. The 330-foot-long Bell Ford Bridge, built in 1869, spanned the East Fork of the White River near Seymour until storms damaged it years ago. It is the last remaining covered bridge in the United States with a combination timber and wrought iron frame, or truss, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Hamilton County officials will place the Bell Ford over Fall Creek to connect Geist Park and a nature trail. The county received a $2.7 million federal grant to restore the Bell Ford. One section of the bridge collapsed into the White River during a storm in 1999, and the other half fell into the river in 2006. The parts were fished from the riverbed and saved. Des Moines: Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the state set a record for rain and snow over the past 12 months. The state saw nearly 51 inches of precipitation from June 2018 through May of this year. That’s about 16 inches more than the 34.42 inches the state averaged per year from 1981 to 2010. State climatologist Justin Glisan says the past 12 months have been the wettest since 1895, the year officials began keeping weather records. He says Iowa can expect more rain as temperatures increase this summer because higher temperatures create more water vapor in the atmosphere. The USDA Midwest Climate Hub in Ames is predicting higher-than-average rainfall for most of the summer. Topeka: Gov. Laura Kelly says she plans to issue an executive order to end a long-standing economic border war between her state and Missouri in the Kansas City area. Kelly told reporters Friday that her executive order will mirror a new Missouri law that prevents incentives from being used to lure businesses across the border in the metropolitan area. The Missouri law takes effect only if Kansas acts. It was the first time that Kelly publicly committed to issuing an executive order. In Missouri, such a policy requires a change in state law. Both states have spent millions of dollars luring businesses across the state line over the past decade. Area officials see such efforts as wasteful and want to focus on attracting businesses from outside the region. Frankfort: The Kentucky Public Service Commission has ruled that electric car charging stations are not utilities and do not need to be subject to regulation. The ruling is intended to remove any ambiguity over the legal status of charging stations. The commission says it should also pave the way for more stations to be installed in the state. The commission says Kentucky has lagged neighboring states in the availability of public charging stations. The state has 94. The ruling hinged on whether charging stations are providing electric service to the public, which would make them fall under the commission’s jurisdiction. Commissioners determined the stations are consumers and end users of electricity. New Orleans: It’s a bad year for people who make their living from seafood in this part of the Gulf of Mexico. Floods from the Midwest are killing oysters and driving crabs, shrimp and finfish out of bays and marshes, into saltier water where they can survive. “On a scale of 1 to 10, we are 9-and-a-half destroyed,” says Brad Robin, whose family controls about 10,000 acres of oyster leases in Louisiana waters. “The light at the end of the tunnel right now is about out.” Many species that depend on a brackish mix of fresh and saltwater in coastal estuaries are decamping as this year’s huge floods flush in fresh water, laden with pollution from farms and cities in the Mississippi River basin. The situation is grim: Louisiana’s oyster harvest is 80% below average for this time of year, and more oysters are expected to die as temperatures rise, according to a preliminary report. Boothbay Harbor: Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage’s wife won’t be the only one in their family spending the summer working at a restaurant. LePage will be joining her as a bartender. McSeagulls Restaurant owner Jeff Stoddard says he hasn’t finalized the former governor’s schedule but expects him to be tending bar for the entire summer in Boothbay Harbor. The governor’s wife, Ann, will be working there again as a server. The restaurant posted photos on social media showing the former governor and first lady wearing McSeagulls T-shirts that proclaimed, “Eat, Drink & Flounder, Just for the Halibut.” The LePages spent the winter at their home in Florida. It’s unclear where they’re staying this summer. They sold their Boothbay home last summer. Baltimore: The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra is locking out its musicians now that contract and salary negotiations have stalled. The Baltimore Sun reports the lockout starts Monday. Musicans say they’re also losing 12 weeks of pay since management abruptly canceled summer concerts. Musicians have been playing without a new contract since September. A statement from orchestra president and Chief Executive Peter Kjome says its business model needs to change. The management wants to cut the performers’ pay and vacation time as well as reducing the season from year-round to 40 weeks. The musicians say managers aren’t willing to make similar cuts to their own salaries and are starving the organization to protect its endowment. Boston: Hundreds gathered over the weekend to celebrate the opening of a park named in honor of the youngest victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Gov. Charlie Baker joined Mayor Mary Walsh and members of Martin Richard’s family Saturday to open Martin’s Park. It features an accessible playground, including a replica of a boat, a water play garden and open space. Martin was one of three people killed when two bombs exploded at the finish line. His younger sister Jane lost a leg. During Saturday’s ceremony, Jane sang “A Million Dreams,” from the film “The Greatest Showman.” Martin’s father, Bill Richard, said in a statement that the park is a “symbol of the commitment of so many individuals and their dedication to building a more kind, just and inclusive community here.” Detroit: The onetime home of President Ulysses S. Grant is being moved from the former Michigan State Fairgrounds to the Eastern Market, where it will be refashioned as a public education and resource center. Sandra Clark, the director of the Michigan History Center, said Thursday that the two-story white clapboard house will be established as a museum to explore Grant’s life and his impact on Detroit. The Civil War general lived at the house with his wife, Julia Dent, from April 1849 to May 1850. The Michigan State Housing and Development Authority is helping to fund the move, which Clark says could cost $200,000. The move is tentatively set for August. HistoricDetroit.org says the house is moving to make way for development on the fairgrounds that have been dormant since 2008. Minneapolis: For decades, the state has resisted allowing cameras in courtrooms for the usual arguments – lawyers would grandstand, witnesses would be intimidated, decorum would be disrupted. Under rules that allowed the judge, prosecutors or defense attorneys to veto camera coverage during the trial phase, seeing a Minnesota trial on TV “would be as common as running into a unicorn in deer hunting season,” as media attorney Mark Anfinson put it. But video coverage of high-profile sentencings – which don’t require approval from the parties involved – is giving a more frequent glimpse inside Minnesota courts. That’s cheered advocates of openness in the court system, even as they wish for easier access at the trial phase. “It’s a definite first step. It’s not the finish line,” says Anfinson, who has seen an increase in video requests from news organizations since the launch of a pilot project in 2015. Natchez: Workers have started installing the foundation for a monument honoring civil rights activists who were arrested in 1965 and taken to a notorious prison where they were held several days without being put on trial. The Natchez Democrat reports the “Proud to Take a Stand” monument is being built near a spot downtown where the mostly young, black protesters were held before being taken to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. Mayor Darryl Grennell says his father, Jonathan Grennell, was among the protesters arrested while marching for civil rights. They did not have a permit, as was then required by a city ordinance. The rule was later declared unconstitutional. Grennell says he’d like to have the monument finished by Oct. 2, the anniversary of the march. Jefferson City: The state could soon become the first to allow outdoor cremations. A bill dubbed the “Jedi Disposal Act” would allow licensed funeral directors to organize outdoor cremations at licensed crematoriums or private sites that have permits. The bill got its name from the “Star Wars” movie franchise, in which two Jedi Knights are cremated in public ceremonies. It passed nearly unanimously in this year’s legislative sessions and is awaiting Gov. Mike Parson’s signature. Sen. Jason Holsman, a Kansas City Democrat, says outdoor cremations have been performed “since the dawn of man,” including by Native Americans and U.S. settlers. The Kansas City Star reports that the only place in the U.S. where public outdoor cremations are legal is the small Colorado town of Crestone. Missoula: Glacier National Park has rolled out a new online tool that aims to help visitors find places to park. The Missoulian reported Saturday that the Montana park’s Recreation Access Display gives live updates on campgrounds, parking lots, car access restrictions and weather. The website has a chart indicating whether each campground is open, closed or full. It also gives the times when the campgrounds filled the previous day. It gives the same information for each of the eight parking lots. Park public affairs assistant Kristine Abbey says the website is currently for optimized for computers, but it does work on mobile phones. Lincoln: A community college is using robots to put long-distance students inside the classrooms. Students establish communication through a tablet computer mounted on a self-balancing chassis on wheels. They can then navigate the Southeast Community College campuses in Lincoln, Beatrice and Milford as robotic avatars, guided by personal digital devices. Christopher Cummins, the college’s director of instruction technology, told the Lincoln Journal Star that teleconferencing often used by long-distance students can be “the incorrect tool for what the instructor is trying to accomplish.” He says robots give students the chance to interact in class, join small-group activities or linger behind after class to ask follow-up questions. Las Vegas: Officials at the National Atomic Testing Museum say it has outgrown its space east of the Las Vegas Strip and is looking for a new location to expand its nuclear testing exhibits. The museum opened in 2005 and became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution in 2011. It chronicles the development of atomic weapons and Nevada’s history hosting above-ground tests for the weapons for decades. The museum’s education director, Jordan McGee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the museum has been in the same location for 15 years. She did not have details on where the museum might move. The museum’s displays include radiation detectors, a simulator for an atmospheric test blast and pop culture memorabilia from the atomic age. Pinkham Notch: The annual race up the highest peak in the Northeast ended in the first photo finish over the weekend. Brittni Hutton, 29, of Lubbock, Texas, led the entire race, but Heidi Caldwell, 27, of Craftsbury Common, Vermont, caught her at the finish line Saturday. Both finished with a time of 1 hour, 16 minutes, 17 seconds in the women’s division of the 7.6-mile race to the 6,288-foot summit of Mount Washington. Judges initially thought Hutton had won but later declared a tie. Eric Blake, 40, of West Hartford, Connecticut, won the men’s division with a time of 1:02:52, besting Kenyan Francis Kamiri by about a minute. Mount Washington, known for weather extremes, had a temperature of about 37 degrees and gusts of 50 mph at the start of the race. Trenton: The state has unveiled a pair of regulations aimed at returning it to a regional greenhouse gas-reduction coalition. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced the rules Monday. Murphy says one would mean a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at electricity-producing plants by 2030. Murphy announced last year that New Jersey would rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative after Republican Chris Christie pulled the state from the group in 2011. The cap-and-trade program is made up of nine New England and Mid-Atlantic states working to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. One rule calls for setting an 18 million-ton cap on carbon emissions in 2020. Figures from the Energy Information Administration show that’s roughly the same as 2017. The second rule crates a framework for implementing involvement in the group. Las Cruces: A new mural seeks to honor missing and slain Native Americans amid a nationwide push to bring more attention to the issue. Artist Sebastian “Vela” Velazquez recently erected the mural in Las Cruces in conjunction with the city’s eighth annual “Illegal” graffiti art show. The work is part of a large-scale mural wrapping around the entirety of the Cruces Creatives building. In the mural, a Native American woman stands in front with her fist raised. She’s screaming, and the words below say: “NO MORE STOLEN SISTERS!” “The news gets turned off, and Facebook gets put down and turned off, and those issues kind of disappear and everything that comes with it,” Velazquez says. “Having that piece up there, and why we sponsored it, is because you can’t really turn off a mural. It’s there every day and every night.” New York: The battle to contain the worst U.S. measles outbreak in 27 years has a new front – summer camp. Vaccinations have been made mandatory this summer for campers and staff in several counties north of New York City that annually fill up with kids from the Orthodox Jewish communities that have been hit hardest by measles. Ulster County took the extra step of mandating the measles vaccine or proof of immunity at all day camps and overnight camps, becoming the latest county in the area to issue immunization requirements. Rockland County announced a similar order this month, following mandates from Sullivan and Orange counties. “We have to make sure our t’s are crossed and our i’s are dotted in making sure all these vaccination records are in,” said Rabbi Hanoch Hecht, of Ulster County’s Camp Emunah, which hosts many girls from a Chabad community in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights. Mebane: A burglary suspect who was fought off by an 11-year-old boy with a machete was caught Sunday, nearly two days after he slipped away from the hospital where he was treated for a head wound. His capture came after a manhunt and finger-pointing about who was to blame for his escape. Sgt. Shane Brown of the Burlington Police Department said Jataveon Dashawn Hall was arrested there Sunday afternoon. Hall, 19, was returned to Orange County, where the sheriff’s office said he faces charges including breaking and entering and assault. Authorities said the boy was alone in the house in Mebane on Friday morning when Hall broke in after another suspect rang the doorbell and a third waited outside. Hall forced the boy into a closet and was stealing electronics when the boy emerged, grabbed a machete and hit the suspect in the head with the blade, drawing blood, according to the sheriff’s office. Hall and the other suspects then fled. Bismarck: The Federal Highway Administration has approved construction of a bridge across the Little Missouri River in western North Dakota, although some private landowners have been fighting the project, and supporters have not said how they will pay for it. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the Billings County Commission wants the river crossing to improve emergency response. Opponents worry it would alter the remote and scenic landscape of the Badlands. One rancher has said it would destroy his property. An environmental study last year identified the site north of Medora as the preferred route, which the feds approved last week. Billings County Commission Chairman Jim Arthaud says a timeline for the project has not yet been established. The next steps include meeting with private landowners to try to obtain right-of-way. Cincinnati: The last of five stops for a special exhibition for the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing will be in Cincinnati. Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission will open at the Cincinnati Museum Center on Sept. 28 and run through Feb. 7, 2020. The exhibition features the Columbia command module and more than 20 objects flown on the Apollo 11 mission. There are also models and videos exploring the birth and development of the U.S. space program. Neil Armstrong, who lived in a Cincinnati suburb following his space career, and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon July 20, 1969, meeting President John F. Kennedy’s bold deadline for putting a man on the lunar surface by the end of the 1960s. Armstrong died in August 2012 at age 82. Oklahoma City: The latest national report on the well-being of children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows Oklahoma has improved its economic, health, education and social factors for children, although the state remains in the bottom 20% of the rankings. The “Kids Count” report released Monday ranks Oklahoma 42nd among the 50 states, an improvement from 44th a year ago. The current ranking is based on data from 2017. The state showed improvement with lower percentages of children in poverty; low-birth weight babies; the childhood and teen death rate; the teen birth rate; and alcohol and drug abuse, as well as an increase in the percentage of children who have health insurance. The report also shows an increase in the percentage of children in single-parent families. Salem: The state is on the precipice of becoming the second, after California, to adopt a cap-and-trade program, a market-based approach to lowering the greenhouse gas emissions behind global warming. Supporters call it the United States’ most progressive climate policy, saying it not only cuts emissions but also invests in transitioning the state economy and infrastructure to better prepare for more intense weather events as climate change worsens. “We have an opportunity to invest a substantial amount into low-income communities off the backs of the 100 or so major polluters that caused this problem,” said Shilpa Joshi, with the lobbying group Renew Oregon, who has spent years working with dozens of organizations around the state to help shape the final legislation. Cap-and-trade has been a top priority this year for Oregon’s majority Democrats, and Gov. Kate Brown has said she would sign the measure. Harrisburg: Good fiscal times may not necessarily mean good fiscal condition for the state. The rage in the Capitol right now is the surplus that state government rolled up in the almost-ended fiscal year. But that surplus hasn’t necessarily changed outside views that Pennsylvania has tall fiscal challenges. The surplus is expected to ease the passage of an on-time budget and leave a substantial sum to deposit into a reserve fund. Such a deposit hits on a key criticism of credit rating agencies – that Pennsylvania lacks reserve cash. Still, Pennsylvania remains among the lowest-rated states by credit-rating agencies, which often criticize the state’s budget-management practices. In a research note last week, Moody’s said Pennsylvania has routinely shown little willingness to enact structural solutions to its budget challenges. Newport: The state is identifying and marking sites that have historical ties to slavery. The Newport Daily News reports that the medallions to be used in the Rhode Island Slave History Medallions Project will be unveiled Wednesday at a lecture by Brown University history professor Joanne Pope Melish at the Colony House in Newport. Charles Roberts, the chairman of the project, will unveil the medallion. The first medallion installation is scheduled for Aug. 25 at Patriots Park in Portsmouth. The project’s focus is marking sites that have a “historical connection to the enslavement of indigenous people and Africans, either by their involvement in the slave trade and the economy of slavery, or by their association with the lives and labor of enslaved people themselves.” Awendaw: A man has been charged with branding sharks like cattle off the state’s coast. News outlets cite South Carolina Natural Resources officials who say a 56-year-old Awendaw man was charged with illegal tagging of a saltwater fish last week. The misdemeanor can net a fine of up to $200. Officials say they were alerted about the brandings last month, as anglers off the South Carolina coast began catching sharks with a symbol that looked like a cursive letter burned just below their dorsal fins. Officials say they also saw photos of such sharks circulating on social media. The Post and Courier reports the brands could have been made with a propane torch or dry ice. The newspaper reports the suspect was “cooperative” with authorities. Sioux Falls: A blogger is circulating petitions that seek to roll back changes that state lawmakers have made to the initiated measure process. Cory Heidelberger says his “People Power Petitions” would eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks that are being thrown up to make it harder for citizens to have a say in their laws. One petition is for a referendum on House Bill 1094, which created a state registry of petition circulators and requires them to wear badges. The other is for an initiated measure to eliminate restrictions, including one that requires circulators to file affidavits with the state. Heidelberg says the initiated measure process gives all South Dakotans an equal ability to propose laws. Supporters of House Bill 1094 say it brings transparency to the initiated measure process. Nashville: Red paint and the phrase “they were racists” were discovered on a Confederate monument in a city park. Police say they found the vandalism Monday at the Confederate Private Monument in Centennial Park. Red liquid was doused on the statue, and the phrase was scrawled on a plaque with the names of more than 500 Tennessee Confederate soldiers. News outlets report police are reviewing footage from cameras in the park. The Metro Nashville Police Department told news outlets there hasn’t been a vandalism incident like this in the park in nearly seven years. The Confederate monument is one of two in Davidson County, with about 70 more across the state. Austin: Gov. Greg Abbott has approved a spending bill that includes a $1 million public safety campaign for firearm storage. The Republican signed a $250 billion two-year budget Saturday without any line-item vetoes. It includes money for the Texas Department of Public Safety to promote a safe gun storage campaign. The National Rifle Association and gun-rights activists had opposed similar legislation in Texas, where they’ve been a powerful force in a state with 1.3 million handgun license holders. An NRA lobbyist told lawmakers that a campaign designed by Texas state police could be corrupted by anti-gun rhetoric. The program follows a mass shooting at a high school near Houston last year. Authorities have said the then-17-year-old gunman took his father’s weapons before opening fire at Santa Fe High School. St. George: Police at Dixie State University are offering people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and others fingerprinting services – a required step to secure driving privileges in Utah. Police at the St. George campus decided to offer the service after the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah reached out to them. ACLU representative Sydni Makemo says the service should help hundreds of DACA recipients and immigrants living in southern Utah. A record of a person’s fingerprints is needed to obtain a driving privilege card. The card allows people to drive in Utah, but it cannot be used as a form of ID. Makemo says the service wasn’t previously offered in Washington County. Burlington: Biographer Willard Sterne Randall will be discussing one of the country’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, and his connections to Vermont and Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen at an event in the city this month. The talk entitled “Hamilton, the Man, the Musical – and his friend Ethan Allen” takes place June 23 at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum. It will include excerpts from the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton.” Randall wrote a biography of Hamilton among other works. Organizers say the event is free, but donations are appreciated. Williamsburg: The College of William & Mary says the masters of a wizardry school need to make a $70,000 debt disappear. The Virginian-Pilot reports the college says Learn Larp LLC hasn’t fully paid its $110,000 bill for hosting an adult role-playing event known as “New World Magischola.” A $695 ticket for the four-weekend camp in 2017 included meals, housing, and witch or wizard robes. Campers also competed for a house trophy, similar to that in the Harry Potter novel and film series. The organization says the event was first held at the college in Williamsburg. It has since been hosted in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. The registered agent for Learn Larp LLC wasn’t immediately reached for comment. Port Hadlock: At least one waterfront landowner has said yes to a request to allow dead gray whales to decompose on their property. So many gray whale carcasses have washed up this year that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries says it has run out of places to take them. In response, the agency has asked landowners to volunteer property as a disposal site for the carcasses. By doing so, landowners can support the natural process of the marine environment, and skeletons left behind can be used for educational purposes, officials said. But the carcasses can be up to 40 feet long. That’s a lot to decay, and it could take months. Landowner Mario Rivera of Port Hadlock told KING5-TV that the smell is intermittent and “isn’t that bad.” “It is really a unique opportunity to have this here on the beach and monitor it and see how fast it goes,” said his wife, Stefanie Worwag. Wheeling: A high school principal says she favors proposed curriculum charges that would no longer designate a valedictorian. The Intelligencer reports Wheeling Park High School Principal Amy Minch says administrators want to eliminate “the game” that forces students to compete for higher grade point averages, class standing and valedictorian status. She says that often results in students taking classes to boost their grade-point average instead of electives to help them in their career path or enrich them as a person. Under the proposal, the school would not rank students or give honors credits for electives. If approved, changes would begin with the class of 2024. The Ohio County Board of Education would have to approve the changes, and board member David Croft suggested gathering public opinion before voting. Madison: A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand eligibility for a forgivable loan program for trainee teachers after changes made four years ago led to a drop in loans awarded. The Minority Teacher Loan Program offers loans to African American, Latino, American Indian and some Southeast Asian populations to study teaching at a Wisconsin college. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that loan recipients must agree to teach in Milwaukee in a high-demand field and be rated proficient or distinguished in an evaluation. If those requirements are met, 25% of the interest and principal on loans is forgiven per year. Prior to the 2015 eligibility changes, the program awarded 212 loans in three years. It awarded only 11 loans in the three school years after, including just one in 2017-18. Jackson: Fodor’s Travel has rated Jackson Hole Airport as the best “tiny airport” in the United States. The airport, located within Grand Teton National Park, beat out second-place Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in neighboring Montana. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports that the travel site noted that airline passengers arriving at Jackson Hole Airport are greeted by breathtaking views of the Teton Range, and the terminal includes leather chairs and a roaring fireplace. Fodor’s did not specify what constitutes a “tiny airport.” Jackson Hole Airport officials this past week released plane traffic numbers for the month of May, showing a 58% increase in commercial activity over the same month a year before. Year to date, passenger numbers have increased 21% over record-breaking 2018.

Iran-US tension rises as Pentagon OKs sending more troops to Middle East and Rep. Omar blames Trump
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, one of Congress' most vocal critics of President Trump, placed the blame squarely on the White House after Iran announced it could enrich uranium up to 20 percent -- just a step below weapons-grade level. Omar took to Twitter on Monday condemning Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal shortly before the Pentagon approved sending 1,000 more troops to the Middle East in response to the attack. ""None of this would be happening if Trump didn't back out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" she tweeted. Omar said the U.S. should get back to negotiations with Tehran and reinstate the Iran nuclear deal. The tension between the U.S. and Iran has been increasing in recent days after a high-profile attack on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. blamed Iran for the attacks, which the country denied. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) released new images Monday showing the aftermath of attacks, including some images purporting to show Iranian forces removing an unexploded device from the hull of one of the vessels. Trump threatens to remove 'millions' of illegal immigrants starting next week
President Trump late Monday announced on Twitter that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will begin the process of ""removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the U.S.,"" but did not elaborate on what new measures will be taken. ""They will be removed as fast as they come,"" Trump wrote. Mike Morgan, the acting director of ICE, did not announce any new initiatives during his stop in Louisville on Sunday, where he spoke about the humanitarian and national security crisis at the border. Trump re-election campaign set to officially launch at Orlando rally
President Trump is expected to officially kick off his re-election campaign at a rally in Orlando, Fla. Tuesday night, and supporters have been lining up for days. Trump voters started gathering outside Orlando’s Amway Center more than 40 hours before the event is scheduled to start. The president tweeted on Monday morning that his campaign has received more than 100,000 ticket requests for the event in an arena that only holds 20,000 people. Tune in to Fox News tonight at 8 p.m. ET for live coverage of Trump's rally. New Jersey man the latest American tourist to die in the Dominican Republic: Report
The State Department has confirmed to Fox News that another American tourist has died in the Dominican Republic. Reportedly, it was a New Jersey man who was found dead on his hotel room floor. Joseph Allen, 55, of Avenel, New Jersey, was found dead last Thursday morning, WABC reported. The popular Caribbean vacation destination has been grappling with a rash of deaths of U.S. tourists in their hotel rooms at various resorts. Of the seven other recent deaths that have become publicly known, Dominican investigators said five were caused by a heart attack. Parkland shooting survivor apologizes for racist comments after Harvard rescinds his admission offer
The conservative Parkland shooting survivor and pro-Second Amendment activist who was dropped by Harvard University after past offensive remarks and racial slurs surfaced appeared Monday on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" where he apologized and asked for forgiveness. ""I'm extremely sorry for it and I wish I could take it back but I can't,"" Kyle Kashuv told guest host Ed Henry. ""All I can do now is seek to right the wrong."" Kashuv revealed on Twitter that Harvard rescinded his admission after the remarks he made as a 16-year-old came to light. The student, now 18, called comments ""offensive,"" ""idiotic"" and ""inflammatory"" and said he made them before the mass shooting -- which transformed him as a person.

The tragedy at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center fits an all too familiar pattern—yet another mass shooting in a place the victims were banned from carrying guns. The most lives are claimed in places where people can’t defend themselves on equal footing. It’s not a coincidence the attack occurred in a public building filled with public employees prohibited from carrying handguns, concealed or otherwise. This attack could have ended with much less bloodshed. Kate Nixon, a compliance manager at the municipal center, was concerned about a fellow employee and spoke with her husband the night before the attack about taking her permitted, concealed carry handgun to work. However, the city bans individuals, including public employees, from possessing ""any weapon"" on city property unless authorized by a supervisor so she decided against it. Unlike his law-abiding colleagues, the killer didn’t abide by the ban. Kate Nixon was one of the 12 people killed in the attack. CALIFORNIA SEES SURGE IN AMMO SALES AHEAD OF NEW GUN REGULATIONS This pattern of attacks at gun-free zones isn’t limited to workplace shootings: 98 percent  of all mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1950 have occurred in places where the average citizen was banned from possessing guns.\ Banks, churches, sports stadiums, and many members of Congress are protected with firearms. Yet children inside the classroom are too frequently left vulnerable. To combat this, Rep. Thomas Massie, co-author of this op-ed, introduced H.R. 3200 last week, a bill that repeals the Gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA) of 1990. Twenty states, to varying degrees, allow teachers to carry—some of these states have had their laws in place for decades. The Safe Students Act would make it easier for state and local governments to unambiguously set their own firearm policies by eliminating the one-size-fits-all federal ban on guns in school zones. Banks, churches, sports stadiums, and many members of Congress are protected with firearms. Yet children inside the classroom are too frequently left vulnerable. Safe Students Act cosponsors currently include Representatives Justin Amash, R-Mich., Jody Hice, R-Ga., Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, James Comer, R-Ky., and Brian Babin, R-Texas. The Crime Prevention Research Center has released a new report examining every school shooting in the United States from 2000 through 2018. There were 306 documented cases of gunshots on school property, 48 of which were suicides. Not counting suicides, 193 people died and 267 were injured in these incidents. Four cases were instances of accidental gunshots by police officers. The rate of school shootings and the number of people killed by them has increased significantly since 2000. The annual death rate from 2009-2018 was twice that of 2001-2008 (even when one excludes suicides). This increase has occurred exclusively among schools that don’t allow concealed carry for teachers and staff. Indeed, with the exception of suicides or gang violence outside of school hours, no school that allows teachers to carry has experienced a death or injury from a shooting. Utah, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and parts of Oregon allowed all permitted teachers and staff to carry without any additional training requirements. Other states left it to the discretion of local superintendents or school boards. As of December 2018, teachers carried handguns in more than 30 percent of Texas school districts. And in September 2018, Ohio teachers were carrying in over 200 school districts. According to Clark Aposhian, senior member of Utah’s Concealed Firearm Review Board, roughly 5 percent of Utah teachers carry permitted, concealed handguns at school. Aposhian estimates that support staff — janitors, librarians, secretaries, cafeteria staff, etc. — carry at a higher rate, between 10 and 12 percent. Seventeen million Americans have concealed handgun permits. This is 8.5 percent of the adult population when one excludes permit-unfriendly California and New York. Nobody knows whether the person next to them might have a gun. Carrying in a school isn’t really any different from carrying in a grocery store, a movie theater, or a restaurant. The rate of school shootings and the number of people killed by them has increased significantly since 2000. Yet no school that allows teachers to carry has experienced a death or injury from a shooting. No student has ever taken a teacher’s gun. In fact, the only accidental discharge occurred outside of school hours and resulted in minor injuries for the teacher in possession of the handgun. Moreover, school insurance premiums haven’t risen as a result of allowing teachers to carry. “From what I’ve seen in Utah, [school insurance] rates have not gone up because of guns being allowed,” says Curt Oda, former president of the Utah Association of Independent Insurance Agents. Nor has a survey of six other states shown any increase in insurance costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Police are essential, but they can't be everywhere at once.  Even if an officer is stationed at a school, shooters are most likely to target him first. We’ve seen this time and again at malls, nightclubs, and schools. By contrast, concealed carry means would-be shooters won't know who is armed. Even if they take an officer by surprise, they must consider they are revealing their position to someone else who has the potential to stop them. Gun control groups paint a frightening picture of what might go wrong if teachers carry concealed firearms, but that fear loses credibility in light of the overwhelming success of concealed carry at schools. Armed teachers deter attackers. It is past time for us to pass common sense gun laws that work. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JOHN LOTT John R.

Lenny Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was killed in the December 14, 2012 shooting, along with 19 classmates and six adults, has been fighting back against conspiracy theorists who claimed that the shooting was a hoax. His victory over the publishers of the book, Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, is the latest victory against the conspiracy. Why Conspiracy Theorists Claim It Was A Hoax The publishers of the book in question are not alone in suggesting that the Sandy Hook school shooting never happened. Almost as soon as images and video of the aftermath of the shooting were hitting the media, the claim was being made by people such as right-wing radio host Alex Jones and multiple others that the shooting was a hoax. But why? The claim is that the shooting was staged in order to produce a so-called ""false flag"" attack that would stir up anti-gun sentiment and lay the groundwork for stricter gun laws, The Vancouver Sun reports. Some even go so far as to say that the government hired so-called ""crisis actors"" to pretend to be grief-stricken parents or townsfolk for the TV cameras.""Nobody Died at Sandy Hook"" publisher apologizes to dad of murdered boy https://t.co/WdSLHIxNxY pic.twitter.com/hE25CEHL88— CBS News (@CBSNews) June 18, 2019Fighting Back ""Nobody Died at Sandy Hook"" publisher apologizes to dad of murdered boy https://t.co/WdSLHIxNxY pic.twitter.com/hE25CEHL88 The fact that some are insisting that their children didn't die in a mass shooting, and that it was all a hoax intended to force through new gun laws, has not sat well with the parents of the murdered children — Lenny Pozner in particular. Pozner and others have fought back against those claims, largely through defamation lawsuits, some of which they've won. The victory over James Fetzer and Mike Palacek, authors of the book mentioned at the beginning of this article, is the latest. On Monday, a Wisconsin judge ruled that Pozner had been defamed by the authors of the book, and ordered that they will be liable for damages, as yet to be determined. The trial to determine how much the authors owe will be held in October, according to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency. The book has been pulled from store shelves. Some of the more alarming claims in the book were that Noah's death certificate was faked; that Noah's parents were portrayed by crisis actors; and that Noah never existed. Pozner, meanwhile, continues his campaign against Sandy Hook deniers. In a separate case, he's suing the publishers of the book, and he's a party to at least seven other cases related to Sandy Hook conspiracy theories as well.",2019-06-18 11:55:26,Father Of Child Killed In Newtown Shooting Win Defamation Suit Against Authors Who Claimed It Never Happened,,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com
374,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/18/shanahan-withdraws-addresses-violent-incidents/,"Trending: By Aaron C. Davis and Shawn Boburg | Washington Post WASHINGTON – In the months that he has served as President Donald Trump’s acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan has worked to keep domestic violence incidents within his family private. His wife was arrested after punching him in the face, and his son was arrested after a separate incident in which he hit his mother with a baseball bat. Public disclosure of the nearly decade-old episodes would re-traumatize his young adult children, Shanahan said. On Tuesday, Trump announced in a tweet that Shanahan would not be going through with the nomination process, which had been delayed by an unusually lengthy FBI background check, “so that he can devote more time to his family.” Shanahan spoke publicly about the incidents in interviews with The Washington Post on Monday and Tuesday. “Bad things can happen to good families . . . and this is a tragedy, really,” Shanahan said. Dredging up the episode publicly, he said, “will ruin my son’s life.” In November 2011, Shanahan rushed to defend his then 17-year-old son, William Shanahan, in the days after the teenager brutally beat his mother. The attack had left Shanahan’s ex-wife unconscious in a pool of blood, her skull fractured and with internal injuries that required surgery, according to court and police records. Two weeks later, Shanahan sent his ex-wife’s brother a memo arguing that his son had acted in self-defense. “Use of a baseball bat in self-defense will likely be viewed as an imbalance of force,” Shanahan wrote. “However, Will’s mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident.” Details of the incidents have started to emerge in media reports about his nomination, including a USA Today report Tuesday about the punching incident in 2010. In an hour-long interview Monday night at his apartment in Virginia, Shanahan, who has been responding to questions from The Washington Post about the incidents since January, said he wrote the memo in the hours after his son’s attack, before he knew the full extent of his ex-wife’s injuries. He said it was to prepare for his son’s initial court appearance and that he never intended for anyone other than his son’s attorneys to read it. “That document literally was, I sat down with [my son] right away, and being an engineer at an aerospace company, you write down what are all of the mitigating reasons something could have happened. You know, just what’s the list of things that could have happened?” As he later wrote in the divorce case, Shanahan said Monday that he does not believe there can be any justification for an assault with a baseball bat, but he went further in the interview, saying he now regrets writing the passage. “Quite frankly it’s difficult to relive that moment and the passage was difficult for me to read. I was wrong to write those three sentences,” Shanahan said. “I have never believed Will’s attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified. I don’t believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat.” Kimberley Shanahan, who has since changed her name to Kimberley Jordinson, has not responded to repeated efforts by reporters to contact her via email, text, phone and social media since January seeking comment about the incidents. Patrick Shanahan’s response when his family was split by acts of domestic violence – including steps he took to manage his son’s surrender to police and to try to keep him out of jail – is detailed in court filings that have not been previously reported. Court records also contain an earlier episode in which both Shanahan and his wife alleged they were assaulted by one other and she was arrested. The Defense Department has long struggled with its own responses to domestic violence, and it has faced a fresh wave of criticism since shortly after Shanahan became deputy secretary of defense in July 2017. In November of that year, an airman who had been court-martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson killed 26 people and wounded 22 others in a Texas church. A Defense Department investigation later faulted the Air Force for repeatedly failing to submit the serviceman’s fingerprints to a civilian database, which it said should have prevented him from purchasing the firearms used in the mass shooting. Last month, the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General admonished the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, saying they failed for decades to consistently follow policies requiring military police to thoroughly process crime scenes and to interview witnesses following allegations of nonsexual domestic abuse. The watchdog said that in 180 of 219 cases it reviewed, the branches failed to submit criminal histories and fingerprints of offending servicemen to civilian authorities. Shanahan said his personal experience with domestic violence has taught him there are no simple policy prescriptions. He said domestic violence rates in the military will only improve if the services can change the way they talk about the stresses of serving in the armed forces in a more honest and natural way. “There’s not one size that fits all, I mean, it’s a very complicated issue,” he said. “It’s not as simple as take this training class or apply these resources, or, you know, look for these kinds of symptoms. I mean, it’s not that simple. There are all sorts of dimensions, whether it’s mental health, or addiction, or stress in the home. It’s a very toxic concoction. “The thing that’s probably, like a lot of other issues . . . is having a buddy system of people who really care about you and can intervene. What I’ve learned is extremely important.” Turbulence at home Patrick Shanahan, 56, climbed the ranks at Boeing over more than two decades, becoming vice president and general manager of the corporation’s commercial airplane program in 2008. An exacting, hard-charging executive who worked grueling hours, he earned the sobriquet “Mr. Fix It” for his ability to turn around sputtering projects worth billions of dollars, such as the aerospace giant’s delayed 787 Dreamliner program. By 2010, Shanahan was earning more than $935,000 annually in salary and bonuses, court records show. But there was turbulence in Shanahan’s personal life with his wife of 24 years. Shanahan and two of his children interviewed by The Post said Kimberley was growing more erratic. One Thanksgiving, she threw the entire dinner on the floor, saying the family did not appreciate her efforts, they said. A birthday cake his daughter baked for Patrick Shanahan was similarly destroyed, they said. Things culminated with a physical dispute in August 2010. According to Patrick Shanahan, the incident began when he was lying in bed, following an argument with Kimberley Shanahan about their oldest child. Shanahan said he had his eyes closed, trying to fall asleep and his wife came in the bedroom and punched him in the face, then more times in his torso. “I was seeing stars,” Shanahan said, but he didn’t react, saying he believes that only further enraged his wife. She then began throwing her husband’s clothes out of a window, according to police and court records, and tried to set them on fire, with a propane tank she couldn’t dislodge from a barbecue grill and later with burning paper towels. Another physical altercation ensued, with police records indicating Kimberley Shanahan swung at Patrick Shanahan. She called the police and claimed that he punched her in the stomach, an allegation he denies. When officers arrived, they found him with a bloody nose and scratches on his face, police records show. Authorities charged his wife with domestic violence. Shanahan later dropped the charges. Patrick Shanahan soon filed for divorce. The file would grow to more than 1,500 pages. Verbal dispute turns violent Kimberley Shanahan won custody of the children and moved to Florida. Patrick Shanahan remained in Seattle, but the couple’s eldest daughter would soon rejoin him to attend college. Shortly after midnight on Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2011, Kimberley Shanahan and William got into “a verbal dispute” over her suspicion that the 17-year-old was in a romantic relationship with a 36-year-old woman, according to a police report. According to police, just after 1:30 a.m., William “shoved and pinned his mother against a bathroom wall” before grabbing a $400 Nike composite baseball bat “to swing at her head,” striking her multiple times. “I attempted to run away from Will, but as I reached the laundry room, he struck me with the bat in the back of my head,” Kimberley Shanahan wrote in a court filing in the divorce case. “The last thing I remember from before I lost consciousness is the impact of the bat, and blood gushing everywhere.” William, Sarasota police wrote, struck several blows to his mother’s head and torso and left her “to lie in a pool of blood” and then “unplugged the landline phone cord depriving the victim and [the younger brother] the use of 911 to render aid.” As William fled the home, situated in an exclusive, barrier-island development called Bird Key just outside Sarasota, he “tossed a bottle of rubbing alcohol” to his younger brother and told him “you clean her up,” according to the police report. The younger brother called 911 from a neighbor’s phone, according to police records. Within hours, William contacted his father who immediately booked a predawn flight to Florida, according to court records and documents provided by the Pentagon. Kimberley Shanahan was hospitalized early that morning and later required surgery, she wrote in a divorce filing. Among her injuries were a fractured skull and elbow, according to the police report. While she was in the hospital, authorities began to search for William, according to records released to The Post by Sarasota police. Police distributed a photo of Shanahan to patrol cars on Bird Key. They tried to track William’s cellphone, but it appeared to be turned off, police wrote. They canvassed a local park and bridges to the mainland. They searched a local yacht club. But there was no trace of him, according to records. Patrick Shanahan landed in Florida just before 5 p.m. on Wednesday. He arranged to stay with William in a hotel. “Mr. Shanahan’s response when he learned of the assault was to book Will a hotel room,” Kimberley Shanahan wrote. Shanahan said it’s a bit of a blur. “It was a hard time to see your son, hopefully you’ll never be in that spot some day,” he said. “I wasn’t hiding. We got a hotel and talked to the attorney and we just camped out.” Shanahan did not visit the hospital where his ex-wife was taken, his ex-wife later wrote in a divorce filing. Instead, over four days that included Thanksgiving, Shanahan worked to assemble a defense team and to enlist family members and friends to attend an initial hearing to try to persuade a judge to let his son stay out of jail while he fought the charges. Derek Byrd, head of a well-known Sarasota defense firm hired by Patrick Shanahan to represent his son in the criminal case, said in an interview that the elder Shanahan acted appropriately by not contacting police until his son could consult a defense attorney, a process that was delayed by the Thanksgiving holiday. Byrd also said that Patrick Shanahan was not aware that police were searching for his son in the days after the attack. “I don’t think Pat handled that time frame inappropriately,” Byrd said in an interview. “I think he was just doing what a reasonable dad should probably do. I’m sure the timeline looks bad on paper, but he didn’t do anything that I consider out of the ordinary, and he wasn’t hiding Will.” Byrd said Patrick Shanahan first contacted his firm within a day of arriving in Florida, either Wednesday night or Thursday, which was Thanksgiving. He said a lawyer from the firm could not meet with the Shanahans until Friday morning, after the holiday. Later on Friday, another attorney from the firm contacted the detective handling the case, Det. Kenneth Halpin. According to the detective’s report, the attorney said he would arrange for the younger Shanahan to turn himself in – after two more days, on Sunday evening, Nov. 27. “Detective Halpin trusted us to do that,” Byrd told The Post. “He said, ‘Fine.’ ” Halpin told The Post that he could not recall the conversation but would have likely cast it differently: “If someone calls and says they’re going to turn in a suspect on a Sunday night and he’s already lawyered up with someone who has a reputation like Byrd, for being on TV, what can you do? You can’t force an attorney to turn in his client,” Halpin said, adding that: “I’m sure I would have also told him that there’s paper out for him, so they’re still going to snatch him up, if he’s found.” That Sunday night, Patrick Shanahan drove William to a police station to surrender, according to police records and a timeline of events prepared by the Pentagon. His mother attended his court appearance the next morning. “My neighbor took me to the court hearing and both of us were shocked to see Pat in the courtroom,” she wrote in the divorce, saying she had believed until then that he had been in Seattle. “He has dreams. He has a future.” Patrick Shanahan and Byrd came to the hearing prepared to plead for the younger Shanahan to remain out of custody, citing his baseball career at an exclusive youth sports academy and prep school attended by sons and daughters of major league athletes. “He’s a college baseball prospect. He has dreams. He has a future. His father is an executive of Boeing,” Byrd said, according to an audio recording that the court released to The Post. “If he has to sit in jail for 21 days, not only is that going to traumatize him, he’s not going to finish the semester, probably get kicked off the baseball team . . . everything is going to be over for him.” Patrick Shanahan also vouched for his son. “He doesn’t believe in violence,” he told the judge, “I’ve never seen him act aggressively toward his brother or any other family members, so it’s a shock to me, what has happened.” The judge declined to release William Shanahan, calling pictures of the crime scene “horrendous.” He was initially charged with two felonies, aggravated battery and tampering with a victim, and faced up to 15 years in prison. In the divorce filing is the four-page memo Patrick Shanahan wrote at the time. It lists “mitigating circumstances” that should be considered in evaluating the alleged assault. A Pentagon spokesman provided a copy of the email containing the memo retained by Shanahan’s brother-in-law, showing it had been sent on Dec. 8, 2011, two weeks after the attack, and 10 days after Patrick Shanahan was present at the court hearing with his injured ex-wife. First, Patrick Shanahan wrote, his 17-year-old son had “acted in self-defense.” “She fueled the situation by berating him repeatedly in his room in a manner that escalated emotionally and physically,” he wrote. The memo continues, alleging a history of substance abuse, emotional abuse and violent tendencies by Kimberley Shanahan. “Over the last 7+ years I have worked as much as possible, partially out of a desire to avoid inevitable conflicts with Kim,” Shanahan wrote. It casts his ex-wife as the instigator in conflicts with him and their children. “It appears that when I was not around to yell at, she started becoming intensely focused on berating, terrorizing and beat them down emotionally.” Kimberley Shanahan disputed those characterizations. “I have always been a very loving and dedicated mom,” she wrote in a court filing responding to the memo, “and I have never emotionally abused any of my children for any period of time.” Kevin Cameron, Kimberley Shanahan’s brother, said he was not bothered by Patrick Shanahan’s memo because he believed Shanahan wrote it before he had all of the facts about the assault. “If anything, I believe Pat fully understands and is better equipped to deal with domestic violence than most people,” Cameron wrote in a letter to The Post. “He has seen it. He has lived it. He understands that domestic violence is real and prevalent. He understands that it can impact anyone of any age, gender, race and socioeconomic status.” Shanahan called a “hindrance” to probe Kris Roberts, a police officer who assisted in the search for William Shanahan, recalled that after the arrest, his father was a “hindrance” in a follow-up matter, as police investigated whether there had been an inappropriate relationship between the adult woman and William. Under Florida law, William was too young at the time to have had a consenting sexual relationship with the woman. Roberts, a retired detective with the Longboat Key Police Department, said the father, whom she could not remember by name, would not turn over his son’s cellphone. After the surrender to police, “his father would not talk to me; he wasn’t helping,” Roberts said. “I remember he had a West Coast address, Seattle maybe, and when he left, the son’s cellphone was just gone.” Roberts said she believes Patrick Shanahan took his son’s cellphone back to Seattle with him. Roberts said that without the cooperation of the father, the investigation fell apart. “We only had one love letter between them, but it didn’t speak to anything sexual,” Roberts said. The adult woman “soon lawyered up, too, and we moved on.” Byrd, the attorney for William Shanahan; an attorney who represents Patrick Shanahan in Seattle; and a Shanahan spokesman said they were not aware of a formal request for the cellphone. Prosecutors would go on to charge William as an adult with one felony: aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. He pleaded down to a third-degree felony, and in 2012, a state prosecutor agreed to a “withhold of adjudication,” curtailing the length of the sentence and probation. The post-sentencing maneuver is not recognized outside of Florida and William’s record could not be sealed or expunged in the state because it involved a violent domestic assault. Related Articles

William was ordered to spend 18 months at a Florida Sheriff’s Youth Ranch and sentenced to four years’ probation. Both penalties were later reduced. The following year, in 2013, William enrolled at the University of Washington, according to his LinkedIn page. His father had recently joined the university’s board of regents. The family had other ties to the school. Patrick’s father, Michael, had served as police chief for the university for more than two decades. William graduated last June with a degree in political science, a university spokesman said. Kimberley Shanahan lost custody of the couple’s youngest child in 2014, when a judge wrote that she had “engaged in abusive use of conflict that is seriously detrimental” to the child. According to multiple accounts, she is now estranged from all three of her children. At his last confirmation hearing, to become deputy secretary of defense in June 2017, all three children were sitting behind Patrick Shanahan. None of the senators asked him about domestic violence.

But many of the parents have been pushing back with defamation lawsuits and one parent can now claim a big win. Lenny Pozner, whose 6-year-old son, Noah, was killed at Sandy Hook, has won his lawsuit against the publisher and authors of the book, “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.” The book, written by James Fetzer and Mike Palacek and published by Moon Rock Books, made several claims against Pozner that he argued were false. It asserted that Noah’s death certificate was fake, that Pozner’s son never existed and that the Sandy Hook parents were crisis actors. These are similar claims that have been pushed by conspiracy theorists and personalities like Jones. Pozner’s win was handed down by a Wisconsin judge, who agreed that the publisher and authors had actively defamed Pozner and many of the other families. While the authors have mostly remained silent, the publisher has reportedly apologized to Pozner. “My face-to-face interactions with Mr. Pozner have led me to believe that Mr. Pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son,” Moon Rock Books’ principal officer Dave Gahary said. “I extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the Pozner family.” Moon Rock Books also announced it would no longer be selling the book. Pozner still has plenty of legal battles ahead of him. He has been at the front of several lawsuits by Sandy Hook parents in states like Connecticut, Florida, Texas and Wisconsin. A second trial in the Moon Rock Books lawsuit has been scheduled for October to determine damages.

377,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/gunman-dallas-courthouse-photo.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Advertisement Supported by “Was I in the right place at the wrong time, or was I in the wrong place at the right time?” the photojournalist, Tom Fox of The Dallas Morning News, said after a man opened fire at a federal courthouse. By Niraj Chokshi It wasn’t until he took the photograph on Monday morning that Tom Fox, a longtime photojournalist, realized what he was looking at: A man wearing tactical gear and carrying a military-style rifle was standing outside a federal courthouse in Dallas, looking his way. Moments earlier, Mr. Fox, who works for The Dallas Morning News, had heard what he thought was a backfiring car and later determined to be rounds fired. Then, around 8:37 a.m., he photographed a security guard and a man in a suit as they ran past him. Mr. Fox was still piecing together what was happening when he looked through the 70-200mm lens of his camera and photographed the man with a rifle, capturing a jarring, detailed close-up of a gunman in the middle of an attack. The image raced across social media, with many praising the photographer for his quick reaction. “I’m seeing this guy reaching for something and then he started to get up and look my way and I was like, ‘O.K., I’ve been spotted, so get up and run,’” Mr. Fox said in an interview on Tuesday, a day after describing his ordeal to a columnist at his newspaper. The gunman was eventually shot dead by the authorities, and no one else was seriously injured. Federal officials, who identified the assailant as a 22-year-old Army veteran, said they were still trying to determine a motive for the attack, according to The Associated Press. Having just returned from a vacation, Mr. Fox, 51, had been hoping for a much less eventful morning. He was sent to the Earle Cabell Federal Building to get an updated photograph of a defendant in a charter school fraud case who was expected to arrive in court about 9 a.m. Mr. Fox had spent the earlier part of the morning waiting for his subject, engaging in brief exchanges with a courthouse security guard and watching a homeless man dance on a street pole. Then he heard the shots. After spotting the gunman, Mr. Fox started running from the courthouse entrance, looking for cover. There were no cars — street parking is prohibited outside the courthouse — so he rushed behind one of the columns lining the building, making himself as small as possible. “I thought if he saw me, he’d shoot me. I was that close,” Mr. Fox said. “It’s two feet between the sidewalk and where I’m standing.” He heard more rounds being fired and glass shattering. The gunman, he later learned, had turned around and fired back into the building. Mr. Fox, unsure what was happening, kept still next to the column, facing the parking lot across the street and watching for the gunman. Soon, something else entered his field of vision: several law enforcement officers. Mr. Fox told them the gunman had not passed him and, figuring it was safe to move, he followed the officers to the parking lot across the street. There, he joined two civilians hiding between cars. Once it was clear that the officers had taken the suspect down, Mr. Fox got up to take photos and then contact his editor. The editor asked for a preliminary photograph, so Mr. Fox took one with his iPhone, taking care to obscure the gunman’s face. Eventually, he and other witnesses were led to a nearby F.B.I. command post, where they were interviewed about what they had seen. Mr. Fox sat on the same wall that a colleague had used as cover while photographing a mass shooting that unfolded at nearby El Centro College nearly three years ago. Afterward, Mr. Fox was allowed to retrieve his car and leave. He returned to his office, where he delivered a disk containing photographs from the scene, then got to work editing a firsthand video he had taken amid the chaos. “Everybody just jumped right in,” he said. Mr. Fox has worked for The Dallas Morning News for nearly three decades and won the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Hurricane Katrina, but he said he had never experienced a shooting so close. According to The Associated Press, the gunman was carrying more than 150 rounds of ammunition. Mr. Fox said he was taking Tuesday off to follow up with journalists who had requested interviews and to decompress. But he said there remains a lot to process. “I woke up this morning and I was thinking, was I in the right place at the wrong time, or was I in the wrong place at the right time?” he said.

378,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/california-police-release-man-suspected-of-threatening-to-shoot-a-synagogue,"US law enforcement officials are facing scrutiny over whether they are minimizing the threat posed by white supremacist terrorists Last modified on Wed 19 Jun 2019 16.13 BST California police arrested a man suspected of making online threats to shoot up a Jewish temple, saying he had a fascination with Adolf Hitler and planned to emulate mass shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh and San Diego. Ross Farca, a 23-year-old from Concord, California, was charged with making criminal threats, possessing an illegal assault rifle and manufacturing an assault rifle, all felonies. Then, over the weekend, police said, Farca was freed on a $125,000 bond.  The California case is likely to renew questions about whether US law enforcement officials are underestimating the threat posed by white supremacist terrorists. In May, a judge’s order to release Christopher Hasson, a Coast Guard lieutenant that prosecutors said had been plotting a neo-Nazi domestic terror attack, prompted condemnation from members of Congress, some of whom had been mentioned on what prosecutors described as a hitlist of journalists and Democratic politicians. In 2017, a ProPublica investigation found, police in Florida released a suspected member of the Atomwaffen Division, a violent neo-Nazi group that has conducted weapons trainings and openly discussed starting a race war, even after finding explosives in his garage. The man, Brandon Russell, had told law enforcement officials that he was using the explosives to power model rockets. Hours after he was released, ProPublica reported, Russell acquired two rifles, loaded body armor and 1,000 rounds of ammunition into his car, and drove off. Sheriff’s deputies who later stopped the car were “convinced that we had just stopped a mass shooting”, one deputy later told ProPublica. The California case involving Ross Farca, 23, comes in the wake of a series of high-profile terrorist attacks targeting worshippers in Jewish synagogues in the United States and at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Police have been tight-lipped about the case, announcing on Friday that Farca was arrested on 10 June and held in the Contra Costa county jail. During a search of Farca’s house in California, police had recovered uncovered empty high-capacity magazines, camouflage clothing, a sword and Nazi literature. Farca pleaded not guilty to all charges at an arraignment last week, according to the East Bay Times. The newspaper and other media said Farca had posted online to the video game platform Steam that he wanted to mimic the gunman in the San Diego incident, “except with a Nazi uniform on”, and aimed for a body count of “at least 30”, using antisemitic slurs throughout. In the San Diego incident in April, a gunman walked into the Chabad of Poway crowded with sabbath worshippers, and opened fire with an assault-style rifle, killing one woman and wounding three people. The San Diego shooting followed two major white supremacist attacks: the Christchurch attacks in March, which left 50 people dead, and an attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, last October, which killed 11 people. Farca also allegedly talked about how it would be cool to livestream the massacre while playing “Nazi music”, the East Bay Times reported. The New Zealand mosque shooter livestreamed himself preparing for the attack and then shooting men, women and children. The footage was widely shared across social media platforms.

379,https://www.theroot.com/forgiveness-is-a-white-privilege-1835625584,"Then Peter came to Jesus and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.” Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. But as [the servant] was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made. The servant fell down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’ So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you’ And he would not forgive the debt, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done. Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?’ And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. “So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.” —Matthew 18: 21-35 Aside from being a great storyteller, activist, and winemaker, Yeshua ben Yousef was also one of the greatest teachers of his time. But if he were alive today, Jesus the Christ would be vilified by Christian conservatives and the religious right for teaching anti-American, socialist principles such as free healthcare, feeding the hungry, debt forgiveness, and—worst of all—doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. I’m pretty sure Jesus shared this story with his disciples to illustrate the virtue of forgiveness, the sin of hypocrisy and the importance of following the golden rule. But this now-heretical parable is also a perfect illustration of the miles-wide chasm between being a white child and being a black child in America. And if that two-millennium-old Ted Talk by a community organizer isn’t enough, please turn your Bibles to the book of America, Chapter 3, Verse 16. This is an excerpt from the scripture of white conservatives. According to the religious dogma of Fox News, right-wing talk radio and people who believe all lives matter, the blood of black children is a direct result of their own actions. Therefore, according to the conservative Golden Rule of taking responsibility for one’s actions, the bullet-riddled corpses of dead black babies is the result of the all-American principle of reaping what you sow. All of the great white prophets clearly explained this to us in their sermons: “Trayvon Martin would be a alive today if he didn’t have a street attitude. And that’s the bottom line.” — Former NYPD detective Harry Houck. “Racist police brutality has to be punished. But respect has to be paid..” — David Brooks on the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. “Act like a thug and you’ll be treated like one.” — Lt. Javier Ortiz, president of Miami chapter of Fraternal Order of Police, on death of Tamir Rice. See? It’s their fault. If only black people would accept personal responsibility for their actions and teach their children how to behave better,  then we wouldn’t have all this controversy. Geraldo Rivera even explained that the children killed by police brutality were actually committing “urban suicide” and proposed that—instead of protesting by wearing an “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt—Lebron James could help solve the problem by wearing a “Raise Your Children” tee. Yes, he actually said that. On television. They believe this, too. After all, the religion of right can see God’s grace in America’s spacious skies, her purple mountains’ majesty and her liberty and justice for all. This is a country that gives everyone what they deserve, and if you fall short, then it must be your fault. Unless you are white. If you are white, then America is the land of “second chances”—especially if you are a white child. Simply by being born with white skin, this sweet land of liberty a bequeaths you an endless supply of mulligans. Take, for instance, the case of Kyle Kashuv, who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman-Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., became a conservative, pro-gun advocate and was subsequently accepted to Harvard University. The Root’s Dara Sharif writes: On Monday, Kashuv shared his astonishment that Harvard had rescinded his admission because of his use of racial slurs in texts he sent two years ago, HuffPost reports. The texts included repeated use of the word “nigger,” including the uhm, observation: “like im really good at typing nigger ok like practice uhhhhhh makes perfect son??!!” HuffPost reported last month on the existence of the racist messages, for which Kashuv, now 18, apologized, saying: “We were 16-year-olds making idiotic comments, using callous and inflammatory language in an effort to be as extreme and shocking as possible.” But in a case where actions seem to have had consequences, Harvard apparently decided to nix Kashuv’s acceptance into the Class of 2023. The news immediately riled up the entire class of conservative punditry. The New York Times’ Caucasian apologist editorial staff rang the alarm and dispatched columnist David Brooks to explain why this innocent little sayer-of-racist-shit should be excused from his actions. “In a sin-drenched world it’s precisely through the sins and the ensuing repentance that moral formation happens,” Brooks wrote. “That’s why we try not to judge people by what they did in their worst moment, but rather by how they respond to their worst moment.” Brooks adds, with all seriousness, that it’s “hard to know if Kashuv has learned from his repulsive comments” but explained that “wisdom comes through a renovation of the heart” and the “awful grace of God.” But the coup de grace of Brooks’ article was when this bastion of conservative principles threw everything he ever wrote into a dumpster, set it on fire and explained that Kashuv shouldn’t be beholden to the commandments of conservatism simply because the world is forgiving of 16-year-olds, because they “haven’t disgraced themselves enough to have earned maturity.” I’m sure 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin or 18-year-old Michael Brown would have agreed with you. If only someone had forgiven them. But you know how it is when you make a mistake, David: “Respect must be paid.” Ben Shapiro, the right-wing troll who insists that he can’t be a white supremacist because he’s Jewish, argued that Harvard had set an impossible standard because it is virtually impossible to not say the n-word if you’re a white kid in America. In an article for the Daily Wire, Shapiro wrote that Kashuv “didn’t commit a crime; he didn’t espouse his gross views publicly,” adding that the teen “underwent a life-changing trauma.” Shapiro said that our colleges are “irrevocably broken,” because—again, this is actually his argument—if calling black athletes “niggerjocks” is frowned upon by private institutions, then “no one will survive.” This is a parable of America. It illustrates the double standard that excuses white kids from their shenanigans while black four-year-olds get guns in their faces for walking out of dollar stores with dolls. This is why people excuse the actions of Covington Catholic MAGAts but understand why cops detain 12-year-olds playing in the park at gunpoint. It’s why media outlets referred to mass murderer Adam Lanza as “bright and troubled” and called Laquan McDonald “wild” and “dangerous.” It’s why accused murderer Kenneth Gleason was called a “clean-cut American kid;” Parkland shooter Nickolas Cruz was called a “broken child” and Mark Anthony Conditt was called a “troubled person motivated by frustrations. Meanwhile, police point guns at three-year-old black toddlers, handcuff innocent, black 10-year-olds and drag black high school girls down the hall. But poor Kyle. After searching the Republican scriptures, it is obvious to me that Kashuv’s parents didn’t raise him right. I understand that the white Bible says “act like a racist, get treated like one,” but Kyle clearly didn’t deserve this. Where’s his seventy times seven? Doesn’t he get 489 more chances to be racist? Everyone knows that people get less racist as they grow older, right? If only his father had worn a “Don’t Say Nigger” t-shirt. But you know what the bible says: Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.* *Scripture does not apply to Brock Turner, sufferers of “affluenza,” parents who scam their kids’ way into elite colleges, Carolyn Bryant-Donham, ex-slave owners, people who watch Fox News, reparations advocates, presidents and white people under the age of 18. Amen. It doesn’t help that some of us internalize that shit and are oh so quick to forgive a motherfucker (especially a racist white one who did something heinous that blew up in public.) Just for the record, should anything happen to me at the hands of the police, someone in power, anyone generally white, let it be known that you are not to forgive the motherfucker in my name. I want you to hold a goddamn grudge and make the motherfucker pay in every way possible. This forgiving Negro thing needs to die like yesteryear.",2019-06-18 17:30:00,Forgiveness Is a White Privilege,,368082,http://theroot.com/

        Nidhi Prakash Reporting From Orlando, Florida Reporting From Orlando, Florida Posted on June 18, 2019, at 11:34 p.m. ET An anti-Trump demonstrator holds up a placard and films a group of Trump supporters near the Amway Center on June 18 in Orlando. ORLANDO — President Donald Trump officially launched his reelection campaign on Tuesday night in Orlando, while LGBT and Latinx protesters held a counter-rally just blocks away. Several protesters, gathered outside a gay bar in downtown Orlando, said it felt like a “slap in the face” that Trump chose to hold his first official campaign event in the city less than a week after the three-year anniversary of the Pulse massacre in which 49 LGBT (and mostly Latinx) people were killed at a gay night club. Trump did not acknowledge the mass shooting, which happened blocks away in downtown Orlando, during his rally. “We just had our anniversary, we just had a memorial mourning the fact that we lost all those lives. He barely even acknowledged the fact that we lost those 49 lives,” said Rocky Rivera. “It wracked the country, it wracked the globe. We’ve been thinking about it ever since … We’ve been scared, and ironically the people we’re scared of support him.” “It feels a bit like he’s insulting us” by holding his reelection launch in Orlando right after the Pulse anniversary, said Megan Cepell, 45. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, weeks after the Pulse attack, Trump, referring to the shooting, said as president, he would “do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.” Last year, during a meeting about gun issues at the White House, he said if “one person” at the Pulse nightclub had been carrying a gun, the shooting “wouldn’t have happened, or certainly not to the extent it did.” Orange County, which includes Orlando, and neighboring Osceola County voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and again for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Florida is an important swing state for Trump in 2020, after he won it in 2016. Republicans gained a Senate seat and held onto the governorship in Florida during the midterms last year, but the margins were slim, and both the Senate and the governor’s races went to recounts at the last minute. Hours before the rally, the city’s largest newspaper, the Orlando Sentinel, published an editorial backing “Not Donald Trump” for president in 2020. “Orlando in particular voted very heavily to make sure he wasn’t the president, so I don’t know why he chose to come here,” said Jeff Lettman, 33, who carried a sign referencing the Pulse massacre. Right next to the protest at the bar, a group of students from the University of Central Florida set up a March for Our Lives tent, the Orlando branch of the national gun control movement that grew out of the Parkland mass shooting in which 17 students and staff were killed at a Florida high school last year. “It’s a big deal to me,” said Bradley Thornton, 21, who grew up in Parkland before moving to Orlando for college, explaining that the group was there partly to protest the lack of gun control legislation federally but is also focusing on registering young voters and trying to push for state-level measures. Dana Ng, 57, said the main issue that brought her out to the protest is that the Trump administration is excluding transgender people from serving in the military. “He doesn’t respect us. All we’re asking for is equal rights. We’re being marginalized, we’re being discriminated against, he refuses to recognize that,” she said. Others at the protest said they’re concerned because the Trump administration has attempted to roll back protections for LGBT people in housing, employment, and education. “It’s his policies that have utterly put the queer and LGBTQ community at such a disadvantage, and he’s speaking right after the anniversary week of the Pulse shooting, how rude and inconsiderate is that. Just a slap in the face,” said Lenise Joseph, 27. “Florida is a battleground state, even though it’s been going red lately unfortunately. If Trump doesn’t win Florida, he doesn’t win nationwide,” said Jorge Jimenez, 30, a member of the Osceola Young Democrats. “Is there a trolling element in there? I don’t know, it might be. Orlando is a very progressive city, and we have a ridiculously diverse community here of Latinos and immigrants and LGBTQ people.”  Nidhi Prakash is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.

382,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/03/beto-orourke-stays-on-the-road,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By William Finnegan It’s not easy to get Beto O’Rourke to speak disparagingly about anyone. I’ve tried. He will condemn divisiveness, injustice, bad policies, inequality, and the corruption of American politics by corporate money. He believes our democracy is in danger. He’s running for the Democratic Party’s 2020 Presidential nomination, so these are not unexpected themes, and yet O’Rourke, who is tall and spare and deep-voiced, delivers them with unusual earnestness. He admits that the line that sparks the most reliable applause from his campaign crowds ends with the phrase “defeat Donald Trump.” But he doesn’t use it much. The big problems—climate change, health care, immigration, hyper-partisanship—didn’t originate with Trump, after all. O’Rourke regularly invokes a vision of national unity as the only way forward. “All of us have a seat at the table. All of us matter,” he says. “I want to show up for everybody.” What, you may wonder, does that mean? Texas got a preview of this vaulting ambition, this post-partisan show-up politics, when O’Rourke challenged Ted Cruz for his U.S. Senate seat in 2018. No Democrat had won statewide office in Texas since 1994. O’Rourke, who is a youthful forty-six, was an obscure three-term congressman from El Paso, a border town far removed from the halls of Texas power and wealth. He vowed to visit all two hundred and fifty-four counties in Texas, and he did, usually driving himself. “We went to places so red you could see them glowing from outer space,” he says. “Places that went ninety-seven per cent for Trump. Nobody had bothered to visit those people before. I learned so much. If you want to serve people, you gotta listen to them.” He live-streamed his travels on Facebook. He never hired a pollster or a political adviser. He refused donations from political-action committees and corporations. And the campaign gained traction. Volunteers started liking, sharing, leafletting, knocking on doors. The world beyond Texas took note after a video clip from a town hall in Houston drew forty-four million views in a couple of weeks. O’Rourke got an audience question about N.F.L. players taking a knee during the national anthem. Was that not disrespectful to members of the armed forces? “My short answer is no, I don’t think it’s disrespectful,” O’Rourke said. Not a practitioner of the sound bite, he then gave a four-minute response that soared through Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Edmund Pettus Bridge, through Taylor Branch’s book “Parting the Waters” and Rosa Parks. He placed the N.F.L. protests in that civil-rights tradition, an effort to call attention to violence against black youth today: “I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, anytime, anywhere, anyplace. Thank you very much for asking the question. I appreciate it.” For many Americans feeling battered by Trump, it was an introduction to an eloquent new politician. Small donations poured in; the campaign raised, in the end, nearly eighty million dollars, the largest amount in U.S. history for a Senate race. Ellen DeGeneres invited O’Rourke on her show, as did Stephen Colbert. Celebrities lined up to endorse him—LeBron James, Lin-Manuel Miranda. And he managed to give Cruz a scare on Election Day, losing by less than three percentage points and receiving more votes than any Democrat ever had in Texas. Turnout among young people was up five hundred per cent. The down-ballot effects were dramatic, as Democrats flipped two House seats, made gains in the state legislature, and swept the cities. Seventeen African-American women won judicial races in Harris County, where Houston is situated. The logic of following a near-miss Senate campaign with a run for the Presidency is not immediately obvious. There is, after all, another Senate seat, currently occupied by John Cornyn, up for grabs in Texas in 2020. But O’Rourke had serious momentum, as well as prominent fans. As he considered a run, Oprah Winfrey practically begged him on national television, “What’s it going to take for you to say yes?” In a straw poll conducted in December by MoveOn.org, O’Rourke came in first among potential Democratic candidates, beating out Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. He decided that this was the year. His campaign raised more than six million dollars on the first day, a record. His early rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire were raucous and packed. Since that initial rush, however, O’Rourke has steadily sunk into the morass of a race with nearly two dozen candidates. His standing in the polls has tumbled to sixth place. A media consensus seems to have formed that he is a handsome lightweight, an entitled child of privilege who has “failed up” all his life. While O’Rourke has been assailed for a variety of flaws—gaffes, inexperience, tactical errors—Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-seven-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has displaced him as the fresh young face. O’Rourke, unfazed, carries on with his upbeat, heavily scheduled, literally hard-driving run. By mid-May, according to his staff, he had driven more than six thousand miles, through fourteen states, held more than a hundred and fifty town-hall meetings, visited thirty-two college campuses, and answered more than a thousand questions. I asked O’Rourke if his emphasis on “everybody,” on a restored social comity, didn’t serve to mask some of the hard realities of a polarized country. We were driving—that is, he was driving—in a rented minivan from Sioux City, Iowa, to Storm Lake, seventy miles east. Two aides tended to their phones in the back seat. It was a foul night, cold and rainy, thick fog. O’Rourke did not dispute the premise: there wasn’t always a win-win to be had. A stark example occurred to me. In Austin, before an O’Rourke rally, I had encountered five white men milling in the shadows of a deserted bank. They were carrying American flags, Texas state flags, and AR-15 rifles. Their leader, a big guy with a big beard, said they were from a group called Open Carry Texas, and, yes, their weapons were loaded. They were “Second Amendment absolutists” on their way to O’Rourke’s rally. “Like most Democrats, he probably thinks the Constitution is a living, breathing document that needs to be updated,” the big man said. “I don’t agree.” In fact, O’Rourke supports universal background checks for gun sales and a ban on the sale of military-grade weapons. In the car, I pointed out that if he got his way on those laws, the Open Carry Texas dudes might not view it as a win-win. He laughed softly. “Right, yeah—they come see me in El Paso with their guns.” He sounded almost fond of them. Once, he said, they were protesting outside a meeting. “So we invited them in and gave them the microphone. Said, ‘Hey, ask whatever question you want, make your case in front of everybody. We all could stand to learn something. Let’s hear it.’ And we had an exchange, listened civilly, politely. And one gentleman, one of the protesters, came up to me afterward and gave me his card. Said he didn’t agree with me about anything but he was impressed we were there and we listened to him. If folks say, ‘You want to take our guns,’ I say, ‘No way. Keep that AR-15. Continue to use it responsibly. You know what you’re doing with it. I just don’t think we need to sell any more into our communities.’ ” So the gun guys had left the meeting liking O’Rourke better. But would that matter when he tried to pass background checks? Or, to pick a broader example, if O’Rourke threatened the interests of oil companies, as basically all the Democratic candidates do, would a polite exchange help solve matters? Our energy future is a bruising fight, a T. rex power struggle, with the public interest opposed to the private interest. An animal flashed in the fog, startlingly close. “Raccoon,” O’Rourke said. “Had a ring tail.” With the weather, we had slowed to a crawl, but O’Rourke was done for the day, so it didn’t matter—no me importa, as he would say, in the pocho border mix that he habitually speaks. Starting that morning, he had appeared at a tavern in Carroll, a diner in Denison, and a college in Sioux City, met hundreds of Iowans, answered dozens of questions, grinned for hundreds of selfies, thanked everybody for coming out, for welcoming a West Texan and teaching him so much about Iowa. At the college, he had dealt with an anti-immigrant heckler—this was, after all, the congressional district of Steve King, the most vehement xenophobe in the House of Representatives. For all his easygoing inclusiveness, O’Rourke sees this political moment in fairly apocalyptic terms. As he put it, “We are under a mother of a pressure test right now. Our structures, our institutions, the rule of law.” He frames his decision to run for President now, rather than later, as a matter of generational responsibility. He and his wife, Amy, have three school-age children, and he says that he fears their judgment. In a packed taquería in Manchester, New Hampshire, I heard him declare, “I don’t want my kids looking back at us forty years from now and saying, ‘Who were those pendejos?’ ” The O’Rourke children go to the same public schools their father did. In the interim, though, El Paso has changed. When O’Rourke’s father, Pat, went to high school in El Paso, you got punished for speaking Spanish. When Beto was in school there, he got forty-five minutes of Spanish instruction a day. Now his kids get half their classes en español. Born Robert Francis O’Rourke, Beto got his nickname as an infant—it’s the local shorthand for Roberto, Alberto, Humberto. His mother, Melissa, used to own a successful furniture store that her mother had started. She went to a Catholic school for girls that, she told me, had boarding students from the Mexican interior. Pat O’Rourke was an El Paso county commissioner and then the county judge. He was theatrical and gregarious, but Beto recoiled from the politician’s glad-handing life. He was quiet and bookish, and thrilled when he found faraway new friends in online discussion forums—an early version of the Internet. He joined a progressive hacker group called the Cult of the Dead Cow. He got into punk rock, particularly the D.C. hardcore scene—straight-edge, earnest punk, not the nihilistic New York seventies stuff. There was a small punk scene in El Paso, and O’Rourke dived into it. But he fled his home town as soon as he could, first to a prep school in Virginia, then to Columbia, where he co-captained the heavyweight crew team and majored in English lit. For a few years after graduation, he stayed on in New York, working as an art mover, a proofreader, a part-time nanny on the Upper West Side. He was living with friends in a funky industrial loft in Brooklyn, playing music, writing songs and stories. But he felt adrift. To the surprise of everybody in his world, he moved back to El Paso. He worked in his mother’s store, played bass in his old band, Foss, which toured the West—strictly D.I.Y.—and released a couple of records. The band folded, or morphed into other bands, and O’Rourke started, with a loan from his parents, a Web-design company, Stanton Street Technology Group, which prospered. He also started an online newspaper, Stanton Street, and found better-than-decent reporters and writers. El Paso had long suffered from a brain drain—ambitious kids didn’t stick around. O’Rourke talked friends from New York into moving there. One of the paper’s most popular columnists was Pat O’Rourke. Pat had retired from politics, after a failed attempt to switch from Democrat to Republican, and taken to riding around the country on a recumbent bicycle, writing drolly about his travels for his son’s paper. He died in 2001, after a car hit him in New Mexico. The paper folded in 2002. Beto’s relationship with his father had not been easy. “Pat wasn’t mean, but he pushed him hard,” Melissa recalled. He expected great things of his son, she said, and privately wished he had studied law or economics or business, not literature. Beto felt the weight of the loans his parents had taken out to pay for college. After Pat’s death, or even slightly before, Beto seemed to switch tracks. “He was never this outgoing, ‘Hi, buddy!’ sort of person,” his mother said. But he began to throw himself into El Paso civic life, volunteering on political campaigns and nonprofit boards. Melissa was struck by a gesture that her son made, his hand tapping his chest, while speaking in public—it was pure Pat. Beto and two friends ran for city council on a reform slate and won. O’Rourke had wandered into something that he was good at. His council district included both well-to-do neighborhoods on the heights, where he grew up, and old river-plain barrios by the border, where people lived far below the poverty line. He held weekly town halls. He became a passionate advocate for the city. El Paso is eighty per cent Latino, and it forms, with Ciudad Juárez, just across the Rio Grande, what amounts to a sprawling binational metropolis. The two sides compete—El Paso lost a lot of industrial jobs to Juárez after NAFTA took effect, in 1994—and also work together closely. Each year, more than seventy billion dollars in trade crosses the six bridges linking the cities, along with some fifty million people, many of them daily commuters. El Paso is a latter-day Ellis Island, O’Rourke likes to say, full of immigrants and, not coincidentally, one of the safest cities in America. O’Rourke met Amy Sanders on a blind date that he steered to the Kentucky Club, a venerable bar in Juárez where the margarita was allegedly invented. Sanders, who was born in Chicago and grew up near Santa Fe, had roots in El Paso. Her grandfather was a lawyer there and her father, William D. Sanders, had gone to El Paso High. William Sanders later became a big-time real-estate investor—the Times called him “the Warren Buffett of the real estate industry.” Amy Sanders went to Williams College, and afterward moved to Guatemala for a year to teach. When she and O’Rourke met, she was teaching at a private school in El Paso. He immediately started selling her on the city as the greatest possible place to settle down. They were married in 2005. Her father didn’t like him at first, O’Rourke told me, which was upsetting. William Sanders was El Paso’s most illustrious native son, and he had come back to town, late in his career, and started investing on both sides of the border, which boosters like O’Rourke took as a big vote of confidence in the city. O’Rourke worked to earn the older man’s respect, and eventually seemed to succeed, although Sanders continues to hold politicians in low regard. He is usually described in press reports as a billionaire; Forbes reckons his fortune at closer to five hundred million. “If I ask him how it’s going at Verde,” O’Rourke said—Verde Realty is one of his father-in-law’s recent ventures—“he always says, ‘Interesting. ’ That’s it. He’s super private.” O’Rourke’s youth had its louche episodes, and his political opponents, in El Paso and elsewhere, have mined it exhaustively. At the Cult of the Dead Cow, in the days of dial-up, did he learn to steal long-distance service? He did. As a teen-ager, did he produce, under the alias Psychedelic Warlord, jejune poems and stories, including one whose narrator enjoyed running down children with a car? He did, and he professes to be mortified by that work now. And did he write, as an undergraduate, a pan of a Broadway show that included disdain for actresses “whose only qualifications seem to be their phenomenally large breasts and tight buttocks”? Guilty. “I am ashamed of what I wrote and I apologize,” he told Politico. O’Rourke excels at the Twitter-age practice of “owning his mistakes,” though not every error is easy to own. In 1998, he was arrested for drunk driving after a collision west of El Paso. He condemns himself for it (“there is no excuse”), and regularly uses the story as an example of race and class privilege. His parents made bail and the charges were dismissed after he paid a fine and completed a diversion course. “I’m grateful for the second chance,” he says. Someone with fewer resources would not have got off so lightly. He denies that he tried to leave the scene that night, though a witness quoted in the police report says he did. This, as they say in court, goes to character. Did his father’s political connections help launch O’Rourke’s political career, as is sometimes said? Not really. Did O’Rourke come from a local Anglo élite and benefit all his life from being a white man? Inarguably. Did he marry into a wealthy family? Indeed. Did his father-in-law co-found a business organization called the Paso Del Norte Group that came up with a downtown redevelopment plan which threatened to displace eighteen hundred residents of poor neighborhoods? Yes. Did O’Rourke, then new on the city council, support the plan? Yes. Did he recuse himself from votes related to his father-in-law’s effort? Not at first. Eventually, reluctantly. But the plan comported with his ambitions to turn El Paso into a vibrant city, and he felt certain that barrio residents would end up in better housing and have more jobs. He went door to door and held town halls to try to persuade people, and then seemed stunned when he was accused of betraying them. For some of his poorest constituents, this consultation came too late. O’Rourke felt vindicated, in part, when the affected neighborhoods helped reëlect him anyway, and then the whole project was put on seemingly permanent hold by the recession of 2008. The downtown business district had been revitalized—Art Nouveau office buildings renovated, new restaurants and clubs and bars opened, chic hotels built. But barrio activists are still fighting a proposed sports arena in a beleaguered neighborhood called Duranguito, and, though O’Rourke was out of office by the time that plan passed, they haven’t forgotten his role in the earlier struggle. They showed up at his official Presidential-campaign launch in El Paso at the end of March, carrying black banners that read “Gentrification Is Violence” and “O’Rourke, You Broke Duranguito, Now Fix Duranguito.” I talked to elderly residents of Duranguito about their battle to hang on to their homes. Romelia Mendoza said that she had no intention of selling. If they wanted to build this arena, it would have to go around her casita. Antonia Morales, who is ninety-one, lamented the destruction of an outdoor market that had been across the street for as long as anyone could remember. There were construction fences everywhere. It was clearly a conflict zone—residents versus the city. David Dorado Romo, a historian, is a spokesman for the barrio holdouts, though not a resident himself. He still blames O’Rourke, at least in part, for the neighborhood’s plight. “You used your charisma, your pretty face, to push this very ugly gentrification,” he said to me. He was still hoping that O’Rourke would speak out, now that he had a national platform. “During the Senate campaign, we were told, ‘Be quiet, he has to beat Cruz.’ And we get it—anybody is better than Cruz. But he never speaks up for us.” When I raised these criticisms, O’Rourke noted that he does not support the construction of the arena in Duranguito. But he praised Romo’s activism and scholarship, and agreed that he hadn’t listened carefully enough to his constituents in the barrio. “At the outset, I really didn’t do my job,” he told me. In any case, he continued to throw himself into the community. The first time he ran for Congress, in 2012, he knocked on sixteen thousand doors, by his count. He was challenging a sixteen-year incumbent, Silvestre Reyes, a former Border Patrol chief who was supported by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Reyes, O’Rourke contended, had a cynical, outdated view of the government’s war on drugs. O’Rourke held liberal social positions, including a then radical belief that marijuana should be legalized; he had co-written a carefully researched book analyzing the failures of U.S. drug policy. But he was also seen as pro-business. He received significant financial support from El Paso businessmen, including Sanders, and some local Republicans crossed the line to vote for him in the Democratic primary, helping him nip Reyes in a five-way race. In 2016, the last time he ran for Congress, O’Rourke won eighty-six per cent of the vote. In early April, O’Rourke was at Cronk’s Café, in Denison, Iowa, talking to the people whom he hopes to serve as President. Many of them looked like folks back home, which is to say, Latino. Standing beside me, jammed behind TV cameras, was a bullnecked fellow named Esteban Martinez. He told me that he had been minding his own business in Harlingen, Texas, in 1996, when recruiters for I.B.P., a major meat packer, came through town, trying to lure workers to Iowa. Martinez bit, then fell in love with a girl in Denison, and was now working at the Smithfield Foods plant, with kids in high school. Denison, population eight thousand, is about half Latino. It even has a Spanish-language newspaper. “It’s a good place,” Martinez said. And it was good to see another fronterizo here running for President. O’Rourke stood in a wide doorway, addressing two packed rooms at once. In a setting like Cronk’s, he has presence to burn, and it wasn’t hard to see what the early excitement was about. He rocked through a regional version of his stump speech, sprinkled with Spanish, that drew laughs here, applause there, but mostly rapt silence. He speaks in long, long sentences, which he organizes with a repertoire of hand gestures—karate chops, a raised index finger, imploring open hands, table sweeps, a fist shaken at an unthreatening angle, a palm to his chest. It looks as if he’s conducting ungainly music, but he usually brings his sentences home, phrase by baritone phrase. Like any performer, O’Rourke reads the room. His set speech can be short, leaving more time for questions, or it can build, hitting all the high points, piling up the cheers. He kept it short at Cronk’s. Children in cages are not who we are. Climate change—our greatest challenge, our Second World War. Scientists say we only have twelve years. End the war on drugs, private prisons, cash bail. Reverse this concentration of wealth. “You with me?” They were. O’Rourke uses Texas to bracing effect when he’s in the North. You haven’t seen voter suppression till you’ve seen how they do it in Texas. New Hampshire heads nod. Dead last nationally in voter turnout—till we improved that in 2018. He quotes an old rancher whose home town lacked electricity back in the thirties. Under the New Deal, electricity came, “and my daddy was a Yellow Dog Democrat for the rest of his life.” What he doesn’t do is demonize Republicans. “We don’t need any more name-calling,” he said in Denison. We need to “pull out the full potential, the talent, the genius, of every American.” O’Rourke also doesn’t talk that much about his six years in Congress. It wouldn’t necessarily help him if he did. Critics note that he voted with Trump thirty per cent of the time. At an event in Wisconsin early this year, he told the crowd, “Outside of Texas, people say, ‘Is he really a Democrat? I think he’s a closet Republican.’ I don’t know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less. I just want to get to better things for this country.” O’Rourke, to be fair, was in the minority throughout his years in Congress. If he wanted legislation that he wrote to pass, he had to find Republican co-sponsors, which he did for some bread-and-butter bills—strengthening cross-border trade, improving ports of entry, increasing access to health care for veterans. Mostly, though, he focussed on constituent service. He joined the Veterans’ Affairs Committee—El Paso has a large Army base, Fort Bliss—and the Homeland Security Committee, where he could work on border issues. He held town halls every month—by Facebook Live if he couldn’t get home. “He never missed one,” according to H. W. Sparks, the executive director of the local Veterans Business Association. The V.A. health-care system in El Paso was in bad shape, particularly for mental-health care. Wait times to see therapists stretched into months. O’Rourke found himself personally recruiting psychiatrists and psychologists to move to El Paso. “I’d call them and say, ‘You’ll love living here, and your help will be so deeply appreciated.’ And we eventually filled most of the spots. Got the wait times way down.” O’Rourke gained a reputation for being quick with social media, and the first national attention he got came by way of symbolic, media-savvy gestures. In 2016, after the mass shooting in the Pulse night club, in Orlando, O’Rourke joined a sit-in on the House floor, hoping to force Republicans to bring gun-control legislation to a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan called a recess, which shut down C-Span, turning the sit-in invisible. O’Rourke live-streamed the protest with his phone, and C-Span picked up his feed. The following year, he and Will Hurd, a Republican congressman from West Texas, were touring V.A. facilities in San Antonio. Their flight to Washington was cancelled by bad weather, so they rented a car and drove. O’Rourke recorded twenty-nine hours of the trip with his phone and put the video on Facebook Live, where it ended up getting hundreds of thousands of views. The congressmen talked politics, ate fast food, sang Johnny Cash, and later won a Prize for Civility in Public Life from Allegheny College. Not everyone was charmed by O’Rourke’s casual bipartisanship, though—particularly not after he declined to endorse Hurd’s Democratic opponent in the next election, and Hurd won. O’Rourke also got a reputation for failing to cover his own behind. As a freshman, he was one of only four Democrats in Congress to vote against sending military aid to Israel during the 2014 Gaza war—“a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children,” he explained. He was hammered, publicly and privately, by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby. Jim Moran, a veteran Virginia congressman, tried to explain O’Rourke’s reasoning to Connie Bruck, of this magazine. “I wanted him to switch his vote,” Moran said. But he wasn’t able to find O’Rourke, which probably didn’t matter, “because—as shocking as it may be—he’s in Congress solely to do what he considers to be the right thing. I’m afraid he may have a tough race in November.” O’Rourke boycotted a speech by the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington the following year. He later went on a tour of Israel (with J Street, AIPAC’s liberal competitor), which did not seem to fundamentally change his view of the conflict. Somehow, he was reëlected. Not all his votes, to be sure, were courageous. O’Rourke, who now speaks urgently about eliminating our dependence on fossil fuels, voted in Congress to lift an oil-export ban and to expedite drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. He told me he believed then that the U.S. petroleum industry was more environmentally responsible than its foreign counterparts, but that he would vote differently now. He also voted for a bill that would make it easier for cop killers to get the death penalty—legislation known as the Thin Blue Line Act, and widely seen as a police retort to Black Lives Matter. He now says that he doesn’t believe in capital punishment, and that his vote was a mistake. But this happened in 2017. O’Rourke’s riskiest move in Congress was bailing out of the money chase. When he arrived, Democratic leaders told him exactly how many hours of each day to spend in a boiler room dialling for dollars. He understood why, particularly for the party out of power, a new member’s first job was to keep his seat, while the whole team clawed toward a majority, and at first he did his bit. Then he didn’t. Still, when he ran for the Senate, in 2018, he out-raised Cruz two to one, relying entirely on small donors. The troubles with O’Rourke’s Presidential campaign started before the campaign. After the loss to Cruz, he went into a self-described “funk.” Although people were urging him to run for President, he had told a “60 Minutes” interviewer in November that his family couldn’t take it. “We spent the better part of the last two years not with each other, missing birthdays and anniversaries and time together,” he said. “I’m not running in 2020.” The counter-argument came not just from Oprah and MoveOn.org but also from Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, who praised O’Rourke as “a phenom.” (This was after his candidate had won.) Roe added, “He is in a league of his own in the Democrat Party. And if he doesn’t use that to run for President, then I don’t know what he’d do with it.” After Christmas, O’Rourke took a solo road trip to think things over. He rambled through five states, staying in motels, talking to seemingly everyone and blogging about it at Medium.com. Some readers compared his writing to Kerouac’s, some to Steinbeck’s. It was a celebration of the people he met, and arguably a mite pretentious. (On a meeting with students at Pueblo Community College: “Something so raw and honest that you want to hold on to it, remember every word . . . a flow between people.”) The trip was also a reckoning with himself. What should he do next? As such, it annoyed a lot of readers, especially women. Amy was home with the kids, again. He was off communing with himself—and America, of course. One began to hear more about not just white privilege but also the singular privilege of being Beto O’Rourke. His social-media presence, previously an asset, began to have mixed results. On Instagram, he streamed video of himself getting his teeth cleaned, hoping to focus on the hygienist, the daughter of a Mexican immigrant; people focussed instead on his teeth. A parody Twitter account called Not Beto’s Journal skewered the tone of his road blog: “This is a campaign for America. For everyone in America. For everything in America. This is a campaign that stands for everything. For anything. For all the things. For America.” When O’Rourke passed through New York: “Grabbed a cab near Times Square. The whole world right in one place. Sudhir, my driver, asks me where we’re going. I reply ‘you tell me, my friend.’ ” O’Rourke said that he made the decision to run after long family discussions. In the end, everybody wanted him to do it. Even the kids seemed to understand what was at stake. Democracy. The planet. He semi-announced his candidacy in a cover story in Vanity Fair. The article was flattering, but the quote on the cover was problematic: “I want to be in it. Man, I’m just born to be in it.” Angsty deliberation had become entitled declaration, and even that was soon distorted. (I mentioned O’Rourke to an Australian editor. “Oh, is that the guy who says he’s born to rule?”) He’s been publicly regretting the remark since. But his official campaign launch was in friendly territory: El Paso, on a sunny morning, in the streets of an old commercial district. Veronica Escobar, the new congresswoman for the area, and an old pal of O’Rourke’s, gave him a rousing introduction, calling him “a son of the border.” O’Rourke and his family took the makeshift stage with one of his favorite songs—the Clash’s “Clampdown”—blasting over concert-calibre speakers. There were thousands of people, many of them dressed in black-and-white Beto merch, both official (“Beto for America”) and unofficial (“Beto Days Are Coming”). There were lots of campaign signs and American flags, lots of kids on shoulders. A young woman near me wore what looked like a MAGA cap, until you read its message: CHINGA TU MADRE TRUMP. The real MAGA caps, and other protesters, including the Duranguito crew and anti-abortion activists, had been banished to a distant side street. O’Rourke’s kids—Henry, eight; Molly, ten; Ulysses, twelve—looked appropriately abashed. Their mother gave a poised speech, with a huge grin. “Listening is what gives Beto strength. It fuels him,” Amy said. A woman standing next to me gasped. “I’ve never heard her voice before,” she said. It was not difficult to picture this family in the White House. O’Rourke gave a passionate speech, much interrupted by cheers that could have been heard in Mexico—the border was only a few blocks away. In fact, at that moment, hundreds of people, detained migrants, were languishing in a jerry-built cage underneath the Paso del Norte International Bridge. This crowd hardly needed to be reminded of the abuses occurring around them. In December, Jakelin Caal Maquin, a seven-year-old girl from Guatemala, had died in U.S. custody after being transported from the New Mexico desert to a hospital in El Paso. Trump took it upon himself to accuse her father of failing to give her enough water. That was false. She had died from a bacterial infection, and her father had thanked the American first responders for their efforts to save his daughter. If one believed in Hell, one might wish its torments visited on Trump for his comments about this girl and her father alone. O’Rourke mentioned Trump once in his El Paso launch speech. The crowd was chanting, “Beto! Beto!” A huge-voiced man behind me was bellowing, “Viva Beto! Viva El Paso!” O’Rourke’s windup was as good as I’ve heard. Then he was off to the airport for launch rallies in Houston and Austin. The woman next to me, the one who had gasped when Amy O’Rourke spoke, had a big, bright homemade poster hanging from her neck, with a heartfelt text extolling love and acceptance. (“Equal rights for others does not mean less rights for YOU.”) Her name was Yvonne Orozco-Martell. Her mother had turned her on to Beto. Now she followed him on Instagram. She loved what he had to say about unity. Of his speeches, she said, “I like the fact that he doesn’t seem prepared. He shoots from the hip, says what he feels.” (Trump supporters, too, are always saying that they like how he shoots from the hip.) Orozco-Martell deplored Trump—no surprise. That week he had been threatening to close the border with Mexico. It was an empty threat, obviously, but wait times on the Juárez side immediately shot up. Her husband worked in a warehouse and some of his co-workers, stuck at the bridge, had arrived four hours late for their shifts. Now they were in trouble. “The company doesn’t care,” she said. Her husband supported Beto, too, even though he couldn’t vote. He was a Mexican citizen. That night in Austin, it was cold and windy and felt like a rock concert. A sexy soul band warmed up the crowd, which numbered maybe ten thousand, beneath the illuminated wedding cake of the state capitol. The singer, in a canary-yellow tracksuit, shouted, “Are we woke? We are woke!” Alex Jones, of Infowars, patrolled the perimeter, bellowing incomprehensibly through a bullhorn, and deep chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” rose from the darkness. The O’Rourke supporters strategically ignored them. The mayor of Austin spoke. “Beto brought us back from the despair of 2016,” he said. “All he had was a car, a fire in his belly, and Facebook Live. It was like in the movies, when the army seems defeated, all dead on the battlefield, and then one guy rises. Oh, he’s alive! And the battle resumes. That was Beto.” O’Rourke came onstage in a black fleece. These screaming people were his people. He applauded them. “What you did in 2017 and 2018 was nothing short of a miracle,” he said. Pointing to the capitol, he added, “You literally changed the composition of this state legislature.” The stage was surrounded by people, like a boxing ring, and O’Rourke turned and turned as he spoke, projecting in every direction. When he warmed up, he unzipped his fleece, then tore it off—he was sweating, even though it was bitterly cold—and when he went to roll up his sleeves, there was shrieking of a particular titillated kind. He grinned. But he was just getting started. I had noticed a little rock-and-roll hop he sometimes does when speaking vigorously. In Austin, it wasn’t subtle. He might as well have been playing an electric guitar as he charged the floodlights in every direction, almost leaving his feet to hit the big notes. I’ve never heard a political crowd roar louder. He bellowed, “Are you with me?” The “YES!” was deafening. Scenes like these seemed to worry Trump. In February, he travelled to El Paso for what many saw as the kickoff rally of his own 2020 campaign. This came just after the thirty-five-day government shutdown that failed to pry from Congress the money Trump wanted for his border wall. He clearly still sees the border as his signature issue, and in El Paso he repeated false claims about crime and the wall that even Dee Margo, the city’s Republican mayor, was moved to debunk. O’Rourke addressed a simultaneous rally, held less than a mile away, with his upbeat anti-wall message. Both drew big crowds, but Trump, inevitably, insisted that his was bigger. Three months later, he was still bringing up the size thing unprompted. In Florida, in early May, he declared that O’Rourke had drawn only five hundred and two people in El Paso. He himself drew more than thirty-five thousand, he said. This is an instructive contrast. Nobody, and I respectfully mean nobody, goes to Trump for the facts. They go for the entertainment, the fun, the inclusion, the angry release. Perhaps they agree with him, perhaps they don’t. A Latino activist in El Paso told me that he had gone to hear O’Rourke that night, and was horrified to see his entire extended family, from both sides of the border, go to hear Trump instead. He understood, though. You knew what Beto would say. You never knew what crazy shit Trump would say. People go for the transgression. I think Trump was worried that O’Rourke, who had nearly pulled off the impossible against “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz, might be a phenomenon, not subject to the normal laws of political gravity. He, Trump, was such a phenomenon. In 2015 and 2016, he rose straight past sixteen Republican rivals, nearly all of them more qualified than he was. Could O’Rourke bottle lightning like that on the other side? So far, O’Rourke has basically tried to re-create his Senate campaign. It ran on a “distributed organizing” model, borrowed from Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign, which gives volunteers open-source digital tools and trusts them to work with minimal supervision. But, scaling up for a national campaign, it was highly unlikely that O’Rourke could ignite the same prairie-fire enthusiasm—especially with so many other progressive candidates in the field, and with no Ted Cruz to focus the minds of supporters. Sanders also had a road-tested campaign, better organized than his 2016 version, and a solid head start. On the last Saturday in April, his team held forty-five hundred house parties simultaneously. No other campaign could match that. The digital fund-raising operation that financed O’Rourke’s Senate run was back in gear. But his announcement video was unaccountably bad. It was three and a half unmodulated minutes of him and Amy sitting on a couch, Beto speaking into the camera, Amy silent, smiling, adoring. Not a hit in O’Rourke’s target demographic. On the campaign trail, he recycled an old favorite remark, intended as self-deprecating, about how Amy was raising the kids, “sometimes with my help.” This did not play, either. Even Amy complained that it sounded “flip.” Beto, chagrined, promised to retire the quip. The rollout was turning into an apology tour. O’Rourke can be strikingly self-critical for a politician. He often says “I don’t know” in answer to a question, and always wants to hear more from anyone who knows more than he does. He tells college students that they are “already the leaders.” His manner, for all the structural privilege he enjoys, is the opposite of entitled; he never seems to smugly know anything. This can be disarming—or disconcerting. It is also, I think, part of why live crowds tend to love him. “He’s my guy,” Christy Watson, a schoolteacher, said at a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa. “I feel like he shares my values on a lot of things. I like how he carries himself.” Watson was flanked by her mother and her teen-age daughter, who were both also settled on O’Rourke. Joan Kitten, a nurse-practitioner in Fort Dodge, said that she picked O’Rourke even before he got to town. “The first time I saw him, on Stephen Colbert, I thought, He’s going to be our next President.” Nearly everybody’s first question about him was, Can he beat Trump? “He’s nice, he’s energetic, but is that enough?” That’s what Ted Cozart, a retired history teacher, wanted to know, after a rally in a high-school gymnasium in Charleston, South Carolina. The rally had been rousing. “But the people who come here on a Saturday morning are diehards,” Cozart said. “These aren’t the people he needs to convince.” I couldn’t tell if he meant white people. We were in a black neighborhood, and the majority of the state’s Democrats are black, but it had been a fairly white crowd. “We need a broader base,” Cozart, who is black, said. “We need to pull in alienated Republicans, and there are a lot of those here.” Now he was definitely talking about white people. “Trump’s disrespecting the military, with John McCain, and they don’t like that.” Cozart’s grown children, Kim and Christopher, were equally well disposed yet equally skeptical. Kim said, “I’m personally not going to vote for someone just because he’s a nice guy.” Like a growing number of political pundits, the Cozarts wanted to hear more concrete policy proposals from O’Rourke. “We have such a great field of candidates,” Ted said. “I need to know what he’s going to do.” In early April, I watched a rapid-fire series of candidates—O’Rourke, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Julián Castro, Jay Inslee, Kirsten Gillibrand—address a crowd of labor organizers and other activists in an old theatre in Washington, D.C. O’Rourke seemed, in that company, very tall and boyish and suspiciously glamorous, slightly out of place. He lingered too long over the rote syllables of “serve you as President of the United States of America.” He seemed slightly buzzed on his own rhetoric. O’Rourke’s platform is to the right of Sanders and to the left of the Democratic establishment. Health care, of course—universal, guaranteed. Universal pre-K, better teacher pay, lower student debt. Immigration reform, Dreamers protected, asylum laws respected, paths to citizenship. Paid family leave, equal pay for women. Criminal-justice reform. End partisan gerrymandering, enact same-day voter registration and a new Voting Rights Act. Renewable energy. Economic democracy. A living wage. O’Rourke has areas of depth that he doesn’t often show—the drug war, rural broadband, the border. When I pressed him about the current border crisis, he described what he considers the only long-term fix—increased aid to Central America—in a way that showed thorough knowledge of U.S. policy in each country in question. But in speeches he can seem like an anti-wonk. He takes pride in trying to answer the question he is asked, rather than the question he would like to be asked, and I have not seen him flaunt his knowledge of the issues onstage. It’s as if he thinks it’s uncool to be a know-it-all. On the campaign trail, O’Rourke remains relentlessly positive, sometimes even lauding his primary opponents, such as Warren, who has an unmatched range and depth of policy proposals. His sunniness also helps neutralize the “oppo research” videographers who seem to show up at every event; America Rising, a conservative group, has some two hundred trackers following Democratic politicians on any given day. On rare occasions, O’Rourke allows himself to express anger or disgust. In a riff on immigration, he criticized Trump for warning that undocumented immigrants were going to “infest” the country: “I might expect someone to describe another human being as an infestation in the Third Reich; I would not expect it in the United States of America.” In the primaries, O’Rourke is most vulnerable from the left. He agrees broadly that, in this new Gilded Age, capitalism must be saved from itself, but he is not prepared to call for the breakup of Amazon and Facebook and Google. In Congress, he voted with Republicans on two rule changes that weakened the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Senator Warren’s beleaguered brainchild. Occasionally siding with the banks may be uncontroversial in Texas; not so in the Democratic primaries. Even the Club for Growth, an anti-tax association that works with Republicans, has attacked him from the left: the group produced a TV commercial about his alleged depredations in Duranguito, suggesting that he was, if not driving the bulldozers himself, then at least secretly working for his father-in-law against poor barrio residents. One of the many “purity questions” that Democratic hopefuls have to answer is whether they are ready to abolish ICE—Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the bane of the undocumented and their families. I put the question to O’Rourke. “No,” he said, emphatically. Like other liberals, he is regularly accused of wanting “open borders.” I’ve heard him take audience questions with that premise, which he gently corrects, saying, “We’re raising three kids half a mile from the Mexican border.” But he thinks a militarized border is exactly wrong—the frightened, crude response of national leaders with no feel for the thing itself. After 2006, when the federal government began fortifying the border through the city with a towering new wall, El Paso became slightly less safe, O’Rourke contends. He thinks that much of the six hundred and fifty miles of fencing built in subsequent years has been a mistake. He’s been outspoken about ICE abuses, under both Obama and Trump, but he has also worked closely with border law enforcement. Reform ICE, yes; abolish it, no, at least not without an alternative ready. Certainly end the kinds of ICE raids that devastate towns in the Midwest, far from the migrant trail. Another threshold question for the Democratic field is, of course, climate. In late April, O’Rourke made a surprise announcement: he was proposing a ten-year, five-trillion-dollar program to combat climate change. He unveiled this ambitious plan in Yosemite Valley, with waterfalls thundering, on Facebook Live. The current benchmark is the Green New Deal resolution, put forward by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, which seeks zero net emissions by 2030; O’Rourke’s proposal has the same goal, with the deadline twenty years later. Depending on your perspective, this can seem admirably realistic or infuriatingly slow. The plan was hailed by Greenpeace and the League of Conservation Voters, and panned by the youth-led Sunrise Movement. That evening, on MSNBC, Chris Hayes plied O’Rourke with friendly questions about the plan. His answers had a hortatory, soapbox quality, as if he were still trying to be heard over waterfalls, or not quite comfortable in the give-and-take of a televised interview conducted via satellite. O’Rourke was barely seen on national television in the first two months of the campaign, turning down nearly every interview request in favor of face-to-face encounters with the public. This was a major tactical mistake, especially with such a huge field. In a national contest, the race is not in coffee shops; it’s on TV. During those same two months, Pete Buttigieg made dozens of appearances on national television. Mayor Pete will do seemingly any interview and do it well. In mid-May, he went on Jimmy Fallon’s show to gamely deliver talking points while the house band played a slinky groove. The crowd loved it. When Buttigieg began to make his move, in March, O’Rourke had reached double digits in an average of national polls. Buttigieg quickly passed him. He has a glittering résumé for a small-city mayor, and a gracious manner on TV. The news media adore him, and he drove the news cycle, at least for a couple of weeks. Fifteen days after the mayor of Austin hailed O’Rourke as the Democrats’ battlefield hero, he endorsed Mayor Pete. O’Rourke began to slip in the polls, behind Warren, who is moving slowly upward, and Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, who has surged intermittently since a bravura announcement in January. In late April, Biden finally announced his candidacy, concentrating his fire on Trump. He promptly broke O’Rourke’s record for one-day fund-raising, and his polling lead increased, leaving Sanders some twenty-five points behind. O’Rourke’s poll numbers sank to six per cent. Biden, who for the moment appeals to the broad center of the Party, particularly to older voters, has shown how many of his rivals are gathered in a relatively narrow slice of the ideological pie. For O’Rourke, the only good polling news lately came from CNN, in early May. A poll matching the top six Democrats in hypothetical races against Trump showed that any of them, except for Warren, would win. O’Rourke won by the largest margin, ten per cent. A ripple of hope passed through his campaign: maybe O’Rourke really was the centrist candidate that America wanted. In the following weeks, his numbers kept falling, to as low as two per cent. In mid-April, I asked O’Rourke how he thought the campaign was going. This was during a rare break from roadwork in Iowa and New Hampshire. We were in his living room in El Paso. He welcomed the question, he said. He was usually too busy campaigning to step back. “It has not gone as well as I would have wanted it to, in terms of my performance with the press,” he said. “That’s on me, a hundred per cent.” On the other hand, he was encouraged by the people he was meeting in the early primary states. “They take this stuff really seriously,” he said. “They’re super invested in it, and asking good questions, and bringing good ideas to the conversations.” The O’Rourkes live in a century-old Mission-style house, a stone’s throw from Interstate 10. When I had pulled up earlier, Amy and Henry were playing catch in the small front yard. Now the kids were charging around, their dog, Artemis, was licking my knuckles, and the sun was going down. One wall of the living room was all bookcases, with a creditable collection of vinyl on the bottom shelf. I was there to talk about the campaign, but the conversation kept going walkabout—a German TV series about the Weimar Republic that he and Amy had just watched, a Chinese film I saw, a frightening new book on climate change. O’Rourke, describing his experience both in Congress and on the campaign trail, said, “You’re always aware of how much you do not know, and how many things you want to get smart on.” This statement—the mix of humility and ambition—struck me as pure O’Rourke. His curiosity is weirdly unbounded, like a belief system in itself. When I confessed my near-total ignorance of China, he said, encouragingly, “Right on.” The odd thing is how unfinished O’Rourke seems in public—not nervous but porous, always looking for enlightenment, or contrary ideas, or a problem he can either solve or take under advisement. His attachment to do-it-yourself campaigning has often been attributed to his punk-rock past, and there is a common thread of the homemade, the cult of authenticity. And yet there is nothing transgressive about O’Rourke’s politics. His vibe of gentle respect is, if anything, more New Age than punk. He still reminisces fondly about visiting the reddest towns in Texas. “I love it,” he said, that afternoon at his house. “Amy and I spent so much time in Amarillo and in Abilene, and in smaller counties that were traditionally Republican and whose residents may feel that Democrats don’t care about them.” Amy, who had joined us, confirmed. But those were the old days, 2018. Now they needed to ramp up. This was fifty states, not one. And campaigning in remote Republican counties, I thought, didn’t actually make much sense in a Democratic primary. Beto had just hired an Obama veteran, Jen O’Malley Dillon, as his campaign manager. She was moving, with her family, to El Paso. He was about to hire another Obama person, a specialist in delegate counting. Amy admitted that it made her nervous: “You fear that they’re going to want your campaign to look like those that they’ve run.” Beto said that he had been talking to a “communications person”—a speechwriter. “I don’t think I’ve ever read a speech,” he said. “I’ve definitely never looked at a teleprompter, or whatever the glass is called—” “Yeah,” Amy said. Teleprompter was right. But would Beto be able to let go of the wheel for this campaign? Stop driving himself everywhere, diving into crowds in one-stoplight towns, relying on his phone and social media to get out the word? Perhaps even start taking direction from professionals, spending more time in TV studios? O’Rourke campaigns the way he does because he believes in it. He wants to feel something (even if it’s only respectful disagreement), to have a breakthrough, to be led as much as he leads. But the evidence is piling up that this approach will not work on the national level, at least not this year. To have any chance, he must turn to television, where empathy, careful listening, and voracious curiosity are not the coin of the realm. Recently, O’Rourke has started making that turn, appearing on news shows and morning shows, becoming the last top-tier candidate other than Biden to hold a CNN town hall—an influential new format. He does not look especially comfortable with what TV hosts keep calling his “reboot.” But he was commanding on CNN, with a stage to pace and a full house at Drake University, in Des Moines. Taking questions from the audience and from the host, Dana Bash, he gave polished and comprehensive answers on impeachment, immigration, reproductive rights. He limned a post-Trump American vision that drew waves of applause. He even wore a coat and tie. This was hardly selling out. O’Rourke is running for President, not city council. Still, being center stage, having all the answers, does not seem to be where his heart lies. “The town halls, the issues, the travel, the endurance, I love all that,” O’Rourke told me in his living room. What he did not love, particularly not while coming off the contact high of a rally, was “the thirty members of the press, in your face, at the first event, at the second event, at the third, and then day after day after day, and asking almost nothing about anything that we just experienced together in that room, in that coffee shop or that tavern or in that home, but things that may have been popping up on the news that day, or things I may have done thirty-five years ago, none of which . . . ” He threw up his hands. “Because this woman has just told me that her daughter spends four hundred forty-four dollars on her prescription, and I’m thinking that through as I’m leaving—like, How do I get her a better answer?” O’Rourke folded his hands. “So I think I’m learning the rhythm of that,” he said. ♦ An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated where Pat O'Rourke went to high school.

383,http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1905/30/se.01.html,"Return to Transcripts main page CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL Town Hall with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CA), Presidential Candidate. Aired 10-11p ET Aired May 30, 2019 - 22:00   ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. [22:00:00] (APPLAUSE) DANA BASH, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening from the CNN Center in Atlanta.  Welcome to CNN's Democratic Presidential Town Hall with Senator Michael Bennet.  I'm Dana Bash. Bennett is a Democratic senator from Colorado vying for a chance to take on President Trump.  Before going to Washington, he served as superintendent of the Denver Public School System.  Public service runs in Bennet's family. His father worked in the Carter and Clinton administrations.  His grandfather was an adviser to FDR, and tonight, Senator Bennett will take questions from Democrats and Independents who say they plan to participate in the Democratic primaries and caucuses.  Now, please welcome Senator Michael Bennet. (APPLAUSE) SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D), COLORADO:  (INAUDIBLE)  Hello.  Thank you.   BASH:  Hi Senator. BENNET:  Hi Dana.  How are you? BASH:  Thank you so much. BENNET:  Thank you for having me.  Nice to see you.  Thank you. BASH:  Senator, have a seat. Senator, I want to start with some breaking news this evening and that is the president, I'm sure you saw, announced that on June 10th, the United States will impose a 5 percent tariff that could increase to 25 percent on all goods from Mexico until quote, ""Illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our country stop.""  How would a President Bennet handle that situation?  BENNET:  President Bennett would work with the countries in our hemisphere to stop this refugee crisis.  A President Bennet would stop behaving as though the United States is a weak country and can't handle a refugee crisis on our border.  A President Bennet would not erect tariffs that are just another tax on American workers and American farmers and ranchers, the last moment they need them.   Commodity prices are already low in this country.  People in the Midwest are getting hammered with terrible rains and in my state, hammered with terrible drought.  And President Trump has made matters worse for them already and he's going to make it even worse now. BASH: OK, let's get straight to the audience.  Our first question comes from Justin Ash.  He works as an insurance adjuster and supports former Vice President Joe Biden.  Justin. JUSTIN ASH, AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Good evening, Senator.  Thank you for being here. President Trump has possibly broken numerous laws.  Do you plan on, if elected, requiring your attorney general to investigate him and if violations are found, prosecuting him after he's out of office?  Or will you pardon the president for all crimes committed if it's found he did so, including members of his administration? BENNET:  I certainly wouldn't pardon him and I think we should investigate him if we believe that that's what's called for by the rule rule of law.  And in the meantime, what we need to do is beat him to make sure that he's just a one-term president.  (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Let me ask you a followup on a related issue.  Robert Mueller said yesterday, quote, ""If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would've said so.""  Given that, where do you stand now on impeachment?  BENNET:  Well, listen, I think Bob Mueller made it very clear that Congress needs to do its job and I believe that Congress needs to do its job.  I've read the Mueller Report.  I heard what Bob Mueller said yesterday.  I believe President Trump has probably committed impeachable offenses and I think Bob Mueller should come to Congress and testify.  Congress should subpoena other people, and if the president doesn't allow them to testify, we should go to the courts and insist that they testify.  And we should follow where the evidence leads.  We need to follow this process though.  There are a lot of tweets going out today about what we should do, impeach or not impeach and all this stuff.  It is very important that we take a page out of history and do what they did with Watergate, which was to make sure the American people understood really what was at stake.  If we go down the road tomorrow and impeach President Trump, we're actually giving him a favor.  That's what he wants, to be able to say he was railroaded, and then to have the impeachment from the House go to the Senate where I guarantee you Mitch McConnell and the Republicans are not going to convict Donald Trump.  They're going to acquit Donald Trump, and then he's going to run for president saying he was acquitted.  BASH:  You mentioned the tweets.  I'm sure you're referring to several of your democratic competitors saying now that they do believe that at least impeachment proceedings should begin.  Why are they wrong just on that? BENNET:  I think that we should call them, you know, Russia proceedings involving the president or whatever it is we want to call them.  If that leads us to impeachment, it leads us to impeachment.  I wouldn't be surprised if it did.  I say the president, in my view, I think he committed impeachable offenses, but we have to go through the process.   And to me, it's one of the problems with our politics today is we want to go out and tweet and immediately react, race to judgment, and we need to be more strategic than that.  We need to be smarter than that. That's one of the reasons why we have a climate denier in the White House even though the vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it. And I'm tired of losing to these guys.  You know, I'm tired of losing to Mitch McConnell, I'm tired of losing to a guy like Donald Trump who never should have won the presidency to begin with.  So I'm not saying we shouldn't follow this evidence where it leads, but I am saying we should bring the American people along for the journey so that they can also help us make a judgment about what the right thing to do is.  BASH:  OK Senator, let's get back to the audience.   Kristina LaPlant is a PhD student studying political science at Georgia State University.  KRISTINA LAPLANT, AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you, Senator.  Recently, the governor of our state signed House Bill 481 into law, which severely restricts women's access to abortion.  In a world that becomes more technologically advanced with each day's passing, state governments across the country are responding by restricting women's rights and not expanding them.  So as president, what would you do to ensure that women and not the government have the right to make decisions about their own bodies?  BENNET:  That's a easy, short answer for me.  Everything I possibly can do to make sure Roe versus Wade is the law of the land and to make sure that women make these decisions, not the government.  And that's the way it ought to be in this country. (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Can you be more specific?  What does that mean in real practical terms?  BENNET:  Well, I mean, what does it mean?  I think it means making sure that the judges I appoint are judges that will uphold the precedent of Roe versus Wade to begin with.  It means making sure that -- I think Kamala Harris had a good idea the other day.  I haven't had a chance to study it, but her idea that the Justice Department ought to have something to say if states have lost court battles and then put further restrictions on women as we had with civil rights, the Civil Rights Division, I think that's a really interesting idea too. Make -- you know, this is what's happening in this country.  Women's reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States. Women's healthcare is under assault all over the United States.  We have managed in the Senate to be able to hold it back, but that doesn't mean there are not huge parts of America where - Texas is a good example - where Planned Parenthood is stripped of any ability to serve women.  And, you know, that's not the way it ought to work.  Jon Tester, who's my friend from Montana who just won reelection miraculously, to the Senate, said last time he was running that his daughter was having to fight for rights that his wife never had to fight for because her grandmother had won those rights.  And that is true.  And they're trying to turn back the clock, and we need to fight it with every ounce of strength that we have. BASH:  Well, Kristina mentioned what's going on here in Georgia. Senator, many entertainment companies have put Georgia on notice about this new law.  You probably know - I'm sure people here do - film and TV is a multi-billion dollar industry here in Georgia.  Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal, Warner Media which owns CNN, they've all warned that they will halt future business here if this law goes into effect. Do you support that?  BENNET:  I do support that.  I think that's awesome.  I think we need more of that kind of advocacy in this country.  We need more of that kind of activism by the leading corporations in America on issues like this and issues like climate change as well.  Issues like -- BASH:  So just to be clear, you support a boycott on the -- businesses boycott -- BENNET:  I do.  Yes, I absolutely do.  Well, you asked me do I support the business' right to boycott.  And -- BASH:  OK, well let me take it a step further.  Do you support the notion of businesses boycotting -- BENNET:  I do.  I think it's important, it's helpful and it's necessary.  Look, this is a moment when our democracy is under siege in so many different ways, from the White House all the way to these state legislators.   And we -- this isn't about just politicians. This is about all of America rising up and saying we're going in a different direction.  BASH:  Let me ask you on -- (APPLAUSE) A bit of a related note.  As of this month, 100 - 100 of President Trump's judges have been confirmed to the federal bench and it's a milestone that was made possible by Senate Democrats.  When you changed the rules a couple of years ago to make it so that just a majority, simple majority vote would allow these judges to get through, now you call your vote to support that your biggest regret in your 10 years in the Senate.  You say you did it because you were a member of the democratic leadership. What have you learned from this regret?  BENNET:  Well, what I've learned from this regret is, first of all, it's important to be honest when you make a mistake.  Second, my objection is not that we could have -- that Mitch McConnell would have done anything differently. It didn't surprise me at all when he said today if there's a vacancy next year, he's going to fill it.  He's the most cynical person in Washington, D.C.  And I believe we need to at least be as strategic as Mitch McConnell.  The Democrats need to.  I don't want us to be as malevolent as he is.  I don't want us to be as cynical as he is. But I want us to be as strategic as he is.   And when it came to these decisions on judges, we helped him every step along the way.  And now, as you point out, Donald Trump has twice the Circuit Court judges that Barack Obama had.  And it's shameful.   And that's why we need to elect a Democratic president.  That's why we need a Democratic majority in the Senate.  And that's why we need elected leaders in Washington that are going to be strategic enough to take on a guy like Mitch McConnell.  I don't think we've done that very well over the past 10 years.  DANA BASH, CNN HOST, TOWN HALL:  OK, Senator.  Let's get back to the audience.   BENNET:  Hi.  BASH:  We want to bring in Naudia Foster, a paralegal who will be attending law school in the fall of 2020.  BENNET:  Congratulations.  NAUDIA FOSTER, PARALEGAL:  Thank you, Senator Bennet.  So my question, actually -- BENNET:  The legal profession threw me out, but I hope you have a better time.  (LAUGHTER) FOSTER:  It's not for everybody.   (LAUGHTER) BENNET:  That's what I told my mom.  (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) FOSTER:  OK.  So.   BENNET:  Sorry.  It's true, though.  FOSTER:  Thank you.  I have a friend who's a recent graduate from UNCC.  She was almost killed due to gun violence.  Gun reform legislation is long overdue, but seems impossible to implement.  How do you plan to reach a compromise that will keep other students and families safe in America?  BENNET:  I think -- thank you for raising the question.  I come from a state, as you know, where we've had 20 years, now, of gun violence, starting with Columbine, which happened just before my first daughter was born.  She's here tonight, actually.  She and her older -- her younger -- middle sister are here tonight.  (LAUGHTER) BENNET:  They -- by the way, it's ironic.  The youngest sister who's 14, is the only one in the house that really wanted me to run. Because she thought that it would mean that I'd be out of the house and away from her.  Her plan's working because she's not here tonight. I am here tonight, and I have no idea what she's doing in Denver, Colorado.  But they have grown up in a world that my generation didn't grow up in.  Scared to go to school because of what happens every several months, it seems, in the United States of America.  And not to mention, every single day in many communities in America.   In Chicago just this weekend, 42 people were shot by guns.  It's not -- it wasn't the kind of mass shooting that we commonly think of, but it's the kind of shooting that goes on every single day in neighborhoods across America.  And I think they deserve to live in a country where they know that their parents and grandparents care enough about them that we're actually going to do something about it.  And that's why we should pass background checks in Washington, D.C.  The Democrats in the House of Representatives have done that.  We should call on Mitch McConnell to put that bill on the floor.  And if he doesn't -- which he won't, because he is impervious to compromise on this issue, just as he is on all other issues -- if he will not put it on the floor, the American people need to demand members of -- need to elect members of Congress that will ensure that that bill is on the floor and voted by the members of Congress.   It is supported by 90 percent of the American people.  And if there are people there that won't support what 90 percent of the American people want, we need to beat them.  I would wish that we could compromise with them, but I don't think those guys are open to compromise because the NRA won't let them compromise.  My state is a third Democratic, a third Republican and a third independent.  It is a Western state.  After Columbine, we went out and went to the ballot, led by our Republican governor at the time, to close the gun show -- basically to put on the ballot the same bill that's on the floor of the House of Representatives today.  And we passed it.  And Dana, in my state, you know, what that means is, two percent, on average, of the people that try to buy a firearm are stopped from buying it every year and -- BASH:  So you mentioned that -- BENNET:  -- those people are murderers, they're rapists, they're domestic abusers.  And I don't know anybody in America who can argue that we would be better off with those people having firearms. BASH:  So you're talking about closing the gun show loophole.  BENNET:  And the internet loophole.  BASH:  And the internet.  What about banning assault weapons?  BENNET:  I would support that.  BASH:  Because you haven't always voted that way.  BENNET:  I didn't vote that way once because it was an old assault weapons ban that I thought was overly drawn and allowed the manufacturers to avoid the ban.  But I certainly would support one.  BASH:  OK, Senator.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  Will (ph) you (ph) -- BENNET:  Where would I go?  BASH:  I know.  You're stuck here.  (LAUGHTER) We'll be right back with a lot more from CNN's Democratic PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL with Senator Michael Bennet.  Stay with us.  (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL with Senator Michael Bennet.  We're live from Atlanta.  Senator, you were diagnosed with prostate cancer right before you announced your candidacy.  How are you feeling?  BENNET:  I'm feeling great, thanks for asking.  You know, it's hard to believe it was about five weeks ago that I was on an operating table. And maybe two months ago that I was diagnosed.  And I feel really good.  But I've got to say, I feel awfully lucky that I had health insurance. This cost $93,000 and if my family hadn't been insured, you know, it would have been a disaster for us.  And it would have been a real disaster for most American families.  And I think about not only that, but what it would be -- what it would mean if you were an American citizen and you didn't have a primary care doctor who could give you a screening that would let you know you had cancer.   I had no symptoms.  And if I hadn't had that screening, I'd be sitting here tonight and I'd be sick.  And I'd be, you know, at some point, dying of cancer.  And that's what's happening to millions of Americans.  And it doesn't happen in any other industrialized country of the world.  It only happens here.  And that's why we need universal health care in this country.  (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Let me ask you about that.  Because you support a public option for health care and you call your plan, ""Medicare X.""   A number of your opponents, as you well know, support Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All Plan, which essentially eliminates private insurance. Why are they wrong?  SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think I might have to get up for this one.   BASH:  Go for it.   BENNET:  Here -- I think you asked the question well, Dana.  I think they are wrong.  I think what we would be much better off doing in order to get to universal health care quickly is to finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act and have a true public option. In my case --   (APPLAUSE) BENNET:  In the one -- the one that I have designed, it would be administered by Medicare, and it would give all of you the chance to choose what's right for you or your family.  If you want a public option, then you can have it.  Basically, it's Medicare-for-all if you want it.  But if you want to keep the insurance you have, which many people do, you'd be able to do that as well.   I don't know if you guys remember when we were passing the Affordable Care Act, the whole thing if you like your insurance you can keep it. Do you remember that?  And a few people lost their insurance and all hell broke loose.   And now, Bernie is proposing if you like your insurance, we're going to take it away from you, from 180 million people who get it from their employer, 80 percent of them say they like it.  Every single labor union in America that's negotiated a benefits package for their workers, for their members, would have to give it under Medicare-for- All.  I just don't think they're going to give it up.   And that's why I think Bernie is wrong to propose it.  I think what we should do is give the American people a choice.  And if we give them a choice it's going to be very hard to argue with the case that we're making.   And I think that's essential because people in my state and people in Georgia and people all over this country don't need insurance 10 years from now or 20 years from now.  They need insurance now.  And we haven't been able to give it to them for the last 10 years.  We can't afford to do this for another 10 years, in my view.   BASH:  Senator, we're going to stay on the issue of health care and get to the audience.   BENNET:  OK. BASH:  Question comes from Irene Wilkerson, a registered nurse who currently works in a neonatal intensive care unit at Emory University.  IRENE WILKERSON, REGISTERED NURSE:  Good evening.   As you may be aware the racial gap in mortality is increasing in the U.S.  Currently, black women are dying four times the rate as white women from pregnancy related complications.  And this statistic is driving the overall rate of maternal death in America up, and has led to the U.S. being the most dangerous developed country to give birth in.   If elected, how do you plan to address this issue and keep black mothers alive?   BENNET:  Thank you for the question and thank you for being a neonatal nurse, that's an important job and --   (APPLAUSE) BENNET:  Everything that's wrong with our health care system -- and, by the way, if you are white and middle class there are many people in this country who hate our health care system because it doesn't work well for them.  Everything that's wrong with it for them is far times worse for people of color and especially for African-American women, and especially for poor people in this country, and especially for poor children of color in this country.   And I think what we have to do is increase access for everybody in the United States of America and be willing to pay for it.  And we haven't been willing to pay for it.  There are rural communities and urban communities, and many of them African-Americans in the South, some not African-American in others in parts of country, where there are -- where there is no primary care or maternity care at all.   And that's why people are dying in our country, and that's why our life expectancy is actually going down in the United States of America instead of what's happening in all these other countries of the world.  I think that it is time for us to have universal health care in the country.  We've got to reduce the cost of health care in the United States because we're spending twice as much as any other industrialized country in the world, but we're not covering people as you say for the most basic parts of health care that are expected as a right in other countries.  They should be a right in the United States of America no matter what color you are, and especially if you are living in one of our less privileged communities.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Senator, our next question comes from Jay Strongwater.  He's a criminal defense attorney -- Jay. JAY STRONGWATER, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Good evening, Senator. BENNET:  Good evening. STRONGWATER:  Climate change is wreaking havoc across the country.  We have flooding in Oklahoma.  We have tornados in Ohio.  In the South, we have record high temperatures.   What would you do beyond the carbon tax to reduce -- to slow or reduce the rate of rising ocean levels, loss of the ozone layer and reduction of glaciers and solar icecaps?   BENNET:  You know, there are a lot of issues tonight I hope we talk about that I care a lot about.  Dana mentioned I'd been a school superintendent.  I care a lot about our failures in education in this country right now.  I care a lot about the fact that we're not investing in infrastructure.  That we've got an economy that's not driving everybody's income up when it grows.   The one issue that's different from all those issues is climate change, because not only is it existential.  If we don't deal with it now, our children aren't going to be able to deal with it because it's going to be too late.   And that's why you hear young people all over this country, the sunrise (ph) moving on others, who are rising up saying your failures are not good enough for us.  Your excuses are not good enough for us. We need you to act urgently on climate change and that is what we need to do.   Last week -- thank you.  (APPLAUSE) BENNET:  Last week, I put out a plan, the first part of which says that, look, we have to get to a no-net no carbon by 2050, which is what the scientists say.  It invests a trillion dollars of public money to leverage another $10 trillion of private money to deal with climate change here and abroad.   You mentioned what's happening in some of our agricultural areas, (INAUDIBLE) of climate change.  It's the first climate plan that links the importance of conservation and carbon sequestration in our lands and our oceans with climate change.  It's a very important part of how we're going to solve this problem.   And it gives everybody in America an opportunity because of the way they want to buy clean energy to participate in driving climate change.  This is not just going to be driven from Washington, D.C. Everybody in America needs to take a role solving it because everybody in America and every one of our kids and every one of our grandkids are going to be affected by it if we don't.  Not going to be affected by it -- are being affected by it today.   In my state, you know, our winters are much shorter.  We've got terrible droughts.  One state away, in Iowa, the topsoil is pouring into the Gulf of Mexico because of the heavy rains that are caused by climate change.   The time to act is now, and we've got to -- we've got to make sure that this election -- I mean, look, we elected a climate denier president last time, even though most Americans agree with you and me. And we've got to make sure we construct the politics that doesn't allow that to ever happen again.  Not just this time, but ever happen again in the history of the United States.  We can't afford for that to happen.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Senator, we're going to take another quick break.  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential town hall with Senator Michael Bennet, live from Atlanta.  Stay with us.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DANA BASH, CNN MODERATOR:  Welcome back.  We're live in Atlanta with presidential candidate, Senator Michael Bennet.   Senator, I had covered you for 10 years in the Senate.  I had no idea that your mother and grandparents were Jewish and survived the Holocaust in Poland.  And I was surprised to learn that about you, and I'm just curious about how that plays into what you think as you see the rise in anti-Semitism in this country, obviously given what happened in Pittsburgh and in Poway, California.   SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It makes me deeply worried about it and especially when I know that people are forgetting the history and forgetting what the Holocaust was all about.   When I grew up all of that was very present in my house.  As you said my mom and parents were Polish Jews.  They survived the Holocaust in Poland.  They went from Warsaw -- after the wars, they lived there for two years and went to Stockholm where they spent a year, and then they went -- this is interesting in the world of Donald Trump -- they went to Mexico City who was willing to take them in.  And then after spending a year there, made it to New York where they could rebuild their shattered lives in the only country that they could.   And my grandparents to this day -- and I live in a state with a lot of immigrants -- to this day, my grandparents had the strongest accents of anybody I have ever known.  And they had great sadness because of what had happened to their family because of what anti-Semitism had done to them.  And -- but they also at the same time had sheer joy of what it meant to be an American citizen, unadulterated joy, a daily joy about being an American. And part of being an American was knowing you lived in a place where something like anti-Semitism would not be allowed to rear its ugly head.  And once you got here, you were an American.  No matter what your religion was, no matter where your parents -- your parents came from, no matter what language you spoke.   And that is who we have been over generations.  And I think we can't allow President Trump's bizarre view of all that color our pride in what we are as a country, a pluralistic place that accepts everybody. And that is (INAUDIBLE) --  (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Let's get back to the audience.  BENNET:  By the way, it's also troubling, Dana, to know that in a lot of European countries, there's a rise of anti-Semitism too that also tends to track these autocratic regimes that are trying to overtake democracies in those places as well.  These things often go hand in hand.   BASH:  Uh-huh. Let's get back to the audience.  Brian Coleman works in health care I.T., also worked for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.   BRIAN COLEMAN, WORKS IN HEALTHCARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY:  Hi, Senator.   BENNET:  Hi.   COLEMAN:  Men like me have been increasingly killed in the last decade.  There are systemic problems in our police departments across the nation.  Cellphones have begun shining a light on these issues.   However, how will you manifest a change in our police department culture in this nation?   BENNET:  I thank you very much for the question.  And by the way, thanks for working for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   (APPLAUSE) BENNET:  In the old days, after I was in the private sector and before I was a school superintendent, I went to work for the city and county of Denver for a guy named John Hickenlooper, I don't know whatever happened to that guy.   (LAUGHTER) BENNET:  He was a terrible boss -- he wasn't a terrible boss.   And the first thing we encountered really when he was taking office is a young man named Paul Childs had been shot in Denver by the police department under circumstances that should never have happened.  And as a result of that, I worked for a year and a half to completely redo the police oversight system in the city and county of Denver on John's authority, it should be said.  And what that took was 18 months of community meetings in Denver,  very, very tough community meetings that I often hosted in the community but also in the city and county building to make sure we were working through the process in a way that we create not just oversight but a new kind of trust and accountability between the community and the police department.   Since that time, that was before there's digital cameras and what they have revealed that the community always knew was happening but that the police department often said wasn't happening, or the broader America believed wasn't happening.  We now know that it is.   And that's why Black Lives Matter has been so important.  That's why the people that have filmed these altercations and these incidents are so important.  And that's why it is so important for us to embrace each other as Americans.   We need to have fundamental trust in each other, and I think the only way we can build that is by spending time with each other, not just when something goes wrong but in the periods in between stuff going wrong so that when it does, we know how to fix it and correct it.   And when I'm president of the United States, I can assure you the Justice Department is going to take seriously every single complaint that comes from every single community where somebody has been treated unfairly because of the color of their skin.  That's something we have to end in the United States of America.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Senator, our next audience question comes from Margaret Thomson, a student at High Point University studying political science.   BENNET:  Hi.  I didn't hear your name.  I'm sorry. MARGARET THOMSON, STUDENT, HIGH POINT UNIVERSITY:  Margaret Thomson. BENNET:  Hi. THOMSON:  Hi.   So according to ""The Washington Post"", two in three Americans say public schoolteachers are underpaid.  How are you going to increase teacher pay and the equality of education at schools across the country?   BENNET:  Thank you very much for the question.   As Dana mentioned, I spent five years privileged in working for the children and teachers and principals of the Denver public schools as their superintendent.  It is -- it will be the best job I've ever had, the most rewarding job we -- I have ever had.   There are many challenges with our education system.  One of them is we're not remotely paying teachers what they need to be paid in this country.  We're not going to be able to solve that problem only from Washington, D.C.   We're going to need national leadership from Washington, D.C., but we need D.C., states and school districts working together to finally decide that we're going to move past a system of compensating teachers that actually was developed and belonged when we had a labor market that discriminated against women and said, your only choice was being a teacher and being a nurse, so we're not going to pay you anything.   And that's still the system we have today.  And so we've got to change that system.  And we have to pay teachers as the professionals that they are.  And that's not just a little bit more.  That is a lot more. And I think we can do that as a country if we're willing to take on that challenge.   Can I say something about public education generally?   BASH:  Go for it.   BENNET:  You know, listen, there was a time in America after World War II when public education was the wind at our back.   There was a time when we had decided that we were going to have universal high school.  We hadn't had it before.   There was a time that we decided we were going to have the G.I. bill and give a whole bunch of people the opportunity to go to college who never had it before.   And now, it was 20 years or so before we finally started letting women go to college, and that changed our economy forever.  And that created the economic growth that we had after World War II.   Today, I'm sad to say this, but because of our insufficient support for our schools, not just payment for teachers, but the fact that kids in this country that should have preschool, have no preschool in America, that all over America, there are cities where there's not a single K-12 school that any senator would send their kid to.   And to go to college, you've got to bankrupt your family.  And if you don't go to college, you're one -- which is 70 percent of the people that graduate in high school, we have absolutely nothing in place that will train you to make this instead of a minimum wage.  We can fix all that.   But today, our education system is instead of liberating people from their economic circumstances is actually -- is actually making worse the income inequality that we have.  It's -- and we've got to change that.   I don't think we can change our economy without changing our commitment to public education in this country.  We need to make it a 21st century offering to our kids and our grandkids, not a 19th century offering, which is what they have today.  And I think we can do it. (APPLAUSE) DANA BASH, CNN HOST, TOWN HALL:  Senator, thank you.  We're going to take another quick break.  Stick around.  A lot more of CNN's Democratic PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL, live from Atlanta, right after this.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) BASH:  We're live in Atlanta with a PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL with candidate Senator Michael Bennet.  I want to get right to the audience, Senator.  And this question comes from Christian Hartley, president of the Young Democrats Chapter at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia.  He also works for a political communications company -- Christian.  CHRISTIAN HARTLEY, STUDENT, MERCER UNIVERSITY:  Senator Bennet, in 2008 -- BENNET:  Do you have a resume with you?  (LAUGHTER) HARTLEY:  No, not on me.   BENNET:  All right.  Well, I'll let you know where to find me (ph).  HARTLEY:  In 2018, you were criticized for supporting a bill that would weaken oversight of the banking industry, an act that critics said could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.  How do you defend your past record of supporting the deregulation of big banks?  BENNET:  Thank you very much for the question.  I was criticized for that, you're right.  And I took the right vote.  It was the right vote for my state, and the right vote for the country.  Both Dodd and Frank said that the attacks on -- the claimed attacks on Dodd-Frank were false.  It didn't matter to other Democrats, they (ph) were attacking Democrats on this.  But they were.  And the reason I supported the bill was that small banks and small credit unions in my state, which are very important to serving rural communities in Colorado, had trouble keeping up with the regulatory requirements of Dodd-Frank.   And for years, they had pointed out to me that they hadn't caused the financial crisis, which is true.  And I said to them, ""When I have a chance to help fix that in a bipartisan way, I will.""  Because we lost 40 percent of the bank headquarters in Colorado as a result, partly, of those regulations.  That is why I voted for the bill.  I kept my word, and I believe I did the right thing.  Thank you for the question.  BASH:  We're going to go to another audience question, Deb Dahlmann who runs her own packaging consulting business -- Deb.  DEB DAHLMANN, BUSINESS OWNER:  Good evening, Senator.  For the past two years, our country has been jerked around like a wagon being towed down a bumpy dirt road -- (CROSSTALK) DAHLMANN:  -- behind an angry toddler on a tricycle.  We seem -- BENNET:  I don't know (ph) what you mean.  (LAUGHTER) DAHLMANN:  We seem to be in danger of losing our place as the leader of the free world.  If you are elected, who would be the recipients of your first three official phone calls?  And what would be your message?  BENNET:  I think that's a great question.  I think I would call our allies in Europe and say that we are open for business once again. Because we know how important this alliance is to -- to freedom in the world and to all of us since World War II.  It's not a Republican or Democratic president that hasn't made a call like that.  I would make a call like that.  I would call the prime minister of Israel, and remind them that our relationship is strong.  And that even when we're critical of one another, we have a particularly important relationship for the reasons that Dana and I were talking about earlier.  And then I would call the heads of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.  And I would invite them to Washington or I would go there and say, ""We need to help you solve the problems in your country so that we can end the kind of refugee crisis that's led to the American government, in the name of the American people, separating children from their families at the border of the United States of America. That should never happen again, and never can happen again."" Those are the calls I would make.  (APPLAUSE) BASH:  And, Senator, what about Vladimir Putin?  What about Vladimir Putin?  BENNET:  Well, I'd call Vladimir Putin.  But he probably wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be one of my first three calls, I don't think.  BASH:  And what would you say when you made that call?   BENNET:  I'd call Xi, too.  I'd call Xi, too.  And I'd say, ""Look, let's figure out a way to reorient our relationship here.""  I think Donald Trump actually has been right to call out China.  I think he's done it in completely the wrong way.   And I think we have an incredible opportunity to create alliances all over the world, from Europe through Asia to Latin America and to Africa, to push back on China's mercantilist practices and benefit workers here in the United States and throughout the rest of the world.  China is running on the law of big numbers.  And it seems to me that our answer there is to not go it alone.  Our answer is to build coalitions all over the world, to push back in a measured and thoughtful way.  And that's not what we've had from this president.  BASH:  And what about when you made that phone call eventually to Vladimir Putin, what would you say?  BENNET:  I think what I'd say to him is, ""We -- unlike the previous president -- we know you've been attacking the United States of America.  You've been attacking our democracy and democracies in Europe through social media.  And we need it to stop.  And if they're -- and if you're not going to stop, there's going to be a price to pay."" BASH:  Which is?  BENNET:  Which is to sanction them and to create real economic harm for them.  BASH:  All right.  So while we're at it, last one is Kim Jong Un. Would he be on your call sheet?  BENNET:  He wouldn't be on my call sheet because I don't think the president of the United States should call Kim Jong Un until the work is done to set up a negotiation that makes sense.  And Donald Trump has done exactly the opposite.  So I think it would be important not to send a message from America that we condone the behavior of that regime.  President Trump keeps saying, over and over again, that he somehow has the economic interests of his country at heart.  And that's why he's never going to do anything crazy.  In fact, he said that's why I'm in love with the leader of North Korea and that Americans can sleep at night. What we know is the North Koreans haven't changed anything that they've been doing for the last 20 years, and they're not going to change it unless they know that there's an American president who's going to rally the world against them, and I think that's what we need to do. BASH:  OK, Senator.  We're going to sneak in one more quick break. Don't go anywhere.  CNN's Democratic Presidential Town Hall with Michael Bennet coming up just in a few moments. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Welcome back.  We're live in Atlanta with presidential candidate, Senator Michael Bennet.   Getting straight to the audience, our question comes from Cindy Moffett.  She's an assistant principal for Gwinnett County Public Schools.  Cindy? CINDY MOFFETT, AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Good evening, Senator.   BENNET:  Good evening, Cindy. MOFFETT:  Given that President Trump is an unorthodox candidate, what would be some key actions or strategies that your campaign is planning in order to defeat him, especially since he seems to have a base that sticks beside him no matter what he or his administration does?  BENNET:  So thank you, Cindy, so you so much for the question.  Thank you for being an educator and an assistant principal with (inaudible). (APPLAUSE)  I'd like to use this as an opportunity, since actually you are an educator, to talk about why I'm running and why I think I can beat Donald Trump.  I mentioned my daughter, Anne (ph) tonight who, and I made a joke that she didn't want me around, but the truth is the reason she's not here is this is her last day of school.  And like students all over the country, she's working hard to try to end the school year in a strong way.  And like students throughout the country, she's trying to learn math or English or AP biology or whatever, geography, (inaudible), whatever it happens to be.  And that is their job.  That's their job.  And by the way, some of the students - and you know this - some of the students are in schools where there is no broadband because they live in a rural community.  Some of the students are in urban school districts where the roof leaks or there are 35 kids in a classroom or the boiler is broken, and every day they show up to do their work. Every day.  We live in a country where when kids are in the fourth grade in this country, only 34 percent of the kids are proficient mathematicians in the fourth grade.  Forty percent -- I guess 34 percent are proficient readers.  Forty percent are proficient mathematicians.  I lost Cindy. She knows these numbers. But still they come back to work and work and work because that's their job.  They do not have time to create universal health care in America.  They do not have time to fix our broken immigration system. They do not have time to deal with climate, to make sure the planet's not incinerated before they occupy the future.  They don't have time to build an economy that works not just for the people at the very top, but for everybody.   They don't have time to make a K-12 system in this country that's actually just, where your education doesn't depend on the neighborhood that you're born into.  They don't have time to make sure college is affordable.  They don't have time to make sure that our generation starts paying its bills so that they can make the choices they should be able to make.  And as they're doing their work tonight, they're not watching this show.  As they're doing their work tonight, they're expecting us to do all of that work.  And for the last 10 years in Washington, we have done almost none of that work.   And in the case of Donald Trump, whom you mentioned, he's actually taking us backwards on every single one of those dimensions. Healthcare being the best example where he's taken away from millions of people in America, including people with pre-existing conditions.  And I believe we need to start doing that work, and that's why I'm running for president.  Because I think that we have to build a big coalition of Americans.  Democrats, Republicans and Independents to overcome the broken politics in Washington, D.C.  It will never fix itself.  It will only become more bitter and more partisan if we as a country don't come together and say we demand something better.  And we are going to create this big constituency for change, a coalition that spans the parties to make it better.  And I think if we do that, we can not only beat Donald Trump, we can fix our broken politics in Washington and we can leave our kids in this honorable country, a future that we can be proud of.  That's what's at stake in this election.  That's why I'm running, and that's why I think I can beat Donald Trump.  (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Senator, thank you so much.  Thank you for joining us tonight. Thank you for watching at home, our studio audience here at the CNN Center in Atlanta.  Tune in this Sunday for back-to-back-to-back Democratic Presidential Town Halls with Congressman Seth Moulton, Tim Ryan and Eric Swalwell starting at 6 p.m. Eastern.

@benshapiro Ben Shapiro is host of ""The Ben Shapiro Show"" and editor emeritus of The Daily Wire. A graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, he is The New York Times bestselling author of ""How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps."" This week, Parkland survivor Kyle Kashuv announced that Harvard University has withdrawn his acceptance to the college. In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the then-high school junior became a prominent voice for school safety, meeting with politicians across the political spectrum. He was also a prominent defender of Second Amendment rights. After scoring 1550 on his SATs and graduating second in his class, Kashuv was admitted to Harvard, turning down scholarship money at other schools to do so. Then came the tsunami. Former classmates who oppose Kashuv’s politics revealed on social media that when he was 16, months before the Parkland shooting, he typed egregious racist slurs, including the N-word, in a private Google doc. This revelation led Kashuv to immediately apologize publicly for his use of the language, which he insisted was not a reflection of racist belief but a juvenile attempt to shock his peers. He pointed to his record of public-facing accomplishment and pledged to learn from his mistakes. He issued an apology to Harvard, taking full responsibility for his comments; he reached out to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to see what steps he could take to assure them that he had changed. No matter. Harvard’s admissions committee decided to withdraw his acceptance. There are several lessons here—all of them bad for the country. First, grace is no longer an aspect of American life—at least for one side of the aisle. Kashuv has been in the public eye for a year and a half. In that time, he has acted with remarkable poise, as have many others in his class. The fact that he participated in an idiotic and disgusting private group chat months before the Parkland shooting has had apparently no effect on his public behavior. If the new standard is that past private statements, once surfaced, override all public behavior since—including apologies, evidence of decency, and willingness to evidence repentance—we are entering a dangerous new era. Is Harvard prepared for dredging up every incoming first year’s Twitter direct messages for scrutiny? But that won’t be the standard, obviously. The commentariat calling for Kashuv’s expulsion was loudly decrying Harvard for having barred Michelle Jones, who killed her own 4-year-old, just two years ago. The problem for Kashuv is that he is conservative; the old racist slurs were merely a means of damaging him. There is little question that were pro-gun control David Hogg the Parkland survivor at issue rather than Kashuv, a little more grace might have been applied here. Second, public life comes with inherent risks and thus should be avoided by rational actors. Kashuv would have been admitted to Harvard if he had never engaged in activism: He scored a 1550 on his SAT and graduated second in his class. No one on the radical left or alt-right would have tried to destroy his academic career; no one would have bothered. Kashuv dared to speak up politically and thus became a target. Rational actors will take note and stay away from the public square, leaving that square to the most shameless and the most enigmatic. Third, Harvard has become an institution not for education but for capitulation to the mob. Forget Kashuv for a second. Focus instead on Harvard Law School professor Ronald Sullivan, a political liberal who was tossed as dean of a residential house for the grave sin of acting as a defense attorney on Harvey Weinstein’s team. Cross Harvard’s most radical students or the wokescolds on social media and the administration will capitulate in short order. Kashuv will be fine. He’ll move on, go to another school, mature, and grow. But Harvard won’t be a part of that process. The social media mob was motivated not by a desire to purify by our politics—after all, Ralph Northam is still governor of Virginia—but by a desire to damage the Parkland student it just didn’t like.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Hargitay said, ""No, I have not talked to her. She did resign from my board."" Fairstein was on the board of Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation, which assists survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse. In an op-ed last week in The Wall Street Journal, Fairstein condemned how she is portrayed in the Netflix series ""When They See Us."" Directed by Ava DuVernay, it tells of the wrongful conviction of five black and Latino teenagers for the 1989 assault on a white female jogger in Central Park. Fairstein, who headed Manhattan's sex crimes unit at the time, has long been criticized for her role in the suspects' interrogation in the racially divisive case. The teens said their confessions were coerced and their convictions were overturned in 2002 after convicted murderer and serial rapist Matias Reyes confessed to committing the crime alone, and his DNA was linked to it. Fairstein would go on to become a best-selling author of mystery novels. Fallout from the Netflix show has led to her being dropped by her book publisher, Dutton. Fairstein also resigned as a Board of Trustees member at Vassar College and from the victims-services agency, Safe Horizon. Hargitay spoke about Fairstein last Friday while promoting the documentary ""Emmanuel,"" about the mass shooting that killed nine black worshippers in Charleston, South Carolina four years ago. Hargitay is the co-producer of the film. When asked about her relationship with Fairstein, Hargitay said she's ""known (Linda) for a long time"" and was introduced to her by ""Law & Order"" creator Dick Wolf. In an op-ed for USA Today last year, Fairstein wrote that she inspired ""Law and Order: SVU."" ""Twenty years ago, while I was still leading what is now known as the Special Victims Unit, I had a call from Dick Wolf, creator of the Law and Order television series. He was in pre-production of a spinoff that he called 'Law and Order: SVU.' He wasn't asking me to be part of his team, but he was hoping I would spend time with two of his leading actors — Mariska Hargitay and Stephanie March — to explain our work,"" Fairstein wrote. ""Not only did I enjoy that opportunity, but it was the start of two friendships I cherish to this day."" When asked if she trained with Fairstein for ""Law & Order: SVU,"" Hargitay said: ""Not trained, I met Linda. Dick introduced me to her. I think Stephanie March did because she was playing the ADA (assistant district attorney)."" ""When They See Us,"" a four-episode series, debuted on Netflix late last month. Hargitay said she's begun watching it. ""I just started it — 15 minutes in,"" she said. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2019-06-19 12:20:00,'Law and Order' star Mariska Hargitay says she hasn't been in touch with Linda Fairstein,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider
387,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5waqd/games-have-always-tried-to-whitewash-nazis-as-just-german-soldiers,"There was something very familiar about EA’s botched roll-out of a premium Battlefield V character skin a few weeks ago, where the company slapped the name of a significant anti-Nazi resistance member onto a laughably overdone German super-soldier. Even as it apologized for using a completely inappropriate name for the character, EA attempted to clarify that he was definitely not a Nazi, but just a German soldier. It was further evidence, if any were needed, that EA and DICE are ill-equipped to deal with the historical context of their own game. They're hardly alone. In the weeks since the tempest-in-a-teapot around a set of DLC characters, we've seen further evidence of the extent of militant, officially sanctioned white supremacy, the ongoing affinity modern white supremacist fascists have for the symbolism of the Third Reich, and we've also seen how much mainstream cultural discourse struggles to comprehend that connection. A man recently accused of planning a mass shooting at a synagogue stated his wish to carry it out in a ""Nazi uniform."" The place he made those threats? Steam. The issues with responsibly depicting German combat forces in World War 2, and their connections to Nazi crimes against humanity, are well-known at this point and have been a point of increasing discussion and debate among historical hobby gamers for years. EA’s flagship shooter might be on the cutting edge of mainstream video gaming, but its naive politics are years behind the state of historical research. The argument that a character fought bravely and heroically for Germany, but not the Nazis, isn’t just naive, but it’s one that was aggressively promulgated by German war criminals themselves. In the years following the Nuremberg trials, there was an increasingly concerted effort to whitewash the record of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of the Third Reich. As a brief peace transformed into Cold War, and the Soviet Union became the new enemy of the United States and its European allies, NATO leadership sought both to rearm the Federal Republic of Germany as an anti-Communist breastwork in central Europe, and to bring German officers back into the respectable professional fold so that NATO militaries could learn from their experiences fighting the Red Army. It was cynical, self-interested, and perhaps irrevocably distorted the historical record of the Wehrmacht even as World War 2 historiography was taking shape. This had a major spillover into popular culture, and perhaps one of the best books on this is The Myth of the Eastern Front by Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies. It details how German officers released self-exculpatory memoirs, how their colleagues in Allied militaries lent their names and prestige to mainstreaming German commanders like Heinz Guderian and Erich von Manstein. But it also details how those memoirs and their ideological bent informed the nascent field of tabletop wargaming. There are two major tenets to the whitewashing of the Wehrmacht, one more reprehensible than the other. The first and worst is that the Wehrmacht was by and large the German army but was never a Nazi army, and did not participate in the crimes against humanity that was the bedrock of Nazi governance and expansion. This was false: Particularly on the Eastern Front, the Wehrmacht worked fist-in-glove with the SS to round up and exterminate Soviet Jews, Romani, and other groups the Nazis systematically persecuted and murdered. Whatever the different experiences and actions of the millions of soldiers (volunteer and conscript) who served in the Wehrmacht, the institution of the Wehrmacht was both complicit and participant in Nazi atrocities on a wide scale. The second tenet is that the Wehrmacht was, in a word, awesome. The German commanders’ position after World War 2 was not unlike that of Confederate generals after the Civil War. They had fought hard and well and still lost in service to a disgraceful cause, but they sought to deny that they were ever beaten. This wasn’t just about pride, but also about regaining respect. What they had been a part of was irredeemable, if they could just change the subject to professional skill, they could rehabilitate themselves as admirable professionals. The position of senior German commanders, in particular, was that the real wellspring of German defeat was Hitler himself, with his amateurish meddling in the masterful workings of his professional officer corps. This narrative also allowed them to highlight their own deviations from the Nazi party line, turning debates about means into something like opposition. But what they opposed most vehemently were things like his refusal to allow German forces to withdraw from dangerous positions, or his insistence on keeping personal control of reserve troops rather than releasing them to officers in the field. Trying to distance themselves postwar from the workings of a monstrous, genocidal regime in which they had been highly placed, the surviving leadership of the Wehrmacht said in their defense that they had always thought their boss was an asshole. This portrayal invites sympathy. On the battlefields of the 1940s, the Germans often do come across as underdogs facing vastly more numerous opponents with bottomless reserves of equipment. Certainly by 1944, the Soviet armies could easily be depicted as a rolling tide of steel and fire, while US forces were the personification of the country’s wealth and industrial capacity. It is very easy to look at these odds and reach the conclusion that the story of the Wehrmacht is the story of a skilled few versus an onslaught of enemy soldiers and war machines. Which is where games come in. Most wargames aren’t quite that lopsided (they wouldn’t be interesting if they were) but it’s long been the case that the Germans are presented as, if not the heroes of World War 2 gaming, then at least the protagonists. The box for Avalon Hill’s Squad Leader depicts German troops beginning an assault, while the flavor text on the background captures a brief narrative around the death of a veteran German squad in Russia. The cover of Across the Rhine depicts triumphant panzers leaving fire and flames in their wake. Again and again, players are invited to imagine themselves as German troops, and not any of the people who defeated them. But even if people noticed how odd this was, the topic lacked any sense of moral urgency. Nazis were evil, they were also largely dead. These games were about history, not dreams or wishes. A curious debate unfolded around 2010 about whether the color of the counters in a new wargame expansion ended up glorifying the Waffen-SS, the specially-picked and equipped German units that reported directly to the Nazi leadership and which were notorious both for their fanatical Nazism and their inhumane conduct. The entire discussion occurred in one of the more niche communities in wargames (I've linked Mark Pitcavage’s blog, who is not an unbiased observer, but you can see traces of the debate in other forums). Advanced Squad Leader is an almost comically detailed wargaming system, and to be an ASL player is generally to embrace a lot of weird obsessions. But with the release of a module for the game called A Bridge Too Far, the game’s publisher Multi-Man, depicted Waffen-SS units on black cardboard counters with white icons and numbers. It was a throwback to an earlier edition of Squad Leader, before the series depicted the SS units in blue as opposed to black. This debate is instructive because it’s so abstract, yet so familiar, and it happened within a community that tends to view its hobby as historical yet profoundly apolitical. The black counter is a Rorsach test that reveals something about the beholder. You had critics of the representation who saw it as both glamorizing the prowess of the thoroughly Nazified Waffen-SS units (they were elite units subject to special rules, but other nation’s elite formations were not similarly distinguished) and making them just look, well, cool. ASL is a game of drab counters on green and brown hexagons, and the SS units are in bold black-and-white. A breed apart. But there were those who felt that the entire controversy was absurd. First, the depiction itself could be as easily read as a reference to the SS units’ infamy and second, it was just a game and not even the whole game but a single counter set in a game about World War 2. The notion that something so minor could be read as pro-Nazi was a stretch. A screenshot of a reseller's listing for vintage black SS counters Not an unreasonable response, but there’s a more vehement version that also popped-up. People raising the question of the black counters were themselves pursuing a political or ideological agenda. It was in itself an invasion by “PC culture” of the wargaming space, with all its scolding, its guilt, its self-righteousness, and its assertion of ambiguity and implicit meaning into a delineated space of abstract simulation. Somehow, the World War 2 shooter largely sidestepped this debate, or the games discourse tended not to have these debates as this genre came of age. But I think there was something else at work: in Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, the Germans were the enemies. These games pulled liberally from Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan but also from action movies like The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen. They had a politics, but not a politics that was interested in the Nazis or what the Third Reich stood for. In multiplayer, the Germans and Allies were largely two different teams fighting over objectives, but there was little interest in the Wehrmacht soldier except as an avatar wearing field gray and using a particular assortment of weapons. Battlefield V is at once a part of this tradition and a break with it, but it also arrived at a very different political, cultural, and commercial moment. It still works within that familiar conceit of Team Axis versus Team Allies, rendering World War 2 once again as an exercise in tactics and skill. But the game arrives at a moment when white supremacy is once again growing in influence and power, its adherents more openly identify with historical fascist movements, and their violence moves from rhetorical to physical. With the Wilhelm Franke character, EA demonstrated first that it's being careless and second that it's not even sure of what the issues are. It’s not hard to understand how this happened. After all, Battlefield V is only kind-of, sort-of about World War 2. It’s a period military fantasy, so divorced from the historical record that it’d be easy to think it’s safely beyond the politics of history. When I reviewed it last fall I noted how much the game seemed simply to be playing dress-up in World War 2 costumes: It’s never certain whether it’s a game about World War 2, or a series of World War 2-themed playing fields. So on the one hand you have voiceover and mission text explaining how the Germans bombed Rotterdam to force a Dutch surrender. On the other hand, as the German team flying into an airborne drop over Rotterdam, you’ll get a generic paratrooper sequence: You’re in a transport plane with a multi-ethnic group of troopers in a random mix of national uniforms, with a jumpmaster yelling at you in German as you hook onto the line in preparation to take the leap into the combat zone. When you land, you’ll be surrounded by men and women fighting for your side, all of whom are carrying whatever is their favorite, class-locked (but nationality neutral) weapon for this battle. Germans wade into battle with American M1 rifles, British medics slap fresh magazines into their Maschinenpistole 40s. Everyone is empowered to be the Fallschirmjäger of their dreams. Costumes are dangerous though, because once a game throws away most historical plausibility, it’s serving to highlight and empower the fantasies it wants to indulge. Separating imagery and events from historical context is exactly how whitewashing happens. But costumes are also a useful, easy thing for publishers to sell. Because they can look cool, and you can sell them to people or use them as a hook to keep people playing your game. So we get a character like the soon-to-be-renamed Wilhelm Franke who we are told is “not a Nazi, but a German solider similar to ones we already have in the game. In Battlefield V, we’re not making any political statements in relation to the real life events of WW2 and there are no swastikas in the game.” The character has no inner life, so the question of whether this avatar “is a Nazi” is pretty much moot. He’s wearing a pretty standard Wehrmacht tunic, though his greatcoat sure isn’t standard issue and it immediately designates him as somewhat different from his fellow soldiers. But what really sets him apart is that he is a ruthlessly efficient killer, practically a combat superhero compared to the Allied redshirts he dispatches and watches bleed-out on the ground. He is the German soldier at his most mythologized. That mythology is tough to separate from Nazism, because the valorization and elevation of the German warrior was part and parcel of the party’s imagery and propaganda. If you have made a Wehrmacht character that typifies badass skill and a cool, heroic aesthetic, then you have also created a character that would fit neatly into Nazi propaganda. You don’t have to create super-warriors like Franke to make a World War 2 shooter. The solution that Red Orchestra 2 arrived at in its detailed treatment of Eastern Front combat was to frame the war as a terrifying nightmare. The German troops you played were exhausted and scared soldiers at the ragged edge of a combat that had taken them a thousand miles from home. They flinched under fire, and their barks were generally pathetic as they pleaded for water and bemoaned their desperate conditions. Red Orchestra 2 screenshot courtesy of Tripwire This is of course a very straightforward kind of “war is hell” depiction whose implicit politics are that soldiers are sympathetic victims of war’s cruelty, but not its authors. Depictions like this are orders of magnitude less reckless than painting German soldiers as skilled, brilliant badasses gunning down lesser warriors, but they also serve to elevate the Soldier above and apart from the Cause. As Heather Alexandra pointed out when writing about BFV’s German campaign, it ended up being: a romanticized tale about Nazi guilt conveniently dawning when defeat finally rears its head. The Last Tiger is one of Battlefield V’s most exciting and thematically focused story missions, but it is a story that is painting a mythology that is still coopted by bad-faith actors and used today to justify gross injustice. The Last Tiger certainly doesn’t like Nazis but it still wants you to to appreciate their bravery. Whatever condemnation it offers is washed away by its flattening valorization of any and all forms of soldiery. Heather juxtaposed this story with that of concentration camp survivors, and other victims of Nazi war crimes. These stories are more important than that of the Good Germans Who Were Awesome at War. Yet it is always to the war that we return, narrowing our focus until high command disappears, the labor camps and death camps disappear, the Einsatzgruppen, the mass graves, the executions, all the other things that make this particular history a horror show vanish and we are left to wage our battles in peace. We’re not going to stop making and playing World War 2 games. For whatever reason, there are countless people (myself included) who are endlessly drawn to revisiting and refighting its battles. But that narrow framing of the history, that exclusion of all the crimes and murders that surrounded the actual fighting on the front lines, serves things beyond the purity of game design. It burnishes and reinforces myths, it divorces warfare from politics, it elevates the soldier—no matter what they serve or advance—as a kind of secular hero. And it gives cover for the idea that there was something admirable and heroic about waging war for Nazi Germany. We have to bring this context and perspective ourselves, because games rarely try and even more rarely succeed. Even allowing for that, however, Battlefield V has been striking in its carelessness, revealing itself at last to be a game about World War 2 that's mostly interested in making sure the Wehrmacht looks cool. Cool enough to sell loving tributes to them to whoever is willing to buy. Have thoughts? Swing by the Waypoint forums to share them!

By EJ Montini If we had been talking about any other young person besides Kyle Kashuv having his admission to Harvard rescinded we &mldr wouldn’t be talking about it. It would not be an issue. At all. Universities like Harvard have thousands of qualified kids applying for entry every year. I’m guessing they’d have no problem finding one as qualified as Kashuv who did not spew a bunch of racist screeds when he was 16. And, by the way, isn’t 16 old enough to know that racist screeds are, you know, racist? Kashuv is “news” only because he’s a darling of some conservatives, including the National Rifle Association, at whose gathering he has spoken. He got to speak there because Kashuv is a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting who, unlike many of his fellow students, is a pro-gun advocate. So now there are those coming forward to say Harvard is dumping Kashuv for youthful indiscretions for which he has apologized. Talker: It's about time we listened to Trump supporters' warnings about Mexico: Today's talker It’s good that he apologized — after being outed. But, again, at an elite institution like Harvard, there are many, many qualified applicants who did not spew racial screeds as 16-year-olds. And if it were any other applicant being dumped, we would have no problem with it. On Twitter Kashuv said, ""We were 16-year-olds making idiotic comments, using callous and inflammatory language in an effort to be as extreme and shocking as possible.” On one of the screenshots released by students who know Kashuv has him writing the N-word more than a dozen times and saying, ""like im really good at typing ------ ok like practice uhhhhhh makes perfect son??!!"" In another online conversation, he says another student prefers dating “------jocks.” Should the use of such racial slurs ruin Kashuv’s life or brand him forever? No. Should it keep him out of Harvard? Yes. I’d guess that any number of applicants to universities like Harvard are rejected or have their admissions rescinded because of something stupid they’ve said on social media. We all have flaws. We all say dumb things on occasion. College admissions are competitive. What can separate someone who gets into Harvard from someone who doesn’t may very well be what was said online at 16. And if it were anyone else, we wouldn’t be giving it a second thought. E.J. Montini is a news columnist for The Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared. Follow him on Twitter: @ejmontini Monica Hesse,  The Washington Post: ""I’m still at a loss about what to do with a situation like Kyle Kashuv’s. And not in some what-is-the-meaning-of-redemption way. But practically speaking: Unless we seal them all in a cave, people who do bad (but not illegal) things are going to continue to be part of our society. What do we think that should look like? What is your personal vision?"" David Brooks,  The New York Times: ""These days, many people seem to think that the way to prove virtue is by denouncing and shunning, not through mercy and rigorous forgiveness. Harvard could have but didn’t take the truth-and-reconciliation approach — confronting the outrage, but trying to use it to get to a deeper eventual embrace. It’s hard to know if Kashuv has learned from his repulsive comments, but if he had, wouldn’t Harvard want a kid who is intellectually rigorous and morally humble? Wouldn’t it want a student who could lend a hand to all the perfect résumé children who may not have yet committed a disgrace, but who will?"" Arwa Mahdawi,  The Guardian: ""The right is obsessed with lecturing liberals on personal responsibility. However, as their response to the Kashuv situation demonstrates, they are not so keen on taking personal responsibility themselves. Actions have consequences, as Kashuv is finding out. He may not be going to Harvard in 2023, but the university is already teaching him a valuable lesson."" I keep hearing “he was 16” as some excuse, as if it happened 20 years ago. But he’s 18 now. His “explanation” was a spin and damage control. — Eric Scoggins I’ve been going back and forth on this — on the one hand, a 16-year-old kid competing with friends to see who can be the most vile is bound to get ugly. On the other hand, this kid needs to understand that his actions have consequences. — Tricia Dillon It's punishment because they had already agreed to accept him. At that point, he had already turned down other offers from other schools and the deadline closed. Pretty raw deal. — J.I. Walkup Sadly, Kyle doesn’t seem to get it, even now. He’s sorry he got caught, not that he said what he said. Words have consequences.

Alex Wong/Getty Images A conspiracy is afoot. And Alex Jones is at it once again. To recap: The InfoWars host is being sued by the families of Sandy Hook for saying the 2012 shooting massacre, that claimed 27 victims, never really happened.
Well, it did.
And Jones, a man who President Donald Trump once gushed praise (“Your reputation is amazing”), is in a hot mess of trouble. Jones’ empire of paranoia is crumbling, and he’s facing some serious legal charges.
SEE ALSO: Alex Jones’ Origin Story—On Public Access, His Act Was Never an Act
On Tuesday, Jones’ was accused of threatening Chris Mattei, the lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families. Taking a page out of the stupid handbook, on Friday’s InfoWars show, Jones punched a picture of the Sandy Hook attorney and called him a “pimp.”
Great move, Einstein.
In turn, Bridgeport Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis called the conspiracy nut’s maneuver on his broadcast “indefensible” and “possibly criminal behavior.”
As we saw back in March, during Jones’ testimony, he blamed his actions on a form of psychosis that made him think that the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a hoax.

We know Jones’ origin story. We know he was merely saying whatever popped into his thick head at that very moment—to get him through the immediate situation.
Jones now no longer questions whether Sandy Hook was a “false flag” or not. Now, he has a new conspiracy theory. Jones is trumpeting that the Sandy Hook lawsuit brought against him is part of a vast left-wing conspiracy. On his show, Jones blamed “the Democratic party operatives that handle and manage all of those poor families and use their grief to inflict wounds on Connecticut every day.”
Further, the families’ lawyers have accused Jones of sending them child pornography. In a motion filed this week, the families’ attorneys said that the FBI was contacted when they found “numerous additional illegal images” in the case documents, which had apparently been sent to InfoWars email addresses. 
Of course Jones framed the child porn scenario as a conspiracy against him by the Sandy Hook lawyers. In fact, the exact words he spewed on The Alex Jones Show were:
You’re trying to set me up with child porn. One million dollars, you little gang members. One million dollars to put your head on a pike. One million dollars, bitch. I’m going to get your ass, you understand me now?
Jones could also take the defense that he didn’t send the child porn but say it was the work of his fans—the same defense that Charles Manson used—passing the blame to his followers. I mean, these were the same fans who saw it was their mission to follow Jones’ lead and harass the families of Sandy Hook victims.
In Jones’ case, he knows that with great power comes great irresponsibility.
Last August, when Jones’ content was removed from Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube for hate speech, he urged fans to rise up against anti-Trump “sociopaths”—who he blamed for the removal of his InfoWars programming. He was banned from Twitter for violating its policy of harassing people, while encouraging his fans to do the same.
“We knew this was coming,” he told his followers. “They tried to break all the Republicans, persecute people. Trump broke through their bullying and lies. We stood beside him, and now they want to take out the press from under him, and they want to use me as the distorted poster child to do it.”
He added as a call to action: “They think you’re weak.”
These are bully tactics that Jones has long deployed to get his followers to drink his clichéd Kool-Aid. In 2018, Brennan Gilmore, a counter-protester at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, sued Jones for defamation. He said that Jones spread conspiracy theories about him that lead to swarm of digital abuse, harassment and death threats. Jones claimed that Gilmore was a CIA or “deep state” agent who helped orchestrate the violence as part of a government operation.
He wasn’t; he was simply a man who ended up garnering an endless string of harassment due to Jones’ beckoning.
Sound familiar?
Finally, let’s not forget Pizzagate. Jones promoted the theory that Hillary Clinton and her top associates were running a demonic child sex-trafficking ring inside of Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.
Jones’ cry for harassment, and fueling of the Pizzagate conspiracy, resulted in one fan marching into Comet Ping Pong with an AR-15 rifle and firing off multiple shots inside. No one was killed in that scenario, and the man was arrested.
But yet, once again, one of Alex Jones’ soldiers did the work for him.
In the Sandy Hook case, a proposed trial date is set for November 2020. How much harassment will be done by Jones’ fans before then? Well, it did.

In 2018, Brennan Gilmore, a counter-protester at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, sued Jones for defamation. He said that Jones spread conspiracy theories about him that lead to swarm of digital abuse, harassment and death threats. Jones claimed that Gilmore was a CIA or “deep state” agent who helped orchestrate the violence as part of a government operation.
He wasn’t; he was simply a man who ended up garnering an endless string of harassment due to Jones’ beckoning.
Sound familiar?
Finally, let’s not forget Pizzagate. Jones promoted the theory that Hillary Clinton and her top associates were running a demonic child sex-trafficking ring inside of Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.
Jones’ cry for harassment, and fueling of the Pizzagate conspiracy, resulted in one fan marching into Comet Ping Pong with an AR-15 rifle and firing off multiple shots inside. No one was killed in that scenario, and the man was arrested.
But yet, once again, one of Alex Jones’ soldiers did the work for him.
In the Sandy Hook case, a proposed trial date is set for November 2020. How much harassment will be done by Jones’ fans before then? On Tuesday, Jones’ was accused of threatening Chris Mattei, the lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families. Taking a page out of the stupid handbook, on Friday’s InfoWars show, Jones punched a picture of the Sandy Hook attorney and called him a “pimp.”
Great move, Einstein.
In turn, Bridgeport Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis called the conspiracy nut’s maneuver on his broadcast “indefensible” and “possibly criminal behavior.”
As we saw back in March, during Jones’ testimony, he blamed his actions on a form of psychosis that made him think that the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a hoax.

We know Jones’ origin story. We know he was merely saying whatever popped into his thick head at that very moment—to get him through the immediate situation.
Jones now no longer questions whether Sandy Hook was a “false flag” or not. Now, he has a new conspiracy theory. Jones is trumpeting that the Sandy Hook lawsuit brought against him is part of a vast left-wing conspiracy. On his show, Jones blamed “the Democratic party operatives that handle and manage all of those poor families and use their grief to inflict wounds on Connecticut every day.”
Further, the families’ lawyers have accused Jones of sending them child pornography. In a motion filed this week, the families’ attorneys said that the FBI was contacted when they found “numerous additional illegal images” in the case documents, which had apparently been sent to InfoWars email addresses. 
Of course Jones framed the child porn scenario as a conspiracy against him by the Sandy Hook lawyers. In fact, the exact words he spewed on The Alex Jones Show were:
You’re trying to set me up with child porn. One million dollars, you little gang members. One million dollars to put your head on a pike. One million dollars, bitch. I’m going to get your ass, you understand me now?
Jones could also take the defense that he didn’t send the child porn but say it was the work of his fans—the same defense that Charles Manson used—passing the blame to his followers. I mean, these were the same fans who saw it was their mission to follow Jones’ lead and harass the families of Sandy Hook victims.
In Jones’ case, he knows that with great power comes great irresponsibility.
Last August, when Jones’ content was removed from Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube for hate speech, he urged fans to rise up against anti-Trump “sociopaths”—who he blamed for the removal of his InfoWars programming. He was banned from Twitter for violating its policy of harassing people, while encouraging his fans to do the same.
“We knew this was coming,” he told his followers. “They tried to break all the Republicans, persecute people. Trump broke through their bullying and lies. We stood beside him, and now they want to take out the press from under him, and they want to use me as the distorted poster child to do it.”
He added as a call to action: “They think you’re weak.”

Finally, let’s not forget Pizzagate. Jones promoted the theory that Hillary Clinton and her top associates were running a demonic child sex-trafficking ring inside of Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.

But yet, once again, one of Alex Jones’ soldiers did the work for him.
In the Sandy Hook case, a proposed trial date is set for November 2020. How much harassment will be done by Jones’ fans before then? In Jones’ case, he knows that with great power comes great irresponsibility.
Last August, when Jones’ content was removed from Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube for hate speech, he urged fans to rise up against anti-Trump “sociopaths”—who he blamed for the removal of his InfoWars programming. He was banned from Twitter for violating its policy of harassing people, while encouraging his fans to do the same.
“We knew this was coming,” he told his followers. “They tried to break all the Republicans, persecute people. Trump broke through their bullying and lies. We stood beside him, and now they want to take out the press from under him, and they want to use me as the distorted poster child to do it.”
He added as a call to action: “They think you’re weak.”
These are bully tactics that Jones has long deployed to get his followers to drink his clichéd Kool-Aid. In 2018, Brennan Gilmore, a counter-protester at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, sued Jones for defamation. He said that Jones spread conspiracy theories about him that lead to swarm of digital abuse, harassment and death threats. Jones claimed that Gilmore was a CIA or “deep state” agent who helped orchestrate the violence as part of a government operation.

391,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/NAGgfiLHwwM/,"Voters are still outraged over President Trump’s post-Virginia Beach intimation that he is open to considering a suppressor ban. On June 5, Breitbart News reported Trump telling Good Morning Britain‘s Piers Morgan that he would “seriously look at” a suppressor ban. Trump’s comments came in a conversation where Morgan referred to the accessories as “silencers,” giving the impression that the accessories completely eliminate the sound of a gun shot. In reality, suppressors make the sound of a gun shot manageable, removing the ear-splitting high pitches associated with one. But they do not mute the shot. Here are seven reasons why action against suppressors is politically risky: President Trump is running for re-election as a pro-Second Amendment President. He has already banned bump stocks and he risks the loss of pro-gun voters if he goes after the suppressors they have acquired by jumping through bureaucrats’ numerous gun control hoops.

392,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/06/19/jeffco-columbine-demolish-survey/,"Trending: Jeffco Public Schools received nearly 7,000 responses to a survey about whether Columbine High School should be torn down and rebuilt, officials said Wednesday. The school district posted the survey last month, after an open letter from Superintendent Jason Glass said officials were exploring the idea of demolishing the building, where 13 people were killed in a mass shooting in 1999. Jeffco Public Schools spokeswoman Diana Wilson said Wednesday that the thousands of survey responses “are being analyzed in detail, including numerous comments.” The results of the survey are expected to be finalized around mid-July, at the earliest, Wilson said. If the survey shows that Jeffco Public Schools families and staff support the idea of demolishing the building, then community forums would be organized and Jefferson County voters would be polled over the issue. Potential ballot language for the issue could be developed in August, Wilson said. Read more at thedenverchannel.com.

393,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/06/18/new-laws-help-rural-black-families-fight-for-their-land,"When Karama Neal’s mother passed away in  2010, Neal became one of more than 150 heirs to 160 acres of family land in  Arkansas first purchased in 1888 by her great-great-grandfather, Griffin Henry  Belk, a former slave. No one had lived on the property since the  1980s, when Neal’s great-uncle died. Neal was excited about being a co-property  owner among many. She began looking for family members, until her father, who’s  an attorney, warned that any one could force a partition sale, often leading to  the loss of ownership. “I stopped that work and looked for a  solution,” Neal said. Neal’s story is a common one among African American  families, especially in the South. Informal successions of property ownership  can create diminished claims to inheritance and situations that are ripe for  corruption. In 1910, rural African American farm families  held between 16 million and 19 million acres of farmland, but the latest Census  of Agriculture shows the amount of land held by African American farmers with active  farms has dropped to just over 2.5 million acres. Provisions in the 2018 farm bill and new laws passed in 13 states since 2011 will help heirs' property owners like Neal and her family, but the changes came after roughly 85% of black-owned land with active farm operations already had been lost, in part because of laws negatively affecting owners of heirs' property. (The census data represents active, black-owned agricultural land. It does not include leased or inactive black-owned agricultural land, or black rural landowners generally, which would yield higher figures.) “Anything could have happened since 1888 to  have us lose the land,” Neal said, “and for so many families, that’s exactly  what happened.” When property owners die without a will, their  descendants, or heirs, share a claim to the estate — a situation known as heirs' property. But it takes only one heir who wants out of the arrangement to sell  their share. They may need the money or no longer want to share in the  responsibility of property ownership. Sometimes, there are so many heirs,  dividing up the property into separate tracts isn’t feasible. An heir may force a  partition sale, which means the entire property is sold. Oftentimes, a  predatory developer scoops it up at a deep discount. Families who lack a deed to their inherited land are at risk of losing it and the wealth associated with it. Some states are working to make it easier for families to retain their land and its value. Poor and disadvantaged communities have been  the primary victims of partition sales, which experts consider to be the “most unstable form of common, real property  ownership.” While many of  those affected have been African American, heirs' property issues affect a range  of people and communities, from whites in Appalachia, to Native Hawaiians in  Hawaii, to Latinos along the New Mexico-Texas border, to middle-income white  families with poor estate planning, according to Thomas Mitchell, a law  professor at Texas A&M University in College Station. Ultimately, the laws erode generational  wealth and create housing and financial instability. Leading researchers  estimate that between 12% and 30% of all rural properties lack clear title,  according to Nick Bourke, who directs the consumer finance project at the Pew  Charitable Trusts. (Pew also funds Stateline.) But people in urban areas, particularly legacy cities, also are affected. Philadelphia, for  example, had 14,000 properties in 2007 owned by deceased people whose heirs  lack current titles, according to a study by Philadelphia VIP, which provides  pro bono legal services. “This is an economic mobility issue,” Neal said. In 1999, a federal  judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  had wrongfully excluded black farmers from loans — often by using the lack of  clear title as an excuse. Between the case, and a second settlement in 2010,  farmers were awarded $2.35 billion. Provisions  in the 2018 farm bill, introduced by U.S. Sens. Tim Scott, a South Carolina  Republican, and Alabama Democrat Doug Jones prevent similar discrimination. President  Donald Trump signed the bill into law in December. The law includes provisions for heirs to  qualify for a USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) farm number — akin to a driver’s  license for agriculture — which unlocks key programs and enables participation  in local FSA elections. The farm bill instructs Agriculture Secretary Sonny  Perdue to come up with other forms of documentation when heirs lack a clear  title. But to fully make use of the farm bill  protections, states must have enacted a Uniform Partition of Heirs Property  Act. Despite attempts to update the partition law,  swift changes didn’t begin until the Uniform Law Commission, which crafts  legislation to help stabilize statutory law across states, promulgated the heirs' property legislation in 2010. The law covers three major partition law  reforms: First, it gives co-owners the opportunity to buy out heirs who want to  sell their share. Second, if a buyout doesn’t resolve the issue, a court may  consider dividing the property between the owners or selling the property and  dividing the proceeds equitably between the owners. Its decision should be informed by economic  and non-economic factors, such as the land’s sentimental, cultural or historic  value or whether one or more co-tenants would be homeless without the property.  Third, open market sales, rather than auctions, are preferred to ensure a  higher sale price. Nevada was the first state to pass the law in  2011. Ten more states followed through 2018. Congress passes a farm bill about every five  years, and it took time for heirs' property provisions to be included. Advocates  say the 2018 farm bill’s historic inclusion of heirs' property provisions has  focused attention on heirs' property issues. This year, 10 state legislatures  and the District of Columbia considered protections for heirs' property owners. Indiana was among the states where  legislation didn’t pass. When a uniform act is introduced in the state  legislature, the Indiana State Bar Association asks for a year to review it  before taking a position, said Jeff Kolb, who chairs the association’s probate  review committee. State Rep. Mark Baker, a Republican, said  Mississippi’s bill didn’t improve state law. “You’d always bring yourself back full circle  to, what is the state of title? And, in whom are we going to confirm ownership  so that we can begin the process in making a partition determination in kind or  by sale?"" said Baker, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. And while Mississippians are free to convey  their interest in property, and property owners can sell their interests as well,  most buyers don’t want to buy an undivided piece of a property unless they’re  related to the other owners, Baker said. “I don’t have a whole lot of clients who are  interested in coming in and buying a 25% interest in a 40-acre tract with  people they don’t know,” said Baker, who runs a private law practice and is a  candidate for state attorney general. In 2013, Neal, the Arkansas co-heir, started  a grassroots organization to advocate for her state to pass the uniform act. Lawmakers  passed it unanimously in 2015, and it became law Jan. 1, 2016. Neal, president of Southern Bancorp Community Partners in Little Rock, and her co-heirs are still working out clear title to the property, but the law at least allows them to begin the process, Neal said. “There was no real way to get clear title  without significantly risking the property,” Neal said. Much of the scholarship around heirs' property  has focused on African Americans in the South, so Mitchell, the law professor,  sought to develop broader interest by universalizing the law’s effects. “With a slight change in framing, we  described a problem that impacts low-income, disadvantaged families, who are  disproportionately people of color, but not exclusively,” Mitchell said. In South Carolina, where African Americans  have been disproportionately affected by partition laws, the law is named after  Clementa C. Pinckney, a former Democratic state senator and an advocate for  changes in partition law who was killed in the 2015 mass shooting at  the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The law passed despite facing opposition from  a single senator, then-Republican state Sen. Paul Thurmond, son of Republican U.S.  Sen. Strom Thurmond, a leading segregationist during the 1950s and ’60s who  died in 2003. Success in Southern states such as South  Carolina made such laws seem easier for other states to enact, Mitchell said. Focusing  on protecting property rights and family real estate wealth has resonated with  audiences in Texas and Missouri, which named its law the “Save the Family Farm  Act.” But some states have surprised even Mitchell. Montana enacted the law in a matter of weeks  in 2013 when a family risked losing the ranch it held over several generations  because a relative threatened a partition suit, Mitchell said. Iowa had one of the country’s worst partition  laws because these laws made a partition sale the preferred remedy even when the court could have ordered property physically divided, Mitchell said. But a dispute between two siblings who had inherited a nearly 500-acre family  farm prompted a public outcry. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which  affirmed a lower court decision that upheld the law by forcing a partition  sale. There haven’t been any broad studies on the  impact of the heirs' property law, though advocates claim that anecdotal  evidence suggests it has been effective. For example, in Texas, land in a  partition case sold for $3 million instead of $1 million, which shows that open  market sales yield better prices than the auctions typically used for partition  sales, Mitchell said. In some states, families who were under  attack have breathing room to practice effective estate planning, according to advocates. Neal said failed efforts in 2017 and again  this year to repeal the law in Arkansas were noteworthy because “it seems unlikely  there would be repeal efforts if the law weren’t being effective.” But no one knows how prevalent heirs' property  is. A 2017 study published by the USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station,  identified 38,120 acres as possible heirs' property in 10 mostly small, rural Georgia  counties. The land represented between 11% and 25% of the total acres within  the counties, and a total tax appraised value of more than $2 billion. Arkansas and other states would benefit from  similar data, Neal said. “There is significant room for research on  the prevalence of heirs' property,” Neal said. “There’s often a misunderstanding  about where it is. People think it’s only a rural issue, and it’s not.” In a special series, Pew’s “After the Fact” podcast explores the changing nature of the American family.

395,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/tim-tebow-uncc-shooting-survivor-cherish-each-others-company/zketmvrwf9xu11s8l0iypq0zf,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Fans brought their University of Florida helmets and jerseys for him to sign. Reporters brought questions he'd already answered in countless cities. Less-famous opponents stared at the scene from across the field. This is the reality of Tim Tebow’s minor league baseball experience, his spotlight shining in ballparks unaccustomed to such illumination. On Wednesday, the former NFL quarterback played here against the Charlotte Knights at BB&T Ballpark. Next week, he’ll be in Buffalo. Then it’s on to Rochester. The frenzy is normal for Tebow’s Triple-A Syracuse Mets teammates, who mostly shrug when asked about the onetime football star competing alongside them. ""It’s like this everywhere with him,"" outfielder Rajai Davis said. ""That’s what happens when you have 4.7 million followers on Twitter."" Sometimes, though, Tebow is able to break up the sameness with a more intimate interaction. Before Wednesday’s game, Tebow met with Drew Pescaro, who survived the April 30 mass shooting in a University of North Carolina Charlotte classroom. Pescaro underwent two surgeries to recover from his injuries. Tebow and Pescaro initially connected through Pescaro’s church, Elevation, to speak on FaceTime a couple of weeks ago. Pescaro's father helped orchestrate the in-person conversation, which took place beside the field and lasted about 10 minutes. ""I've followed him since he was at Florida. ... He’s been my sports idol since fourth grade,"" Pescaro, 19, said. “I thought (the video call) was amazing, and then this was 10 times cooler."" MORE:  MLB scout says Tim Tebow has peaked in Triple-A Before a Syracuse Mets game in Charlotte, @TimTebow meets with Drew Pescaro, one of the young men shot at UNCC in April. pic.twitter.com/2PE6JL4KE8 As a lifelong Patriots fan, Pescaro donned Tebow’s No. 5 New England jersey — an unusual clothing item given the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner's brief stint with that team. Tebow smiled when he saw Pescaro's uniform choice and seemed moved by his time with the student. Tebow cherishes these kinds of personal moments as he traverses the day-to-day grind of the minor leagues. ""(Pescaro) is someone who, in the midst of adversity, showed so much strength and faith and determination,"" Tebow said. ""I always try to let (people in need) know I’ll be praying for them. Hopefully that can be encouraging."" Davis, who met with Pescaro moments after Tebow went to stretch in left field, praised Tebow's generosity and ability to lift the young man's spirits. Davis is well-positioned to appreciate Tebow having played 14 MLB seasons. The veteran's litany of big league memories leaves him not only satisfied with his own career, but also cognizant of what others bring to the game. Davis, then, didn’t seem to mind not starting Wednesday. It allowed him to take in the Tebow spectacle on a night Tebow’s presence meant a little more than usual. “We have the better view on this side. We can see the (uptown Charlotte) skyline, too,” Davis said of the third-base dugout, where he would spend the next few hours. ""I'll be watching the whole show from here."" Pescaro sat just behind that spot, enjoying almost the exact same view. Amid a stretch of his life he called ""a pretty rough time"" personally, he felt fortunate to get an up-close perspective of one of his favorite players. ""It meant the world to me,"" Pescaro said. ""Everyone else I’d met (since the shooting), it was also extremely cool.

398,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/y1gLEsZDdoE/,"During a gun control event outside the U.S. Capitol Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) suggested Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is twiddling his thumbs while guns kill people. Schumer ascended the podium and asked, “Why are we here?” He then answered his own question, saying, “Because too many American lives have been lost to gun violence and the United States Senate could do something about it today, and the United States Senate and Mitch McConnell are just twiddling their thumbs as more and more people die from gun violence.” He said, “Leader McConnell has created a do-nothing Senate, refusing to consider even the most popular House-passed bills.” Schumer pushed universal background checks, saying, “Over 90 percent of Americans support closing…background check loopholes.” He referenced House Democrats’ universal background checks bill, H.R. 8. That bill, passed February 27, criminalizes private gun sales unless an individual gets government approval before selling a handgun to his lifelong neighbor or a shotgun to a coworker he has known for decades. However, H.R. 8 would do nothing to hinder attacks like the one witnessed in Virginia Beach on May 31, and that is because the Virginia Beach gunman passed background checks to acquire his guns. Moreover, universal background checks would not have stopped a single mass shooting in the last 12 years because nearly every attacker during that time-frame acquired his guns via a background check. The exceptions are those who stole their guns.

399,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/6WNLpUHDK6Y/,"Democrat gun control advocates gathered at the Capitol on Thursday to put out a rally call for the Senate to take up the universal background check for gun purchases bill the House passed 114 days ago, claiming 11,400 people have since died from “gun violence.” That claim, which puts the “gun violence” toll at 100 a day, can’t be squared with any existing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which tracks mortality from guns but does not have data from this year. Even the so-called Gun Violence Archives, which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer referenced in his remarks, doesn’t jibe with the stats cited at the rally. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit formed in 2013, states on its website that 6,635 people have died in 2019 so far from “gun violence.” Schumer also claimed that there have been 102 mass shootings in the United States since the House passed HR 8, but according to the Gun Violence Archives he references, 176 mass shooting are recorded there and those include a wide range of incidents ranging from domestic murder-suicides to drug and gang-related incidents. “So let’s think of that — two numbers — 102 people killed; 114 the number of days the bill has sat in the Senate,” Schumer said. “It is outrageous.”  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) spoke at a rally at the Capitol on Thursday urging the Senate to take up a universal background check gun bill that passed in the House in March. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) opened the rally with a backdrop of volunteers from gun control activists groups holding placards with white stick figures. Volunteers also held signs with the “11,400 dead” figure. “Behind us this afternoon are representations of the 11,400 individuals who have died by gunshot wounds since our colleagues in the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan background checks bill,” Murphy said. “That piece of legislation will save lives.” “But over the course of the past 114 days, since this legislation has been waiting for action in the United States Senate, America has lost another 11,400 individuals — 100 a day,” Murphy said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also recited the same 11,400 number while quoting George Bernard Shaw — “the sign of a truly intelligent person is that he or she was swayed by statistics.” But even the leftist VOX website and the New York Times reported that the vast majority of gun deaths are from suicide — 65 percent in 2015, the latest year that the CDC has data. The CDC reports that in that same year only 23.5 percent of the 31,415 deaths from guns were homicides. A statistic missing from the Democrat rally is how many gun fatalities involved guns that had or had not involved background checks. Democrats also invited former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), who survived a shooting in her home state of Arizona eight years ago. Giffords played to the emotions of the crowd and she spoke briefly, telling her supporters to “fight, fight, fight” for gun control. But as Breitbart News reported, the man who attacked her had undergone a background check, so the bill she supports would not have spared her.  Former Congresswomen Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), who survived a shooting eight years ago, spoke at a rally on Thursday at the Capitol to support a gun control bill. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) Breitbart News also reported the other mass shooters who underwent background checks: Virginia Beach (May 31), Virginia Tech gunman (April 16, 2007), the Fort Hood gunman (November 5, 2009), the Aurora movie theater gunman (July 20, 2012), the D.C. Navy Yard gunman (September 16, 2013), the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014), the Orlando Pulse gunman (June 12, 2016), the Las Vegas gunman (October 1, 2017), the Texas church gunman (November 5, 2017), the Parkland high school gunman (February 14, 2018), and many more. The list from the CDC shows death from guns as Number Ten on its list of the top causes of death in America following heart disease, cancer, accidents, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes, flu and pneumonia, and kidney disease. Pelosi also cited the statistic that 47 children die from gun violence every day. But according to the Worldometers research site, abortion is a much greater threat; in 2019 so far almost 20 million children have died from abortion, or 125,000 abortions a day. Some 50 million abortions have taken place in the United States since the United States Supreme Court legalized the procedure in 1973 in its Roe v. Wade decision. You can watch the whole rally here.

400,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/603343876/0/phoenix/nation~Bidenaposs-comments-on-segregationist-Senators-loom-over-big-weekend-for-South-Carolina-Dems/,"Former Vice President Biden’s controversial comments this week about two former segregationist lawmakers is looming large as 21 White House hopefuls gather in South Carolina to make their case to voters in a state where African Americans make up the majority of the Democratic electorate. Biden, who has led the Democratic field in all major polling, endured the sharpest criticism he’s seen from party rivals during his nearly two-month old campaign after he boasted during a fundraiser about his ability to get things done in the Senate. He alluded to working with Democratic segregationist senators James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia early in his career while trying to make a point about lost civility in national politics. But bringing up Eastland, who had been called the ""Voice of the White South,"" and Talmadge spurred recriminations from his fellow White House hopefuls, including Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, both who are African American. They questioned Biden for name-checking lawmakers who opposed racial integration of public schools. Biden and campaign surrogates have pushed back against the criticism, saying his remarks were being misconstrued. The controversy continues to simmer even as some party faithful try to downplay the intra-party sniping ahead of this weekend’s Democratic party cattle call in Columbia, S.C. All but two of the party’s major candidates are scheduled to stump at Rep. Jim Clyburn's “World Famous” Fish Fry, the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention, a state party dinner, and an event hosted by the political arm of Planned Parenthood. Biden is also scheduled to hold a private discussion on Friday with African-American leaders. “You must judge politicians by votes, not by association,” said civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native who traveled to the state to take part in the party gathering and launch a voter registration drive. “You can relate to all kinds of people, you just cannot swallow all of their venom.” South Carolina holds the fourth-in-the-nation party nominating contest on Feb. 29 and has received an extraordinary amount of attention from candidates in the early going. By the end of this weekend, candidates will have held more than 175 campaign events in the state this year, according to a USA TODAY analysis of candidates' public schedules. Black voters make up more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina, and are key to a primary victory. Several African American South Carolina lawmakers and Democratic operatives told USA TODAY that the episode has spurred a debate about whether Biden is in touch with the black voters he’s trying to court. State Rep. J.A. Moore, a lawmaker from North Charleston who has endorsed Sen. Kamala Harris, said that Biden’s remarks about Eastland and Talmadge adds another layer of skepticism about the impact that the former vice president’s long political career has had on African Americans. Moore said Biden’s backing of the 1994 Crime Bill — tough on crime legislation that some critics say disproportionately impacted African-Americans — and the treatment of Anita Hill, an African American law professor who faced sometimes misogynistic questioning during Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearing from an all-male Senate Judiciary Committee led by Biden, had previously caused him concern. “I just think he’s out of step,” said Moore, whose sister and eight others were killed in the 2015 mass shooting by a racist gunman who targeted a bible study at an African American church in Charleston. “That’s not his first time touting his ability to work with people who have been bad for my community. What I think it goes back to is that much of the African American community thinks he did a pretty good job while he was the vice president for Barack Obama. We have to remember that’s Barack Obama’s administration — not his.” Who should apologize? Biden: Booker should apologize after criticism of my comments on segregationists Biden backlash: 'He is out of step': Backlash after Biden talks 'civility' with segregationist senators Several senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus came to Biden’s defense as he received flack for his remarks. Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress and host of this weekend’s fish fry, noted to Politico that he worked with the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, an avowed segregationist. Biden adviser Anita Dunn also noted in an MSNBC interview that Biden did not praise Eastland and Talmadge. “The point of the story is that you have to be able to work with people, even if they hold positions repugnant to you, in order to make some progress,” Dunn told MSNBC. South Carolina Rep. Bill Clyburn, who is the cousin of the powerful U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, said in a USA TODAY interview that Biden has demonstrated throughout his career that he’s guided by a sense of fairness and a desire to promote “good government.” “You ought not to abuse too much the person who tries to find common ground,” said Bill Clyburn, who has endorsed Biden. But another state party operative, Berkeley County Chairwoman Melissa Watson, said Biden has too often been “given a pass” for hurtful remarks or appeared to act in a matter that could be construed as tone deaf. At the start of his campaign, Biden addressed accusations from women that Biden violated their personal space or kissed, hugged or touched them without consent. Watson, who has backed Harris, questioned whether Biden has become averse to admitting when he’s wrong. For example, Biden earlier this month reasserted and then backed off his support for the Hyde Amendment, a federal rule prohibiting the use of taxpayer money on most abortion procedures. “He must do better,” Watson said of Biden. “It’s not good. He doesn’t want to seem like a flip-flopper. He just recently had to walk back his support the Hyde Amendment, and he doesn’t want his campaign to be stuck with a title of ‘retractor or flip-flopper in chief.’ What he doesn’t seem to understand is that he was in the Senate for nearly 40 years and America evolved.” From AOC: Ocasio-Cortez on segregationist comments: Booker doesn't need to apologize to Biden Biden said the piling on by 2020 rivals was unfair and stood by his remarks. Meanwhile, his campaign surrogates argued that the comment was similar to anecdotes he's told before to underscore the need to find common ground to make Washington work. Booker, who offered the sharpest critique among 2020 candidates, took offense when Biden told reporters that he ""should know better."" ""I know the damage that segregationists caused and how that still affects black and brown communities like the one I go home to,"" Booker wrote in fundraising email. ""I know the people that Vice President Biden worked with would not have wanted me in the Senate. And I know that anyone running to be president of the United States and the leader of our party shouldn’t need this lesson."" In his remarks at the New York City fundraiser, Biden recalled, while speaking in a southern drawl, that Eastland “never called me boy, he always called me son,” according to a pool report of the event. Booker rebuked Biden for using language that he said was insensitive. “You don’t joke about calling black men ‘boys.’ Men like James O. Eastland used words like that, and the racist policies that accompanied them, to perpetuate white supremacy and strip black Americans of our very humanity,” Booker said. South Carolina Rep. John King, who has endorsed Booker, said he agreed with the New Jersey Democrat. But King was circumspect on what impact he thought Biden’s comment might have on his standing with black voters in the state. “Vice President Biden will be judged on his record as an elected official prior to being elected vice president and I think that people have started looking at that,” King said. “We’ll just have to see come election day, that what he says to the African American community, if it actually sells and whether it means something or not. Or maybe they vote for him because of his connection to the Obama administration.” Biden later Wednesday called Booker to talk about the day's comments. A Booker campaign spokeswoman said the senator reiterated what he had said publicly to the vice president directly. State Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman and Biden backer, slammed Booker Thursday morning for carrying out a ""pure naked political tactic"" by going after Biden over the anecdote. ""I know as chairman of the party I had (Biden) speak at least twice, maybe as many as three times (including) once as vice president and some variation of that story has been told ... when he's talking about reaching across the aisle and working with people who you have huge differences with and may find reprehensible,"" Harpootlian said. ""That's all he's talking about there. In no way has he ever indicated that he approved or any way adopted their positions. Cory Booker is looking for a fight because he is so far down in the polls."" It remains to be seen how much of an impact Biden’s comments will have on rank-and-file African American voters, a key constituency that will play an important role in deciding who is the party’s nominee and that candidates chance against President Trump in the general election. Biden has said that if he wins the nomination, he can beat Trump in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas — all states that Trump won in 2016. But in order to be competitive in those southern states, the former vice president will almost certainly need a strong turnout from African American voters. For the South Carolina Democratic primary, black voters make up roughly 61% of the electorate, making them a potent voting bloc. But Democrats in South Carolina are decidedly more conservative than party faithful in nearly any other part of the country, said Sam Johnson, a former chief of staff to Columbia mayor Steve Benjamin. ""You have to be nimble in how you talk about certain issues in South Carolina politics,"" Johnson said. Biden held a 20-percentage point lead over his nearest rival in the Palmetto State, according to a poll published last week in the Charleston Post and Courier. The commanding lead, however, shrunk from a 31-point lead for Biden over his closest rival— Sen. Bernie Sanders— in the Post and Courier’s poll conducted days after Biden made his first 2020 visit to the state in early May. Some South Carolina Democrats who are backing rivals of Biden for the nomination say Biden has benefited from a coattails effect from serving as President Obama’s vice president. Rep. Terry Alexander, who has endorsed Sanders, predicted that Biden’s support will slip among black voters as they are exposed to the former vice president on the stump and learn about his record. “It’s early, and Biden’s support is soft,” Alexander said. “The more he talks, the more he puts himself in trouble. It’s almost like he’s acting like Trump. He thinks, ‘I can say whatever I want to say and the people will support me no matter what.’ But you put him out there two days in a row and he’ll say something like (what he said about Eastland and Talmadge.) But this weekend offers Biden a chance to turn the episode into a footnote or exacerbate the problem, South Carolina political analysts say. ""This is a good chance for Biden to get his feet back under him, (but) it is going to be hard for his staff to keep him protected from the media,"" said Danielle Vinson, a professor of politics and international affairs at Furman University in Greenville, S.C.",2019-06-21 06:00:16,Biden&apos;s comments on segregationist Senators loom over big weekend for South Carolina Dems,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

404,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/21/facebook-co-founder-warns-against-libra-cryptocurrency,"Chris Hughes says involvement of private companies is threat to autonomy of nation states Last modified on Fri 21 Jun 2019 18.10 BST One of Facebook’s co-founders has warned the social network’s plans for a digital currency called Libra could allow corporations involved in the scheme to wield power over nation states. Chris Hughes, whose role in the early days of Facebook has given him a net worth estimated at $430m (£340m), said global regulators should intervene to slow the progress of the cryptocurrency.  Facebook is developing Libra from a base in Switzerland, in partnership with 27 other corporations – including Mastercard, Paypal, Uber and Vodafone – collectively known as the Libra Association. What is Libra? Facebook says Libra is a 'global currency and financial infrastructure' - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra. Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency? Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account. Who is in charge of Libra? Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience. The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions. Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra.

The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard. However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative announced that they were pulling out, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe. How and when can I use it? With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app. Kari Paul in San Francisco “If even modestly successful, Libra would hand over much of the control of monetary policy from central banks to these private companies,” said Hughes, a co-chair of the Economic Security Project, an anti-poverty campaign group. “If global regulators don’t act now, it could very soon be too late.” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gave a cautious welcome to Libra in his speech at the annual Mansion House dinner on Thursday night. But in an article for the Financial Times, Hughes said the companies involved in the Libra Association, which have each put $10m into the project, would be able to “disrupt and weaken” nation states. He warned that if enough people in emerging economies traded local currency for Libra, it would threaten the ability of governments to manage their fiscal policies. Emerging markets should place a temporary ban on local banks and payment processors accepting the currency until the implications are thought through, Hughes said. “What Libra backers are calling ‘decentralisation’ is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank,” he said. Hughes added that if Libra is successful, Facebook and its partners would hold undue sway over the development of crucial global technology such as identify verification, as well as effectively writing the rules on matters such as privacy and response to theft. He said anyone believing his fears were overblown should consider how Facebook has had a huge, sometimes negative, effect on other walks of life. “The company’s decision to offer live broadcasting made it possible for teenagers to stream bullying, terrorists to live cast an execution and a gunman a mass shooting,” Hughes said. “It has similarly transformed mobile messaging and news and journalism faster than many imagined.” The Guardian has approached Facebook for comment.",2019-06-21 11:02:44,Facebook co-founder warns against Libra cryptocurrency,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

It's Orwell meets the Salem witch trials via ""The Lord of the Flies,"" social justice warrior-style. Thought-crime is already a prosecutable offense. A U.S. federal court has indicted WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange for thinking about, merely for what-if musing in conversation with Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, about hacking a government computer. The government admits there was never an actual hack. Undercover FBI agents entice young Muslim men into nonexistent terrorist plots in order to entrap them. An Ohio man on probation for possession of child pornography was sentenced to seven years in prison for a handwritten diary he had written for his own use that depicted rape and torture of children disgusting but purely theoretical. Coming of age pre-Internet I rest secure in the knowledge that most of my screw-ups and youthful indiscretions remain blissfully undigitized and unsearchable. I was wrong, I did bad things, hopefully I learned and won't repeat the same ones. People under age 35 or so don't have that luxury. As Edward Snowden remarked, ""They understand what it means to make a mistake, have someone with a smartphone in the room and then have it haunt you for the rest of your time in high school or college or whatever."" If and when Shirky's vision is realized, it won't matter. Digital evidence of intemperate language and drunk texts and obscene selfies will be so widespread that their revelation will be met with a collective shrug. Until then, we will have cases like that of Kyle Kashuv. Kashuv, 18, is the right-wing counterpart of David Hogg. Both men survived the mass shooting at the high school in Parkland, Florida and both got into Harvard College. Unlike Hogg, however, Kashuv is a right-winger and speaks at pro-gun rallies. Also unlike Hogg, it has been revealed that Kashuv spewed a bunch of racist and anti-Semitic slurs online when he was 16. After Kashuv issued a series of apologies, Harvard rescinded his acceptance. Let that sink in: when he was 16. Kashuv claims to have become ""a better person."" Maybe, maybe not. But even if he hasn't, even if he's still and really a bigot, how are his private and political thoughts any of Harvard's business as long as he keeps his racist BS to himself? Harvard is extremely unforgiving of its prospective freshmen. They previously rescinded admissions from 10 kids who shared dirty memes about the college on Facebook, and also famously from a woman who served time in prison for murder, because she didn't reveal her record on her application. Why should she have to? She did her time. Let her study up and move on. It is notable that Kashuv apologized at length, eloquently, repeatedly. The only way to fix bad words is with good words and he did that. Was he sincere? Only he knows that; frankly, that should be enough. The admissions officers are punishing something even more ephemeral than thought-crime. Call it post-thought-crime. Harvard is turning this guy away either because they suspect he is insufficiently repentant or, more likely, because they think that what he said two years ago was so awfully distasteful that he deserves to be sanctioned despite and after he recanted, reformed and (claimed to have) stopped being the person who wrote those racist and anti-Semitic comments. Thought-crime is sinister and invasive; post-thought-crime goes still further because it eliminates even the possibility of redemption. This, Harvard College is telling the world, is not a young man, a tabla rasa whose future is unwritten. His racist comments at age 16 make him as forever toxic as Chernobyl, a filthy demon worthy only of scorn and contempt. Harvard chooses to believe that he is as he behaved at his worst, two years ago. They choose to ignore him as he claims to be now -- better. The evil must be true; the good must be a lie. Apologies are worthless, merely the self-serving rhetoric of the justly condemned villain. There is nothing for Kashuv to do but slink away and die.

406,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/21/how-accusations-of-islamophobia-threaten-our-freedom-of-speech/,"(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Across the globe, anti-Semites are growing bolder. Each smear is more overt. Each attack is deadlier. Hateful rhetoric once kept to the fringes of society has crept into the mainstream and is now disseminated online and in the halls of Congress. But when the House tried to pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism earlier this year, they couldn’t even get it on the floor for a vote. Instead, a revised resolution was passed 407-23, denouncing both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia “as hateful expressions of intolerance.” The House resolution, while problematic, was still better than what transpired in the United Nations. Until Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon spoke out and rallied allies, the resolution only condemned Islamophobia, completely excluding anti-Semitism. These two resolutions show the unfortunate trend of framing anti-Semitism and Islamophobia as equivalent phenomena and equal dangers. They are not. (RELATED: The Islamophobia Scam) Hatred of Muslims is real and can be deadly, as we saw in New Zealand recently. But as radical Muslim organizations like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as well as federal lawmakers like Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) have come to prominence in America, so have false accusations of Islamophobia.  MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – MARCH 19: Protesters hold placards aloft as they march during the Stand Against Racism and Islamophobia: Fraser Anning Resign! rally on March 19, 2019 in Melbourne, Australia. The protesters are calling for the resignation of Senator Fraser Anning, following the statement he issued within hours of the Christchurch terror attacks on Friday 15 March, linking the shootings at two mosques to immigration. Those attacks killed 50 people and have left dozens more injured. The accused attacker, 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged with murder and remanded in custody until April 5. The attack is the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history. (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) While anti-Semitism and Islamophobia sound similar, and both refer to prejudicial opinions about minority groups, they are not the same. A phobia is a strong, irrational fear of something that poses no real danger. Judeophobia is an irrational fear of Jews. Islamophobia is an irrational fear of the Islamic religion or Muslims generally. Anti-Semitism, on the other hand, is rooted in hatred, not fear. “Because anti-Semitism is the godfather of racism and the gateway to tyranny and fascism and war, it is to be regarded not as the enemy of the Jewish people, I learned, but as the common enemy of humanity and of civilization, and has to be fought against very tenaciously for that reason, most especially in its current, most virulent form of Islamic jihad,” said the famed English-American author Christopher Hitchens in 2011. The late historian Robert S. Wistrich — arguably the world’s leading expert on anti-Semitism during his lifetime — framed anti-Semitism in the context of the difference between an “obsession” and a “compulsion.” “Compulsion’ suggests being coerced; and I think of anti-Semitism as more inner-driven,” Wistrich said, citing French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre’s description that anti-Semitism is “not an opinion, but rather a crime of passion; and, in the final analysis, the anti-Semite wants, consciously or unconsciously, to kill the Jew.” While anti-Semitism is what Wistrich deemed “the longest hatred,” Islamophobia is a relatively novel phenomenon in historical terms. The phrase was first used in the 19th century, but became prominent after Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 following the publication of Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses. The fatwa not only imposed a death penalty on Rushdie, but also criminalized all the publishers and translators of the book. When Rushdie was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 for his service to literature, Iran accused Britain of “Islamophobia,” saying its fatwa still stood. “A stupid term — Islamophobia —has been put into circulation to try and suggest that a foul prejudice lurks behind any misgivings about Islam’s infallible ‘message,’” Hitchens wrote in 2007. Since then, the Islamophobic label has been used more and more often to deter any scrutiny of any groups or individuals who happen to be Muslim, even when those are advancing radical or harmful ideas, like Iran’s Ayatollahs. The political uses of the term Islamophobia go a long way toward explaining why the Associated Press stylebook barred the term in 2012. In 2017, AP changed their minds and added it back.  Ilhan Omar, newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on the Democratic ticket, arrives for her victory party on election night in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 6, 2018. – US voters elected two Muslim women, both Democrats, to Congress on November 6, 2018, marking a historic first in a country where anti-Muslim rhetoric has been on the rise, American networks reported. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee, won a House seat in a heavily-Democratic district in the Midwestern state of Minnesota, where she will succeed Keith Ellison, himself the first Muslim elected to Congress. (Photo by Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images) “Islam is not a race … Islam is simply a set of beliefs, and it is not ‘Islamophobic’ to say Islam is incompatible with liberal democracy,” said Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born Dutch-American feminist and former politician who abandoned Muslim faith and is an outspoken voice against female genital mutilation in the Islamic world. CAIR’s crusade against Islamophobia — and free speech — is particularly laughable, as the organization has even called “Aladdin” Islamophobic. The prime minister of France Manuel Valls demonstrated a wariness of the political purposes of the Islamophobia charge, and refused to use the term following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack. (RELATED: Destigmatizing Islamophobia) Calling critics Islamophobic is a very useful way to stifle debate, and Islamic radicals know this very well. Because of the power of the charge, few today are brave enough to take a public stance against radical Islam. As a result, criticism of Islam, Muslims and related matters are censored often in favor of the Islamist. Chelsea Clinton has experienced this. So have Bill Maher and Dennis Prager. My own opposition to the Iran deal, boycott campaigns against Israel, and support of a petition calling out Reps. Omar and Tlaib for their anti-Semitism have earned me the designation as well. Today, the unfortunate reality is that any time somebody is brave enough to critique a dangerous ideology, the government of a Muslim country, or even a terrorist network, they’re silenced, shut down, and stigmatized for engaging in “Islamophobia.” ",2019-06-21 12:02:40,How Accusations of &#8216;Islamophobia&#8217; Threaten Our Freedom of Speech,,18775,http://dailycaller.com
407,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marine-corps-times/news/your-marine-corps/~3/WdTRHrs0ccg/,"A safety brief analyzing security concerns at one military installation offered up an eccentric example of a potential hazard when instructors warned airmen in attendance of the growing threat of incels, or involuntary celibates. The online-based community of introverted, sexless individuals that may have started decades ago as an innocuous attempt at achieving a sense of belonging has, in recent years, become a label for a more aggressive sect of repugnant men who cast the entirety of the blame for their coitus-free existence onto women. This scorn has manifested in the form of heinous misogyny shared over online message boards, and in a handful of cases, escalated into deadly violence. In the wake of learning Army veteran and Dallas courthouse shooter, Brian Isaack Clyde, was an active participant in the incel subculture, at least one base — Maryland’s Joint Base Andrews — is now taking measures to educate service members on the warning signs — including the use of a popular meme Clyde shared on his social media — of potential violence carried out by the incel community. In the time leading up to the shooting, Clyde shared a version of the incel meme known as “Virgin vs. Chad,” in which the characteristics of an incel man are stacked up against his antithesis. In Clyde’s case, the meme contrasted the ways in which the Virgin and Chad would carry out a mass shooting, according to the Dallas Morning News. Clyde, who was found with a rifle and more than 150 rounds of ammunition on his body, was shot and killed by security officers shortly after he opened fire at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other casualties. The “Becky vs. Stacy” iteration that was used during the brief at Andrews, one that was shared Tuesday to the popular Facebook page, Air Force amn/nco/scno, depicts two types of women flanked by a series of debasing comments incels use to characterize those who refuse to enter romantic relationships with them. Increased discussion in “extremist connections and attacks” from incels is cited in the brief along with other incel character traits, such as maintaining the belief that they are “owed attention from ‘Beckys.'” “The content of this briefing was based upon law enforcement as well as public sources and was used to inform both military commanders and law enforcement personnel about a very real threat to military members and civilians,"" Master Sgt. Jake Richmond, spokesman for Joint Base Andrews, told Military Times. “The briefing aims to provide those audiences with the necessary tools to identify and prevent threats.” One such threat came to a violent end in May 2014, when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger shared a video blaming women at UC Santa Barbara for his repeated romantic failures before going on a shooting and stabbing rampage on the school’s campus. The same day as the Isla Vista killings, Rodger posted a video titled, “Why do girls hate me so much?” in which he ranted against women at the school. “I don’t know why you girls are so repulsed by me. I do everything I can to appear attractive to you. I dress nice, I am sophisticated, I am magnificent. I have a nice car, a BMW. . . I am polite,"" he said. ""I am the ultimate gentleman. And yet, you girls never give me a chance. I don’t know why. I feel so invisible as I walk through my college. Your revealing shorts, your cascading blonde hair, your pretty faces. I want one for a girlfriend. I deserve girls much more than all those slobs. . . . I should be the one with the girls. I mean, look at me? I’m gorgeous. But you girls don’t see it.” Rodger killed six and injured 14 more before shooting himself in his vehicle. The video has since been taken down.

410,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/sports/stephen-curry-finals-durant-politics.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Sopan Deb Stephen Curry woke up sore on Thursday. He had good reason: It had been only a week since his Golden State Warriors lost a grueling N.B.A. finals series to the Toronto Raptors. In the last five seasons, Curry has played in 93 playoff games, adding more than the equivalent of a full 82-game regular season to his workload. He said he had not picked up a basketball since his team’s Game 6 loss and did not plan to play competitively for another month or so. He has to recover from what he called “knickknack injuries” and sore legs, which can be masked by the adrenaline of a deep postseason run. “Your mind is powerful because it keeps you feeling better than you really are,” Curry said. And this was a season in need of that kind of self-deception. Just one week removed from what can only be described as a crushing end to his 2018-19 season, Curry invited a New York Times reporter to ride with him for about an hour as he was driven from his home to San Francisco International Airport to fly to Asia for his fifth tour there with Under Armour. From the back of the vehicle — a cross between a stretch limousine and a party bus that resembled a rolling spaceship — Curry spoke at length about the uncertainty of the Warriors heading into next season, his off-court aspirations and his willingness to get involved in politics. The next several months have much in store for Curry, a 31-year-old basketball savant who, after 10 seasons, is already thinking hard about life after basketball. No, he won’t be making a cameo in LeBron James’s production of “Space Jam 2” (he was asked but said no, citing scheduling issues), but he will probably field a call or two from former President Barack Obama (he said they are in contact about once a month). He has ramped up projects for his production company, Unanimous Media, which he formed last year with his partners Jeron Smith and Erick Peyton. Its name nods to Curry’s unanimous selection as the league’s most valuable player in 2016. That was a good year. But Curry will soon encounter one of the biggest challenges of his career on a basketball court, after devastating injuries to his teammates Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson in the finals that will keep them out for much of next season, if not all of it. That is, of course, if they are re-signed by the Warriors to begin with, since both can be free agents. At this stage of Curry’s career, when he should be able to take a step back and manage his body, he may have to handle an even bigger offensive load. “I run a lot more than the next guy,” Curry said. “There’s really just an understanding of my training and the things I do to get myself ready. I can withstand that type of output night after night. It’s going to be hard. It’s going to require another level of discipline.” He will probably not have the option of “load management,” a term that has entered the N.B.A. vocabulary to describe players sitting out regular-season games so they can be fresher for the playoffs. After years of benefiting from a team with exceptional firepower, Curry, one of the greatest offensive players in history, could find himself as the firepower. Curry said that he could not see himself playing until age 40, but that he wasn’t worried about extra weight in spite of his injury history. He said he was ready to dig deep — even though “I don’t know who our starting lineup is going to be next year.” “This regular season was the hardest one we’ve ever had in terms of keeping everything together,” Curry said. “Not because of anything more than it’s just mentally challenging to perform at this level every single night. When we got to the playoffs, it was the most fun I think we’ve had, minus the injuries, obviously. That was tough all the way across the board. “But it was as fun, if not more, than years past. Because one, we were challenged. Two, there was a constant communication in the locker room like, ‘Yo, this is what we live for.’” They ended the season on their home floor, at Oracle Arena, but it was the Raptors who were celebrating a championship. Then the scene suddenly changed. As Toronto’s players and their family and friends flooded the court, Masai Ujiri, the Raptors’ president, was stopped by a sheriff’s deputy who would not let him on the court because he said he did not have the proper credential. (The police said Ujiri, who is black, struck a white officer in the face, though some bystanders have disputed this account; prosecutors are investigating the incident.) “You know what’s crazy? I saw him after,” Curry said, referring to Ujiri. “I didn’t know anything about this situation. But looking back, I saw his face and I could tell something had happened.” Curry said he had seen cellphone videos from bystanders and read the news reports about the incident. “If he didn’t do anything wrong, obviously, you’d hope that it was handled in a better fashion,” he said. “Especially for a guy that was going out and trying to celebrate with his team that had done something historical. So I don’t know if that was a white G.M. or whatever, if that’s handled differently. You can always play the what-if game.” The incident became part of long-running discussions about race and policing in the United States, a topic Curry said he is passionate about along with gun violence. He was an executive producer for “Emanuel,” a Brian Ivie-directed documentary released last week about the 2015 mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C. In recent years, Curry has been more likely to be political, such as when he spoke out against President Trump in 2017 or when he invited Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, Calif., to be a guest on his YouTube show. He also appeared with Obama at an event in Oakland this year. One of Curry’s partners at Unanimous Media, Smith, worked in the White House’s office of digital strategy under Obama. But don’t expect Curry to be involved in 2020 campaigning, as James and J.R. Smith, the Cleveland Cavaliers guard, were for Hillary Clinton in 2016. “Let’s just say that I don’t have a relationship with anybody that’s running,” Curry said. “Maybe that will develop over time. But I haven’t gotten into that game yet.” But he did say the stakes of the next presidential election were “extremely high,” “especially with how these last four years have been in terms of exposing a lot of nastiness that still exists in our country.” Amid the tension in the United States, and even in the locker rooms of the N.B.A., Curry has been working to bring forth family friendly and personally meaningful entertainment through his production company. Curry is an executive producer of “Holey Moley,” a miniature golf reality show that had its television premiere on Thursday night after being promoted relentlessly by ABC during the N.B.A. finals, and was also one for “Breakthrough,” a faith-based drama that premiered around Easter. On YouTube, Curry has “5 Minutes From Home,” his version of “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” in which he has hosted guests like the actor Daveed Diggs. Curry said that he wanted to express the full breadth of his interests and that he could see himself writing scripts down the road. Some of his work has dealt with the lives of college athletes, who he said “definitely should get paid.” But in the meantime, he is still in the prime of his basketball career. He doesn’t have many of those years left — and discussions about where Curry stands among N.B.A. greats are beginning to intensify. He attracts his fair share of criticism. His playoff failures — if you can call them that — are often cited as evidence that maybe he has always been more flash than substance. He hasn’t been voted the most valuable player in the finals, for example, something critics point at to diminish his accomplishments. Curry is aware of the noise, but he said he didn’t care much for the narratives. “The only regret I do have is the behind-the-back pass I threw in 2016 in Game 7,” he said, referring to a crucial turnover with just about five minutes left in the game, which the Warriors lost. “That’s literally the only regret I have in terms of how I’ve played, and that comes with wins and losses, right? I’m cool.” Advertisement",2019-06-21 23:48:08,Stephen Curry Finally Gets Some Rest (but Only From Basketball),,1,http://nytimes.com

          / CBS News South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn hosted his annual ""Fish Fry"" event Friday night in Columbia, and just about all the Democrats running for president made their pitch to voters in a critical early primary state. Their speeches are being limited to roughly 90 seconds, giving the famed event a lightning-round quality. Joe Biden urged that ""whomever the Democratic nominee is, we have to stay together and elect a [Democratic] president of the United States.""All the candidates had less than two minutes to pitch themselves. After Biden wrapped up, Clyburn joked ""that's the shortest speech Joe Biden ever made."" South Carolina hosts the first primary in the South on Feb. 29, 2020. It's considered a key state for candidates, where black voters make up 61% of the electorate. If a candidate does well in South Carolina, it could be seen as an indicator for his or her support among black voters across the country. Most of the candidates plan to stick around Saturday, when the South Carolina Democratic Party will be holding its annual convention and elect its officers.  Tim Ryan spoke with CBSN after the fish fry, discussing his plan to ""out compete"" China by investing in clean energy. Climate change, Ryan said, ""needs to be expressed to the majority of Americans who are struggling as opportunity,"" meaning that workers who have lost their manufacturing jobs could go into production of solar panels and wind turbines. The Ohio congressman said his plan would have American workers ""out compete"" and ""out build"" their Chinese counterparts. Ryan said that he agreed with President Trump's decision to take on China, but thought that tariffs alone were not the solution. ""A tariff is a tactical move that's supposed to be part of a larger strategy,"" Ryan said. All 21 candidates present at the fish fry wrapped up the event with a group photo onstage alongside Clyburn. Kamala Harris began her speech by invoking the mass shooting by a white supremacist that killed nine worshipers at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston four years ago this week. Harris paid homage to the past heroes of civil rights. She said she was standing on their shoulders as a candidate, with a vision for the future that includes healthcare for all, higher pay for teachers, and ""reasonable"" gun control laws. ""This is a fight not only to honor the history and heroes,"" said Harris, ""it's a fight for our future."" -- Stephanie Ramirez In her pitch, Elizabeth Warren touted her campaign's ""big ideas"" for ""big structural change."" She ran through some of her most well-known policies such as a wealth tax, which she says would pay for universal childcare, as well as tuition-free college. In the biggest applause line of her speech, Warren discussed her plan to give $15 billion to the country's historically black colleges and universities. ""We need to have courage in this country,"" Warren said. ""2020: We can dream big, fight hard and win."" Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who has a fierce base unofficially known as the ""Yang Gang,"" took the opportunity to introduce his proposal for universal basic income, where each citizen would receive $1000 per month. Yang said that most voters knew this about him: ""There's an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone $1000 month. All of those things are dead true, South Carolina."" Calling President Trump's solutions to increasing automation of manufacturing jobs ""garbage and nonsense,"" Yang repeated his usual catchphrase to close his speech. ""The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math,"" Yang said. ""I think we are doing some hot yoga here tonight!"" Tim Ryan told the crowd after Clyburn said the Ohio congressman was a fan of hot yoga. Ryan's main message to the crowd was ""the middle class has been getting screwed for the past 40 years"" with production jobs disappearing across the country. By focusing on workers like these, Ryan argued the ""center of gravity"" of the Democratic Party will move ""back to the middle of the country and in the South."" -- Bo Erickson Michael Bennet, one of the lesser-known candidates in the race, spent most of his speech attacking President Trump. ""In my view, we have a president who doesn't care about America. He doesn't love anybody but himself,"" the Colorado senator said, to laughs from the audience. In one of the longer speeches of the evening -- over three minutes long -- Bernie Sanders highlighted his signature campaign promises, including Medicare for All and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. ""We're going to bring our people together around an agenda that works for all of us, not just the 1%,"" Sanders said. He also talked about reducing student debt and making public colleges tuition-free. He ended his speech by telling the audience that ""we are the 99%,"" and that the 99% has far more power than the 1%. Notably, Sanders was the only candidate so far to not wear a Clyburn campaign t-shirt. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro invoked the 2015 shooting at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine congregants were killed. Castro noted the shooter, who was white, was apprehended by police ""without incident."" ""What about Eric Gardner? And what about Stephon Clark?"" Castro questioned as he continued to list other black Americans shot by police. ""We're going to be fearless to make sure this country works for everyone,"" he added. -- Bo Erickson ""The shortest speech Joe Biden ever made,"" is what host Jim Clyburn called Biden's less-than-one minute address to Fish Fry attendees tonight. Biden said over the years of campaigning in South Carolina, and attending this gathering, it ""seems like I have lived in South Carolina."" The former vice president also reminisced about missing long-time South Carolina Sen. Fritz Hollings. -- Bo Erickson In his brief speech, Cory Booker emphasized the importance of unity in the Democratic Party -- even if he is not the Democratic nominee. ""This election is not about one person and one office, it's about who we are as a nation and who we must be to each other,"" Booker said. ""We all must make sure that we may be in the midst of a primary but when the primary is over we become a united force."" Booker, who has widely proclaimed his love for ""dad jokes,"" ended his brief speech with a corny fish fry-themed quip. ""Let's not flounder, let's get out there and kick some bass,"" he said. Elizabeth Warren arrived at the fish fry saying she was excited to eat some fish and drink some beer. ""I hope there's beer,"" she told reporters. ""Michelob Ultra."" She was greeted by supporters who were chanting ""L-I-Z, she has a plan for me!"" When asked whether Joe Biden should apologize for his comments earlier this week about his past relationships with segregationist lawmakers, Warren said she was not attending the event to criticize her fellow Democrats. She also said that the new sexual assault allegations against President Trump do not surprise her. -- Eleanor Watson John Delaney defended his moderate policy proposals in an interview with Elaine Quijano and Major Garrett, saying that unlike some of the other candidates in the race, he would not offer ""impossible promises."" Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland who announced his campaign in 2017, said that he believed there are two categories of candidates in the race: ""people who are promising things that don't make sense or are never going to happen,"" and candidates who would put forth ""real solutions."" Criticizing candidates like Bernie Sanders, Delaney said that he believed running on a socialist platform against President Trump is ""risky."" CBS News pollster Anthony Salvanto and Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright spoke to South Carolina Democratic voters about what they want to see from the presidential candidates flocking to their state. ""You need to be there,"" said one voter, about how candidates can appeal to local voters. Kamala Harris responded to criticism from Jim Clyburn that she had not done enough to lay out her policy proposals for South Carolina voters, encouraging him to come to her events. According to recent CBS News polling, Harris and Cory Booker both lag well behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in South Carolina. In an interview with NBC News this week, Clyburn said he was surprised that Harris and Booker, who are both black, hadn't caught on in the state. Clyburn, widely seen as the most influential Democrat in South Carolina, said there's ""been a little bit of amazement to me as well, because I thought for sure that there would be much more of a surge and I can't quite figure that out yet."" He added that Harris hasn't ""spelled out the policy stuff with her vision."" In response, Harris told reporters Friday: ""I would like him to come to some of my events so he can hear them."" ""I'm very proud of our policies and I'm told that we actually have among probably the top two or top three of all the candidates, the most policies that we rolled out in pretty significant details,"" Harris said. State Rep. JA Moore, who has endorsed Harris, told CBSN that he believes enthusiasm will grow for Harris as she continues to visit the state. ""As we get to know her, I guarantee those numbers will come up,"" Moore said about her poll numbers. Democratic presidential candidates are urging caution when it comes to Iran, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone in what the U.S. says is international airspace. Late Thursday night, the president ordered a strike on Iran, but backed off, he said, after learning the likely human toll. Candidates are hoping President Trump, who campaigned on getting the U.S. out of wars in the Middle East, will turn to diplomacy rather than aggressive military action. Mr. Trump said the strike he was ""cocked and loaded"" for -- which he said could have killed 150 people -- was not ""proportional"" to the drone strike carried out by Iran. Read more about presidential candidates' reactions to escalating tensions with Iran here. Seth Moulton, a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, said he would respond to Iran shooting down an American drone with a ""targeted, clear response,"" and that President Trump's decision to call off a retaliatory strike on Iran showed that the president ""has no strategy."" Moulton, who served in the military in Afghanistan, said that he would do a targeted cyberattack in Iran in retaliation. Moulton also pointed out the importance of addressing foreign policy in a presidential platform. ""It's not just enough to criticize Trump, we have to show how we will lead,"" Moulton said. ""He's weak as a commander in chief. I don't know why I'm the only candidate in the race who's taking him on as commander in chief."" Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Ohio, weighed in on Joe Biden's comments this week touting his relationships with segregationists while he was in the Senate. ""I don't know that he should apologize,"" Fudge, who is black, told CBS News' Major Garrett. However, she noted that ""when you decide to be on the biggest stage in the world, you have to be very, very careful"" when making comments about race. ""There's a sensitivity that is important, especially for people of color, because we have always been the most loyal base of this party,"" Fudge said. Fudge believes that Biden will directly or indirectly address the comments he made earlier this week during his speech at the fish fry, particularly since the majority of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina is black. Fudge said that she wasn't endorsing Biden, although she said that she ""liked"" him and had known him a long time. ""I've not decided to endorse anyone yet. It's coming soon,"" she teased. In an interview with CBS News' Ed O'Keefe Friday afternoon, Kirsten Gillibrand pushed back against criticism that she had equated anti-abortion activism to racism in an interview with the Des Moines Register earlier in June. In the interview with the Register, Gillibrand compared nominating anti-abortion rights judges to nominating judges with racist beliefs. Gillibrand has previously said that she would only nominate judges who support abortion rights to the federal bench. ""Imagine saying that it's okay to appoint a judge who's racist, or anti-Semitic, or homophobic,"" she continued. ""Asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America ... I don't think those are political issues anymore."" ""All these efforts by President Trump and other ultra-radical, conservative judges and justices to impose their faith on Americans is contrary to our Constitution,"" Gillibrand told the Register. O'Keefe questioned Gillibrand about these comments, asking for clarification. ""What I was saying is, as president of the United States, I would only appoint judges or justices that see Roe v. Wade -- that it's been precedent, law of the land for over 40 years,"" Gillibrand said, adding that to ""take away"" a woman's right to an abortion ""undermines our civil rights and our human rights. And I don't think there's a place in our party for candidates that don't understand that these are basic human rights."" She also said that people in the Democratic Party with anti-abortion rights beliefs should not run for president. ""I don't think as a Democrat they should, because they're literally saying, 'Women of America don't deserve human rights. Women of America don't have the agency to make the most important decision of their lives,'"" Gillibrand said. One of the major candidates is missing tonight -- Pete Buttigieg. His absence is no slight to Jim Clyburn. It's an attempt to avoid bad optics. Buttigieg is back in South Bend, where he is mayor, handling the aftermath of a police officer's shooting of a black resident, which has sparked protests in the African-American community in South Bend. Clyburn told CBSN's Elaine Quijano in an interview before the event that Buttigieg had personally contacted him to explain why he had to miss the fish fry. Clyburn said he understood.""I know a little about that, where we've had police shootings...I know what he's going through and I wish him well,"" said Clyburn. Major Garrett said that even though Buttigieg's absence is driven by the shooting, his absence in South Carolina has been noticed and ""is now a topic of conversation."" -- Emily Tillett  As 21 presidential candidates descend on Rep. Clyburn's fish fry (which he thinks may set an attendence record), the South Carolina kingmaker says that the contenders need to focus on accessibility and affordability in their policy proposals. ""I've been saying ,what we're trying to do is try to pick a presidential candidate who can make the greatness of this country accessible and affordable for all of its citizens. Whatever they talk about I'd hope they'd get out of the clouds and get down to where people are,"" Clyburn told CBSN's Elaine Quijano. ""If you're gonna talk about health care, answer the question, 'How will I make it accessible -- how will I make it affordable?"" he explained. He advised candidates to be as explicit as possible about their plans for Americans and South Carolina voters when they make their pitches this weekend. -- Emily Tillett Some 3,000 people are expected to show up, with  Clyburn and Rep. Joe Cunningham kicking off the fish fry  with speeches. Candidates are expected to give the crowd shorter versions of their stump speeches. Here is the list of candidates attending the fish fry: Food often presents a campaign trail hazard for presidential candidates. Ask John Kerry, who infamously ordered Swiss cheese with his cheesesteak in Philadelphia. Or Mitt Romney, who misspoke about his ""cheesy grits"" in Mississippi. In the last election, John Kasich found himself pilloried for eating his pizza with a knife and fork. The fish fry features fish dredged in cornmeal, flour and spices and then cooked in vats of hot oil and served on a slice of white bread with hot sauce. Clyburn may not be endorsing anyone, but he's at least helping candidates avoid fish fry food flubs. He tweeted instructions and a short video of former President Obama eating at the fish fry when he was a candidate. ""How to properly eat fish at a fish fry: Step 1: Get your fish, Step 2: Wrap fish in white bread, Step 3: Apply hot sauce, Step 4: Enjoy,"" Clyburn wrote. How to properly eat fish at a fish fry: Step 1: Get your fishStep 2: Wrap fish in white breadStep 3: Apply hot sauceStep 4: Enjoy pic.twitter.com/E9oWPJe1bL Organizers ordered 4,400 pounds of fish and 6,400 slices of bread to feed the masses. Clyburn, who is the most powerful African American in the House, holds the position of a political kingmaker in the state. His fish fry, which he has hosted for nearly 30 years, has become a key campaign stop for presidential candidates, especially after South Carolina officially became an early primary state in 2008. Although he declined to make an endorsement in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Clyburn endorsed Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016. Days before the fish fry, Joe Biden attracted controversy when he talked about his relationship with James Eastland, a Mississippi senator and noted segregationist, at a fundraiser in New York City Tuesday. Biden referenced Eastland while arguing for more civility in Washington. ""I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,"" Biden told the crowd. ""He never called me 'Boy.' He always called me 'Son.'"" Eastland, the longtime chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ardently opposed the civil rights movement  and was an avowed white supremacist. ""At least there was some civility,"" Biden said in his remarks Tuesday. ""We got things done. We didn't agree on much of anything. We got things done."" Today, he said, ""You look at the other side and you're the enemy."" On Wednesday, some of his Democratic opponents criticized him for the remarks and a couple even called on him to apologize. Biden said Wednesday, ""The point I'm making is you don't have to agree. You don't have to like the people in terms of their views but you just simply make the case and you beat them."" He did not apologize, declaring instead, ""There's not a racist bone in my body."" -- Bo Erickson, Zachary Hudak and Alan He A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll published Thursday found that Biden is the top choice among South Carolina Democrats, garnering 45% support from party voters. Most African-Americans are considering Biden and half are considering Bernie Sanders. A third of black voters are considering supporting Kamala Harris. However, the poll was conducted before Biden made his remarks about working with segregationist senators in the past. Biden's ties to President Barack Obama are helping boost him to the front of the pack in South Carolina and across early voting states. More than eight in 10 (including most whites and blacks) say his history as President Obama's vice president is a reason they are considering backing him, outranking things like his policy stances and his time in the Senate. -- Jennifer De Pinto First published on June 22, 2019 / 9:13 AM © 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

413,https://townhall.com/columnists/gavinwax/2019/06/23/kyle-kashuv-harvard-and-the-death-of-nuance-n2548780,"Source: AP Photo/Michael Conroy This week Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the February 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida, announced that Harvard had rescinded his admission. The reason—past racist comments he had allegedly made in private texts leaked to the media. Predictably, the Right reacted with shock and outrage. Many lamented the fact that a 19-year-old and the survivor of a mass shooting wasn’t shown a shred of mercy by the Harvard bigwigs for benign comments he made when he was 16 years of age. It’s worth explaining why someone who’s committed one of the most egregious sins of our era—bigotry should be shown some scrupulousness in the examination of his case as well as forgiveness. In pursuing this question it would be wise to first examine similar cases of retribution. There is precedent for this kind of behavior on the part of universities: in June 2017, Harvard rescinded the admission of several students over leaked messages exchanged in a group chat. The offending content included “racist” and sexually-explicit memes. Across the pond, British students at Warwick University faced expulsion when sexually-charged messages about various female students were also leaked. In both cases the conversations were entirely private, and none of the students were documented to have engaged in the behavior which they discussed or acted on the sentiments which they expressed. Likewise, no one has shown Kashuv to be a rabid racist, much less a danger to anyone (including his potential peers). It’s also not clear how racist words or opinions exchanged in private, without malice, on a virtual medium, are academically disqualifying. But the distinction between private speech and public action appears to have been utterly lost on the intelligentsia staffing Harvard and the liberal media more generally. To them, nuance is a privilege they cannot afford anyone guilty of bigotry, and most especially racism. Virginia Governor Ralph Northup, recently accused of dressing in blackface in a yearbook photo, faced an avalanche of calls for his resignation from his own party. Although he weathered the storm and retained his office despite the wishes of his political superiors, it is telling that he too was denied the privilege of nuance. Northup had, by his own (initial) admission, committed the unforgivable offense of dressing in blackface; that enough is grounds for his un-personing. Extenuating circumstances—such as the fact that his dressing in blackface at the time was likely college-aged humor in poor taste—don’t matter when the accusation in question deals with racism. The contentious cases of Kashuv and Northup ultimately beg the question: Why is racism the modern heresy of the 21st Century? Why is the mere appearance of racism, or the form of racism regardless of context, an immediately damnable offense, not warranting forgiveness? The same people who unequivocally demand the firing or expulsion or de-platforming of people like Steven Crowder for perceived bigotry are the same people who go to great lengths to elaborate all the reasons women might seek abortions, and why abortion is distinct from infanticide outside the womb. Nuance—and empathy—aren’t lacking there. The most telling aspect of a society are its sacred cows—those things which it most vehemently defends, and whose offenders it most vehemently prosecutes. In the Middle Ages, during the time of the Inquisition, the one inviolable dogma was that of the Christian (Catholic) Church. Those who denied any integral part of the faith by word or deed faced not only social ostracism, but an investigation by ecclesiastical authorities and punishment by the state. But the most overlooked aspects of the Inquisition are both its nuance and empathy. Rather than face a trial by secular authorities without theological training (a rather common method of passing judgment on heretics in Europe at the time), the accused under an Inquisitorial investigation would at the very least have a right to competent trial. Though he (or she) was often tortured and therefore induced into giving a confession, the Catholic Church always allowed the condemned access to the sacrament of confession and very often urged clemency on the part of the secular authorities. In short, even the medieval Inquisition, with all its fabled cruelties and abuses, offered more nuance and empathy than our modern-day liberal overlords. Though the stakes are not nearly as high—Kashuv has not been executed, only denied admission to an Ivy League university—the heretics of our day are treated more harshly than the heretics of yore. In order for anti-racism to avoid becoming a kind of Christianity without forgiveness—the religious zeal with which the Left crusades against all forms of bigotry cannot help but spur one on to such a comparison—Harvard and the mainstream media ought to treat real and possible cases of racism with a more compassionate hand. Kashuv deserves a means to an appeal, and maybe, just maybe, the forgiveness of all those who were offended by his actions. Anyone in his position would surely desire the same.

414,https://pjmedia.com/faith/chick-fil-a-emerges-triumphant-despite-political-battles/,"Chick-fil-A has had a difficult year. In March, liberal outlets slammed the restaurant chain’s charitable foundation for funding Christian organizations “with a history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination.” Then the San Antonio airport banned the restaurant for seven years and the Buffalo airport followed soon after. Yet in May and June, the tide turned rather decisively. The FAA’s Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation into the airport bans. Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) signed S.B. 1978, a law preventing Texas government actors from discriminating against religious groups or those who associate with them — a bill known as the “Save Chick-fil-A Bill.” Yet the biggest coup came this past week. According to a Nation Restaurant News study published Monday, Chick-fil-A was the fastest-growing restaurant chain in America over the past year. The chicken joint took third place among all U.S. restaurants in sales — with a whopping $10.46 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chick-fil-A’s simple menu and its excellent customer service have propelled it into the top three. Some estimates suggest Chick-fil-A may surpass Starbucks, which took the number 2 slot with $20.49 billion in sales. Only McDonald’s, with $38.52 billion in sales is safely out of reach. Chick-fil-A is poised to become the third-biggest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, trailing only McDonald's and Starbucks https://t.co/n56j9TVs0j — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) June 19, 2019  There may be a political and even spiritual dimension to Chick-fil-A’s success, however. The chicken joint is famously closed on Sundays and has a corporate mission to “glorify God.” Conservative Americans flocked to the restaurant chain when controversy over LGBT issues broke out in 2012. That year, CEO Dan Cathy said the U.S. was “inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and we say we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage.” This infuriated LGBT activists, who also discovered that the WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded in 1984 by Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, donated money to socially conservative charities such as Eagle Forum, Focus on the Family, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Family Research Council (FRC), Exodus International, and the Marriage & Family Legacy Fund. Activists denounced this funding as contributions to “anti-gay groups,” and indeed such organizations support the traditional Bible definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. These organizations have been demonized, with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) accusing FRC of being a “hate group” — an accusation that inspired a terrorist to attempt a mass shooting in 2012. After a nationwide boycott — and a conservative rush to buy at Chick-fil-A called “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,” led by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) — the company apologized for its comments and the WinShape Foundation stopped funding the “anti-gay” organizations. In 2018, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to apologize after eating Chick-fil-A during June, the designated LGBT Pride Month. Earlier this year, liberal outlets continued to slam Chick-fil-A over donations to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army. As Vox noted, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes requires its employees to refrain from “homosexual acts,” since the Bible clearly condemns such acts as sinful. The Salvation Army also upholds the biblical understanding of sexuality. It turned down $3.5 million in San Francisco city contracts due to requirements that city contractors provide spousal benefits to same-sex partners of employees. Casting such stances on conscience as “anti-gay” or “anti-LGBT bigotry” is a growing trend on the left. The case of Christian baker Jack Phillips is illustrative. Phillips gladly serves all people who enter his shop, and will sell pastries to LGBT people without a second thought. Yet he routinely turns down requests for him to lend his artistic talents to create special cakes for various occasions he disagrees with, particularly the holiday of Halloween, which is often lucrative for bakers. When a same-sex couple requested a custom cake for their wedding, Phillips refused due to his religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he had discriminated against the couple on the basis of sexual orientation. Members of the commission compared Phillips’ refusal to the abuse of Christianity in Nazi Germany, even though Phillips’s own father liberated concentration camps. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phillips, 7-2. Yet a transgender lawyer called to request a custom cake celebrating his gender transition, and Phillips again refused. The commission went after him again. The commission dropped this second case in March. The same transgender lawyer sued Phillips this month. Of people like Phillips — who gladly serve LGBT people but will not use their artistic talent to endorse same-sex marriage or gender identity — LGBT megadonor Tim Gill said, “We’re going to punish the wicked.” The continued attacks on Phillips and on Chick-fil-A are quite illustrative. If Chick-fil-A stops funding FRC and other groups, activists will fault it for funding the Salvation Army. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Jack Phillips, LGBT activists will find another way to target him. Yet Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in 2012 set a new record for the chain in 2012, and the chicken joint has emerged triumphant again this year. Despite controversy, the restaurant has a powerful business model, and the more religious among us might say God is rewarding its faithfulness. Perhaps it should keep funding Christian organizations despite the “anti-gay” branding. Follow Tyler O’Neil, the author of this article, on Twitter at @Tyler2ONeil.

SOUTH BEND, Indiana—Democratic Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg strode off the campaign trail and directly into the full force of constituent anger on Sunday, when a town hall held to discuss the police shooting death of a black man descended into shouts, heckling and demands for police reform. The mayor’s appearance on his home turf, which took place just hours after a mass shooting at a pub that killed one and injured at least 10 more, was in response to the police killing Eric Logan, a black man, near central South Bend. “I just want you to know that we’re not running from this.” Buttigieg said to room. “Of course I’m upset. A man died in this city at the hands of one of the people in charge of protecting the city. “I’m not commenting on who did what, with or without policy or what was legal or whatever. I can only describe it as a demon that is in so many parts of American life... and to know that part of my job is to be there for that—to listen—to have that poured on me, to have even people I agree with hurl all of their anguish and frustration at me because I represent the city because I represent this problem, of course I’m going to feel that.” The investigation into the shooting is still in its early stages and prosecutors are looking at any criminality by the police officer. According to South Bend police, Sergeant Ryan O’Neill was responding to a reported car break-in, and said Logan, whom he discovered with his legs sticking out of a car, wielded a knife and refused orders to put it down, the South Bend Tribune reports, while approaching O’Neill “with the knife raised.” O’Neill reportedly shot twice, striking Logan once in the abdomen. He was transported to the hospital by police cruiser, where he died. But O’Neill’s body camera was not on, which has led to significant skepticism of the police’s version of events. Police have argued that because O’Neill did not turn on his emergency lights, neither his body camera nor his dashboard camera were automatically activated, the South Bend Tribune reports, and that O’Neill did not later turn on his body camera because he was verifying if Logan owned the car he was discovered in. “You can sense the pain not only around this incident … and not only around our city but what’s happening everywhere, when it comes to the disempowerment that so many black Americans have felt in relation to the police,” Buttigieg told reporters after the event. “When you lead a city and it’s hurting, you take that on board all the time, but you especially take that on board at a time like this.” But South Bend has struggled with racial issues in recent years. Critics of a policy that targeted vacant homes for demolition say it burdened black homeowners, who inherited those properties but could not maintain them. South Bend has also been roiled by Buttigieg’s decision to fire the city’s black police chief in early 2012 following allegations that he had taped subordinates using racist language, which soon grew into a wiretapping dispute. Buttigieg, speaking to reporters on Sunday, addressed racial tensions both in his city and around the country directly. “This problem has to get solved in my lifetime,” Buttigieg told reporters. “I don’t know of a person or a city that has solved it, but I know that if we do not solve it in my lifetime, it will sink America. And if nothing else, I hope people know that I am motivated, not out of some theoretical concern or some political imperative, but as somebody whose city is hurting.” “What I hope African Americans watching this see is that our city is facing this. We’re not running away from it. This isn’t theoretical for us, this isn’t something being debated in Washington,” he added. “This is our problem, as it is a problem in so many places. And we are on the front lines of it. And we’re doing everything we know how.” When Buttigieg and South Bend Police Chief Scott Ruszkowski strode on stage, a murmuring crowd grew tense and quiet. It wasn’t until the town hall’s moderator, local NAACP president Michael Patton, asked for applause to “give God some glory” that the crowd obliged. But during the course of the roughly 90-minute town hall, that tension grew from muttered interjections to full-on shouting. When Buttigieg explained the police department had made strides forward—like improving online transparency and disciplinary standards—one crowd member shouted “it’s not enough!” It was just the beginning. One man, shouting as stormed down an aisle of the high school auditorium seized the microphone from a fellow speaker. Voices continually interjected in anger, like when Patton, the town hall’s moderator, turned to Buttigieg and Ruszkowski and asked how to bring trust back to the police force. “Fire the chief!” one person shouted. “Why you askin’ them?” roared another. The mayor, for his part, said he would welcome scrutiny of the case, including from the Department of Justice or from a special local prosecutor, and accepted responsibility for multiple failures in local law enforcement. “We have tried, but not succeeded to increase diversity in the police department,” he said. “And while body cameras have been implemented across the police department, there is frustration, which I share, that they were not there when we needed them the most.” Though police defenders appeared to be few in attendance, there appeared to be a racial divide in the reactions town hall attendees had to leaders’ comments. When the moderator called for calm, for example, many white guests clapped, while many black attendees sat silently. But regardless of race, the overwhelming majority of attendees were upset about Logan’s death. “I lived for most of my life in Virginia, and I used to represent as a lawyer the Virginia State Police,” Michael McManus, an attendee who now lives just outside South Bend, said before the event began. “And the state police’s job was to protect the citizens. It seems to me … at least what I’ve seen so far in the newspaper, that’s not what happened.” How Buttigieg handles the situation has come under the national scope as his presidential campaign has managed to credibly compete with some of the bigger names in Democratic politics. The campaign raised $7 million in April alone, and he’s polling more than a point ahead of Trump in a head-to-head matchup according to multiple political research firms. But he has yet to seize anything close to control of the race, running behind Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden—by significant margins. Buttigieg also said that, although he has stepped off the campaign trail, he still plans to participate in the first set of Democratic debates later this week. And despite the rancor at the town hall event, some of Buttigieg’s fans came out to see him, like Sparky Tavis, who lives just outside South Bend. She said she doesn’t blame the mayor for the shooting. “I won’t think anything differently (afterwards), because I don’t think he’s responsible,” she said before the event. “Sure, he’s the mayor of South Bend, but not being—I think the chief of police, I think there’s other people who are responsible.”",2019-06-23 20:05:27,Racial Tensions Flare at Mayor Pete Town Hall on Police Killing of Black Man,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
417,https://abcnews.go.com/US/students-country-world-part-national-school-walkout-today/story?id=53712013&cid=social_twitter_abcnp,"The event began at 10 a.m. today across every time zone and last 17 minutes. Students across the country rally in National School Walkouts to end gun violence Thousands of high school students, many still far from voting age, are streaming out of schools across the country today to protest against gun violence in the wake of last month’s mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people. “I’m just mad there’s no action by our government representatives,” Daniel Rogov, a junior in Brooklyn, New York, said today. “It’s all thoughts and prayers; it’s all talk,” he told ABC News. “After a gun violence tragedy there’s a speech talking about how we need change but there never is change.” The event, which began at 10 a.m. across every time zone, was officially scheduled to last 17 minutes -- one minute for each of the victims gunned down in the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But many students are rallying for much longer. To the students at Stoneman Douglas, Daniel's message is, “Keep making your voices heard. While the politicians might stop talking about this, we’re not done.” Over 3,000 walkout events were registered to take part in today's call on Congress to pass tighter gun control laws, according to ENOUGH National School Walkout, the event organizers. The walkouts are across the nation, from Michigan to Maryland, from Colorado to California, and from the White House to Washington state. ""Remember why we are walking out,"" Stoneman Douglas survivor Lauren Hogg wrote on Twitter today. ""We are walking out for my friends that passed, all children that have been taken because of gun violence. We are walking out for the empty desks in my classes, and the unsaid goodbyes. This epidemic of School shootings must stop."" In Washington, D.C., a huge crowd of chanting students gathered in front of the White House. Once the clock struck 10 a.m., the students silently sat down with their backs to the White House. Even though most teenagers can’t vote, “we just want the White House to hear us,” Abby Silverman of Bethesda, Maryland, told ABC News outside the White House. Kevin Butler told ABC News he came to the White House to “make sure there are stricter gun laws,” and even though the president wasn’t there during the sit-in, Kevin thinks their voices will be heard. From the White House, the students marched to a rally at Capitol Hill. At one Evanston, Illinois, school, about 3,000 of the 3,500 students walked out, the school said. “We should come to school and be protected, not where we have to come to school and fear for our lives,” Evanston student Alexis Harris Dyer told ABC News ""We are all gathered together to show that we care, to show that we have voices. We are young people and we are passionate about what we have to say.” At the massive walkout was a massive call-in, as students flooded lawmaker's offices all at once with calls for gun reform. “I’m a high school constituent of [Gov.] Bruce Rauner,"" one teen said on the phone. ""I’m calling to request that you take action to reform our nations gun laws.” “Often our words are ignored,"" Dyer said, ""So I think this is a way where we can actually be taken seriously.” Student Emma Stein added, “I hope to inspire the next generation of voters and get young people engaged in the political process and to hold their representatives accountable. ... As long as there’s a threat of mass shootings in schools, I think students will remain very dedicated to the issue.” At a rally in Denver, high schooler Jlynn Terroade said, ""It's really important for students to exercise their rights and be activists for what they believe in. That's what today was all about."" ""Our Second Amendment seems to seem to care about guns more than students,"" Terroade told ABC News. ""We have to empower ourselves."" Another Colorado student, Adriana Strode, added, ""You don't want your brother, sister, your daughter to be the next victims of a mass shooting. ... We're here to open people's eyes so they can see this is a big issue."" Women’s March Youth Coordinator Tabitha St. Bernard Jacobs, one of the few adult allies guiding the students in the youth-led movement, told ABC News before the event that while the walkout was sparked by the Florida school shooting, the event is about pressuring Congress to act against gun violence overall. She said the walkout was a way to shed light on the kind of gun violence that exists not just in schools but every day, like shootings that affect communities of color or devastate cities like Chicago. How participants spent those 17 minutes of the walkout was up to them, St. Bernard Jacobs said. Some people were doing a lie-in, while others held rallies, she said. Thousands of miles away from Parkland, Florida, at a Southern California school, students placed 17 empty desks in the quad, each with a flower and a picture for the 17 shooting victims. At one Michigan high school, the names of all school-shooting victims were read as students walked out in silence, according to the school. Students from around the world were also eager to participate. Students at the Zurich International School in Switzerland took part, gathering outside in the shape of a peace sign. Students snapped this photo via a drone. ""I'm really proud of our two students who organized the event and took the photos,"" Upper School Principal John Switzer said via email. Izzy Harris, a student at the American School in London, said students at her school, including herself, walked out ""to demonstrate that the U.S. government needs to make changes to their gun laws."" ""Although we are not directly affected in the U.K., a number of us are American and have many connections to the U.S.,"" she told ABC News via video. While many school districts were supportive of the protests, some schools had threatened to discipline students participating in walkouts. At the high school on a South Korean base where U.S. military forces are stationed, officials warned students not to walk out, saying policy prohibits protests on U.S. military installations. ""Seoul American High School will maintain a roster of any students who walks out of class and will provide that list to the Yongsan Garrison Command Team to determine if any further steps are warranted,"" Principal Donald Toy Williams Jr. wrote in a memo to parents and sponsors posted on the school's Facebook page today. ""We would also like to note that any student who leaves campus during the walkout time will be dealt with by the military police who will take their name, information, and then escort them back into school control immediately."" In Plainfield, Illinois, where some students had planned to walk out, doing so came with a guideline. Students who wanted to participate in the walkout also had to attend an after-school discussion with state legislators to discuss issues that relate to school violence, like the political process, school safety, gun control and what influences politicians, Plainfield School District Superintendent Lane Abrell told ABC News. A student who walked out but did not attend the discussion with state legislators would get a one-hour detention, Abrell said. Abrell said the walkout ""in my opinion ... doesn't really solve the issue,"" and the meeting with local legislators is a way for students who genuinely are passionate about the cause to learn how school violence issues can be solved. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said schools could punish students for missing class for walkouts, but the punishment should only be because students missed school and not as a harsher punishment because the students participated in a protest. Dozens of colleges and universities had said they won't penalize applicants who are peaceful student protesters. ABC News' Ali Rogin, Connor Burton, Elizabeth Mclaughlin, Katherine Carroll, Frank Elaridi, Rachel Katz, Doug Lantz, Andy Fies, Dennis Powell, Fergal Gallagher, Armando Garcia, Evan McMurry and Samantha Reilly contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-23 22:30:29.869228,Energized students rally in National School Walkouts across US to end gun violence,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
418,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heading-final-campaign-blitz-trump-cements-central-role/story?id=58849968&cid=social_twitter_tw,"President Trump will hold 11 rallies in the final six days of the midterms. Trump says he's been 'toned down' in his political rhetoric  No, Donald Trump is not on the ballot on Nov. 6, but that fact hasn't stopped him from playing a central role in a midterm election that will decide control of both houses of Congress and possibly determine the success of much of his legislative agenda. Now, with less than a week until voters decide the fate of 35 U.S. Senate seats, 435 U.S. House seats and 36 gubernatorial seats, Trump is embracing a final chance to take center stage. The flurry of campaign activity for the commander in chief that has been steadily increasing as Election Day approaches will kick into hyperdrive on Wednesday in Fort Myers, Florida, as he begins a period of attending 11 rallies in just six days, hoping to drive home a closing argument rooted in both positive economic numbers and the same immigration scare tactics that defined so much of his 2016 campaign. In the campaign's closing weeks, the president has tried to paint the Democratic Party not as a political opponent, but as an unruly mob hellbent on throwing the country into chaos and squalor. ""The Democratic party has become an angry, ruthless, unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary,"" Trump said at a rally in Elko, Nevada, on Oct. 20. ""Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs,"" Trump said at a recent rally in Houston for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. The president has spent less time discussing the recent mass shooting in Pittsburgh and an attempt by a crazed Trump supporter to bomb various prominent Democratic figures and news media organizations, which sparked a national conversation about the impact his words are having on American political society. All told, Trump will have held a grand total of 44 ""Make America Great Again"" rallies in 23 states between March and November, according to an analysis by ABC News of his schedule -- a torrid pace for a president whose party is holding a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and that likely will lose control of the U.S. House. Trump has also unleashed a steady and consistent stream of endorsements via his Twitter feed, calling out 11 House Republicans on Monday in the same fashion he has all cycle, referring to the candidates as “Strong on crime,” or big supporters of “the military and our great Vets.” Trump's unfiltered rhetoric on social media and the campaign trail, his penchant for controversial decisions on immigration and foreign policy and the constant churn of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has caused constant headaches for Republican candidates, and fodder for their Democratic challengers. That combination resulted in an uptick in Democratic primary turnout and potential electoral gains big enough to fuel the party's hopes of potentially retaking the U.S. House in November. ""The biggest single effect Trump has had on the 2018 elections is to energize Democrats as well as other anti-Trump voters,"" Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told ABC News. ""Usually, the Democratic coalition, especially minorities and young people, fails to show up in midterm elections at the same rate as whites and older voters, the core of the GOP base. Yet if current trends hold, Democrats are poised to outvote Republicans in November because they are determined to register their disapproval of Trump and the GOP."" Whether it's the caravan of Central American migrants heading for the U.S.-Mexico border, the painfully divisive confirmation hearings of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh or the murder of a prominent Saudi journalists, Trump lacks the inhibition that his predecessors have shown in offering his own straightforward view of world events. It's a characteristic that has time and time again destabilized an already hectic election season, political experts say. In 2018 alone, Trump has, in various capacities as president, visited all 18 states with races included in ABC News' 18 for 18 contests, and has made multiple visits to states with particularly competitive Senate races like Montana, West Virginia, Nevada and Florida. Trump has also used Twitter to weigh in on 14 of the 18 races ABC News has identified as indicative of the key storylines defining the midterms. In recent weeks Trump also has made visits to states and particular districts that he won in 2016 but where Republican support has seemingly wavered. This past weekend, the president traveled to Murphysboro, Illinois, in the state’s 12th Congressional District, which is represented by GOP Rep. Mike Bost. Also in attendance at the rally was GOP Rep. Rodney Davis, whose congressional district, the 13th, lies just north of Bost's. Our partners at FiveThirtyEight rate both races as ""Lean Republican,"" and the Democratic challengers to Bost and Davis have out-fundraised the GOP incumbents this cycle, according to FEC records. For Trump, the message for why Illinois voters should back someone like Bost is not hard to understand. ""A vote for Mike is really a continuation to make America great again. Very simple,"" Trump told the crowd. It's a message and a slogan the President is undoubtedly happy to repeat on the campaign trail. Vice President Mike Pence, whom one outside political adviser described as the ""tip of the spear"" of the White House's midterm strategy, has also been a regular on the campaign trail this cycle. In the past week, Pence has traveled to Arizona, Nevada and Michigan to boost Senate and House candidates. Pence heads to Ohio on Wednesday to campaign with congressional candidate Troy Balderson and gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine in Mansfield. ""Republicans want strong borders, no crime and no caravans, right?"" Trump asked the crowd at his Illinois rally over the weekend. ""We don't want caravans. We're not having caravans."" ""Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted this week ahead of his decision to send more than 5,000 troops to the southern border, ""Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!"" The president's desire to dominate the national debate, which attempts to do frequently through his Twitter feed, on key issues has, again and again, thrust him into the middle of historically heated policy battles in the lead up to the midterms. Immigration is no doubt at the top of that list, and the president's plan, announced in an interview with Axios earlier this week, to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on U.S. soil, could throw yet another wrench into a third-rail political issue. But the role of disrupter is one the president relishes and has played numerous times on the campaign trail. Trump and the Republican Party also have wielded the anger in the aftermath of the contentious and bitterly partisan Kavanaugh hearings as a political weapon in recent weeks, trying to put it at the forefront of GOP voters' minds ahead of Tuesday's vote. ""This will be the election of the caravans, the Kavanaughs, law and order, tax cuts and you know what else? It's going to be the election of common sense, because most of it's common sense,"" Trump declared at his Illinois rally. Trump's unabashed and unapologetic campaign style remains unique in American political history, but that hasn'tt stopped candidates across the country from attempting to emulate him. Candidates in crucial Senate races in Arizona and Indiana have all tied themselves to Trump and enthusiastically embraced his policies. Mike Braun, who branded himself a self-made businessman and political outsider who echoed Trump's ""Drain the Swamp"" mantra, successfully outdueled two sitting congressmen on the way to winning the GOP Senate nomination in Indiana. The anti-Trump fervor has led many Democrats, including one of their most prominent recruits this cycle, to push for Trump's impeachment. Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, hoping to make the Democratic dream of turning Texas blue a reality in 2018, said he would vote to impeach Trump in the wake of the president's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. O'Rourke defended his comments in a CNN town hall earlier this month and pointed to the president's handling of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia meddling in 2016 as grounds for impeachment. ""When, by broad daylight on Twitter, [Trump] asked his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to end the Russia investigation, I would say that's obstruction in action,"" O'Rourke said. While the 2018 midterms are rightly top of mind for most Americans, there are clear signals the president is already gearing up for what's sure to be an incredibly competitive and contentious re-election fight. He's already directly called out a number of Democrats reportedly considering 2020 presidential bids, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and billionaire Democratic activist Tom Steyer, goading his potential rivals with snarky tweets, referring to Warren as a ""phony"" and Steyer as a ""stumbling lunatic."" Trump's tweets and statements about his potential 2020 rivals demonstrate clearly that the day after Election Day next week, the 729 days that separate America from the next presidential contest cannot keep the campaign from beginning in earnest. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Trump cements his central role in the midterms in campaign blitz: ANALYSIS,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
419,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-improve-background-checks-budget-calls-cuts/story?id=53216967&cid=social_twitter_abcnp,"Trump will host a listening session with high schoolers impacted by shootings. Trump wants to make background checks more efficient: White House — -- While the White House has said President Donald Trump is “supportive of efforts” to update the nation’s background check system in the wake of the Florida high school shooting last week, the president's proposed budget for 2019 would actually roll back federal grants to help states in reporting to the national background check system. Under the proposed FY 2019 budget, which the administration rolled out just two days before the deadly Parkland, Fla. shooting that left 17 people dead, proposed federal spending for the grants that help states improve the completeness of the records they report to the federal database would be reduced from $73 million to $61 million — a $12 million decrease. An administration official insists that the president's budget fully funds the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and said the decrease in proposed funding is designed to match the level of spending requested by states that qualify for the grants. ""The FY 2019 President's Budget proposes to reduce funding for this program because the number of states eligible for NICS Act Record Improvement Program funding is not expected to increase and the $10.0 million request is sufficient to sustain the existing level of activity under this program,"" the official said, noting that the government only funded the states that were eligible and that some states have failed to produce required compliance plans related to reporting mental health records. President Trump, who sources tell ABC News has repeatedly said “we have to do something” in the wake of the Florida tragedy, announced on Tuesday that he directed his Justice Department to look into banning bump stocks, which were used in the Las Vegas shooting last year. The president has also expressed support for a bill introduced last year by Sen. John Cornyn, R–Texas, to update the background check system to ensure that states and federal agencies have up-to-date and accurate information on individuals prohibited from buying firearms. Cornyn introduced the bill, called the Fix NICS Act, last year following the Sutherland Springs mass shooting in his home state. The bill is co-sponsored by leading gun control advocate Sen. Chris Murphy, D–Conn., who saw 20 children killed in his home state in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. The bill, referring to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, is also endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Press secretary Sarah Sanders has said that “discussions are ongoing” but that “the president is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system."" While any action the administration takes in the wake of Florida is expected to stop short of any proposal that would amount to gun restrictions, Principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said late last week that “mental health and school safety” would be at the forefront of any policy prescriptions the administration may pursue. “The president wants to take leadership and actually fix this problem and create best practices across the country,” Shah said on FOX News late last week. On Wednesday, the president is set to host a “listening session” with high school students and community members impacted by the school shootings Parkland, Sandy Hook and Columbine communities. On Thursday, he will meet with state and local officials on the issue. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Trump says he wants to improve background checks but budget calls for cuts,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Trump to Florida shooting victims: 'Your suffering is our burden also' — -- President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the White House following a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead and 14 injured. ""Today I speak to a nation in grief. Yesterday a school filled with innocent children and caring teachers became the scene of terrible violence, hatred, and evil,"" Trump said. As consoler-in-chief, a role that has become all too familiar for modern presidents, Trump addressed a nation that has seen three of the deadliest mass shootings in the past year. This is the fourth time the president has spoken to the country in the aftermath of a shooting. ""Our entire nation with one heavy heart is praying for the victims and their families. To every parent, teacher and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do to ease your pain. We are all joined together as one American family. And your suffering is our burden also,"" he said. Standing in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, Trump also sought to console the parents of the young people who died in the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. A former high school student opened fire on students and teachers using an AR-15 rifle. ""No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning,"" Trump said. ""Each person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them. A life filled with wondrous beauty and unlimited potential and promise. Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give and talents to share with the world."" Trump directly addressed America's children during his remarks, telling them that they ""are never alone."" ""You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you. If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer or a faith leader,"" Trump said. ""Answer hate with love. Answer cruelty with kindness. We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life that creates deep and meaningful human connections and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors."" Trump has addressed the nation three times before in the wake of mass shootings — first, after the Congressional baseball shooting in Alexandria, Virginia that left Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana in critical condition, then, in October, after the worst mass shooting in American history in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in November, after the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. On Thursday, Trump said that he plans to work with his administration on securing schools and tackling the issue of mental health. In a proclamation, Trump ordered all flags to fly at half-staff ""as a mark of solemn respect for the victims of the terrible act."" Trump said that soon after the shooting, he spoke with Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Pam Bondi, the Attorney General of Florida, and Broward County Florida Sheriff Scott Israel. The president said he plans to visit Parkland to visit families and work on coordinating a federal response to the attack. Trump tweeted his condolences on Wednesday as the shooting unfolded. The president did not directly mention the debate over gun policy reform in his roughly six minute long speech. He also did not answer a reporter's shouted question ""Why does this keep happening in America? Will you do something about guns?"" As he has previously in the debate over how to prevent further mass shootings, the president largely focused on the issue of mental health. On Thursday, he pointed to the shooter's history of mental illness in a tweet. Former President Barack Obama, who during his tenure in office frequently expressed frustration over the lack of meaningful gun policy reform, tweeted that the most recent school shooting is another example of why action is needed. In his remarks, Trump seemed to direct his message squarely at those who have immediately called for restrictions on gun ownership in the wake of the shooting. “It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference, we must actually make that difference,” Trump said. “In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community and country.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Trump tells nation grieving school shooting 'We are here for you',,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
421,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-andrew-gillums-midterms-loss-in-florida-signals-for-the-democratic-party?mbid=social_twitter,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Jelani Cobb Just before 11 P.M. on a dreary Tuesday night, in Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida and the erstwhile hope of progressives across the country, took to the stage in front of Lee Hall, at Florida A. & M. University. The foreboding cloud cover mirrored the mood on the campus, where both Gillum, who is the mayor of Tallahassee, and his wife, R. Jai, had matriculated. Throughout his upstart campaign, in which he improbably defeated two better-established rivals in the primary to gain the nomination, Gillum has salted his speeches with references to his grandmother. This night was no different. When he went to school in the mornings, he told his supporters, his grandmother told him to pay attention to the lesson, so that he could bring it home with him. He’d told that story so often that “Bring It Home” had become a campaign slogan. In the earlier, more optimistic stretches of the evening, people who had gathered in front of a giant screen that had been set up on the campus chanted the phrase as they watched returns from pro-Gillum precincts roll in. But on Tuesday Gillum added a melancholy postscript to the story. “I sincerely regret that I couldn’t bring it home for you,” he said, as his wife, his lieutenant-governor running mate, Chris King, and King’s wife, Kristen, stood beside him. Gillum’s defeat came in contrast to the most recent polls, which showed him with a slight lead. Florida’s habitually close elections gave reason to believe that a Democratic win was possible. Despite a recent increase in Donald Trump’s approval rating in Florida, he remains underwater in the state. Gillum supported criminal-justice reform in an election that also saw a ballot initiative to restore voting rights to former felons who have served their time with the support of two-thirds of voters. (More than a million Floridians will have their voting rights restored.) He favored gun-reform legislation in a state where seventeen students and staff members were fatally shot at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland; and where, just four days before the election, a self-proclaimed misogynist shot six women, two of them fatally, and one man, in a Tallahassee yoga studio. The campaign also had a war chest worthy of a major campaign. The tall, sharp mayor with a plainspoken charm had garnered the attention—and the donations—of supporters from across the country. Gillum’s progressive inclinations also made him part of a larger national debate about the direction of the Democratic Party. The progressive wing cited his unanticipated win in the primaries as evidence of the waning appeal of centrism. That seemed to translate into a level of voter enthusiasm that favored the Democratic ticket in Florida. At precincts around Tallahassee, young people and first-time voters streamed to the polls. At Bethel A.M.E. Church, a low-slung brick building on West Orange Avenue, people ducked through the rain in clusters of three or four to cast their ballots. Early voting numbers had surged across the state, but particularly in the Democratic bastions of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties. Read all of The New Yorker’s election reporting and commentary. There were other motivators. In an election that was widely seen as a referendum on the President, the Republican nominee, Ron DeSantis, a forty-year-old former congressman, is a strong Trump supporter, and his campaign conjured echoes of Trump’s incendiary bigotry. DeSantis gave speeches at a conference organized by David Horowitz, who has said that the “only serious race war” in America is against white people. DeSantis’s warning to voters not to “monkey this up” was understood as an attempt to race-bait Gillum, though he denied it. Bizarre robo-calls using stereotypical slave dialect were made on DeSantis’s behalf, which he was forced to disavow. The first sign of trouble came literally over the horizon early in the evening. The sky opened and torrents of rain, punctuated by claps of thunder, fell in Tallahassee just in time to drench the after-work crowd, dampening both the ground and voter enthusiasm. The weather was particularly ominous for Gillum, whose campaign depended on strongholds like Tallahassee and Miami-Dade County to offset the tally in the disperse rural areas where DeSantis was expected to do well. Earlier in the day, Kristen Clarke, of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, reported that her organization had received reports of voting machines not working and of some voters being turned away. By noon, the office had received some five hundred complaints. Yet the election proved to be a game of turnout. Gillum suggested as much in his concession speech, when he said, “We may not have not all shown up in the way that we thought and hoped that we would, but I still believe that there are more of us who believe in what is common, and what is decent, and what is right.” The results of the election—assuming that DeSantis’s fifty-five-thousand-vote margin holds up after the absentee ballots are counted—throw many assumptions into flux. Democrats saw progressives like Gillum and Beto O’Rourke, in Texas, lose in close races. They also saw Claire McCaskill, a definitive centrist, lose her Senate race in Missouri. The debate about which direction the Party should pursue will likely continue. Donald Trump orchestrated a campaign of fearmongering in the final run-up to the elections, one that coincided with the mass shooting in Tallahassee as well as a murderous hate crime in Pittsburgh, a racist shooting in Kentucky, and a series of attempted bombings, yet Republican voters in many places remained undeterred. One consequence is that the larger Republican majority in the Senate will almost certainly insulate him from anything that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, finds in his probe, even if the newly Democratic-controlled House of Representatives finds impeachable offenses there. The Trump enigma has been whether his racist, sexist, belligerent nationalism represents an emerging nationwide political tendency, or whether he is a sui generis figure who is able to exist outside the norms of American politics, even as his most ardent allies in government must at least nominally remain inside them. Last night’s results suggest the former. In the longer term, the presence of a Republican governor in Florida will be a boon to the Republican nominee—presumably, Trump—in seeking Florida’s twenty-nine Electoral College votes in 2020. Elections are overseen by the secretary of state, who serves at the pleasure of the governor. Most acutely, the results mean that the idealistic, upbeat candidacy of the man who would have been Florida’s first black governor foundered on the shoals of division and racism. As Tuesday night wore on, more than one person suggested to me that November 6, 2018, had begun to feel a lot like November 8, 2016. Gillum, who is just thirty-nine, attempted to buoy his supporters’ spirits. “I am not going anywhere,” Gillum promised them. He would, he said, continue to fight on their behalf. The students and the volunteers on the A. & M. campus, standing in the rain, cheered his resolve, even as they conceded that they would have to witness history being made on another night.

422,https://abcnews.go.com/US/president-trumps-shifting-stance-assault-weapons/story?id=53197912&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"He once said he supported an assault weapons ban. Gun violence: By the numbers — -- President Donald Trump's position on gun control, particularly regarding assault rifles, has appeared to shift over the years. Trump in 2000 said he took a middle ground, supporting a ban on assault weapons though generally opposing gun control. Trump in 2015, however, was dismissive of calls to regulate assault rifles which, he said,0 are common semi-automatic weapons popular with many Americans. Now in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre in Florida that killed 17 high school students and teachers, the nation is again focused on the question of gun control generally and, specifically, of regulating semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 allegedly used by the shooter at Stoneman Douglas High School. Students from the high school who have overnight became outspoken activists for gun control have specifically called on President Trump as well as other elected officials to listen to their concerns and enact gun restrictions. So where does Trump stand? In a page-long explanation of his stance on guns in his book, ""The America We Deserve,"" published in 2000, Trump offered a very generalized summary of Democratic and Republican positions on gun control, characterizing each as extreme. ""Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk to NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions,"" he wrote. By contrast, he cast his stance as something of a middle ground. ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,"" he wrote. At the time, the U.S. had a ban on semi-automatic rifles under a law known as the assault weapons ban that took effect in 1994 and expired in 2004. In his 2015 book ""Crippled America,"" Trump appears to have changed his position. ""Opponents of gun rights often use a lot of scary descriptive phrases when proposing legislative action against various types of weapons. Ban 'assault weapons' they say, or 'military-style weapons,' or 'high-capacity magazines,'"" he wrote. ""Those all do sound a little ominous, until you understand what they are actually talking about are common, popular semiautomatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned and used by tens of millions of Americans."" In ""Crippled America,"" Trump argues that background checks on prospective gun buyers ""accomplished very little"" and merely brought ""more government regulation into the situation."" Trump cited Project Exile, a crime-reduction program started in Richmond, Virginia, in the late 1990s, which sought to reduce firearms-related offenses by increasing the penalties on felons caught carrying guns. As a presidential candidate, Trump reiterated his support for this program. Trump wrote in his 2015 book that he ""owns guns. Fortunately, I have never had to use."" According to public records, he got a concealed weapons permit in 2010, which he referred to in an interview with Outdoor Life magazine in early 2016, calling himself ""a very big Second Amendment person."" Trump was endorsed by the NRA in May 2016, and the gun rights group ended up spending $30.3 million in support of his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since his election, Trump has become the first president since Ronald Reagan to address the NRA while in office. As president, he has also taken action that may make it easier for some people to get guns, including people with mental illness. On Feb. 28, 2017, Trump signed H.J. Res. 40, effectively ending a Social Security Administration requirement that the names of people who receive mental health benefits be entered into a database used by the FBI for background checks on prospective buyers of firearms. The requirement, which had yet to go into effect when Trump ended it, would have added the names of an estimated 75,000 individuals with mental illness to the database, according to the administration of former President Obama. These individuals would have been notified by the Social Security Administration of possible restrictions on their buying firearms, but would have had the opportunity to go through an appeal process. Since ending the requirement, Trump has pointed to mental health issues as a root cause of a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed in a church. He has also suggested that mental illness may have been a factor in the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last week. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Trump's shifting stance on assault weapons,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
423,https://abcnews.go.com/US/multiple-people-injured-reported-mass-shooting-california-bar/story?id=59050130&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"The country-themed Borderline Bar and Grill was packed at the time. Father talks emotionally about his son, killed in California bar shooting At least 12 people, including an officer, were killed late Wednesday when a gunman opened fire in a packed Southern California bar during its ""college night,"" leaving the community of Thousand Oaks in shock and in mourning. The lone suspect, 28-year-old Ian David Long, was found dead inside the Borderline Bar & Grill after the overnight shooting, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Authorities believe he shot himself. Long was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, Dean said. His only weapon was a legally purchased .45-caliber handgun, Dean said. Long added an extended magazine to the Glock gun, the sheriff said. Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran, was killed in the line of duty, Dean said. He was one of the first on the scene and was shot multiple times when he entered the bar, authorities said. Helus, 54, survived by his wife and son, was looking to retire soon, the sheriff's office said. Instead, he made ""the ultimate sacrifice,"" Dean said. When the shooting report came in, the sheriff said Helus was speaking with his wife on the phone. ""Hey, I got to go handle a call, I love you,"" Helus told his wife, according to Dean. Dean told ABC News' David Muir that he spent a lot of time with Helus and that they worked out at the same gym, where the sergeant would visit ""with everybody."" ""He's a good guy,"" Dean said. ""...He's friendly, he's happy, he just wants to talk and be personable and help people out. He's helped a couple of the employees in there get hired as deputies."" Also among the dead is 22-year-old Cody Coffman, his father, Jason Coffman, overcome with emotion, told reporters. ""I talked to him last night before he headed out the door,"" Jason Coffman said. ""First thing I said was, 'Please don't drink and drive.' Last thing I said was, 'Son, I love you.'"" ""I am speechless and heartbroken,"" he said. ""I cannot believe that it's happened to my family."" ""I just want him to know that he is going to be missed,"" Jason Coffman said of his oldest child in between tears. Another victim was Pepperdine University student Alaina Housley, niece of Adam Housley and ""Sister, Sister"" actress Tamera Mowry-Housley. ""Our hearts are broken,"" Adam Housley and Tamera Mowry-Housley said in a statement. ""Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner."" ""We offer our deepest condolences to the Housley family and ask that our community join us in keeping Alaina’s family, friends, and loved ones in their prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" Pepperdine University added in a statement. Marine Corps veteran Dan Manrique, died in the shooting, Jacklyn Pieper, athletic director for the Ventura County Chapter of Team Red White & Blue, told ABC News. Manrique was the chapter captain for the organization. Telemachus Orfanos also died in the shooting, his mother told San Francisco ABC station KGO. Orfanos was in attendance at the country music festival in Las Vegas where 59 people were killed last October. ""My son was in Las Vegas with a lot of his friends and he came home,"" Susan Orfanos said. ""He didn't come home last night, and I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control, and I hope to God nobody sends me anymore prayers. I want gun control. No more guns."" Justin Meek, 23, also died, according to Thousand Oaks' California Lutheran University, from which he had recently graduated. ""Meek heroically saved lives"" during the massacre, the university said. ""Cal Lutheran wraps its arms around the Meek family and other families, and around every member of this community,"" the university said. Noel Sparks and Blake Dingman, both 21, were also victims of the shooting, ABC News confirmed. The bar was packed when police responded to the country western bar in Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, late Wednesday night. Among those inside were six off-duty police officers, who reportedly ""stood in front of my daughter"" to protect her after the gunfire rang out, one parent told the sheriff. Teylor Whittler was celebrating a friend's birthday at the bar's college night when she heard gunshots. ""A bunch of people dog-piled on top of each other,"" she told ""Good Morning America."" ""Everyone just yelled, 'Run, he's coming!'"" ""There were at least 50 people that all tried getting up at once and running out the back door. I ended up getting caught in the ground and stumbled over by multiple people,"" Whittler said. ""I got hit in the head by a stool that was being picked up to throw through a window, until some guy came up behind me and grabbed me and said, 'Get up, we have to go!'"" She said multiple men around her blocked the group with their bodies, ""ready to take a bullet for every single one of us."" Whittler's friend, Sarah Rose DeSon, told ""GMA"" she was hiding behind a table when she saw a spark and smoke. ""As soon as we all saw that, we jumped up,"" she said. ""I ran out the front door, down some stairs, face-planted in the parking lot but I was lucky enough to get out alive."" Thirteen people with gunshot wounds or lacerations were treated and released from local hospitals. As the sun rose Thursday, women as young as 18 years old emerged from the area surrounding the bar. Many were dressed in cowboy boots and flannels and draped in pink blankets given to them by authorities. They clung to each other, desperate to find missing friends. Terrified parents also descended on the area. One mother was so frantic that she jumped out of the passenger side of a still-moving car to race toward the crime scene. As parents waited outside, they ""pinged"" their children's phones, some of which were left buzzing inside the bar. ""We're just praying for our friends that we haven't heard from,"" DeSon told ""GMA."" ""You never think it's going to be you until it happens. This is a problem. This is real and it's awful."" Thousand Oaks ranked third in America’s safest cities this year, according to Niche, a Pittsburgh-based company that researches neighborhoods and schools across the country based on public data as well as resident reviews. ""I love this place -- it's our usual hangout,"" college student Erika Sigman said of the Borderline Bar to ABC Los Angeles station KABC. ""My parents trust me going here."" Meanwhile, investigators are working to determine the suspect's motive. There's no apparent connection between Long and the Borderline Bar, the sheriff said. Long served in the Marine Corps from 2008 to 2013. He served in Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011. Long lived near Thousand Oaks in the town of Newbury Park. Neighbors told ABC News that he lived with his mother and rarely went outside. There are no indicators of any additional associates or other threats to the Los Angeles area, Paul Delacourt, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. Investigators are searching Long’s vehicle and his home to ""paint a picture on the frame of mind on the subject."" This April deputies were called to his home for a report of ""subject disturbing"" and found Long ""somewhat irate,"" said Dean. Mental health specialists met with him, Dean said; however, they ""didn't feel that he was qualified"" for involuntary psychiatric commitment. President Donald Trump has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until Saturday at sunset ""as a mark of solemn respect for the victims,” he said in a proclamation.

424,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-supportive-efforts-update-background-check-system-florida/story?id=53197674&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"Trump is under pressure to respond to the Florida high school shooting. Gun violence: By the numbers — -- The White House says President Donald Trump is “supportive of efforts” to update the nation’s background check system in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shooting last week that killed 17 people, many of them teenagers. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday the president spoke with Texas Sen. John Cornyn on Friday about legislation he introduced last year following the Sutherland Springs mass shooting that took place in Cornyn's home state. “While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system,” Sanders said. That bill, co-sponsored by leading gun control advocate Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who saw 20 children killed in his home state in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, calls for making updates to the background check system to ensure that states and federal agencies have up-to-date and accurate information on individuals prohibited from buying firearms. The bill, called the Fix NICS Act, referring to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, is endorsed by major gun rights organizations, including the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation. While any action the administration takes in the wake of Florida is expected to stop short of any proposal that would amount to gun restrictions, sources tell ABC News that the president has repeatedly said “we have to do something” in the wake of the Florida tragedy. Principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said late last week that “mental health and school safety” would be at the forefront of any policy prescriptions the administration may pursue. “The president wants to take leadership and actually fix this problem and create best practices across the country,” Shah said on FOX News late last week. This week, the president is set to turn his focus to the issue of school safety with a “listening session” on Wednesday with high school students and teachers. And on Thursday, he will meet with state and local officials on the issue. This is the fourth mass shooting that President Trump has had to respond to since becoming president, and in the wake of those other shootings, the administration has repeatedly pivoted away from having a conversation on gun control measures and has instead put the focus on mental health. Following the shooting in Sutherland Springs last year, the president said, ""We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn't a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it."" Since last week’s shooting, the president has not said it's too soon to talk about gun control but he has twice ignored questions about whether there should be changes to the nation’s gun laws. The only time the president has previously expressed an openness to some sort of regulation relating to guns was in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, when he said the administration would be ""looking into"" bump stocks regulation. ""We'll be looking into that over the next short period of time,"" the president said back in October. But ultimately, a bill that would have addressed the issue of bump stocks stalled in Congress. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,White House says Trump open to changes in background checks after Florida,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
425,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-republicans-reach-breaking-point-tariffs/story?id=53597366&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"Trump’s economic nationalism is colliding with the national economy. Will Trump sign new trade plan? The TAKE with Rick Klein It didn’t happen over Charlottesville, or any of the scandals, the insults, the attacks, the mistruths, or even over the payment to the porn star. It’s the issue of tariffs that has driven Republican policy minds and elected officials to say in virtual unison to President Donald Trump: This isn’t right. Trump, who is set to sign his tariff proclamation today, prompted a resignation from a high-profile economic adviser, stern statements from House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, public pleading from the president’s friends and allies; it’s all part of a last-ditch effort to lure Trump away from his instincts. Trump’s economic nationalism is colliding with the realities of the national economy. It’s also a collision of style and substance for a president who said this week: “I like conflict.” “Markets don’t like conflict, investors don’t like conflict,” said Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. It sets up a test for the president, who is talking tough, yet also offering potential off-ramps for allies — with actual policies set to be released in the coming days. The bigger test, though, will be for Republican elected officials, if Trump stays committed to a policy course they think will be disastrous. The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks The East Coast may be getting pummeled with snow, but political storms are brewing out West. As the Los Angeles Times put it yesterday: “Trump's immigration war with California has reached a fever pitch."" On the one hand, many California cities seem eager to protect their residents — documented or not — who are living peacefully in their communities. At the same time, the federal government continues to increase immigration raids and sweeps and is now suing the Golden State over the right to deport anyone the federal government chooses — and perhaps anyone without proper paperwork — without the state getting in the way. Both sides seem suited up for this war, already donning their battle boots and armed with litigation. It is hard to think of any issue in recent American history that has pitted a state government and local law enforcement against federal agencies like this — at least not one that so directly and materially affected human lives. Both sides are battling for the final say in who can live where. The TIP with Meridith McGraw, Devin Dwyer and Jordyn Phelps After a week teasing his big announcement on trade, President Trump is expected to sign a proclamation today formalizing his controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.""We'll do it in a — in a very loving way,"" Trump said Tuesday of his tariffs decision. The signing will take place at 3:30 p.m., according to the White House, and will include workers from the American steel and aluminum industry. Wednesday, in her press briefing with reporters, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said there will be potential exemptions for Canada and Mexico - and possibly other countries - based on national security. But the decision to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has been met by criticism from leaders within Trump's own party. By one independent analysis, the move could result in an estimated net loss of 146,000 American jobs, even if more than 30,000 new steel and aluminum industry jobs are created in the first year under the tariffs. More than a hundred Republican members of Congress on Wednesday signed a letter to Trump ""expressing concern"" over tariffs. ""We're urging the President to tailor these tariffs so American businesses can continue to trade fairly with our partners, sell American-made products to customers all over the world, and hire more workers here at home,"" wrote House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady. Trump's decision has also sparked deep divides inside the White House. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn resigned amid internal administration debates over tariffs. United Steelworkers union representatives told ABC News they have been invited to the White House for the signing ceremony. This weekend, Trump is expected to head to the heart of steel country in Pittsburgh, Pa.

426,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/24/san-jose-quadruple-homicide-previous-bay-area-mass-shootings/,"Trending:  SAN JOSE — A standoff with police Sunday night ended with five people killed, including the suspect, in one of the deadliest mass shootings in Santa Clara County history. What police are calling a quadruple murder and suicide was just the latest in a long line of Bay Area mass shootings. Here are some of them: 4 dead, 2 wounded. Jimmy Lam, a UPS worker, shot and killed three co-workers at a company facility in San Francisco. Two people were wounded. Lam killed himself after police told him to put down the gun. Lam, 38, a UPS driver, filed a grievance in earlier in 2017 claiming he was working excessive overtime, a union official said at the time. 7 dead, 3 wounded One L. Goh, of Alameda, killed seven people and wounded three others in a shooting rampage at Oikos University, a small Oakland nursing college. He will spend the rest of his life in prison under a plea deal reached earlier this year. Goh is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose delusions led him to believe that the administration and staff at Oikos University were conspiring against him, alienating him from classmates, and covertly having him bugged and followed. Goh told police he went to the Oikos campus in East Oakland that day to confront a specific administrator. 3 dead, 7 wounded Shareef Allman gunned down three coworkers at a Cupertino cement plant and wounded seven other people before he was shot to death by police in a gunfight. The 47-year-old heavy equipment operator at Lehigh Hanson’s Permanente Cement Plant had been in a safety meeting with more than a dozen coworkers when he pulled a gun from his waistband and began shooting. One of the survivors of the shooting said Allman felt co-workers were trying have him fired after he was repeatedly accused of driving recklessly at the quarry. Allman kept a handgun at home hidden in the cutout pages of a Bible. 6 dead, including the shooter, and 1 wounded Devan Kalathat shot and killed his 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter, his brother-in-law and his wife, and their 11-month-old daughter. He killed himself. Kalathat’s wife was critically wounded, but survived. Kalathat’s wife later said she had no idea what triggered the massacre, but an autopsy found her husband had a benign brain tumor that might have caused headaches.  5 dead, including shooter Lovelle Mixon shot to death four Oakland police officers, two during what appeared to be a routine traffic stop by the motorcycle officers. The other two officers were members of a SWAT team who were killed inside an apartment where the gunman was hiding. Officers shot and killed the 27-year-old parolee. It was the deadliest incident in the department’s history. 3 dead Jing Hua Wu, 47, of Mountain View, shot and killed three coworkers at a Santa Clara semiconductor company after he had been laid off. Wu, who was convicted of the shooting, killed the CEO and another top executive at SiPort. He told jurors during the trial that he shot his gun accidentally. 3 dead, two wounded Asmeron Gebreselassie shot his sister in law and two of her relatives during a Thanksgiving dinner at the family’s home in Oakland, to avenge what he believed was his sister in law’s role in his own brother’s death. Gebreselassie and his brother Tewodros Gebreselassie — who let his brother into the home — were convicted of the murders in 2011, but Tewodros Gebreselassie’s conviction was overturned in 2015 and he pleaded guilty to lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter. he was released from prison in 2016. Asmeron Gebreselassie was sentenced to life in prison. 5 dead, including the shooter. Todd Vernon shot and killed his wife and his three children, before turning the .357 Magnum on himself. His wife had confided to a friend that she wanted out of her six-year marriage with Vernon, who was unemployed. In the suicide note Vernon sent by FedEx to his mother’s Orange County home, he said he couldn’t live without his wife and he couldn’t stand the thought of someone else raising his three children from a previous marriage. By killing the kids, experts say, he was taking the children away from his first wife, with whom he had bitterly fought for custody. 3 dead Stuart Alexander, nicknamed the “Sausage King,” gunned down three government meat inspectors, missing a fourth who ran for his life, inside the the Santos Linguisa Factory in San Leandro. Alexander got into a dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture after the agency contended he was not heating his sausages properly. When the inspectors arrived at his property to shut him down, he shot them. Alexander was convicted of the murders, which were caught on surveillance video, and died on Death Row of natural causes at age 44. 9 dead, including shooter, 6 wounded Gian Luigi Ferri shot and killed eight people and wounded six others at the San Francisco law firm Pettit & Martin in the city’s worst mass shooting. Ferri killed himself after the shooting at the high-rise building. The 55-year-old failed entrepreneur’s motive is still unknown. The shooting led Congress to pass historic gun reform legislation. 7 dead, 4 wounded Richard Wade Farley shot and killed seven coworkers and injured four others at ESL Incorporated, a Sunnyvale defense contractor. Farley draped himself in 98 pounds of guns and ammunition when he went on the shooting spree inspired by his obsession with a female colleague who did not accept his advances over three years. That woman was severely wounded in the attack, but survived and testified against Farley, who was sentenced to die. 6 dead David “Moochie” Welch burst into an East Oakland home and shot six people, including two toddlers, in their heads as they slept. The 28-year-old heroin and cocaine dealer, who remains on Death Row, went from room to room shooting his victims on Pearmain Street. Welch had been upset over the breakup with his 16-year-old girlfriend, so he killed her and her five relatives and friends. Staff writer Veronica Martinez contributed to this report.

On Monday evening, the 37-year-old presidential hopeful found himself facing more harsh criticism from local police who claim that his interest in the shooting of the 54-year-old black man at the hands of a white police officer is purely political, and that his approach to the tragedy has only created greater division.

During Sunday's town hall, Buttigieg said he takes responsibility for the South Bend Police Department's failed efforts to hire more minority officers and implement the use of body cameras. The shooting that has led to public unrest and caused Buttigieg to briefly suspend campaigning happened shortly before 3:30 a.m. on June 16. Police were called to the 100 block of North William Street after dispatch received a report of a suspicious person going through cars. South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O'Neill responded to the scene and confronted a man, later identified as Logan, who police said was partially in a vehicle in the Central High School Apartments parking lot. Officials said Logan stepped out of the vehicle with a knife in his hand and approached O'Neill with the weapon raised. O'Neill stepped back and ordered Logan to drop the weapon, police say. Police said when Logan did not comply, O'Neill fired his service weapon and struck Logan. After the shooting, Logan was taken to Memorial Hospital, less than a mile away, in a squad car. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. O'Neill was treated for minor injuries and discharged, according to the prosecutor's office. The nature of O'Neill's injuries remains unclear. O'Neill was equipped with a body camera. Police say the officer did not activate the camera and there is no other footage of the shooting. No other witnesses have come forward. In Monday’s letter, the FOP executive board explains that the shooting is being investigated by an outside entity, and that they are standing in support of O'Neill until “a thorough and complete investigation is done.” The board members say that throughout the process, Buttigieg has failed to devote any of his attention to other local crimes, including multiple shootings at Kelly's Pub that left one person dead, 10 others injured and a hospital on lockdown early Sunday. The board also says that the mayor has not spoken to O’Neill’s family, or the “South Bend Police Family.” “Mayor Buttigieg has in no way unified the community. Mayor Buttigieg continues to only focus on one incident and one family,” says the FOP letter. “Buttigieg has yet to comment on the largest mass shooting in the recent history of South Bend, or on one juvenile killing another earlier in the week. Buttigieg's focus on one family has left several others ostracized.” The board ends the letter by saying that every officer is held to a high level of accountability, and that they are committed to building long term trust in the community. “In a short time, Mayor Buttigieg will no longer be the leader of this great city.

431,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/06/25/police-union-rips-buttigieg-using-shooting-score-campaign-points/,"South Bend’s police union is not happy with Mayor Pete’s handling of an officer-involved shooting. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #36 issued a press release Monday explaining its reaction to the recent events involving one of their own members. The union has more than 350 members. They say that Pete Buttigieg is using a tragedy for political gain, namely in his presidential campaign. The press release expresses support for Sgt. Ryan O’Neill, the officer involved in the shooting of Eric Logan, a knife-wielding man. O’Neill shot Logan two times as Logan approached him and Logan died at the hospital. O’Neill is a white policeman and Logan is a 54-year-old African-American. There is a presumption of innocence in America, the union points out, and support for O’Neill will continue throughout the ongoing investigation being conducted by an independent entity. That entity, the Metro Homicide Unit, is doing a full and complete investigation without involvement from the police officers with whom they serve. The union calls out Mayor Pete for making disparaging remarks against police and failing to unify the community. His comments are driving a wedge between police and the community. From the press release: “All Police work and all of American life take place in the shadow of racism” is a comment made by the mayor that the union points to as disparaging. Buttigieg’s focus on this event is “solely for his political gain and not for the health of this community,” claims the union. By focusing only on this one incident and the family involved, Buttigieg has failed to acknowledge “the largest mass shooting in the recent history of South Bend or on one juvenile killing another earlier in the week. Buttigieg’s focus on one family has left several others ostracized. He has not spoken to the families involved in the Kelly’s Pub shooting, the South Bend Police Family, or the family of Sgt. O’Neill all of whom are suffering greatly.” The statement addresses the point that the accountability level of officers has increased “exponentially” and the manual has been restructured at or above national levels in all areas. It spoke to the good works done in the community by the police department and members of the union. The press release ends with a plea for the community to come together. The union leadership points to the fact that Mayor Pete will soon no longer be running the city but the police department and the residents of South Bend will still be there. It is not surprising that the police union issued this press release. Mayor Pete looks to be in over his head in handling the pressure of balancing running a small city and campaigning for president. Buttigieg is young at 37 years of age and his limited political experience is not serving him well right now. Earlier in the day, Buttigieg had emailed campaign supporters to address events this past weekend, as he faced raw emotions, shouts and protests over the Logan shooting. “It was a painful but needed conversation,” he wrote. “And I feel overwhelmed and heartened by the number of people — supporters and critics — who have reached out and made it clear over the past week that they want to join hands and face these problems together.” Buttigieg also wrote, “I will be working with my team and community to build on what we have done together over the past few years. It is clear we need to implement bolder and more aggressive actions moving forward.” It turns out that this is not the first time that Buttigieg has disparaged police officers. There was an incident in 2017 when Mayor Pete didn’t stick up for police as strongly as the department felt he should have. Monday wasn’t the first time the union took Buttigieg to task. In 2017, then-FOP president Dan Demler argued that the mayor hadn’t done enough to stick up for the department when officers faced criticism. As one instance, Demler pointed to Aaron Knepper, an officer who was embroiled in various controversies and lawsuits over use of force. “The narrative has been put out there that we can’t be trusted,” Demler said. Knepper was one of the officers who responded to the scene after the Logan shooting and transported Logan to the hospital. He is currently the treasurer of the FOP. In response to Demler’s comments in 2017, Buttigieg said he was “proud of the dedication our officers show every day, and we stand by our officers when they do the right thing.” St. Joseph County Prosecutor Kenneth Cotter filed a petition Monday asking a judge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the shooting. It is becoming clear that Sgt. O’Neill is about to be painted as a racist because of an alleged incident eleven years ago. Is Mayor Pete a part of that plan? He supports the petition. The mayor praised the prosecutor’s decision to request an independent investigator. “I respect and support Prosecutor Cotter’s decision to seek an outside, special prosecutor to investigate the circumstances of Eric Logan’s death,” Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. “Our community is in anguish, and for all of us to come to terms with what happened, it is vital that the investigation be fair, thorough, and impartial.” I’m not so sure that inciting racial tensions is the way Mayor Pete wants to go. He suffers from an almost complete lack of support from African-American voters as polling stands now. He should also consider his troubled past with racial relationships in South Bend. During his first term in office, tensions mounted as he fired the police chief who was African-American. The petition for a special prosecutor sounds as though it is all about creating a narrative against Sgt. O’Neill, not actually trying to create a fair investigation. Cotter’s petition requests a special prosecutor to “avoid any appearance of impropriety, conflict of interest or influence upon the ultimate prosecutorial decision to be made.” The petition also noted his chief investigator, Dave Newton, was a South Bend police lieutenant in 2008 while O’Neill was a patrol officer and had filed a report at the time quoting two other officers “that voiced a concern of inappropriate racial remarks made by Ryan O’Neill.” My central question remains, as far as Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign goes – how can Democrat voters have faith in his leadership ability if he craters under the pressure of a police shooting in his small city? The people involved in the local tragedy are all known to him. He touts his desire to be of his community and work for the people he serves. Yet, when under pressure from the special interests that emerge from this kind of incident, for example, agitators like Black Lives Matter,  he emotionally caves to pander to one community over another. As mayor, he should be calling for community unity and supporting the police as they protect that community. Given an absence of wrong-doing by Sgt. O’Neill, at least so far, Mayor Pete has not risen to the occasion and that calls into question his rise to the highest political office in the land. Is he ready to be the leader of the free world if he botches leading a city of 100,000 people? Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

6.25.2019 4:05 PM Yesterday Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) introduced a bill that would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of ""gun silencers,"" which he blames for helping the perpetrator of last month's mass shooting in Virginia Beach murder 12 people. ""The sound of gunshots is what tells you that your life is [in] danger, and that it's time to run, hide, take cover, call the police and help others save themselves,"" Menendez says. ""At the end of the day if you can hear a weapon you might just save a life."" Contrary to the impression left by TV shows and movies, so-called silencers, a.k.a. suppressors, do not eliminate ""the sound of gunshots."" On average, they reduce the noise generated by a .45 ACP pistol, the kind used in the Virginia Beach attack, from around 157 decibels to something like 127 decibels, which is still louder than a siren or a thunderclap. It's not surprising, then, that ""most law enforcement experts say"" the Virginia Beach shooter's suppressor ""likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time,"" as the Associated Press noted. But Menendez thinks he knows better. ""What first sounded like a nail-gun ended up being gunfire,"" he says, suggesting that some victims might have lived if the sound had been louder. Never mind that there is no evidence to support that supposition, or that people have been known to confuse the sound of unsuppressed gunfire with noises generated by nonthreatening sources such as firecrackers or a car backfiring. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is cosponsoring Menendez's bill, insists there is no legitimate reason to own a suppressor. ""The only people who could reasonably oppose a ban on gun silencers are criminals trying to avoid detection by law enforcement or mass murderers trying to hurt as many people as possible,"" he says. ""Whether a firearm is being used in a mugging or a massacre, the sound of a gunshot is a warning that helps bystanders get to safety and allows law enforcement to track and apprehend the shooter."" Americans legally own about 1.5 million suppressors, which means they live in one of the 42 states where the devices are legal, have paid a $200 transfer tax, and have passed a federal background check that typically takes eight to 10 months. Based on data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, The Washington Free Beacon's Stephen Gutowski calculates that ""roughly .003 percent of silencers are used in crimes each year."" Yet according to Blumenthal, every single American who owns a silencer is a criminal. Why might law-abiding Americans find suppressors useful? As anyone who has visited a gun range can testify, guns are really loud, even when you're wearing ear plugs or muffs. Suppressors provide extra hearing protection, which may be worth the cost and trouble of legally buying them if you shoot frequently, especially if you shoot large-caliber guns. Blumenthal seems to think that explanation is just a cover for criminal activity, which defies logic and math. Menendez's bill, the Help Empower Americans to Respond (HEAR) Act, would ban not just new sales of suppressors but current possession. Like Donald Trump's extralegal ban on bump stocks, it would transform law-abiding gun owners into felons because they legally acquired a politically disfavored product that is rarely used to commit violent crimes. The text of the bill does not seem to be available yet, but Menendez's summary says it would ""authorize a buyback program"" and ""provide individuals with a 90-day grace period after the date of enactment for individuals to comply with the ban."" Update: The bill is here. People who continue to possess suppressors after the 90-day grace period could be fined up to $250,000 and/or go to prison for up to five years.

Why don’t we politician silencers? “””roughly .003 percent of silencers are used in crimes each year.””” I wonder how many of those are manufactured vs homemade. Most all of them?  Today is day 334 of my 8 month wait for a legally purchased suppressor….  I doubt that people with my patience would use them in the commission of a crime. It’s also strikes me as a bad calculation. The linked article states there are 1.3 million so .003% would be 39 per year but the total was 44 in an entire decade. I think what it was supposed to say was .003% of crimes involved a silencer each year which would make more sense. Contrary to the popular impression fostered by TV shows and movies, so-called silencers, a.k.a. suppressors, do not eliminate “the sound of gunshots.” WHAT Sad, but true…they change the sound levels from dangerously high to just painfully high… A 45ACP generates about 160 decibels; a quality suppressor will reduce by about 40 dcbls, to a noise level equivalent to a chain saw or a thunder clap.  I often use a chain saw, and while it will not make me deaf [cause immediate damage to my hearing] people can hear it way down my country road.  These dip-shits are just defecating out their mouths in an effort to create an impression of what they want to be “true.” >>> “The only people who could reasonably oppose a ban on gun silencers are criminals trying to avoid detection no true law-abider … Most people are not familiar with the sound of gunfire, and they don’t react when they hear it. This old biker I used to know had a story about hearing gunfire in Baltimore several years ago. He dived for cover, and one other man about his age did also. Everybody else on the street just looked around, if they noticed at all. The other man asked my friend, “‘Nam?” My friend replied, “No, Watts riots.” You aren’t flat out saying it but, seeking cover =/= unfamiliar or oblivious to gunfire. The fact Menendez is still a Senator is more disgusting than anything else that has happened over the last 3 years. yes. Pervert tryin’ to take my suppressor … Nearly all democrats in congress being in GitMo. New Jersey.  America’s great experiment re what life would be like had we not rebelled against Great Britain, or had lost the Cold War. Supressors (like semi-auto centrefire rifles now dammit) are legal, unlicensed and pretty much universal here (New Zealand). They’re regarded as a health & safety thing by most. The range officer gave me a very evil look last time I fired an unsupressed .308. Your politicians are even bigger morons than ours – something I can only ascribe to having a larger population of morons to draw from. Many of them are Kiwi; fortunately we are not subject to your Prime Minister; hot as she is, I’m glad we don’t have her. We have our own version of MAGA. Make Ardern Go Away. She is an inspiration to women everywhere that you don’t need talent or accomplishments to become Prime Minister of New Zealand. Yep a ban on suppressors will stop someone hell bent on MURDER from committing a crime. OR, they will just build a simple one themselves as it is only a threaded tube with baffling! But, I am sure someone inspired to murder will yield to such a powerful law. Gun laws aren’t made to stop crime. Effing Idiot NannyStater Donks. Guess how many will be turning to The Purolator Solution. “The Purolator Solution” I “hear” it works, at a cost of $3.99 + a cheap adapter. criminals trying to avoid detection by law enforcement All the criminals trying to get away with crimes within earshot of the police? If the South side of Chicago teaches any lessons it’s that the ability to silence guns is nothing compared to the ability to silence witnesses. Watch as the NRA caves and claims this is reasonable. BTW the added length of a silencer makes the guns harder to conceal which is a bigger issue than the silencing part, that is if your goal is to commite crimes with it. I’m not so sure. The momentum behind liberalizing suppressor laws over the past several years has been considerable, given the public health benefits to shooters, as well as the lack of actual connections with crime. So I don’t think this will fall in the same category as “bump stocks” as a bone to throw to the left. Nor do I think there’s the same lefty public outrage on this issue as there was with bump stocks after Las Vegas, given the differing scale of the crimes. The sheer body count of Las Vegas got a lot of people’s attention for demanding “somebody do something”. Virginia Beach seems like a more typical “disgruntled employee” shooting around which the political lines were drawn long ago. i hope you are right since the NRA has been promoting silencers however they are under attack publicly for some serious internal scandals that they may hope capitulation will silence the outside focus on their internal issues. It won’t but they may think that way. I’m not entirely clear that silencers (or bump stocks) are in the NRA’s wheelhouse. They aren’t, themselves a weapon and instead would be an effect that should be shielded from illegal search and seizure. Not to say that the NRA shouldn’t defend other rights but that 50 yrs. ago there was no “right to privacy” as we understand it now and I’m not entirely sure I agree with RTKBA in that vein. I wholly defend your right to build and own any arms you like, up to and including a nuclear bomb. However, I don’t think you have a right to have a nuclear bomb in your garage or basement *and* conceal that fact from your mortgage lender, neighbors, and pretty much anyone else in the effective radius. Not to equate silencers on handguns with nuclear bombs but to indicate that the NRA has a membership and a mission and that silencers and bump stocks may not be in favor with either the memberbship or the executive committee’s mission despite any given minority opinion no matter how valid. They certainly shouldn’t advocate the banning of silencers, but they always run a risk of becoming (e.g.) anti-Federalism rather than pro-2A. IMO, the most interesting thing about the NRA is that it’s traditionally been such a powerhouse and that at any given moment leftists could pretty readily co-opt and destroy the entire organization simply by actively participating in it. The 2A protects the right to keep and bear Arms. As in armaments. Pistols, rifles, swords, knives, clubs, tanks, aircraft, ships, cannons, grenades, bombs, mines, nukes, TNT, lasers, all accompanying equipment, all required ammo, and any armament developed in the future. Dont like that, change the constitution. This country really need to be cleansed of all the Marxist subversives, or ‘progressives’ As they like to canal themselves. There is no right to treason. As someone who has shot  a ,22, 5,56,45 and 9 mm suppressor I can say the he’s an idiot. Or a liar. BTW, I go to Blackwing shooting in Delaware ,oh every now and then. Best gun store in Ohio. If you go, get directions to the Hamburger Inn in town. You will thank me. A politician, a liar, an idiot?  But in the spirit of Mark Twain, I repeat myself. Such redundancy hereabouts. Gun control is about the control, not the gun. We who were ridiculed for saying that after the second, they would go after the first are here to shout “WE TOLD YOU SO!”. I am surprised OSHA hasn’t mandated suppressors as safety equipment. Any competent machinist can make a fitting that will screw onto a threaded barrel on one end, and an automobile oil filter on the other, and work just like a silencer, for a while. Some will sell them. It’s sort’a like George Will’s proposition that if a country wants nuclear weapons, they’ll eventually get them. Toolmaker’s apprentice here. I sell thread adapters for fifty bucks each to friends and strangers alike. Make them out of 420 stainless or 4140 chrome moly and they’re literally as tough as the barrel itself. Cash only and only in person, though. And of course, only to be used as a solvent trap when cleaning… We wouldn’t want to get any Hoppes #9 on the kitchen table, now, would we? I reasonably oppose a ban on silencers and I would guess I am not any more a criminal than Blumenthal.  And I’m SURE I am less of a criminal than Menendez. You’re also probably not a stolen valor scumbag like Blumenthal, claiming service in Vietnam that never happened. However, you are probably *less* of a criminal than Blumenthal as well. I mean I’m sure that fucker’s done *something*, right? 😉 Most progressives, which is nearly all democrats, should be in prison based on existing anti sedition laws. Its not so much that politicians and their supporters learn about firearms from TV, its that voters learn about politics from TV. Outlawing guns will not stop criminals from getting them Outlawing silencers will not stop criminals from from getting them. But if a person wants to kill some one with a gun quietly that person would use something like a .22 caliber. With a weapon like that one would get close so there would be no chance of missing and no body would be the wiser. But both the weapon and the silencer if not made in the US would be imported from places like Mexico by gun runners just like they do drugs. It’s starting to feel awfully 1776 up in here… I think we’re more in 1772 or 1774 still… There’s a few years yet before we get to full on 1776… But I suspect it is coming. All gun control laws are unconstitutional and therefore illegal. It should be clear to every American Patriot that the courts, legislatures and executive officers are violating their oaths and the US Constitution in allowing violations of the 2nd Amendment. “The sound of gunshots is what tells you that your life is [in] danger, and that it’s time to run, hide, take cover, call the police and help others save themselves,” Menendez says. Note he left out “fight back.” “The only people who could reasonably oppose a ban on gun silencers are criminals trying to avoid detection by law enforcement or mass murderers trying to hurt as many people as possible,” he says. “The only people who could reasonably oppose a ban on automobile mufflers are criminals trying to avoid detection by law enforcement or people with road rage trying to hurt as many people as possible,” he says. So interesting aside, I stumbled onto a random video awhile back on YouTube that was pretty cool. Basically, with some calibers of weapon, if you buy sub sonic ammo, and pair with a good silencer, you can DAMN NEAR get the thing to be “movie” silent with some guns. Pretty cool stuff. Of course you have a lot less stopping power because of the weak ammo, but if one really wanted to be as quiet as possible, it does go a long way with pistol calibers. > like Donald Trump’s extralegal ban on bump stocks So, they’re just following the lead of our glonous leader? Why does Reason hate Trump do much?!?! The Left will fight tooth and nail to preserve any gun law now on the books, no matter how whimsical or useless that law might be. […] it earlier but here’s a detailed analysis and rebuttal to this stupid legislation, that would make me a […] […] ReasonYesterday Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) introduced a bill that would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of ""gun silencers,"" which he blames for helping the perpetrator of last month's mass shooting in Virginia Beach murder 12 people. ""The sound of gunshots is what tells you that your life is [in] danger, and that it's time to run, hide, take cover, call the police and help others save themselves,"" Menendez says. ""At the end of the day if you can hear a weapon you might just save a life.""Contrary to the impression left by TV shows and movies, so-called silencers, a.k.a. suppressors, do not eliminate ""the sound of gunshots."" On average, they reduce the noise generated by a .45 ACP pistol, the kind used in the Virginia Beach attack, from around 157 decibels to something like 127 decibels, which is still louder than a siren or a thunderclap. It's not surprising, then, that ""most law enforcement experts say"" the Virginia Beach shooter's suppressor ""likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time,"" as the Associated Press noted.The only thing a suppressor does is reduce the report of a gun being fired from something that will damage your hearing permanently to something that will damage your hearing temporarily. OSHA regulations force people to wear hearing protection inside computer labs because of the noise of the fans keeping the computers cool; why should the noise of a firearm going off be any different? […] This bill is another bill introduced by a Democrat based in ignorance of the truth.  A suppressor ( there is no such device like a silencer except in movies) only reduces the sound of a gunshot from above the Pain threshold down to the level similar to a jackhammer. Anyone who has been near a gun when fired and not wearing hearing protection knows the immediate sensation is pain, and then ringing in your ears for 10-15 minutes.  A gunshot, ANY GUN SHOT, is loud.  The reason this lunatic used a suppressor was to protect himself so he could keep shooting.  Suppressors are already class III items which require a special firearms license to possess which is expensive and involves a extensive background check.  It is much more likely the suppressor used was made by the shooter which means this law is meaningless.  However why would anyone be surprised that a criminal like Menendez would want to do something illegal and unconstitutional. Please log in to post comments Baylen Linnekin

News By Joe Tacopino Submit June 25, 2019 | 4:55pm				| Updated June 25, 2019 | 8:29pm David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting rampage and fierce gun critic, said that he has been the target of seven assassination attempts in the past year. Hogg told The Washington Post that killing him would be “the stupidest thing they could do to try to try to end the movement.” “That would make it even more successful in the end,” Hogg said in an interview published Tuesday. “Because it would invigorate us and create f—ing change.” Hogg survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018. As a result, the 19-year-old student founded “Never Again MSD,” a student-led gun control advocacy group. Hogg said about the death threats: “I have to live through this, and it is traumatizing.

435,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marine-corps-times/news/your-marine-corps/~3/Oq0DP3-YRTs/,"Then-Gunnery Sgt. Jarad Stout was sleeping in the early morning hours of Nov. 20, 2015, when the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, Mali, was attacked by gunmen affiliated with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. The armed militants were holding about 170 people hostage, including a dozen Americans. But when the Marine Raider, who was serving as a liaison to the U.S. embassy at the time, received word of an “active shooter,” he and his team were “out the door in five minutes."" Stout had very little initial information regarding the attack, but he devised a plan and led his team, braving grenades and small arms fire, to help rescue hostages. “There was very little time to respond,” Stout said in a command release. “However, our purpose was clear. That clarity and unity of purpose allowed us to navigate the ambiguity and manage our emotions to accomplish the mission at hand.” More than 20 people were killed in the mass shooting, including one American. Now a master sergeant, Stout’s heroic actions and quick decision-making earned him the nation’s third highest award for combat bravery, the Silver Star. The award was presented at a closed-door ceremony at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in April 2018. Stout will be honored as the Marine of the Year at this year’s annual Service Members of the Year Awards ceremony, which will be held July 10 in Washington.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Marine Corps Times Daily News Roundup. The Marine Raider received the Silver Star for rescuing hostages during a 2015 terrorist attack in Mali. Stout enlisted in the Corps in 2003 and has spent the past 16 years supporting America’s global fight against terrorism — and racking up six overseas deployments. Half of those deployments were in the past several years, when Stout served as an operator with elite Marine Raiders combating North and West Africa’s nebulous world of insurgents, militia groups and wannabe ISIS and al-Qaida offshoots. He told Marine Corps Times in an interview that service to his country is the “most important calling” that he has, and that the “service-before-self mentality” is a major driving force in his life. Since deploying to West Africa in 2014, Stout has been immersed in America’s shadowy wars in the U.S. Africa Command area of responsibility, where the threats are often erratic, the players are ambiguous and violence often rises and falls with the local political tumult. While there have been talks of reducing America’s military footprint in the region, little is known about U.S. operations in AFRICOM. Just a handful of special operations forces and conventional troops are spread thinly across small outposts, various diplomatic missions and drone bases covering vast geographic terrain. Stout knew the risks involved in the AFRICOM area of operations when he rushed to the aid of Americans held hostage by terrorist gunmen at the Mali hotel. But Stout says much credit is also owed to U.S. embassy staff who worked “really hard to manage the crisis."" “It was a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos and they did a really good job,” Stout said. “They dealt with the situation as it was and not as they wanted it to be."" U.S. forces face a task fraught with complications stemming from Mali’s complex political atmosphere, which features a plethora of extremist groups, terrorist organizations and sophisticated weaponry. In 2018, Stout was selected for the Congressional Fellowship Program, an opportunity Stout volunteered for so he could work “outside his comfort zone” and help provide lawmakers with a more “granular look” about what is actually happening in North and West Africa. Stout works with and advises U.S. Rep. James Langevin, D-R.I., chairman of the House intelligence and emerging threats and capabilities subcommittee. When he has time, Stout volunteers for Community Family Life Services — a nonprofit that helps move families out of poverty. He also runs to raise money for various charities. He helped raise money for Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors in memory of Anita Datar, the American aid worker killed in the hotel attack. Stout described her as a “fantastic example of American exceptionalism” who “went out in the world and did her best to make it a better place.” He also will be running to raise money for Spirit of America, which provides support to deployed military and civilian personnel.

In the interview, Hogg said that ending his life would only “invigorate” the gun control movement. “If they kill me, that’s probably the stupidest thing they could do to try to end the movement,” he said. Hogg did not get into specifics about the threats and was not pressed by the Post to provide details.

If you value Mother Jones' reporting and you can right now, please help us close that gap with a donation today. Mother Jones illustration; Getty Nailing down the motive behind a mass shooting is often difficult. Most shooters tend to be driven by a poisonous blend of entrenched grievances, personal setbacks, depression, rage, suicidal urges, and in some cases, serious behavioral disorders or mental illness. Rarely can their actions be explained definitively by a single factor. However, Mother Jones’ in-depth database of mass shootings reveals a stark pattern of misogyny and domestic violence among many attackers. This factor is already relatively well known in cases where men gun down intimate partners, children, and other family members in their own or other people’s homes. There is also a strong overlap between toxic masculinity and public mass shootings, according to our latest investigation. Based on case documents, media reports, and interviews with mental health and law enforcement experts, we found that in at least 22 mass shootings since 2011—more than a third of the public attacks over the past eight years—the perpetrators had a history of domestic violence, specifically targeted women, or had stalked and harassed women. These cases included the large-scale massacres at an Orlando nightclub in 2016 and a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. In total, they account for 175 victims killed and 158 others injured. Two of the shooters bore the hallmarks of so-called “incels”—a subculture of virulent misogynists who self-identify as “involuntarily celibate” and voice their rage and revenge fantasies against women online. A man who recently planned to carry out a mass shooting in Utah and another who opened fire outside a courthouse in Dallas also appeared to be influenced by incel ideas. Two recent cases show how violent misogyny and abuse against women can fuel mass shooters’ behavior—and may serve as warning signs long before they strike. As observable indicators of a person’s capacity for escalating violence, this information could help mental health and law enforcement experts who work to prevent mass shootings by using behavioral threat assessment to identify and intervene with potential attackers. Scott Beierle was a socially maladjusted 40-year-old with a history of arrests for groping women in public. As far back as high school, he’d written detailed fantasies about raping and murdering women. At Florida State University, where he attended graduate school, he alarmed people around him with inappropriate comments and stalking behavior and was eventually banned from campus. In videos he posted on YouTube, he expressed anger toward women and admiration for Elliot Rodger, a suicidal mass shooter who targeted sorority members in Southern California in 2014. By last November, Beierle had hatched a plan to attack a yoga studio in Tallahassee. As an evening class began, he posed as a customer carrying a yoga mat. Once inside, he opened his bag, put on a pair of noise-muffling headphones, and pulled out a handgun. He fatally shot two women and wounded four other people, then used the gun to kill himself after a person in the class rushed him and fought back as others fled. About three weeks later in Chicago, 32-year-old Juan Lopez approached his ex-fiancé, Tamara O’Neal, outside the hospital where she worked as an ER doctor and demanded that she give him back an engagement ring. At the time, Lopez was still involved in a protracted custody battle with his ex-wife, who had secured an emergency protection order against him after he menaced another person with a gun and threatened to show up at her job to “cause a scene,” according to December 2014 court records. “I fear that my safety is in jeopardy,” she said. Four years later, Lopez fired a pistol at O’Neal from point-blank range, then shot her again as she lay in the hospital parking lot. He then entered the building and killed two more hospital employees before dying in a gun battle with police. The trail of violent misogyny and abusive behavior in many shooters’ cases dovetails with a key finding from research published by the FBI in 2018: Not only do most shooters give off multiple behavioral warning signs that are observable to people around them, a majority do so starting months and even years before their attacks. The shooters in Tallahassee, Chicago, Orlando, Sutherland Springs, and elsewhere brutalized women long before their gun rampages. These patterns are significant to threat assessment professionals, who are trained to gauge how dangerous a person may be by analyzing a range of possible warning behaviors, including a history of violence, acquisition of weapons, and signs of further violent intent. Years before he fatally shot O’Neal and two other people, Lopez, like many domestic abusers, had used threats of violence to exert control over his ex-wife. Brandishing a gun and threatening to go after her at work were indicators of Lopez’s capacity to plan and carry out an attack, according to a threat assessment expert familiar with the case. Lopez’s record with women contained other warning signs: He had been kicked out of a fire department academy after inappropriately touching female cadets and roughing them up during training exercises. In the years before Beierle struck, he expressed his misogyny and grievances in verbose YouTube monologues. He delivered his pseudo-intellectual and narcissistic screeds mostly in a calm, articulate manner. But his smoldering rage against women was not far from the surface: He seethed in moments when he called out several young women who he claimed had wronged him during his school years. As he recounted how one stood him up for a date, he paused briefly for a nonchalant but chilling aside: “Ah, I could’ve ripped her head off.” Naming names may have been tantamount to Beierle making a hit list, a common behavior among shooters, though ultimately he targeted women he did not know. “The treachery that a female is capable of…to me is astonishing,” he said. “What comes around goes around, and those that engage in treachery ultimately will be the victims of it.” According to a Washington Post investigation, Beierle had also written reverently about a trip he made to the site of the Tallahassee boardinghouse where serial killer Ted Bundy once lived, and to the sorority row where Bundy had murdered two women in 1978. Such a pilgrimage-like act, seeking inspiration from a place associated with infamous violence, is another behavior seen among various rampage shooters. Mass shootings are a small fraction of overall gun violence in the United States, but their steady repetition is grim. Mass murders where men kill their female partners and children occur nearly two dozen times per year, according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Family Violence. The public attacks by men who targeted or brutalized women that we analyzed for this investigation average out to about three per year. Moreover, hundreds of other women are shot to death annually in individual murders or murder-suicides by male intimate partners. Existing federal law prohibits people convicted of some domestic violence crimes from owning or possessing guns, and some states have passed laws in recent years to strengthen such regulations. The Justice Department has also been cracking down recently on domestic abusers who unlawfully keep guns. But many states with looser gun restrictions still allow misdemeanor domestic-violence offenders to have firearms, including abusive partners who are not spouses, a problem known as the “boyfriend loophole.” In Florida recently, a woman fearful of her estranged husband was arrested on robbery charges after she took his guns and turned them into the police—even though he had just been jailed for alleged violence against her, was subject to a temporary restraining order and was prohibited from having guns as a condition of his release on bail. A local law enforcement official said that the gun prohibition was difficult to enforce and essentially would have required the husband’s voluntary compliance: “It’s one of those things you hope people do the right thing and surrender their guns.” As part of an attempt to reauthorize the federal Violence Against Women Act this spring, House Democrats sought to broaden gun restrictions for domestic abuse and stalking convictions and close the so-called boyfriend loophole. But the National Rifle Association and their allies have stood in the way, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell so far burying the bill in the Republican-controlled Senate. Gun lobbyists have long pursued similar goals in statehouses. Opposing a recent effort in Rhode Island to strengthen gun laws against domestic abusers, the NRA acknowledged that domestic violence is “abhorrent”—but argued that some men are falsely accused of abuse and could have their gun rights trampled. As the NRA opposed the Violence Against Women Act this April, a spokesperson reiterated the group’s opposition to tighter gun restrictions for known abusers: “The fact that Nancy Pelosi and her minions of anti-gun zealots insist on adding a gun-control poison pill to an otherwise good bill is just another example of the shameful politics Americans hate.” A week later, a new study based on FBI data revealed that intimate partner homicides in America have been steadily on the rise, increasing 19 percent between 2014 and 2017. In 2017, a total of 2,237 victims were killed. Two thirds of them were women, most of whom were shot to death.

Here’s what to expect from the crowded field of contenders. They’ve been crisscrossing Iowa, leaping on counters, showing off fluffy bellies, collecting endorsements, and publishing cringey, probably staged text exchanges, and now your future president, or at least 20 people who improbably believe that they could be that, will argue in front of a national audience for sport. Congratulations, everyone: Hell, I mean democracy, is upon us! The first Democratic debates of the 2020 presidential cycle will take place in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday, with the slate broken into two nights of 10 candidates each; the order was arranged at least in part to “maximize viewership”—i.e., to keep you and your mom entertained. Politics as entertainment has never failed us yet. Your handy cheat sheet of who’s who, when, and where—moving from the left side (for viewers) of the stage to the right (proximity to center stage was assigned based on highest poll results)—is below. Both two-hour debates begin at 9 p.m. Eastern. Wednesday night: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, U.S. Representative Tim Ryan, former housing secretary Julián Castro, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, Senator Elizabeth Warren, former representative Beto O’Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and former representative John Delaney Thursday night: Author Marianne Williamson, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, businessman Andrew Yang, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator Michael Bennet, and Representative Eric Swalwell If some of these names are, um, less than familiar, I am delighted to tell you that this is a “them” problem and not a “you” problem—and the Inslees and Swalwells of the slates will surely attempt to use their moment in the spotlight, or at least near the spotlight, to tell you who they are. Some may even succeed! Rejoice in this rare moment of getting to watch also-rans as they are literally also-running. The debate is capped at 20 participants, meaning that a handful of others—Steve Bullock, Seth Moulton, Wayne Messam, and Mike Gravel, assuming you consider the teens standing on each other’s shoulders inside Gravel’s raincoat to be a candidate—didn’t make even this generous cut, which was determined based on polling. As that classic American adage goes: sad! Below, some items to watch out for as the fun and/or chaos gets underway. Order your salads and get your hair clips ready, because this is going to be a wild ride. As the front-runner, Biden will almost certainly be the primary story line coming out of the debates. A poor—or even neutral—performance would bolster the sense that he’s already peaked. Historically, Biden has done well in debates: His last two on the national stage, campaigning as Barack Obama’s running mate against Sarah Palin in 2008 and Paul Ryan in 2012, were tours de force. “That’s a bunch of malarkey,” he memorably declared to Ryan. He is good at this. Still: His last dominant debate was seven years ago. That Biden has been the default headline story means that for the nine candidates sharing a stage with him, memorably attacking him is an easy way to make it onto the front page themselves. For that to work, of course, the blows would have to land, and Biden has historically been adept at avoiding damage in this kind of setting. There’s a danger in too many candidates dedicating themselves to attacking Biden onstage: A free-for-all against the front-runner would certainly make news, and perhaps bring Biden down in the polls, but probably not in a way that would do much to single out any of the jabs. Lower-performing candidates in particular need to differentiate themselves, so, well, you could say it’s time for some game theory. Biden’s performance will have ramifications even when he’s not on the stage. This is one of the places where Warren’s draw—she’ll be on the significantly less high-profile Wednesday ticket (more on that later)—hurts her most. Warren, whose campaign has gained traction over the last month, is uniquely qualified to attack Biden. They have history: As Politico recently detailed, back in 2005, when Warren was a law professor at Harvard, she came before a Senate hearing to argue against a bill meant to address the rising rate of bankruptcy. Biden, who was advocating for the bill, spent 36 years representing Delaware in the Senate and is much warmer on banks than many Democrats, let alone 2020 hopefuls—especially Warren. Many major banks use Delaware as a hub, and one does not spend three and a half decades representing the state without making oneself known as a friend to the industry. In the 2005 hearing, Biden tried to deflect Warren’s attacks with his most Biden-y folksy schtick; she was unmoved, and her sharp rejoinders clearly won the exchange. What worked with Ryan in 2012, making the veep look both affable and in control, instead made him look out of touch. It’s easy to imagine Warren getting a similar result now, particularly if she again pushes him on his economic positions, but—at least in this first debate—she won’t get the chance. Count on some of the more obscure hopefuls to do as much as they can to get attention. The second debate is one month from now in Detroit and will likely feature a similar setup with similar requirements to make the stage. But by the third debate—September 12 with a possible second night on September 13—the Democratic National Committee has made clear that it’s done with long-shot sideshows: To make that stage, candidates must be polling at 2 percent or above in at least four major polls (or in polls conducted in the first four states in the Democratic primary calendar) and must have a substantial national donor base (130,000 unique donors total and 400 unique donors in a minimum of 20 states). Those marks are far beyond what many of the lesser-known candidates who will debate this week have achieved; to stay in the race into the fall, they’ll need to do something to raise their name recognition and attract new supporters. That might not be anything truly outlandish—we’re unlikely, alas, to see anyone wear a boot on their head—but doing something flashy in Miami or Detroit is the last, best shot for many of the candidates. Some candidates hope that just being visible onstage will do the trick: Andrew Yang—of the Yang Gang—has said that one of his debate hopes is to get people to ask, “Who’s the Asian man standing next to Joe Biden?” (He’ll actually be two people away from Biden—Pete Buttigieg will be in between them—but he’s reasonably close to the center of the stage, so he may get his wish.) Others want to make sure that their national introduction gets attention for the right reasons: On Tuesday, Marianne Williamson’s director of communications went so far as to send a missive to members of the media specifying that the candidate’s occupation ought to be listed as “best-selling author and activist” and not either “spiritual guru (or any type of guru)” or “Oprah’s BFF or Oprah’s guru. (Or any title that rightfully belongs to Gayle King).” Related OK, OK, Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar aren’t to be dismissed. But the major candidates are heavily concentrated on Thursday’s slate. Warren, meanwhile, will be the only one on Wednesday’s stage who is polling above 5 percent. Will she look über-competent in comparison with the many relatively unknown politicos by her side, or will she seem diminished by it? Will viewers even bother to tune in to Wednesday’s debate if they know the bigger candidates are coming the following night? At the very least, Warren is missing out on an opportunity to join in the inevitable fireworks that will come on Thursday. Still, she has a chance to own Wednesday’s coverage, and if Thursday devolves into a dogpile on Biden, she might do well to stay away from the fracas (for now!) and keep the conversation on her policy platforms. On June 16, a white police officer in South Bend, Indiana, shot and killed Eric Logan, who was black, while answering a call about a man breaking into cars. Buttigieg, who has been South Bend’s mayor since 2012, suspended his campaign and returned to the city. Then, early Sunday morning, a mass shooting at a local bar killed one and injured 10. On Sunday, Buttigieg hosted a tense town hall to address the police shooting. Buttigieg has already had trouble convincing skeptics that his tenure as the mayor of South Bend—a city of scarcely 100,000—is sufficient experience to take on the presidency. Now even that is in tumult, just as his national ambitions are about to be challenged. Will he be able to take the decidedly national questions about policing, gun violence, and race that these incidents have raised and translate them into something that resonates with voters and shows a clear line from South Bend to the White House? In recent weeks, Bernie Sanders has remained second in the polls, but he’s been losing ground to Warren. Since 2016, Sanders’s critics have been keen to lampoon him as little more than a rabble-rouser who’s equally—or more—interested in upsetting the traditional Democratic field as he is in defeating Trump. The debate offers him a chance to show that that’s incorrect—and to make the case, naturally, that traditional Democratic politics aren’t the right way forward. He’s clearly eager to make a splash: This week, he trotted out an ambitious student loan forgiveness program. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Check your inbox for a welcome email.

News By Yaron Steinbuch Submit June 26, 2019 | 11:56am				| Updated June 26, 2019 | 12:51pm Two more Florida deputies involved in last year’s Parkland school massacre have been fired for neglect of duty, the Broward County sheriff announced Wednesday. Deputies Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were fired Tuesday for their inaction in the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed, Sheriff Gregory Tony said. He did not give details of the internal affairs investigation but said a lengthy report would be released later. “In essence, it was neglect of duty. We lost 17 people,” Tony said at a brief press conference. Stambaugh was working an off-duty shift at another school when he responded to reports of shots fired at Stoneman Douglas, the Sun-Sentinel reported. He walked to the back of the school to put on his bulletproof vest and then took cover for about five minutes when he heard the shots, according to bodycam footage. Stambaugh then got back in his truck and drove to a nearby highway — a trip that took more than five minutes, according to a state commission investigating the law enforcement response. Eason, meanwhile, fled as bullets flew, then wasted time fiddling with his bulletproof vest and body camera while students were dying, investigators said. He also had been faulted for not writing an official report after getting a tip in February 2016 that the school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had threatened on social media to open fire at a school. Earlier this month, two other deputies were fired for neglect of duty — including school resource officer Scot Peterson, who was the first armed law enforcement officer at the scene, yet stood in place outside the building for 48 minutes. Peterson faces 10 charges of failing to confront Cruz, child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury. His lawyer has said he will fight the charges. Scott Israel, who was the sheriff at the time of the Valentine’s Day mass shooting, was removed from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for similar reasons. He is appealing that decision before the state Senate. Deputy Brian Miller was fired in May. Three other deputies — Michael Kratz, Brian Goolsby and Art Perry — were cleared in the investigation and will be allowed to return to work. The Broward Sheriff’s Office has been assailed for its response to the shooting, including by parents, other law enforcement agencies and many South Florida political leaders. Cruz, who confessed to the massacre, faces 17 counts each of first-degree murder and attempted murder.

441,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/KDT1d90tqeE/,"The NRA announced Tuesday that it has decided to shut down NRATV — the live broadcasting media arm of the organization — as well as part ways with spokesperson Dana Loesch. The gun lobbying group is also severing business ties with its estranged advertising firm Ackerman McQueen, which has represented the NRA for nearly four decades and operates NRATV. The two parties have been embroiled in an ugly lawsuit, as the NRA has accused the firm of staging an “executive coup.” Moreover, the decision to shut down production of NRATV comes in response to several prominent board members expressing their distaste with the far-right, conspiracy theory peddling content NRATV produces, which muddles the NRA’s core mission of protecting second amendment rights: “Many members expressed concern about the messaging on NRATV becoming too far removed from our core mission: defending the Second Amendment,” Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.’s longtime chief executive, wrote in a message to members that was expected to be sent out by Wednesday. “So, after careful consideration, I am announcing that starting today, we are undergoing a significant change in our communications strategy. We are no longer airing ‘live TV’ programming.” According to the New York Times, The NRATV may continue to run pre-recorded content, however on-air personalities such as Dana Loesch and other Ackerman employees will no longer be the public faces of the NRA. Loesch specifically has recently come under fire for particularly abhorrent messaging such as putting KKK masks on “Thomas & Friends” cartoon characters and the repeated taunting of Parkland shooting survivors. As such, once the news hit Twitter, people couldn’t help but savor the rich irony — offering the newly unemployed Loesch their most sincere “thoughts and prayers.” Thoughts and prayers ⁦?? @DLoesch⁩ ⁦@stinchfield1776⁩  https://t.co/8uwAqzKHaC — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) June 26, 2019  While Dana Loesch is trending because she was fired by the @NRA from NRATV, a reminder that she put KKK hoods on Thomas & Friends cartoon characters, said she hopes the Mueller report burns in an “AIDS fire,” and called gun safety advocates “tragedy dry humping whores.” pic.twitter.com/yKEsaET501 — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 26, 2019  Thoughts and prayers @DLoesch. https://t.co/ZPQszNE5B7 — Molly Knight (@molly_knight) June 26, 2019  hearing NRATV and Dana Loesch are canceled like pic.twitter.com/9p9m0spqsF — shauna (@goldengateblond) June 26, 2019  So sorry to hear about the demise of NRATV.

442,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/06/26/aoc-applauds-worker-walk-solidarity-kids-sleeping-beds/,"It’s hard to believe but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has outdone even herself. She proved just how vacuous she can be when she cheered-on a worker walk-out scheduled for Wednesday in Boston by employees of Wayfair. (See our earlier coverage.) Yes, Wayfair, the e-commerce company that sells home goods. She wants Wayfair to end its federal contract to sell beds for children in border detention centers. AOC actually thinks it is a good idea for employees to bully Wayfair over its contract to sell $200,000 of mattresses and beds to a detention center housing children on the southern border. Over 500 employees signed a petition to demand the company end its contract and they committed to a walk-out Wednesday in solidarity. The Baptist Children’s Family Services, a non-profit charity group working to furnish the detention center in Carrizo Springs, Texas, contracts with the federal government to manage some of the camps along the border with Mexico. Wayfair workers think the company is enabling illegal alien detentions for profit. This is all about virtue-signaling from the open borders crowd. “The United States government and its contractors are responsible for the detention and mistreatment of thousands of migrants seeking asylum in our country,” the employees wrote in an undated letter organizers said was signed by 547 employees. “We want to be sure that Wayfair has no part in enabling, supporting, or profiting from this practice.” They added that the detention of migrants at the southern border isn’t “an ethical business partnership Wayfair should be a part of.” You can’t make this stuff up. If AOC and her pals are so concerned about the conditions in detention centers and especially the welfare of children caught up in the illegal activities of their parents, why would she deny them a bed in which to sleep? Does she prefer children to sleep on cold concrete floors instead of a bed with a new mattress, just to own the people who support our country’s sovereignty? AOC considers the real problem here to be that Wayfair is “profiting from concentration camps.” She jumped right in with her support. The employees demand that Wayfair donate their profit from the sale to RAICES. Yes, there’s a tweet for that. Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children. They asked the company to stop. CEO said no. Tomorrow, they‘re walking out. This is what solidarity looks like – a reminder that everyday people have real power, as long as we’re brave enough to use it. https://t.co/667abeLDTG — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 25, 2019  Employees have asked Wayfair to donate the profits, $86,000, to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, a nonprofit organization that operates in Texas. The company leadership team responded as you might hope they did. They told the employees that they will sell to “any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate.” Good for them. I hope they don’t cave to the Marxist demands of its employees. Private business is to be commended for standing up to those who believe the federal government should provide everything for its residents from cradle to grave. The employees have no right to demand Wayfair donate profits and certainly not to whom donations should be made. Besides no longer doing business with Baptist Children’s Family Services, there is a second demand. The employees want their “core values” taken into account. From CNN: More than 500 employees sent a letter Friday to senior management, asking the company to no longer do business with BCFS. They also asked Wayfair to establish a code of ethics that “empowers Wayfair and its employees to act in accordance with our core values.” CNN has seen a copy of the email sent by employees to Wayfair senior management. Who among us thinks that more than 500 employees are going to agree upon what constitutes the same core values? Does Wayfair only hire the open borders crowd? The company does lean liberal enough to have pulled its advertising dollars from the Laura Ingraham show on Fox when she criticized David Hogg, the gun-grabbing student after the Parkland, Florida mass shooting in the high school. Maybe they will cave to the demands of the mob. Some of the usual suspects have weighed in with their support of the workers on Twitter. We must actively #resist any & all efforts by this cruel, incompetent administration to cage children and separate families. I proudly stand in solidarity w/ the hardworking individuals at #Wayfair who are walking out in the name of #justice & humanity. https://t.co/UFvCZNGeTJ — Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@RepPressley) June 25, 2019  I stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for. https://t.co/L3hqbazX4l — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) June 25, 2019  It’s too bad that the Democrats continue to blame President Trump and his administration’s immigration policies for the disasterous conditions at the southern border. Instead of working with the administration and Republicans in Congress to solve the problems, beginning with approving additional funding, they rant on social media. Democrats aren’t really concerned about the conditions in detention centers, they just want a political issue. Officials called on Congress this week to pass a multi-million dollar funding package to help the relevant agencies provide care to children being held in facilities at the border. Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner John Sanders urged Congress this week to pass a $4.6 billion emergency funding package which includes nearly $3 billion he says will provide the growing population with adequate care. AOC and her sister legislators were vocally against additional funding for the border. They went so far as to slam the agents and others working on the border by calling them criminals. This kind of rhetoric is unacceptable yet Speaker Pelosi and other high-ranking Democrats allow it to continue without consequences. “These radicalized, criminal agencies are destroying families and killing innocent children,” a statement from Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., read. Their accusation appeared to refer to deaths of migrant children while in U.S. custody. A bill passed Tuesday night in the House after Speaker Pelosi wrangled the far left faction of the Democrats into voting on additional funding for the humanitarian crisis. The funding is for $4.5 billon. The bill passed along party lines in the Democrat-controlled chamber after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelled a mini-revolt by progressives and Hispanic lawmakers who sought significant changes to the legislation. New provisions added to the bill were more modest than what those lawmakers had sought, but the urgent need for the funding – to prevent the humanitarian emergency on the border from turning into a debacle – appeared to outweigh any lingering concerns. The 230-195 vote sets up a showdown with the Republican-led Senate, which may try instead to force Democrats to send Trump a different, and broadly bipartisan, companion measure in coming days as the chambers race to wrap up the must-do legislation by the end of the week. Wayfair was down 5% on the New York Stock Exchange at the end of business Tuesday. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

443,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/26/virginia-beach-gun-free-zone/,"Photo by ERIC BARADAT/AFP/Getty Images A Virginia Beach employee is circulating a petition to abolish the city’s policy barring personnel from bringing guns into work if they are properly permitted. Vincent Smith, an engineer who worked in Building 2 where the recent shooting occurred, posted a petition on change.org asking the city to amend its employee weapons ban so properly licensed personnel may bring their gun to work, local CBS affiliate WTKR reported. “People are forced, like I am every day, to choose between earning a living and saving my life,” Smith told WTKR. “I want a real consideration by council and a real discussion about changing the policy that the city has to something that doesn’t just forbid employees to have weapons but something that includes an allowance for people to take a personal level of responsibility for their own safety,” he said. VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA – JUNE 02: People stop to pay their respects to those killed in a mass shooting at a makeshift memorial outside the City of Virginia Beach Operations Building June 02, 2019 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The petition had 2,270 signers as of June 26, close to its initial goal of 2,500. Smith wasn’t in the building during the May 31 shooting that left 12 people dead, including shooter DeWayne Craddock. The shooting occurred on multiple floors of Building 2 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center, reported CNN.

Smith is also his building’s evacuation manager, and long recognized a “gap” in security because qualified employees could not carry a firearm into the building. In 2016 he drafted a petition to change the policy and collected 260 signatures, one of whom was Bert Snelling, an outside contractor killed May 31. “Had I gotten these changes effective on May 30th we would be looking at a very different May 31st,” Smith added.

445,https://ew.com/music/2019/06/26/madonna-god-control-music-video-shooting-scene/,"'RuPaul's Drag Race' star Monét X Change also appears in the brutal clip. Madonna has taken a visually graphic stance against gun violence in her new music video. The just-released, Jonas Åkerlund-directed video for “God Control,” a gospel-infused dance-pop song that contains a lengthy disco breakdown and firearm blasts peppered throughout its complex production, sees the legendary performer donning 1970s-inspired outfits as she makes her way out to a nightclub with a group of friends (including Gigi Gorgeous, actress Sofia Boutella, RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars 4 champion Monét X Change). The evening ends in tragedy, however, as a gunman opens fire on the dance floor, leaving multiple victims — including Madonna — bloody and wounded in the aftermath. “If you’re sitting alone in your apartment all day and you’re writing about the downfall of humanity, it tends to get you down. After a while, you need to have fun. So, where does a girl go? She goes to a disco!” Madonna said of the video’s concept in a pre-release teaser. “I tried to bring the world of disco and freedom, and having that joy silenced by a small thing made of metal that can end someone’s life. Guns need to be made illegal.” The video also features footage of real gun control protests, and ends with a quote from Angela Davis that reads, “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.” “The idea of the song is that I’m speaking about something very serious, but the music is disco. It’s ironic because we used to be able to go places like discos to have fun, to forget, to be free, and now even those places aren’t safe,” she added in another teaser. “Let’s get some gun control, people!” “God Control” — produced by Mike Dean and longtime Madonna collaborator, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, for the singer’s 14th studio album, Madame X — also contains lyrics urging Americans to “wake up” to the perils of gun violence that spills the “blood of innocents” in the country. “Our nation lied, we lost respect / When we wake up, what can we do? Get the kids ready, take them to school / Everybody knows they don’t have a chance / To get a decent job, to have a normal life,” Madonna coos at the start of the track, which evolves from a chorus-backed chant into a full-fledged dance party across its six-minute runtime. “When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh / They pretend to help, it makes me laugh.” Madonna further references the effects of gun violence elsewhere on Madame X, with the album’s closing track “I Rise” incorporating portions of an impassioned speech given by Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor and gun control activist Emma González. The 60-year-old previously raised eyebrows during the Madame X album cycle as she performed the promotional single “Future” with rapper Quavo at the 2019 Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv, Israel — a set that saw Madonna’s dancers wearing the Palestinian and Israeli flags on their backs as they embraced, which was widely seen as a political statement on the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The performance concluded as the words “wake up” — which also feature prominently in “God Control — flashed on a giant screen behind the duo. In the wake of the stir, a representative for Madonna told EW that “a message of peace is not political.” Madonna has noted that “God Control”‘s parent album, Madame X, was crafted around the titular persona, described as “a secret agent traveling around the world, changing identity, fighting for freedom, and bringing light to dark places.” Over the years, various entries in the artist’s robust videography have also courted controversy — namely the music video for the Mirwais-produced “American Life,” which included images of real-life war violence and ended as Madonna tossed a hand grenade to a George W. Bush lookalike. Madame X is out now, and will be supported by an intimate, worldwide theater tour throughout 2020. Ahead of Madonna’s headlining performance Sunday at New York City’s WorldPride event, watch the “God Control” music video above.

446,https://gizmodo.com/facebook-cites-mass-shooting-streamed-live-on-facebook-1835885104,"Questioned over Facebook’s efforts to stop the spread of false information in the aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, a senior Facebook official called to testify before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday said the company has since improved the way it handles viral acts of bloodshed and terrorism. As evidence, the official pointed to actions taken by Facebook this spring during the Christchurch terrorist attack—a massacre of more than 50 Muslim worshipers in New Zealand that was streamed in real-time over the internet  by a shooter using Facebook Live. “Our systems didn’t work the way we wanted them to after Las Vegas,” said Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook, when she was pressed about the spread of misinformation and extremist content by Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat whose congressional district occupies most of Las Vegas. Hundreds of current and former police officers and other law enforcement personnel are members of… Considered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, an individual armed with two dozen guns fatally shot 59 festivalgoers from a window on the 32nd floor of Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay Hotel in October 2017. On Facebook, the shooter was misidentified in viral posts that spread well after the real shooter was identified by police. Accused of harboring hate and serving as a gateway to violence, Facebook and other major social networks are scrambling to devise new methods to stem the spread of extremist content. Earlier this month, YouTube announced plans to purge the site of thousands of videos and channels advocating hatred of individuals because of their race or religion. Facebook wants its platform to be a “hostile environment” for terrorists, a company official told reporters last month. While the social giants often speak of the immense technical challenges involved in such undertakings, Facebook and YouTube have both faced allegations that executives simply ignored the deadly consequences of their failed moderation policies in pursuit of greater profit and growth. YouTube, especially, has been accused of knowingly radicalizing users with its algorithms that encourage them to watch videos progressively more “edgy,” hate-filled and caustic. On Wednesday, Titus recalled how the Las Vegas shooting was followed by a wave of hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and misinformation, including widely shared Facebook posts that misidentified the gunman and his religious affiliation. “They peddled false information claiming the shooter was associated with some kind of anti-Trump army,” she said. On Facebook’s “Safety Check” page, where users are encouraged to “connect with friends and family to find help after a crisis,” a blog listed as a top story identified the shooter as a woman who was described as a “Trump-hating Rachel Maddow fan.” Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo later told the press that the shooter—a 64-year-old man—was “happy with Trump” because of the stock market. Seated alongside Google and Twitter officials on Capitol Hill, Bicker testified that Facebook’s crisis response had “gotten better” since the 2017 shooting, pointing specifically to Facebook’s response to the Christchurch terrorist attack this March. “With Christchurch, you had these companies at the table and others communicating real-time, sharing with one another, URLS, new versions of the video of the attack,” she said, noting that Facebook stopped 1.2 million versions of the video from being spread across the platform. Facebook said in March that it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally. It’s systems, in other words, failed to prevent some 300,000 videos—or roughly 20 percent of them—from being viewed by users. “So we’ve gotten a lot better technically,” Bickert told the committee. The Christchurch massacre was streamed live on Facebook and viewed about 4,000 times before it was removed. Copies and edited versions of the videos subsequently spread across the site and onto Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms. “One of the things we saw after Christchurch that was concerning was people uploading content to prove the event had happened,” said Nick Pickles, senior strategist of public policy at Twitter. Derek Slater, global director of information policy at Google, said it was YouTube’s policy to “raise up” authoritative sources of information. “And we will also seek to reduce exposure to content that is harmful misinformation including conspiracies and the like.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that four Google employees privately admitted that they won’t allow their own children to watch YouTube unsupervised. The sentiment, they claimed, is widespread at the company. “One of these people said frustration with YouTube has grown so much that some have suggested the division spin-off altogether to preserve Google’s brand,” the report said. “So we’ve gotten a lot better technically,” Bickert told the committee.",2019-06-26 18:03:00,Facebook Cites Mass Shooting Streamed Live on Facebook as Proof Platform Has 'Gotten Better',,4469,http://gizmodo.com
447,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/madonna-god-control-video-852755/,"Welcome, Singer’s clip for Madame X track depicts nightclub shooting Reporter Madonna highlights the devastation of gun violence — and our maddening inability to take meaningful action to prevent it — in her chilling new “Gun Control” video. The clip contrasts the joy of nightclub dancing with the brutality of a mass shooting. “The story you are about to see is very disturbing,” warns the opening text. “It shows graphic scenes of gun violence. But it’s happening every day. And it has to stop.” From there, director Jonas Åkerlund cuts to the deadly shooting, a children’s choir singing at a church vigil, scenes from a Seventies-styled discotheque and modern-day protests against guns and the NRA. In-between, Madonna churns out the song’s lyrics on a typewriter. “I want to draw attention through my platform as an artist to a problem in America that is out of control and is taking the lives of innocent people,” Madonna said of the video in a statement. “This crisis can end if our legislators act to change the laws that fail to protect us all.”  She elaborated on the clip via Instagram, writing, “This is your wake up call. Gun violence disproportionately affects children, teenagers and the marginalized in our communities … Honor the victims and demand GUN CONTROL. NOW. Volunteer, stand up, donate, reach out. Wake up and insist on common-sense gun safety legislation … Innocent lives depend on it.” “God Control” is the vocalist’s third single from her recently issued 14th LP, Madame X, following “Medellín” and “Crave.” In This Article:

Gun control. Now’ Last modified on Wed 26 Jun 2019 22.43 BST Madonna has released a graphically violent video for her new single God Control, which depicts a mass shooting heavily reminiscent of the one in Orlando’s Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead and 53 injured in June 2016. She makes a stark call for gun control, both in the song’s lyrics and in a written statement at the end of the video, which reads: “Every year over 36,000 Americans are killed in acts of gun violence and approximately 100,000 more are shot and injured. No one is safe. Gun control. Now.”  She also quotes civil rights activist Angela Davis: “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.” The video features a tearful Madonna typing the song’s lyrics: “When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh / They pretend to help, it makes me laugh … They say that we need love / But we need more than this.” The scenes are intercut with her imagining herself at a nightclub, beginning with the gun attack and rewinding through the evening, including a scene of her being mugged at gunpoint on the way to the club. The nightclub scenes are disturbing and bloody, depicting a gunman opening fire with an automatic rifle, and striking the attendees. Until the October 2017 shooting at a Las Vegas music festival which killed 58, the Pulse terror attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was shot and killed by police during the attack – he had described himself as an “Islamic soldier” and pledged allegiance to Islamic State. In a separate statement, Madonna said: “I want to draw attention through my platform as an artist to a problem in America that is out of control and is taking the lives of innocent people. This crisis can end if our legislators act to change the laws that fail to protect us all.” In a recent interview, Madonna said: “When you think about the amount of people who have died, been killed, have been wounded, whose lives have been changed irrevocably because of the lack of gun control in America, it’s such a huge, huge problem.” In the same interview she also championed LGBT rights and criticised recent US restrictions on abortion, saying: “We fought really hard for a lot of these freedoms and now it seems like they are all systematically being taken away ... It doesn’t make me feel hopeless. It just makes me want to fight back.” God Control is directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who has made numerous videos with the singer beginning with Ray of Light in 1998. He has also frequently worked with Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and David Guetta.",2019-06-26 17:02:34,Madonna calls for gun control in violent video that depicts nightclub shooting,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Former DEA Special Agent David Katz breaks down the details of a deadly shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia. A Virginia Beach city employee has started a petition to allow civil servants to carry concealed firearms at work in the aftermath of a mass shooting that left 12 people dead last month. Vincent Smith, an engineer who is also the evacuation manager in the building where the shooting took place, wants city officials to end the gun-free zone policy pertaining to municipal employees while at work. Current policy only allows the public to carry firearms in the municipal center. MORE FAMILIES DEMAND INFORMATION ON VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING ""In the wake of recent tragic events, it has become abundantly apparent that this employee weapons possession ban must end,"" the petition reads. ""Time and again we have tragically witnessed that gun-free zones are in fact some of the most dangerous and vulnerable places in America. We are petitioning to allow our properly permitted City personnel to have the right to bear arms and defend themselves while at work. Such arms will be required to remain concealed."" The petition had garnered nearly 2,600 signatures as of Wednesday evening. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE ZERO IN ON SHOOTER'S WEAPONS CACHE AND JOB BACKGROUND Smith started a similar petition in 2016 after seeing what he deemed to be red flags in evacuation plans and security on city property. That petition received only 260 signatures, including Bert Snelling, a contractor killed in the May 31 shooting. The gap was not ""allowing employees to carry a firearm if they're qualified,"" he told WTKR-TV of perceived security lapses. ""Instead, people were forced — like I am every day — to choose between earning a living and saving my life."" Smith envisions a program where the city vets employees wishing to bring firearms to work through background checks and psychological exams. ""I don't propose that every employee with a concealed permit be able to carry it at work,"" he told the news station.

450,https://www.bustle.com/p/every-2020-candidates-gun-control-stance-in-one-big-list-16796614,"News  The mass shooting in Virginia Beach that left 12 victims dead at the beginning of June began another wave of tweets and statements from politicians denouncing the status quo and calling for stricter gun laws. But, like after most such shootings, the laws in the country have not moved an inch. Most of the people running for president promise they would change that, and many have their own plan to combat gun violence in America. Here's where every 2020 candidate stands on gun control. The status quo â at least for the Democrats â may be two bills that the House passed in February. Neither have much chance of being picked up by the Republican-controlled Senate or being signed by President Trump. But it does show where the Democratic party largely is on gun policy. The first bill, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which was supported by a handful of Republicans, too, would expand background checks to every sale in the United States â even those sold privately online or at gun shows. Another bill passed by the House in quick succession would extend the waiting period for federal background checks when buying a gun to 10 days. The policies proposed by the candidates for the Democratic nomination largely fall in line and build off these policies. Some even go much further, suggesting innovative ways to keep guns out of the wrong hands and to prevent further mass shootings and gun violence in the country. Here's what every 2020 candidate has to say. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado doesn't yet have a dedicated section for gun control on his website, but he does mention it in his ""vision"" under ""Restore American Values."" The website reads, that he will ""enact common-sense steps to end gun violence."" This year he has also tweeted about gun control, noting the need to pass ""common sense"" reforms including universal background checks. His time in the Senate gives some insights into his positions on gun control. ABC News reported that he has a ""mixed record,"" citing his support for checking guns in Amtrak bags and OntheIssues.org reported he received a C+ rating from the NRA in 2010. Former Vice President Joe Biden doesn't have a set plan on his website, but he argues on social media and in his campaign speeches that he has a strong history of taking on the NRA. Legislatively, he has long been in favor of gun control. ""I know how to beat the NRA because Iâve done it before - twice,"" Biden tweeted on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. ""I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."" Of all the candidates in the race, Sen. Cory Booker has arguably the most developed plan to tackle gun violence. The key difference that sets Booker's plan apart is that he would not just require background checks but gun permits as well. ""Hereâs how it would work: Individuals could seek a gun license at a designated local office, widely available in urban and rural areas, similar to applying for or renewing a passport,"" Booker wrote about his plan on Medium. ""They would submit fingerprints, provide basic background information, and demonstrate completion of a certified gun safety course."" The permits would be good for five years and would be renewable. Booker also has proposals to keep gun manufacturers accountable for their products in terms of regulations and also would allow them to be found liable in civil suits when guns are used misused or trafficked, causing ""public safety implications."" Montana Gov. Steve Bullock has written about gun violence in an intensely personal way. His nephew was shot to death in a Montana schoolyard by another student when he was just 11. In a May 2018 USA Today op-ed, he shared that experience and wrote about the kind of gun control he supports, including background checks, age restrictions, red flag laws that allow for guns to be taken away from someone temporarily when family or police request it, and a ban on bump stocks. Bullock himself owns a gun, he said. ""Americans calling for protection of the Second Amendment want their families to be safe,"" Bullock wrote in the op-ed. ""I know because Iâm a gun owner who believes in the Constitution, yet also recognizes its limits."" South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg lists gun laws as an issue on his campaign page. He outlines a number of policies that he would like to achieve, including universal background checks, red flag laws, waiting periods for gun purchases, a ban on ""military-style"" assault weapons, and a nationwide gun licensing system similar to the one that Booker proposed. His issues page also stresses lowering the rate of gun deaths by suicide, says he will get guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and will support policies to ""hold the gun industry accountable."" Former HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro does not have a section on his website dedicated to gun policies, but he has been calling for more sensible gun laws since 2012, following the Newtown shooting. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Castro addressed the Second Amendment, stating, ""like every other freedom, there are reasonable limits, regulations to be placed on it."" In the interview, he stressed universal background checks and gun access rules regarding people who have mental health challenges. On Twitter in June, he also advocated for an assault weapons ban. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio doesn't have a full campaign website yet, let alone a section on gun control. As mayor, though, de Blasio started the Office to Prevent Gun Violence to reduce gun crimes and deaths in the city in 2017. ""We, every single day, are working to make this the safest big city in America,"" de Blasio told The New York Times in January. ""We need the laws that we have that protect against guns being on our streets and we will fight to protect ourselves, thatâs the bottom line."" Rep. John Delaney of Maryland has a whole section on his website about ""gun safety."" He lays out several areas that he would work on, including universal background checks, a ban on ""high-powered, military-style assault weapons,"" a ban on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, and passing extreme risk or red flag laws. He also says he would close the ""boyfriend loophole"" for domestic violence abusers, essentially stopping abusers who aren't married to their partners from purchasing firearms, and push for gun violence research. In March at a presidential candidate forum with WBUR, Delany spoke about his plan for gun control if he's elected and praised red flag laws based on the experience in Maryland. ""The family can go to the court and actually have the court intervene around that situation and take the firearm away,"" Delaney told WBUR. ""In my home state of Maryland, itâs been incredibly successful ... Itâs a good example of a smart policy."" Gabbard consistently scores low on NRA ratings and high with the Brady Campaign, an organization that advocates for gun control. Her website doesn't have an issues list, but there are policy positions on her old website from her last congressional run. ""She has long called for reinstating a federal ban on military-style assault weapons and high capacity magazines, requiring comprehensive pre-purchase background checks, closing the gun-show loophole, and making sure that terrorists are not allowed to buy guns,"" her congressional campaign page reads. It also lists the many bills that she co-sponsored on gun control over the years. Gillibrand, like almost all of the Democrats running, has an ""F"" from the NRA and stellar ratings from the Brady Campaign. Gillibrand does mention the issue on her presidential campaign site, noting her NRA rating and different policies she has supported, including universal background checks. She spoke out on the issue in November on The Late Show. ""Well, it is extraordinarily heartbreaking and it's infuriating because Congress literally has done nothing in the face of gun death after gun death in communities all across this country,"" Gillibrand told the host, Stephen Colbert. ""And it is because of the greed: the greed of the gun manufacturers and the greed of the NRA."" Gillibrand, though, was not always such a strong advocate gun control. When she served as a representative in the U.S. House for upstate New York, she maintained a more conservative view on guns. At the time, she had an ""A"" rating from the NRA. She has since spoken out about her change of heart. Former Sen. Mike Gravel for Alaska has not tweeted about guns once, or any related post about violence. Nor does he have a section on his website about gun control. He has, though, made a very strong statement against selling arms to other countries. OnTheIssues.org reported that he made a variety of statements in 2007 and 2008. He previously supported a license and training requirement for gun ownership and has spoken about supporting the Second Amendment. Harris has lousy grades from the NRA like the other candidates. She has a dedicated section about gun violence on the issues page of her presidential campaign site where Harris puts forward a dramatic plan that she would make happen on her own if Congress doesn't act in her first 100 days in office (though she hopes they will). In the section, Harris says she would use executive orders to mandate federal background checks, revoke licenses of some gun manufacturers, and make it harder for domestic abusers to buy guns. It also outlines her record as district attorney and attorney general in California, where it says she called to renew a federal assault weapons ban and ""defended Californiaâs gun violence prevention laws."" Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado doesn't have an issues page on his website, but the site does mention gun control in his ""about the candidate"" section. ""He stood up to the NRA to pass landmark gun safety legislation, including limits on high capacity magazines and universal background checks,"" the page reads, referencing his time leading Colorado. In May, Hickenlooper announced a gun control plan to the media that included universal background checks, national gun licenses, raising the minimum age to own a gun to 21, and an assault weapons ban. He also proposed improving mental health services for children in the hopes of preventing future violence. He also has an ""F"" rating from the NRA. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington doesn't have a gun control section on his website â the focus is largely climate change â but he does have a history of supporting the gun control since 1994, even paying a political price for his votes. He lost his congressional seat in 1994 following his support of an assault weapons ban, according to CNBC. In Washington state, he has pushed for citizen's initiatives that restrict guns in the form of a red flag law and raising the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles in recent years. In 2019 alone, he has signed into law a number of measures, according to the AP. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota does have a section on guns on her website. The site reads that preventing gun violence is ""long overdue."" Among the policies that she calls for are universal background checks and banning high capacity magazines,  bump stocks, and assault weapons. She's also worked to ensure that a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act would close what is usually referred to as the ""boyfriend loophole,"" which allows domestic violence abusers who aren't married to their partners to continue to purchase firearms. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas doesn't list gun control on his website, but he has tweeted about gun control â even before his run for president, back when he was trying to win the Texas U.S. Senate seat. His plan when running for the Senate included universal background checks, supporting federal research on gun violence, which is currently banned, and a ban on ""weapons of war."" Miramar, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam has a large section on gun reform on his website â though the policy details are at times scarce. He talks about his fears as a parent and a citizen every time there is a shooting, mentioning the Parkland shooting in particular as it is just ""minutes down the road."" ""As a result of Washingtonâs refusal to address gun violence, young people across the country have grown up traumatized by the gun violence epidemic,"" Messam writes. On his web page, Messam adds that he supports law enforcement taking guns from domestic abusers, people with mental illness, and those on the terrorist watch list. Messam also says he has a goal of cutting gun deaths in half during his first term. On the local level, Messam has made an amphitheater gun-free and has sued to be able to institute more gun control, according to Axios. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts does not have a section on gun control on his campaign website, but he has spoken about the issue while in elected office. On his congressional website, he has written that he supports universal background checks, a ban on ""weapons of war,"" and allowing for federally funded research into gun violence. He's also written op-eds on gun control, speaking about his time serving in the military and using weapons of war on the battlefield as context. ""So believe me when I tell you: There's simply no reason for a civilian to own a military-style assault weapon. It's no different than why we outlaw civilian ownership of rockets and landmines,"" he wrote in The New York Daily News. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio does not have a section on gun control on his campaign website. He was once a member of the NRA but he says he left the organization over its inability to address gun violence, The Huffington Post reports. ""I support background checks, I support researching this, I support closing the Charleston loophole, I support keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists or people who are on the terrorist watch list,"" Ryan said in Iowa in March. ""So all of the comprehensive firearm reforms that are out there, I strongly support."" His voting record in the early 2000s, though, matches his NRA rating of ""A"" at the time. He has voted in the past to prevent lawsuits against gun manufacturers and to prevent research on gun violence, according to OnTheIssues.org. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont does have a section on his site about gun safety. On the page, Sanders advocates for ""expanded"" background checks, an assault weapons ban, prohibiting high-capacity ammo, and targeting people who buy guns for criminals. ""When we are in the White House, we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of Americans want,"" the page reads. But Sanders has not always had these positions, according to NBC News. Earlier in his career, including as a U.S. representative, he voted for a number of pro-gun laws including the law that prevents gun manufacturers from being held financially responsible. He also opposed federal research into gun violence and a national system for background checks. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has a large part of his campaign website dedicated to ending gun violence. He has an eight-part plan that lays out the policies he would take if he were to become president, including a national gun buyback program, universal background checks, a federal licensing program, an insurance requirement for gun owners and more. He supports a ban on bump stocks, assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and more. He would also regulate gun manufacturers, invest in research into gun violence, expand protections for survivors of domestic violence, and expand programs to prevent suicide. ""There's nothing that we propose here today that is at odds with what [the NRA] claims they stand for,"" Swalwell said at a news conference announcing his plan, according to CBS News. ""I think the greatest threat to the Second Amendment is doing nothing."" In 2016, President Trump ran on reversing some gun control policies that President Obama had put in place by executive order, including the policy that used Social Security Administration data to stop people who could not care for themselves from buying a gun. Trump signed a bill that reversed that. Since moving into the White House, Trump has proposed a number of gun policies, many of which would loosen restrictions on buying and carrying guns â or even encourage arming more Americans. He's against gun-free zones and has proposed arming teachers, for example. He has expressed openness toward some gun control, though. In late 2018, his administration officially banned bump stocks. He has also spoken about raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles and making the country's background checks system better. None of these ideas came with detailed policy, plans though. Like almost all of her colleagues, Warren has a meager rating from the NRA. Guns don't make her issues list on her campaign website, though, even though she has spoken out on gun control in the past and said that she would declare gun violence a national emergency were she to be elected in a conversation with The Late Late Show's James Corden in February. She has voted several times to ban high-capacity magazines and supported an extension to the assault weapons ban. In 2017, after the Las Vegas strip shooting, Warren called for ""sensible"" changes, including strengthened background checks. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld has not tweeted the word ""gun"" once and has only used the word ""violence"" a few times. As a Republican challenging Trump, he has a different position from many of the other contenders on the list. Several candidate profiles on Weld do not mention gun control either. According to OnTheIssues.org, Weld opposed gun control when he ran as a libertarian for vice president in 2016. That was a shift from his time serving as Massachusetts governor in the 1990s; at that time, he supported gun control, according to the Conservative Review. Marianne Williamson, an author and spiritual leader, has a long section on her website about gun reform. The website reads that the argument over gun control is ""less about the Second Amendment and more about profit maximization for gun manufacturers."" She points to the wording ""well-regulated"" in the Second Amendment and proposes a number of policies. Williamson's page says she would ban assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines, implement universal waiting periods and background checks, pass red flag laws, and put limits on people with mental illness' ability to purchase weapons. She also suggests a gun license would require more training. ""More than anything else, I feel that as president, I could make a moral argument for the cultivation of greater respect for life, in our lives,"" Williamson's page concludes. ""The cultivation of love and respect for others is perhaps the most powerful gun safety measure, and I would pursue it with all my heart."" Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, also lays out a gun reform plan on his page that compares getting a gun to driving a car. He proposes that there be several tiers of licenses for different types of guns, from ""basic"" rifles and handguns to ""advanced and automatic weaponry."" The requirements would slide up to, everything from age (up to 21) to the need to provide DNA to the FBI. He also supports banning bump stocks and creating federal safety guidelines. ""Most Americans agree on common-sense safety requirements and restrictions on firearms,"" Yang's page reads. ""As President, I will support sensible regulation of guns that allows their continued enjoyment by responsible gun owners in a framework that promotes the overall public safety."" There are plenty of variations among the candidates on gun control policies, but the biggest difference is between Republicans and Democrats. In the bills that passed in February, a few Republicans supported the universal background check bill, but none were in favor of lengthening the waiting period, for example. That difference won't become the media's focus until closer to the general election, though, as Democrats are likely to try and position themselves on their gun control policies in the debates and on the campaign trail. The winning policies for the primaries will likely go far beyond what has currently passed either house in Congress. As voters consider who they'd like to support â especially for those who prioritize gun control â these policy proposals allow for an informed decision.

451,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/sVFnCq-HqnU/,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said during Wednesday’s debate that gun violence is a “national health emergency in this country.” She suggested that solutions might include “universal background checks” and banning “weapons of war,” a reference to “assault weapons.” Warren did not mention that California adopted universal background checks in the early 1990s, yet the state has witnessed mass shooting upon mass shooting in the decades since. She also omitted the fact that California has an “assault weapons” ban, yet the shootings continue. She said, “We can also double down on the research and find out what really works.” Warren added, “We need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done.” On June 25, Breitbart News reported a 60 Minutes segment about University of Southern California research on AR-15s. That research contrasted an AR-15 rifle with a 9mm handgun and found that the rifle was more powerful than the handgun. The researchers could have found an even greater discrepancy in power if they had compared an AR-15 rifle to a .32 handgun.

452,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/603662854/0/phoenix/nation~Ford-asks-Alabama-car-dealer-to-end-shotgun-giveaway-after-California-shooting/,"DETROIT – Ford Motor Co. has asked a Ford dealership in Alabama to stop giving out certificates for free 12-gauge shotguns to anyone who buys a new or used vehicle. The automaker told the dealership late Wednesday that the promotion was inappropriate after three people died Tuesday evening during a mass shooting at a California Ford dealership. There, a man who had been  fired from his job at the dealership in the San Francisco Bay area fatally shot two employees, then himself, according to local media reports. ""So it’s done. They’ve ended our promotion. I’m very disappointed,""  Colin Ward, general manager of Chatom Ford in Chatom, Alabama, said Wednesday. Chatom Ford's advertising offered a shotgun, a Bible and an American flag with a car purchase. The offer drew  hundreds of calls from across the country from people wanting to buy cars to get the shotgun. ""Ford said we can fulfill our commitments to the customers that we've made up till now, but we have to cease it going forward,"" Ward said. 'God, Guns and Freedom': A rural Alabama Ford dealership's promotion is a viral sensation Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said that leaders in Ford's regional office asked Ward to cease and desist the promotion in light of the California shooting. ""This is a local promotion. It is not something Ford developed and the dealers are independent businesses,"" said Reid. ""But if a dealership is (altering the promotion) in light of the tragedy, that seems appropriate.” From the start, Ward was overwhelmed by the response he got from the promotion that he and a buddy devised earlier this month. Some gun control advocates objected, but Ward insists the offer was not intended to offend anyone. He only wanted to sell more cars in the tiny rural town of Chatom. A video that Ward posted June 21 on Facebook, called ""God, guns and freedom,"" went viral. ""All our phone lines are jammed up and it’s an overwhelming response,"" Ward told the Free Press on Tuesday morning. “We only have three salespeople. They’re overwhelmed right now."" In a promotion that was set to run until July 31, Ward was giving customers a $200 gift certificate for a 12-gauge shotgun good at any gun store, as well as a Bible and an American flag with a new or used vehicle purchase. ""This was not a political ad to offend anyone or exclude anyone,"" said Ward, who added he would give equal value gift certificates for other items to those who didn't want a shotgun. One customer asked Ward for ""a different kind of flag"" and Ward offered him an Amazon gift card of equal value to select what he wanted. ""If you want a Torah, I’ll buy you a Torah. If you want a Koran, that’s fine. I don’t discriminate against anyone,"" said Ward. ""We just didn’t have that on hand because 90% of our customers here are Southern Baptist."" Ward's dealership sells about 360 new and used cars a year, mostly F-150 pickups. In the past, he said, he has given away Microsoft Xboxes, Apple iPads and television sets. He wanted to do something different this time. ""We were catering to our local community,"" he said. ""With dove (hunting) season around the corner, the Fourth of July is the American flag, so we thought we’d combine both."" Chatom is about an hour's drive north of Mobile, Alabama. Largely rural, it has a population of about 1,200 people. In the video, Chatom Ford sales manager Koby Palmer stood in front of a red pickup, draped in an American flag, holding a Bible, and pitched the deal intended only for ""our little local community,"" said Ward. ""We're a small dealer, we just made a video on Facebook, it wasn’t even a TV ad, so I have no idea why it’s getting this reaction."" Chatom Ford was not prepared for an influx of business from other states or the diverse new customer base. In one case, a man from Miami called to buy a new F-250 pickup, but the man only spoke Spanish. “I had to look around and my service manager speaks Spanish,"" said Ward. ""So I turned him into a salesperson today."" Chatom sold a used Ram pickup to a customer in New York state, Ward said. He has received calls from Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts, New York, Canada and Europe, he said. ""They’re literally coming from everywhere,"" said Ward before hearing from Ford.  ""We can’t handle any more than what we have happening right now.” He said the store sold about half a dozen cars in two days. While Ward was emphatic that his promotion was not political, other gun gimmicks at car dealerships were indeed political. One in southern Oregon at Earnest Auto Sales ran  around this time last year. The dealership in Roseburg, Oregon, erected a sign that read, ""Buy a car, get a gun."" The sign went up the same day that 200 people rallied at the county courthouse in support of the Second Amendment, local media reported. In November 2010, a truck dealership in central Florida took the promotion to a new level with a ""Buy a truck, get a free AK-47"" deal, upsetting some gun control advocates. Nations Trucks in Sanford, Florida, offered $400 vouchers to  truckbuyers to redeem at a nearby gun store. In July 2009, Max Motors in the tiny city of Butler, Missouri, about 50 miles south of Kansas City, offered a gift certificate for a Kalashnikov AK-47 rifle to anyone who bought a pickup. The dealership's business slogan was “God, Guns, Guts, and American Pick-Up Trucks."" But the appropriateness of a gun giveaway depends on geography, auto industry experts say. ""In my 15 years here at the association, I cannot recall a Colorado new car dealer running any kind of a gun promotion as a sales effort (or any other other effort),"" said Tim Jackson, president of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association. ""Frankly, in most areas of Colorado (and the country), this would not be a good idea due to the controversial nature of guns. Though, geographically, there are areas of the country that may be an effective program."" On the East Coast, such promotions are rare, dealership association heads say. ""Not in New Jersey,"" said Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers. But Chatom Ford appears to have the blessing of his state. Tom Dart, president of the Automobile Dealers Association of Alabama, said the promotion was a good marketing move. ""Those are iconic symbols in the patriotic Deep South that would resonate with many consumers,"" said Dart. ""It seems to be a pretty effective promotion given the coverage it has received.""

453,https://pjmedia.com/trending/the-morning-briefing-who-won-medals-at-the-woke-olympics-debate/,"Aquí está lo que está en la agenda del presidente hoy: The Woke Olympics: Carousel of Freaks I am ashamed to say I watched the entire debate. Who was the winner? I would say it was a tie between Donald Trump and those who did something else. Perhaps the second round of debates will be different. Just kidding. Here is a summary for the smarter people among us who did not watch. Most of the candidates claimed that Trump’s economic policies are not working for the middle class, only the rich are benefiting. The poll numbers do not reflect this claim. According to Rasmussen’s latest survey released on Wednesday, 50 percent of likely voters say the economy is good or excellent. By comparison, only 34 percent said the same about Obama at the same point in his administration. Similarly, 53 percent rate their personal finances as good or excellent in the latest Rasmussen Reports Consumer Spending Update. Only Democrat special math resolves that 50 percent are the “top 1 percent” beneficiaries of Trump’s economic policies. Will voters believe this lie? Will they take the risk of Democrats coming in and suffocating the economy by taking away money “from the wrong hands” and putting it into the hands of the truly worthy? We’ll see. Elizabeth Warren, the leader of the pack, periodically disappeared during the debate but was given plenty of attention in the beginning. Robert Francis O’Rourke spoke in Spanish (this is will play well during the general election, LOL) and Cory Booker retaliated by also speaking in Spanish. I learned last night that Cory Booker lives in a neighborhood where there are gunshots at night. Wasn’t he the mayor of Newark at some point? Sounds like he did a great job. When Beto was speaking Spanish, Cory Booker was speaking meme. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/T5bthONryS — Ben Greenman (@bengreenman) June 27, 2019  De Blasio and Warren both want to put you into a government-controlled health care program and take away your healthcare choices. Speaking of choices, most of the candidates tussled over how pro-choice they are; many supported no restrictions on abortion. Julian Castro, who doesn’t speak Spanish, believes in “reproductive justice.” I don’t know what that is, but it sounds scary. Apparently, it involves trans women getting abortions. “What that means is that just because a woman, or let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose,” Castro said. Does a trans woman have a uterus? On national security, some of the candidates said China was the biggest geopolitical threat while others said it was Iran. I can’t remember which ones, they all blurred together since they aren’t really that different policywise, said climate change was the biggest threat. Other answers were nuclear war and one person, perhaps de Blasio, said it was RUSSIA. That is wild since we just spend $40 million getting to the bottom of the RUSSIA-collusion mythology. The climate change clown Inslee said Trump was the biggest threat. One big topic was immigration. Most of the Democrats on the stage wanted to decriminalize unauthorized crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border. This is insane. Is there another country on the planet that allows people unauthorized access to their country? I don’t think that is a very strategic political position to take. However, sex traffickers, gang members and drug cartels support this policy, so that must be the niche the candidates are trying to nail down. Four men believed to be associated with ISIS were just busted in Central America, presumably on their way to the U.S. The Democrats welcome you, ISIS terrorists! Finally, another notable debate moment was the Tim Ryan and Tulsi Gabbard argument over foreign involvement. Gabbard is very anti-war; Ryan wanted to keep troops in Afghanistan. I think Tulsi really elevated herself during the debate and Google Trends shows she was one of the most searched candidates during the circus.

Here's the top 10:https://t.co/I0WiP7r7bt pic.twitter.com/GwK5s3P7UT — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 27, 2019  Oh yes, one more thing: we didn’t hear much about impeachment last night relative to the amount of coverage it gets in the corporate media.

454,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ar-15-used-mass-shootings-weapon-of-choice-60-minutes-2019-06-23/,"Some of the worst massacres in recent memory have had something in common: the AR-15 style rifle. Scott Pelley reports on why the high-velocity rounds used in the gun makes it so deadly The mass shooting this past April at a California synagogue has something in common with the deadliest massacres: the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Variations of the AR-15 were used to kill at two New Zealand mosques, a Pittsburgh synagogue, Texas church, a Las Vegas concert, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and Sandy Hook Elementary School. The AR-15 style rifle is the most popular rifle in America. There are well over 11 million and they are rarely used in crime. Handguns kill far more people.   But as we first reported last November, the AR-15 is the choice of our worst mass murderers. AR-15 ammunition travels three times the speed of sound. And tonight we're going to slow that down, so you can see why the AR-15's high velocity ammo is the fear of every American emergency room. Mass shootings were once so shocking they were impossible to forget. Now they've become so frequent it's hard to remember them all. Last October, in a Pittsburgh Synagogue, 11 were killed, six wounded. FBI Special Agent Robert Jones: This is the most horrific scene I've seen in 22 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Members of the Tree of Life Synagogue conducting a peaceful service in their place of worship were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith. Just 11 months before, it was a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Assistant fire chief Rusty Duncan was among the first to arrive. Rusty Duncan: 90 percent of the people in there were unrecognizable. You know the blood everywhere, I mean it just covered them from head to toe. They were shot in so many different places that you just couldn't make out who they were. The church is now a memorial to the 26 who were murdered. Rusty Duncan: I've never had the experience, not with any kind of weapon like this. For me to see the damage that it did was unbelievable, it was shattering concrete, I-- you know, you can only imagine what it does to a human body. Scott Pelley: The police estimate that he fired about 450 rounds. Rusty Duncan: Oh, I believe it. I saw the damage it did. I saw the holes in the church from one side to the other, all the pews, the concrete, the carpet, I saw it all. A gunshot wound is potentially fatal no matter what kind of ammunition is used. But Cynthia Bir showed us the difference in an AR-15 round against gelatin targets in her ballistics lab at the University of Southern California. Cynthia Bir: Years of research have gone in to kind of what the makeup should be of this ordnance gelatin to really represent what damage you would see in your soft tissues. Scott Pelley: So this is a pretty accurate representation of what would happen to a human being? Cynthia Bir: Yeah, this is currently considered kind of the state of the art. This is a 9 millimeter bullet from a handgun, which we captured in slow motion. The handgun bullet traveled about 800 miles an hour. It sliced nearly straight all the way through the gel. Now look at the AR-15 round. Cynthia Bir: See the difference? Scott Pelley: Yes. It's three times faster and struck with more than twice the force. The shockwave of the AR-15 bullet blasted a large cavity in the gel unlike the bullet from the handgun. Scott Pelley: Wow. There's an enormous difference. You can see it right away. Cynthia Bir: Yeah, exactly. There are fragments in here. There's, kind of took a curve and came out. You can see a much larger area in terms of the fractures that are inside. Now watch from above. On top, the handgun, at bottom, the AR-15. Scott Pelley: It's just exploded. Cynthia Bir: It's exploded and it's tumbling. So what happens is, this particular round is designed to tumble and break apart. The 9 mm handgun round has a larger bullet, but this AR-15 round has more gunpowder, accelerating its velocity. Both the round and the rifle were designed in the 1950's for the military. The result was the M16 for our troops and the AR-15 for civilians. Cynthia Bir: There's going to be a lot more damage to the tissues, both bones, organs, whatever gets kind of even near this bullet path. The bones aren't going to just break, they're going to shatter. Organs aren't just going to tear or have bruises on them, they're going to be, parts of them are going to be destroyed. That fairly describes the wounds suffered by 29-year-old Joann Ward. At Sutherland Springs Baptist Church she was shot more than 20 times while covering her children. Ward was dead, her daughters mortally wounded, as assistant fire chief Rusty Duncan made his way from the back of the sanctuary. Rusty Duncan: As I got a couple of rows up, Ryland's hand reached out from under his stepmom and grabbed my pant leg. I wouldn't even known he was alive until he did that. I didn't even see him under her. Well, that's where me and him made eye contact for the first time. Joann Ward's five-year-old stepson Ryland Ward was hit five times and was nearly gone when he reached trauma surgeon Lillian Liao at San Antonio's University Hospital. Scott Pelley: How much of Ryland's blood do you think was lost before he came to you? Lillian Liao: At least half. This is Ryland's ER X-ray. Lillian Liao: You see the two bullet fragments that are in him. Scott Pelley: The X-ray shows you the solid fragments of the shrapnel and the bullets, but it doesn't tell you much about the damage to the soft tissue. Lillian Liao: No, and it doesn't tell you what's on the inside. I mean a bomb went off on the inside. And our job is to go in there and clean it up. Scott Pelley: A bomb went off on the inside because of the shockwave from these high-velocity rounds. Lillian Liao: Correct. Ryland endured 24 surgeries to repair his arm, leg, pelvis, intestines, kidney, bladder and hip. Lillian Liao: At some point it's like putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. Scott Pelley: What do you mean? Lillian Liao: Well his organs are now in different pieces and you have to reconstruct them. The arm was missing soft tissue, skin, muscle and part of the nerves were damaged. The bowel has to be put back together some of the areas of injury has to heal itself so you can see that he can walk around like a normal child and behave as normal as possible. With the AR-15, it's not just the speed of the bullet, but also how quickly hundreds of bullets can be fired. The AR-15 is not a fully automatic machine gun. It fires only one round with each pull of the trigger. But in Las Vegas, it sounded like a machine gun. A special add-on device called a bump stock allowed the killer to pull the trigger rapidly enough to kill 58 and wound 489. In other mass killings the AR-15 was fired without a bump stock, but even then, it can fire about 60 rounds a minute. Ammunition magazines that hold up to 100 rounds can be changed in about five seconds. Maddy Wilford: I remember hearing the gunshots go off and being so nervous and scared and all of the sudden I felt something hit me. Scott Pelley: You'd been shot how many times? Maddy Wilford: Four times. Scott Pelley: How many surgeries? Maddy Wilford: Three. For my arm, my stomach and my ribs and lung. In February of 2018, 17-year-old Maddy Wilford was at school, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 17 were murdered, 17 wounded. Maddy Wilford: And I just remember thinking to myself, there's no way, like, not me, please, not me. I don't wanna go yet. Laz Ojeda: Her vital signs were almost nonexistent. she looked like all the blood had gone out of her body. She was in a state of deep shock. Paramedic Laz Ojeda saved Maddy Wilford, in part, because Broward County EMS recently equipped itself for the battlefield wounds that the AR-15 inflicts. Laz Ojeda: We carry active-killer kits in our rescues. Scott Pelley: Active-killer kits? Laz Ojeda: Yes. Scott Pelley: What is that? Laz Ojeda: That is a kit that has five tourniquets, five decompression needles, five hemostatic agents, five emergency trauma dressings. Dr. Peter Antevy, Broward County Medical Director, told us today's wounds demand a new kind of training. Peter Antevy: If I take you through one of our ambulances or take you through our protocols, almost everything we do is based on what the military has taught us. We never used to carry tourniquets. We never used to carry chest seals. These were things that were done in the military for many, many years. Scott Pelley: When did all of that change? Peter Antevy: It really changed I think after Sandy Hook. After Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 first graders and six educators were killed with AR-15 rounds, a campaign called ""Stop the Bleed"" began nationwide. Antevy and doctors including Lillian Liao in San Antonio, are training civilians who are truly the first responders. There have been more than 45,000 classes like this in the last four years. Peter Antevy: The day after the shooting, my kids, they're waking up, and they're ""time to go to school."" And, my son heard kind of heard what happened the night before, when I was on the scene, and he looked at me with the fear of God that he had to go to school that day. My first instinct was, ""He needs a bleeding kit."" My son today has a bleeding kit on his person. Scott Pelley: How old is he? Peter Antevy: 12 years old. Here it is. This is it. We, we, I've given him this and I've taught him how to use it. Scott Pelley: You believe that these mass casualty events have become so common – Peter Antevy: Absolutely. Scott Pelley: – that it is important for everyone in this country to be prepared. Peter Antevy: Everyone. Scott Pelley: That's where we are in America today? Peter Antevy: That's where we are. Ryland Ward survived the church massacre because firefighter Rusty Duncan used his belt as a tourniquet. For over a year Ryland has worked, often six days a week, learning to sit, stand, and walk again. Ryland Ward: I'm going to see if this actually goes in the hospital. Yep. Scott Pelley: Did you meet some new people in the hospital? You were there for a long time. Ryland Ward: How do you know? Scott Pelley: They told me. I talked to some of the people who helped you. Ryland Ward: Like who? Scott Pelley: There was, uh, Doctor – Ryland Ward: Liao? Scott Pelley: Doctor Liao, yes. He has his strength back. Its remarkable, really. But healing from the loss of his stepmother and sisters won't be as quick. Maddy Wilford is also moving forward. Like many who suffer physical trauma, her interests have turned to medicine and an internship where she is studying the kind of surgeries that saved her. Not long ago, many communities assumed mass murder would never come to them Today, all Americans are being asked to prepare for the grievous wounds of high-velocity rounds. Produced by Ashley Velie.

455,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/27/parsons-google-facebook-facial/,"YouTube Screenshot / 20th Century Fox Fears of technological innovations are nothing new. When the Kodak portable camera was introduced in 1888, a panic ensued over privacy concerns. People were horrified “Kodak Fiends” would take embarrassing photographs of them without their consent. The panic over the Kodak camera even made its way to the White House. When a boy took a picture of President Theodore Roosevelt during his first week in office, Roosevelt scolded the boy, saying “you ought to be ashamed of yourself!” Today, the panic over the Kodak camera seems quaint. Americans carry pocket sized cameras everywhere they go. Still, those fears didn’t seem silly at the time. But real privacy risks were eventually mitigated by things like “Peeping Tom” laws and fear faded as cameras improved, offering more benefit than risk to consumers. Yet, the tendency to embrace the commonplace and fear new inventions exists. Sociologists have coined the term “technopanic” to describe the mass moral panics that occur when people distrust technology and fear it is a risk to society. But often, this unchecked fear just slows technological progress and imposes real societal costs in the process. A recent example is the technopanic over facial recognition technology. Facial recognition is rapidly evolving and offers many potential benefits to users. Some of these benefits include faster and more secure check-in or payment methods online, personalized services, and more security. But understandable fears of government overreach may be going too far and ultimately hamstring the benefits of this emerging technology. It is important to constrain government use of facial recognition technology as news reports out of China and elsewhere illustrate how it could be abused. But curbing even private development of facial recognition technology has become a growing trend in the states. Currently, Illinois, Washington and Texas have laws restricting private uses of the technology. The city of San Francisco followed suit by outright banning local government agencies from using facial recognition technology. Now, Oakland, California and Somerville, Massachusetts are considering similar policies. The most stringent biometric privacy law is in Illinois. Known as the “Biometric Information Privacy Act,” the law effectively prohibits private entities such as Facebook or Google from implementing facial recognition into any of their products. These well-meaning biometric privacy laws are meant to protect consumer privacy. However, they may end up doing the opposite. Facial recognition technology uses biometric identifiers to increase privacy over alternative verification methods. A passcode can be hacked or stolen. But a fingerprint or facial scan to unlock an iPhone? That’s a password unique to the user that cannot be easily replicated. Another practical use for facial recognition is allowing parents and teachers to register their biometric identifiers with a school to help keep track of those authorized to enter a secure school building. That is a particularly promising use of this technology as we try to make our schools and workplaces safer in the wake of mass shooting. Future generations might look back at our current technopanic over facial recognition technology and think it just as quaint as the outrage over the Kodak camera. And while fears over potential abuses should be taken seriously, it is important to mitigate any actual harm without curbing the benefits of this invention. Constant government surveillance is a scary idea. But, due to the infancy of facial recognition, we have barely begun to scratch the surface of many private benefits it can offer to consumers — increased privacy and security being just the beginning. We must be careful not to stifle this exciting new technology out of fear of the unknown.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: Imagine this real nightmare scenario: You are the father of the youngest victim of the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut — the worst school-related massacre of its kind in American history. It was a day when the dad, Lenny Pozner, dropped off three of his kids at school and went home with just two of them. The other was transported in a body bag to the city morgue. Let that sink in for a moment. But you did not get enough time to grieve. Soon after you buried your son, a small but extremely active group of demented and delusional conspiracy theory souls opined the incident was faked and part of a government and multi-layered liberal conspiracy to attack the Second Amendment. They accused Pozner and other Sandy Hook parents on social media and other venues as being paid “crisis actors” who made up their kids. One hoax groupie, Lucy Richards from Florida, actually threatened Pozner’s life several times caught on audio and was later prosecuted and sentenced two years ago to a five-month prison term. But the pinnacle of this outlandish crusade was the publication in 2015 of “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook: It was a FEMA Drill to Promote Gun Control.” The 400-plus-page book, which was sold on Amazon for two weeks before it was pulled, argued the event was faked. It also theorized  Pozner was not who he really was and that he falsified the death certificate of his 6-year-old son, Noah — a boy whose jaw was blown off when he was shot by school gunman Adam Lanza, according to the medical examiner autopsy report. It went on to postulate that Noah was not only not Pozner’s kid, but that the boy was made up and never existed, according to court documents. Instead of ignoring the conspiratorial yo-yos, as other grieving parents initially did, Pozner got his Brooklyn ire up and pushed back. In addition to forcing social media sites like Facebook and others to pull hoaxer sites, family pictures and comments, he formed HONR. The site is composed of a group of tech-savvy volunteers seeking to expose lies and targeting the extremist community of people who purvey the idea that Sandy Hook was a hoax. Of course, that made the divorced IT consultant and father more of a target and prompted a few relocations across the country. But push more he did, primarily to defend and honor his murdered son’s legacy. He also began shopping nationally for a lawyer to file a defamation lawsuit against the co-authors of the inflammatory book. The lead author is James Fetzer, a retired University of Minnesota-Duluth college professor living in Wisconsin who, in a conspiracy blog,  once tied the school shootings to the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence and counterterrorism agency. Pozner ended up selecting Jake Zimmerman, a St. Paul native, Central High School and University of Minnesota Law School grad who had never litigated a defamation case before in a 16-year legal career mostly specializing in high-tech, semiconductor patent litigation and some personal injury cases. “Jake and I talked about my situation and my experiences,” Pozner told me this week. “He really listened and took the time to address my concerns. I liked his approach for this case and his general philosophy about litigation.” Pozner’s choice paid off. Last week, six months after the suit was filed, Wisconsin Dane County circuit judge Frank Remington ruled that, indeed, Pozner had been defamed by Fetzer and his co-author Mike Palecek. The book publisher, Moon Rock Books, had previously settled and later publicly apologized to Pozner.  A jury trial to assess punitive and compensatory damages is scheduled for October. “If Mr.  Fetzer wants to believe that Sandy Hook never happened and that we are all crisis actors and even that my son never existed, he has the right to be wrong,” Pozner told reporters in a prepared statement after the ruling. “But he doesn’t have the right to broadcast those beliefs if they defame me or harass me,” Pozner added. “He doesn’t have the right to use my baby’s image or our name as a marketing ploy to raise donations or sell his products. He doesn’t have the right to convince others to hunt my family.” Fetzer, who still uses a University of Minnesota email address that describes him as a “distinguished” McKnight emeritus professor though he retired in 2006, disagreed with the decision. “My day in Court did not turn out as expected,” he tweeted. “ Even though I was able to produce decisive proof of the death certificate published in (the book) is a fabrication — because it lacks certification — the Judge ruled against me.” Please. Stop the nonsense. Have a heart. Smell the coffee, say 100 Hail Marys and Our Fathers for penance and then go away and get a life. Now ask me how I really feel. Like most of us, attorney Jake Zimmerman watched the TV coverage of the Sandy Hook massacre of 20 children, most just a tad older than his own at the time, and six staffers, with a sense of stomach-churning angst. “It was just insanity. Then, the fact that there are people out there denying the opportunity to grieve just seemed morally wrong and so I decided to take the case,” Zimmerman told me. He caught the socially conscious legal eagle bug early in adolescence growing up in a Saintly City household where his mother hosted dinners and gatherings attended by longtime family friends and attorneys Bill Tilton and the late Ron Rosenbaum. The passionate back and forth conversations and debates on legal and social matters “got heated but they were never personal attacks. They were focused on the merits of the arguments,” he recalled. “They took on pro bono cases. They worked hard for causes they believed in.” He credits his eight-year stint at the Minneapolis-based Robins Kaplan law firm as great affirmation for his career pursuit before he decided to found a law firm of his own a few years ago. Along with three other lawyers admitted to practice in Wisconsin, including his wife, Zimmerman removed emotions from the case and launched his own independent probe into Fetzer’s allegations in the book. He ordered his own copy of the book as well as Noah’s birth and death certificates and autopsy report. He also obtained Noah’s pediatric medical records going back to the day Noah and his twin sister were born at Danbury Hospital. Father of Sandy Hook Victim Wins Defamation Suit Against Massacre Deniers  “We submitted evidence of what their temperatures were at the time of birth, what their heartbeat rates were when they first passed urine,” Zimmerman said. For Pozner, the lawsuit was never about money. It was about having a court legally acknowledge that his son, Noah, the one who did not return home that fateful day seven years ago, was a real boy who was murdered. It was the first legal court victory in an ongoing and pending slew of similar lawsuits filed in Texas by Pozner and other Sandy Hook parents against Alex Jones and his InfoWars cable TV program. Jones had also heavily promoted and spun the Sandy Hook fake conspiracy theory in recent years until he was finally confronted with legal pushback and attributed his views to “psychosis.” As Pozner shared in an email, “hoaxers have posted my address, social security number, and other private information online. They have posted videos of my home, with crosshairs aimed at my balcony. I have two surviving children. It’s terrifying that people would threaten me and my family because of things that are published by Fetzer and other hoaxers.” “I am gratified that by pursuing this case, not only have I won a victory for Noah and for my family, I have also helped to establish a precedent that may make it easier for other victims to seek justice in court,” he said. Zimmerman noted that the ruling had ripple effects that resonated beyond Pozner and those directly impacted by the Sandy Hook shootings. He got a call from a Danbury Hospital records clerk who wanted to let him know that staffers inside watching a TV report on the Wisconsin ruling “stood up and spontaneously applauded” at the breaking news. Zimmerman was humbled and touched by the reaction. “Their lives have been so impacted by these people,” he said. “Conspiracy theorists show up in town, start looking through documents and making accusations, and it impacts on the ability of the people there to grieve. “We don’t normally think of a town as being injured. They did not lose all their kids,” Zimmerman added. “But they really have been injured by this event. It’s incredibly difficult to move on when someone shows up in town every couple of weeks and says you guys are all in on this conspiracy, that you guys are all crisis actors and you are all getting paid.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

She didn’t acknowledge the 49 people who died for that artistic inspiration,” he continued. “This is the same Madonna who– right after the Pulse shooting happened – posted a picture of herself kissing Britney Spears to honor the 49 victims who had just lost their lives.” “I just question and wonder where Madonna’s head is at,” he added.  Another survivor, Patience Carter, said the pop icon’s video was “really hard to watch.” “I understood what she was trying to do with bringing awareness to the topic of gun control, but I definitely felt that wasn’t the right way to go about doing it,” she said. “Because, for someone like me who actually saw those images, who actually lived those images, to see them again dramatized for views, dramatized for YouTube, I feel like it was really insensitive,” Carter added. Madonna reportedly made the video because she “can’t take it anymore.” “I made this video because I want to draw attention to a crisis that needs to be addressed. To me, this is the biggest problem in America right now,” she said.  EntertainmentMediaPoliticsgun violencemadonnaPulse nightclubPulse Orlando .

462,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/603853252/0/milwaukee/sports~Brewers-Pirates-Brandon-Woodruff-becomes-the-first-game-winner-in-National-League/,"The Milwaukee Brewers continued to struggle to score runs Saturday night but Brandon Woodruff didn't need a lot of support. With Woodruff shackling the Pittsburgh Pirates on six hits and one run over 7 ⅔ innings, the Brewers squeezed out a 3-1 victory at Miller Park. It was only the fifth victory in the last 15 games for the Brewers, who are 4-5 on their last three-series home stand with a game remaining. Woodruff (10-2, 3.79 ERA) became the first 10-game winner in the National League with his eighth quality start of the season. Josh Hader, who has not allowed a hit or run over his last eight outings, worked the ninth to record his 20th save. The Pirates struck for a run in the first inning after Kevin Newman led off with a single and Bryan Reynolds was hit by a pitch. Woodruff recorded two outs before Colin Moran lined a run-scoring double to right-center but the Brewers cut down Josh Bell trying to score from first base, holding the deficit to one run. BOX SCORE: Brewers 3, Pirates 1 RELATED: Woodruff has been a winner for Brewers NOTES: Arcia's defense played role in Saladino replacing Perez HAUDRICOURT: Offense an issue but the rotation is a bigger concern Yasmani Grandal led off the bottom of the inning with a bunt hit to the left side, foiling the Pirates’ infield shift to the right. After Christian Yelich walked on four pitches, the runners advanced on Mike Moustakas’ sharp grounder to first. Pirates starter Jordan Lyles had a chance to escape the inning when Ryan Braun bounced into an out at the plate but he threw past first base on a pickoff attempt, allowing Yelich to trot home from third. Eric Thames followed with an RBI triple into the right-field corner to give the Brewers a 2-1 lead. Thames tacked a run on the Brewers’ lead with one down in the fourth inning when he sent a towering drive down the right-field line and well into the second deck for his 11th home run of the season. The blast came on a high 3-2 fastball from Lyles. Woodruff cruised through the second, third and fourth innings before finding some trouble in the fifth. After Corey Dickerson led off with an opposite-field double to left, Woodruff retired the next two batters, only to have Lyles hit a tapper to the left side for an infield hit. With runners on the corners, Woodruff stopped it there by inducing Newman to bounce into a force at second, keeping it a 3-1 game. The Brewers continued to mount threats against Lyles and the Pittsburgh bullpen without success. They collected only one hit in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position, keeping it a tight game. Yelich will be in HR Derby: FOX TV had Christian Yelich miked for the national broadcast and he was heard talking to Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell about participating in the All-Star Home Run Derby. Makes sense, since he leads the majors with 29 HRs. The Brewers’ Jesús Aguilar participated last year in the Derby but bowed out after one round. MLB has yet to announce the HR Derby field. Suter ready to move forward: Left-hander Brent Suter, 11 months past Tommy John reconstructive elbow surgery, is back in town and will travel with the club to Cincinnati, where he will meet with Dr. Timothy Kremchek, who performed his surgery. If Kremchek gives the go-ahead, Suter will return to the team’s training facility in Arizona and begin facing hitters in live batting practice, a big step in his recovery process. “I started throwing curveballs off the mound this week and it went good,” Suter said. “I’m excited. The process has been so day-to-day.” Suter still has hopes to pitch for the Brewers in September but manager Craig Counsell said that would fall in the category of “pleasant surprise” if it happens. In other words, the Brewers won’t count on it but would love if it happens. The same goes for reliever Bobby Wahl, who is recovering from an ACL tear in spring training. Brewers benefit from challenge: The Pirates challenged a safe call at second base with Keston Hiura in the sixth inning and rued doing so after the call was upheld. They lost their challenge and had to wear it in the seventh when Corey Dickerson was obviously safe at first on what was ruled a 3-6-3 double play. California Strong honored: In a pregame ceremony, Brewers players Christian Yelich, Ryan Braun and Mike Moustakas, and Mike Attanasio, son of team owner Mark Attanasio, were honored for their efforts in leading the California Strong movement that raised money for families stricken by the wildfires in that state as well as the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill. Several members of that group’s leadership were on hand for the ceremony as well as representatives of Southeast Ventura County YMCA, which partnered with California Strong to get money to those in need. To date, more than $2 million in donations has been raised, with more than 625 families benefiting. Yelich, Braun, Moustakas and Mike Attanasio were given YMCA Community Service Awards for their efforts. This year: 44-39 Last year: 48-35 Saturday: 37,821 This year: 1,506,000 (34,227 avg.)

465,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-orourke/democrat-presidential-hopeful-beto-orourke-outlines-lgbtq-policy-proposal-idUSKCN1TD16B,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Ginger Gibson 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke on Wednesday outlined his proposal to improve gay rights in the United States and to reverse what he called “discriminatory policies” under President Donald Trump. “LGBTQ+ Americans have made incredible progress over the past decade, thanks in large part to the tireless efforts of activists and advocates — but too many LGBTQ+ people still lack protection under many states’ laws and the current Administration is encouraging rather than stamping out discrimination,” O’Rourke, a former U.S. representative, said in a statement announcing the proposals. Coinciding with June’s designation as Gay Pride Month, O’Rourke joined other Democratic presidential candidates this month in calling for more federal action to protect gay rights. His announcement came on the third anniversary of the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, when an Islamic State-inspired gunman killed 49 people. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, a monumental decision that altered the national legal status of gay couples across the country. Democrats have called for additional protections, including laws to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. O’Rourke is one of more than 20 Democrats running for president, who have near universal agreement on gay rights protections. His three-part proposal included a series of executive orders to reverse Trump policies: canceling the ban on transgender troops, reversing a policy that allowed federally funded adoption agencies to reject gay parents and ending current policies that greatly restrict gay men from donating blood. He also called for measures to protect transgender women from violence. Among other examples, he promised to allow migrants seeking asylum to qualify as a “vulnerable population” if they are gay. Second, he would work with Congress to pass legislation to end discrimination, including employment, housing and access to public services. Finally, he would work to help improve gay rights abroad. His administration would establish an office within the State Department dedicated to gay rights and would seek a new international treaty to enshrine gay rights. O’Rourke joined an annual two-mile jog known as the Pride Run in New York City on Wednesday morning. Other Democratic candidates also marked the Pulse anniversary. In an email to supporters, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is gay, listed the victims’ names and called for stricter gun limits and hate crime laws. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, also used the occasion to call for “commonsense gun reform” and stronger protections for LGBTQ Americans in an email to backers.

466,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/middleeast/mohamed-morsi-dead.html?module=inline,"Advertisement Supported by By Declan Walsh and David D. Kirkpatrick KHARTOUM, Sudan — Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president, collapsed and died while on trial in a Cairo courtroom on Monday, six years after the military ousted him in tumultuous circumstances that pushed Egypt back to autocratic rule. The Egyptian authorities gave no official cause of death, but critics blamed the poor conditions in the prison where Mr. Morsi had spent the past six years. They said the authorities had deprived him of vital medicine for diabetes, high blood pressure and liver disease; held him in solitary confinement for long periods; and ignored repeated public warnings that the lack of proper medical care could be fatal. “I think there is a very strong case to be made that this was criminal negligence, deliberate malfeasance in providing Morsi basic prisoner rights,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch, said Monday. “He was very obviously singled out for mistreatment.” His death was a somber milestone in Egypt’s ill-fated democratic transition after the Arab Spring in 2011. Mr. Morsi, 67, won Egypt’s first free presidential election in 2012 as a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, but was removed from power a year later in a military takeover. Since then he faced a raft of charges including terrorism, spying and breaking out of prison in trials that human rights groups say are deeply flawed. He was in court to face espionage charges on Monday afternoon when he fell unconscious and died, Nabil Sadek, Egypt’s prosecutor general, said in a statement. Mr. Morsi had spoken for five minutes from the glass cage where prisoners are kept before the hearing was adjourned, Mr. Sadek said. Moments later Mr. Morsi collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. In his final comments, Mr. Morsi continued to insist that he was Egypt’s legitimate president, one of his lawyers told The Associated Press. The first freely elected president in Arab history, and the first Islamist to occupy that role, Mr. Morsi was elected on June 17, 2012, seven years to the day before he died. His election was the apex of the Arab Spring uprising, and a high point for the Muslim Brotherhood, a 91-year-old Islamist movement founded in Egypt and whose influence extends across the Arab world. For many Egyptians, Mr. Morsi’s election was their greatest hope for a definitive break with the country’s long history of autocracy after decades of harsh and corrupt rule under President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in the 2011 uprising. Some Egyptians worried that he might impose strict Islamic moral codes, while critics in Washington and around the region raised alarms that he might even seek to establish a form of theocratic rule. Mr. Morsi surprised many by seeking cordial relations with the United States and maintaining diplomatic ties with Israel. He developed a warm working relationship with President Barack Obama, and the two men worked together to help stop a bout of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the fall of 2012. But at home, Mr. Morsi’s rule was troubled from the start. He governed clumsily, at one point issuing a decree that critics said put him above the rule of law. Supporters said the decree was part of his efforts to grapple with a hostile security establishment that was actively maneuvering to undermine his authority. In the early summer of 2013, giant protests against Mr. Morsi filled Tahrir Square, the crucible of the 2011 uprising, providing the military with an excuse to oust him. His defense minister, Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, seized power on July 3, 2013. Six weeks later, Egyptian security forces shot dead at least 817 protesters, mostly from the Muslim Brotherhood, in what human rights groups called the largest mass shooting of demonstrators in recent history. Mr. el-Sisi was elected president in 2014 and still rules the country with an iron grip, with Egypt’s democratic hopes largely extinguished. A referendum in April to allow Mr. el-Sisi to remain in power until 2030 was passed overwhelmingly in a flawed vote that allowed no opposition voices. Egyptian television channels, which are tightly controlled by the security services, offered equivocal coverage of Mr. Morsi’s death. Some did not interrupt their usual programming to report the demise of a former president. Other channels aired footage portraying the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. “Lies are an integral part of the Muslim Brotherhood,” said a voice on CBC Extra, a private station, after a segment that showed Islamic State fighters threatening to attack Egyptian soldiers. There was no immediate comment from President el-Sisi’s office. The handful of people in Egypt willing to speak sympathetically about Mr. Morsi avoided his politics and focused on the conditions of his detention. “He was a victim of brutal prison conditions,” Gamal Eid, a lawyer and human rights advocate, said by phone from Cairo. Mr. Morsi had been charged with various crimes in politicized trials that have dragged through Egypt’s slow-moving courts. In 2016 his son, Abdullah, told The New York Times that the family feared that the former president might fall into a diabetic coma. Unlike most prisoners in Egyptian prisons, Mr. Morsi was barred from receiving deliveries of food and medicine from his family, said Ms. Whitson of Human Rights Watch. In addition to being held in solitary confinement, he was denied access to the news media, letters or other communication with the outside world. His wife and other family members were allowed visit just three times in the six years he was imprisoned. In March of last year, a panel of British politicians and lawyers reviewing his treatment concluded that Mr. Morsi had received “inadequate medical care, particularly inadequate management of his diabetes and inadequate management of his liver disease.” Failure to address his care, the group warned, could put Mr. Morsi’s life in danger. In a statement on Monday, Crispin Blunt, a member of Parliament who led the panel, said: “Sadly, we have been proved right.” Mr. Sadek, the Egyptian prosecutor, ordered an immediate investigation into the cause of death. In a statement, he said he would seek Mr. Morsi’s medical file and order a committee to prepare a report on the cause of death. Investigators will use surveillance footage from the courtroom and question witnesses who were with Mr. Morsi when he died, the statement said. After overthrowing Mr. Morsi, Mr. el-Sisi sought to banish the Muslim Brotherhood, calling it a terrorist group and sparing little effort to discredit it among the Egyptian public. Most Brotherhood leaders are in jail or exile, and thousands of its members languish in Egypt’s crowded prisons. In April, President Trump pushed to designate the Brotherhood a terrorist organization under pressure from Mr. el-Sisi, a close ally. The Pentagon and State Department objected, saying the group did not meet the definition of a terrorist entity. Mr. Morsi was born into a family of modest means in Sharqiya, in the Nile Delta. He earned a Ph.D. in material science from the University of Southern California and later taught at Zagazig University, near Sharqiya. He was almost unknown to the Egyptian public, and most Islamists, before he ran for president in 2012. The Brotherhood initially chose a more dynamic and well-known figure as its candidate. Mr. Morsi, the understudy, got the nomination only when the first choice was disqualified. Speaking privately, many Brotherhood members now fault Mr. Morsi for his failures during the year he spent in office, in particular his inability to build broader public support and outmaneuver the hostile security services and Mr. el-Sisi. Mr. Morsi never led the Brotherhood, a position held by its Supreme Guide, Mohammed Badie, since 2010. Mr. Badie was also imprisoned in 2013 and has been sentenced to seven terms of life imprisonment and a death sentence in various trials since then. Mr. Morsi’s death is unlikely to have much effect on the current direction of the group, already driven deep underground by the crackdown that followed his ouster. Peter Mandaville, a professor at George Mason University and a former adviser to the State Department on political Islam, argued that Mr. Morsi’s death was resonating beyond the Brotherhood with other Egyptians who voted for him or “have concerns about the current government’s human rights record.” “You already see it on Egyptian social media,” Professor Mandaville said. “Everybody is qualifying it with ‘this guy was a flawed politician and president’ but saying that what happened here today tells us something about the current state of the rule of law and respect for rights in Egypt.” Mr. Morsi’s son Ahmed mourned his father on Facebook, writing: “Father, we will meet again, with God.” Advertisement",2019-06-17 00:00:00,"Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s First Democratically Elected President, Dies - The New York Times",,1,http://nytimes.com

File/Brooks Brunson/Staff The nine who died in the Emanuel AME Church shooting are Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, DePayne Middleton Doctor, Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons Sr., Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson. When Melvin Graham's younger sister died four years ago in the Emanuel AME Church massacre, nobody handed him a road map to navigate the odyssey ahead. The June 17, 2015, shooting, by a self-avowed white supremacist during the church's Bible study, shocked the nation. Not since racists firebombed black churches in the 1960s had hate-filled violence targeted them with such deadly results. Looking back, Graham sees harbingers. A racist gunman killed six people in the 2012 mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. Another killed three people at two Jewish centers in Kansas in 2014. But Graham didn't see in those congregations his fellow journeymen, not at first. Since the Emanuel tragedy, however, mass violence has devastated religious communities often enough that they now constitute a macabre sub-genre in America's gun violence epidemic. In response, those most impacted are stepping forward more and more to comfort others set onto the same grim path. When an anti-Semitic man killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October, Graham felt as if he could have cut and pasted the names involved in the two shootings — the white supremacist killer, the house of worship, the innocents dead — and have read essentially the same story. So, he set a pen to paper. “To the Tree of Life: I'm writing because I know your pain and what you're going through. You are wounded in ways you do not know. You are forever changed. Hold onto your seat and press forward, and always remember your loved ones.” Graham wasn't alone. Soon after the shooting, Emanuel's pastor flew to Pittsburgh to offer comfort. A couple months later, Polly Sheppard, who survived the Charleston church shooting, made the same journey to urge the Jewish congregants to seek faith and forgiveness — and professional therapy. Two weeks later, over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, members of one of the three congregations that worshipped at Tree of Life in turn traveled to Charleston. A group from New Light Congregation, which lost three members in the shooting, stood up in front of Emanuel’s crimson sanctuary as church members flowed forward to set hands of empathy on them. Monday will mark four years since an angry young man with murderous intent slipped into Emanuel and headed for 12 people settling in for Bible study. He sat with them for about an hour, not speaking, until they shut their eyes for closing prayer. Then he pulled out a gun. Nine people died that night, including the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the church’s pastor and a state senator who was sitting beside the killer. And the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., a retired minister who led the study most Wednesdays. And Myra Thomson, who led it for the first time that night. And Susie Jackson, at 87 the oldest among them to die. And her nephew Tywanza Sanders, the youngest at 26. And their cousin Ethel Lance, the church’s sexton, a mother of five. And the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, mother of four. And the Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, mother of three. And Cynthia Graham Hurd, mother of none but mentor to hundreds in her decades as a beloved librarian. Nine families, the survivors and the church's entire congregation found themselves thrust into a journey through what the Bible calls “the valley of the shadow of death.” Then they relived their losses anew with each mass shooting in America, including the Pulse nightclub massacre almost one year to the day after their loved ones died. However, for about 18 months, no other house of worship experienced violent loss quite like theirs — until January 2017, when a man walked into the Islamic Center of Quebec City in Canada and killed six. People who knew the shooter said he held white nationalist and anti-immigrant views. Then, in September 2017, a black man killed a white woman and injured seven others at a Nashville, Tenn., Church of Christ. A note in his car cited vengeance against the convicted Emanuel killer, Dylann Roof. Two months after that a man gunned down 26 worshippers, including the pastor’s daughter, at First Baptist Church in Texas. It wasn’t a racially motivated crime, but the carnage took place during worship nonetheless. Less than a year later, in October 2018, a white supremacist entered the Tree of Life synagogue. Then the carnage spread across oceans as it barreled into 2019. In March, 50 people died in two mass shootings at mosques in ChristChurch, New Zealand. The killer left a manifesto replete with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim vitriol, including mention of Roof and other violent extremists. On Easter, more than 250 people died when suicide bombers in Sri Lanka targeted churches and hotels. It wasn’t gun violence, but the terror in sacred places felt horrifically familiar. And on the last day of Passover, in late April, a gunman killed one person and wounded four, including Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, at the Chabad synagogue of Poway in California. Authorities said the killer had written anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim statements in a manifesto. The rabbi, however, stood just 39 days later at a forum in San Diego to discuss ""Confronting Hate, Bigotry and Ignorance"" with religious leaders from other communities that had grappled with hate-fueled violence. His left arm in a sling, gesturing with his bandaged right hand, now missing its index finger, Goldstein described seeing a man 10 feet away pointing an AR-15 rifle at him. ""It changes you,"" he said. The Rev. Kylon Middleton, pastor of Mount Zion AME in Charleston and a close friend of Pinckney's, understood. He described the horrors of hearing his friend was dead and consoling Pinckney's wife and two daughters that night four years before. He joined the others in describing struggles to find positive paths forward, namely by trying to unite people. ""We can empathize through our sufferings in order to put ourselves in the shoes of someone else,"" Middleton told the San Diego audience. Heidi Beirich leads the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which publishes its Hatewatch blog, and has chronicled the rise of these crimes. “There’s no question that religious institutions have been a focal point of domestic terrorists’ attention, driven by white supremacists,” Beirlich said. “It’s a serious problem. And it’s not going away."" After the Tree of Life shooting, three houses of worship reached out to the Jewish congregants: a nearby black church, a local Sikh temple and someone from the Islamic center in Quebec. New Light Congregation already had a relationship with the predominantly black Rodman Street Baptist Church. The Baptist congregation held one of many vigils around Pittsburgh. At the event, New Light’s grieving members stood and clapped and sang and praised God. They sang songs of the Christian church. They sang songs of the Jewish faith. “It was the most uplifting thing that happened, a release of emotions and feelings I didn’t even know were bottled up inside of us,” recalled Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light. A couple days after the shooting, the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh's director reached out. He had received a call from someone at the Quebec mosque. Several members planned to drive to Pittsburgh to offer support. Could they meet? “We went, ‘huh?' ” Cohen recalled. He admits he wasn’t very aware of the shooting there. He couldn't recall ever going to a mosque. Yet four men he'd never met drove 12 hours to meet with the three Tree of Life congregations. They discussed what happened, the logistics of terror. Then they talked about the public’s reaction, the solidarity. And then they discussed the future — the reality of their new journey. “The message was: Be armed. Be aware of your exits and entry points. Do an active shooter training,” Cohen said. One of the men explained, “My sons are afraid to go to mosque."" Beth Kissileff recalled nodding at that. Her husband, New Light Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, had hidden in a storage closet with three of their members. The gunman shot and killed one, an 87-year-old man who peered out when the shooting quieted for a moment. Kissileff mentioned that their daughter also was afraid of returning to worship. So were others. “Unfortunately,"" she said, ""we are part of a network now.” Sheppard, the Emanuel shooting survivor, traveled to New Light in early January with a message. “I just wanted to tell them to seek counseling and to forgive,” Sheppard recalled. “With forgiveness you can move forward in the grace that God has extended to you by leaving you here.” She also discussed how the Emanuel survivors felt church leaders failed to minister to them and how she now attended a different church. That struck Cohen. As co-president of New Light, he considered what he needed to do for its members. “You need to listen to the heart,” Cohen realized. Then Kissileff came to him with an idea: “Maybe we need to see how other people are dealing with this.” They wanted communion with those who understood their grief so closely. And they wanted to spread a narrative of fighting white supremacy. So, a few weeks after Sheppard’s visit, on MLK weekend, they headed 700 miles south to Charleston. That Friday, they attended Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim, the local Reform congregation, where Sheppard joined them. On that Sunday, they stood in a mass of sorrow at Emanuel’s altar rail as church members came forward from their pews to wrap them in a sea of tears and shared understanding. Emanuel's pastor, the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning, made them a promise that day: “From this congregation, from the depths of our hearts, you are not alone. We will be there.” Afterward, he met privately with the group for about two hours. They peppered him with questions about what to do, what to expect. Manning wasn’t assigned to Emanuel until a year after the shooting, so he talked about what to expect if the shooter went to trial. Cohen took away some key advice: “What wounds and thoughts that you’d thought had passed are going to come back to the surface.” Manning's words reminded Kissileff of the Torah reading about Jethro being Moses’ eyes. “He was sort of the eyes for us,” Kissileff said of Manning. “It really was very important for us to have those eyes into the future.” Last month, Manning and nine Emanuel members, including members of Myra Thompson's family, journeyed back to Pittsburgh. Now, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Emanuel shooting, leaders from the two houses of worship will come together again. Tree of Life's Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who also survived that shooting, will join Manning for a discussion at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Charleston Music Hall as part of the third Charleston Forum. Melvin Graham, who wrote that letter to Tree of Life in the fall, is happy to see the various congregations helping one another. They will need one another. At first, he thought the Emanuel massacre that claimed his sister Cynthia was a “one-off,” the fluke of a deranged racist. Instead, he predicts the crowd on their journey will multiply. “Where the lambs are,"" he said, ""the wolves come.” Contact Jennifer Hawes at 843-937-5563. Follow her on Twitter @jenberryhawes.

SOUTH BEND, Indiana—Democratic Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg strode off the campaign trail and directly into the full force of constituent anger on Sunday, when a town hall held to discuss the police shooting death of a black man descended into shouts, heckling and demands for police reform. The mayor’s appearance on his home turf, which took place just hours after a mass shooting at a pub that killed one and injured at least 10 more, was in response to the police killing Eric Logan, a black man, near central South Bend. “I just want you to know that we’re not running from this.” Buttigieg said to room. “Of course I’m upset. A man died in this city at the hands of one of the people in charge of protecting the city. “I’m not commenting on who did what, with or without policy or what was legal or whatever. I can only describe it as a demon that is in so many parts of American life... and to know that part of my job is to be there for that—to listen—to have that poured on me, to have even people I agree with hurl all of their anguish and frustration at me because I represent the city because I represent this problem, of course I’m going to feel that.” The investigation into the shooting is still in its early stages and prosecutors are looking at any criminality by the police officer. According to South Bend police, Sergeant Ryan O’Neill was responding to a reported car break-in, and said Logan, whom he discovered with his legs sticking out of a car, wielded a knife and refused orders to put it down, the South Bend Tribune reports, while approaching O’Neill “with the knife raised.” O’Neill reportedly shot twice, striking Logan once in the abdomen. He was transported to the hospital by police cruiser, where he died. But O’Neill’s body camera was not on, which has led to significant skepticism of the police’s version of events. Police have argued that because O’Neill did not turn on his emergency lights, neither his body camera nor his dashboard camera were automatically activated, the South Bend Tribune reports, and that O’Neill did not later turn on his body camera because he was verifying if Logan owned the car he was discovered in. “You can sense the pain not only around this incident … and not only around our city but what’s happening everywhere, when it comes to the disempowerment that so many black Americans have felt in relation to the police,” Buttigieg told reporters after the event. “When you lead a city and it’s hurting, you take that on board all the time, but you especially take that on board at a time like this.” But South Bend has struggled with racial issues in recent years. Critics of a policy that targeted vacant homes for demolition say it burdened black homeowners, who inherited those properties but could not maintain them. South Bend has also been roiled by Buttigieg’s decision to fire the city’s black police chief in early 2012 following allegations that he had taped subordinates using racist language, which soon grew into a wiretapping dispute. Buttigieg, speaking to reporters on Sunday, addressed racial tensions both in his city and around the country directly. “This problem has to get solved in my lifetime,” Buttigieg told reporters. “I don’t know of a person or a city that has solved it, but I know that if we do not solve it in my lifetime, it will sink America. And if nothing else, I hope people know that I am motivated, not out of some theoretical concern or some political imperative, but as somebody whose city is hurting.” “What I hope African Americans watching this see is that our city is facing this. We’re not running away from it. This isn’t theoretical for us, this isn’t something being debated in Washington,” he added. “This is our problem, as it is a problem in so many places. And we are on the front lines of it. And we’re doing everything we know how.” When Buttigieg and South Bend Police Chief Scott Ruszkowski strode on stage, a murmuring crowd grew tense and quiet. It wasn’t until the town hall’s moderator, local NAACP president Michael Patton, asked for applause to “give God some glory” that the crowd obliged. But during the course of the roughly 90-minute town hall, that tension grew from muttered interjections to full-on shouting. When Buttigieg explained the police department had made strides forward—like improving online transparency and disciplinary standards—one crowd member shouted “it’s not enough!” It was just the beginning. One man, shouting as stormed down an aisle of the high school auditorium seized the microphone from a fellow speaker. Voices continually interjected in anger, like when Patton, the town hall’s moderator, turned to Buttigieg and Ruszkowski and asked how to bring trust back to the police force. “Fire the chief!” one person shouted. “Why you askin’ them?” roared another. The mayor, for his part, said he would welcome scrutiny of the case, including from the Department of Justice or from a special local prosecutor, and accepted responsibility for multiple failures in local law enforcement. “We have tried, but not succeeded to increase diversity in the police department,” he said. “And while body cameras have been implemented across the police department, there is frustration, which I share, that they were not there when we needed them the most.” Though police defenders appeared to be few in attendance, there appeared to be a racial divide in the reactions town hall attendees had to leaders’ comments. When the moderator called for calm, for example, many white guests clapped, while many black attendees sat silently. But regardless of race, the overwhelming majority of attendees were upset about Logan’s death. “I lived for most of my life in Virginia, and I used to represent as a lawyer the Virginia State Police,” Michael McManus, an attendee who now lives just outside South Bend, said before the event began. “And the state police’s job was to protect the citizens. It seems to me … at least what I’ve seen so far in the newspaper, that’s not what happened.” How Buttigieg handles the situation has come under the national scope as his presidential campaign has managed to credibly compete with some of the bigger names in Democratic politics. The campaign raised $7 million in April alone, and he’s polling more than a point ahead of Trump in a head-to-head matchup according to multiple political research firms. But he has yet to seize anything close to control of the race, running behind Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden—by significant margins. Buttigieg also said that, although he has stepped off the campaign trail, he still plans to participate in the first set of Democratic debates later this week. And despite the rancor at the town hall event, some of Buttigieg’s fans came out to see him, like Sparky Tavis, who lives just outside South Bend. She said she doesn’t blame the mayor for the shooting. “I won’t think anything differently (afterwards), because I don’t think he’s responsible,” she said before the event. “Sure, he’s the mayor of South Bend, but not being—I think the chief of police, I think there’s other people who are responsible.”",2019-06-24 12:10:56,Racial Tensions Flare at Mayor Pete Town Hall on Police Killing of Black Man,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
469,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-hope-strike-gold-california/story?id=63356699,"Fourteen Democratic presidential candidates have descended on California. 2020 candidates react to the Virginia Beach shooting SAN FRANCISCO -- Eleven presidential candidates made their pitch at Saturday's California Democratic Convention in San Francisco on a wide range of topics -- and there wasn't a clear favorite in the end, although three candidates got major responses from the audience. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren talked about big structural change saying, ""Here's the thing ... when a candidate tells you about all the things that aren't possible about how political calculations come first, they're telling you something important. ... They're telling you they will not fight for you. Not me! I'm here to fight!"" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker gave an impassioned speech about gun violence, one day after a mass shooting claimed 12 lives in Virginia, saying, ""Beating Donald Trump is a must. But that is a floor, not a ceiling. We are bigger than that. We have greater ambitions than that."" Meanwhile, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was given a standing ovation before he even uttered a word. Only one candidate was met with jeers: former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. He said, ""If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big goals, socialism is not the answer,"" causing the entire room to erupt in boos. He could barely continue, saying in response, ""You know if we're not careful we're going to reelect the worst president in U.S. history."" The audience held up signs supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders in response. And Washington Gov. Jay Inslee seized an opening upon taking the stage right after Hickenlooper, saying, ""I am the governor who doesn't think we should be ashamed of our progressive values."" A total of 14 Democratic presidential candidates descended on California this weekend, looking to mine for gold in a left-leaning state with a large share of delegates and, ultimately, electoral votes that could help hand a candidate an Oval Office jackpot. Top-tier candidates, including Sanders, Warren, Harris and Buttigieg spoke at California's Democratic Convention in San Francisco, hoping to nab some of the 416 delegates possibly up for grabs when California voters go to the ballot box on Super Tuesday next year. The new March 3 date is months earlier than recent presidential elections. And mail-in voting for the state starts a month before: the same day as the Iowa Caucus. ""You can come in third [in California] and leave with more delegates than you had if you won New Hampshire or Iowa,"" said Roger Salazar, a spokesperson for the California Democratic Party. Also in San Francisco, starting Friday and through the weekend, with several candidates in attendance is MoveOn’s ""Big Ideas Forum,"" an event aimed at progressives. And a number of the Democratic hopefuls also attended the Unity and Freedom Presidential Forum on immigration in Pasadena on Friday in an appeal to Latino voters -- a group that, as of the 2020 cycle, will become the largest minority voting bloc. California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said the parade of candidates currently coming through the state is exactly what he intended when he wrote the bill as a state senator to move California's primary voting up in 2020. ""You're having candidates engage Californians in a much more comprehensive way. It forces that conversation, and even as candidates campaign across the country, they can point out that California has a different perspective,"" said Lara, who has thrown his support behind Harris, the state's junior senator. But he said he doesn't think the bill necessarily even gives the California native an advantage. ""As a Kamala supporter,"" he said, ""there's no way we're taking anything for granted. That doesn't mean we're not going to do the work. We're going to talk to voters and grind it out."" He said he expects some of those conversations with voters this weekend will revolve around women's rights as anti-abortion laws sweep through the country. In March California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's rule on Title X which, in part, would prohibit doctors from making abortion referrals. Lara also said that with roughly one-sixth of California households being mixed-status households, he expects many candidates to address immigration. ""We've proven we can incorporate our immigrants and the sky doesn't fall,"" he added. At California's Democratic Party State Convention on Saturday, 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke echoed Lara's sentiments on immigration, saying that immigrants make the country better. ""It is the best problem we have ever had in this country's history -- we can ensure that we treat those who come to our borders after fleeing the deadliest places on the planet with the respect that they deserve,"" O'Rourke said. In April, Trump tweeted that ""Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!"" He later specifically targeted California, saying ""California certainly is always saying, 'oh we want more people' ... well we'll give them more people."" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted immigrants ""are people, not pawns."" Salazar pointed to another area where many Californians disagree with some of the actions the White House is taking: climate change. ""When it comes to the environment, the governor and the attorney general and other state leaders have been very active on pushing back on the White House to minimize the impacts,"" he said. Earlier this year, the White House and California once again clashed on environmental policy in talks that ended without an agreement on a controversial Trump administration proposal to roll back fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a suit against the Trump administration to release data supporting their decision to rollback federal vehicle emission standards. While some speculate getting California voters in the process earlier will change how the candidates approach policy, others believe a nominee could be decided sooner since delegates will be decided earlier on, leaving the democratic nominee with more time to challenge Trump. Lara cautions it's too early to speculate how California's new role will affect the election, however, saying, ""There are all these different theories on how moving the presidential primary is going to work out. And that's to be seen."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-02 00:00:00,2020 Democratic presidential candidates hope to strike gold in California,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

471,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thousands-pounds-fish-thousands-voters-22-presidential-candidates/story?id=63835003,"The event is a must-attend political event for presidential hopefuls. 2020 presidential candidates come together in South Carolina COLUMBIA, S.C.  -- South Carolina played host to 4,400 pounds of fish, 6,400 slices of white bread and a lot of cringeworthy punchlines Friday night. Just as the food supplies ran out -- 21 Democratic presidential hopefuls took the stage to each make a brief pitch to thousands of voters at Rep. Jim Clyburn's annual ""World Famous Fish Fry"" in Columbia, South Carolina, ahead of the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention on Saturday. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who boasts a close friendship with Clyburn as a veteran third-time fish fry attendee, focused on delivering one concise message in his short speech: ""Whomever the Democratic nominee is, we have to stay together and elect a Democratic president of the United States of America."" Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey, who was seen hugging Biden off-stage after a week of animosity between the two over comments on segregation, followed Biden in emphasizing the importance of unity in the party. ""This election is not about one person and one office, it is about who we are as a nation and who we must be to each other,"" Booker said. ""We all must make sure that we may be in the midst of a primary, but when the primary is over, we become a united force. Not just to beat one guy in one office, but we become a united force to put the indivisible back in this one nation under God and stand up for liberty and justice for all."" Booker closed his remarks with a joke for the fish fry: ""Let’s not flounder, let’s get out there and kick some bass."" Many others, including former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and Any Klochuchar, of Minnesota, addressed some of the big issues the country is facing, such as health care, public schools, criminal justice reform and climate change. ""We make this government work for us, and that means we’re just getting started,"" Warren said. ""We need to attack our problems head on. We need to attack climate change head on. We need to attack the control of the NRA head on. We need to have courage in this country. So for me, it’s about building a future. This is our chance. 2020. We can dream big, fight hard, and win!"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the only one in his button-down while all 20 other candidates were wearing matching Clyburn T-shirts, emphasized the power of unity in defeating the current president. ""Brothers and sisters, at the end of the day, the 1 percent, they got a lot of money and they got a lot of power,"" Sanders said. ""But we got something they don't have. We are the 99%. And 99%, is a hell of a bigger number than 1%. Let us stand together. Let us defeat Trump. Let us transform this country."" Sen. Michael Bennet, of Colorado, one of the lesser known candidates, drew laughs from the audience by taking a jab at President Donald Trump. ""In my view, we have a president who doesn’t care about America,"" Bennet said. ""I don’t think he loves America. I don’t think he loves anybody but himself."" Sen. Kamala Harris, of California took a more serious tone, reminding the crowd of the South Carolina mass shooting that killed nine people at Mother Emanuel AME Church four years ago. ""And in this fight, this is a fight not only to recognize our history and honor the ancestors and honor the heroes,"" Harris said, ""it is a fight for our future, and a vision of our future."" The largest gathering so far for the 2020 contenders -- and a prelude to the first Democratic debates next week -- ended with remarks from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii, followed by a group photo with all the candidates on stage. Since its inception, the fish fry, which is free and open to the public, has been an effort to give South Carolinians a glimpse at candidates without the cost of attending the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention's Blue Palmetto Dinner. Tickets to the sold-out dinner cost $150. The fish fry isn't only about making a good impression on voters, it's also about forming key relationships with the Democratic establishment in South Carolina. Clyburn, the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, has hosted the fish fry for nearly three decades. He's considered the most influential leader in South Carolina politics and his endorsement is highly coveted. Though Clyburn has promised to refrain from endorsing a candidate ahead of the state's Democratic primary in February, in 2016, Clyburn endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after saying he would stay neutral. He didn't publicly endorse a candidate during the 2008 Democratic primary. ""Vice President Biden has the inside track because of his name I.D., because of his established relationships with the state,"" Harrison said. ""Many of these presidential candidates are new to South Carolinians and to the South Carolina Democrats."" Still, other 2020 presidential hopefuls are hoping to make inroads in South Carolina -- a state where African-Americans make up nearly 30% of the population. BothBooker and Harris have campaigned heavily in the state, venturing out of the two large metropolitan areas, Charleston and Columbia. While others, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have struggled to garner much African American support at events in the state. Buttigieg skipped the fish fry to hold community meetings following the fatal shooting of Eric Logan, a black man, by a white police officer in his hometown. The mayor, who traveled back to South Bend after his remarks earlier in the day at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) in Miami, was surrounded by members of the community and activists, including individuals holding Black Lives Matter signs, who jeered and heckled the candidate. Jaime Harrison, a former chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party and current U.S. Senate candidate, recommended that candidates shore up their South Carolina teams with staffers that have strong ties in the state. He says doing outreach in some of the most rural corners of South Carolina is critical. ""Speak with Democrats that not only live in urban areas, where most of the state's population is, but also in many of the rural communities which will probably be very influential in determining who ultimately wins the primary,"" Harrison said.

472,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/03/pastor-trump-prayer-1352311,"politics By KRYSTAL CAMPOS 06/03/2019 06:35 PM EDT Updated 06/03/2019 11:00 PM EDT The pastor of a Northern Virginia church where President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit over the weekend has explained why he publicly prayed for the president, acknowledging to his congregation that “some within our church … are hurt that I made this decision.” “Sometimes we find ourselves in situations that we didn’t see coming, and we’re faced with a decision in a moment when we don’t have the liberty of deliberation, so we do our best to glorify God,” Pastor David Platt of McLean Bible Church said Sunday evening in a statement to church members titled “Prayer for the President.” “Today, I found myself in one of those situations.” Hours earlier, Trump’s motorcade made an unannounced detour to the church while returning to the White House from Trump National Golf Club in nearby Sterling, Va. “President Donald J. Trump is visiting McLean Bible Church in Vienna, VA, to visit with the Pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,” Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement on Sunday, referring to the mass shooting at a municipal complex that left 13 people dead, including the gunman. Platt explained in the statement to his congregation that he had been caught off guard. “At the end of my sermon at the 1:00 worship gathering, I stepped to the side for what I thought would be a couple of moments in quiet reflection as we prepared to take the Lord’s Supper,” he said. “But I was immediately called backstage and told that the President of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him.” Platt, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s International Mission Board, also explained that he prayed for the president because 1 Timothy 2:1-6 urges, in part, that Christians pray “for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.” Trump, wearing a blazer over his golf clothes, stood on a stage while Platt prayed.

Thank you Franklin,” Trump tweeted on Saturday. This article and its headline have been updated to better reflect the pastor's message to his congregation. Missing out on the latest scoops?

It is our patriotic duty to push back on the Trump administration's undermining of America,"" she said, as scattered shouting began. ""This isn't about politics, it isn't about partisanship, Democrats versus Republicans, no. It's about patriotism, it's about the sanctity of the Constitution and it's about the future of our nation,"" Pelosi later added, to shouts of ""Impeach!"" ""We will go where the facts lead us, we will insist on truth, we will build on an iron-clad case to act,"" she added. ""Because in the United States of America, no one is above the law -- not even president of the United States. And President Trump will be held accountable for his actions."" By Caroline Kelly Democratic hopefuls have weighed in on the Friday shooting in Virginia Beach that left 12 dead and four injured as of Saturday afternoon, mourning the lives lost and calling for an end to such shootings. The former vice president tweeted Friday, ""11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach."" Booker addressed the shooting at the top of his remarks Saturday at the MoveOn Forum in San Francisco, California. ""We had another mass shooting in America yesterday, and these cannot just go on in our country,"" the New Jersey senator said. ""We used to be a nation that when four girls were killed in a bombing in Birmingham, we changed laws. When women were killed in the Shirtwaist Factory fire, we changed laws."" ""We are seeing too much death in our country,"" he said, adding later that it reminded him that ""the power of the people is greater than the people in power, and when the people are united, they cannot be defeated."" ""Too many lives cut short. This has to stop. I’m holding Virginia Beach in my heart tonight,"" the Montana governor tweeted. Speaking at the Service Employees International Union Breakfast in San Francisco, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor told reporters, ""We cannot tolerate being the only developed nation where this is routine. We know it’s not the last time this is going to happen and Washington’s failure to act is costing lives."" ""Heartbreaking news out of Virginia Beach as another community copes with a senseless gun violence attack,"" the former Housing and Urban Development secretary tweeted Friday. ""We can and must pass common sense reforms to end the gun violence epidemic—and ensure no community has to endure the pain that the Virginia Beach community feels today."" ""Our hearts are with the people of Virginia Beach, especially the victims and their families in this time of grief,"" the former Maryland congressman tweeted, adding, ""We can't accept this as normal, we need to take action on gun safety. We can't go on like this."" The California senator tweeted Friday, ""Heartbroken for the victims and their families of the Virginia Beach shooting and grateful for the first responders on the scene. This senseless act of violence should not be normal. Too many communities have been shattered by gun violence — we cannot continue to stand idly by."" ""The news out of Virginia Beach is simply devastating,"" the Colorado governor tweeted. ""Public servants who just showed up to do their job are not coming home tonight because of gun violence. This story has played out too many times in too many towns. We need to stand up and stop this. #EnoughIsEnough"" The Washington state governor also addressed the shooting outside the SEIU Breakfast Saturday, calling for action on national gun safety laws, similar to those in his home state, as soon as tomorrow. ""Look, this is a pain that’s felt all across America, not just Virginia and for those folks who said we should not talk about gun safety, in the wake of this tragedy, that’s just wrong,"" he told reporters. ""This is exactly the time we need to talk about gun safety. And I’m hopeful that we can pass the laws in America that I’ve passed, that we’ve passed in Washington state. We need common sense gun safety. We need it now. Let’s get this started tomorrow."" Speaking outside the the SEIU Breakfast in San Francisco, the Minnesota senator lamented that ""we’ve seen way too many of these"" types of tragedies, adding that while her thoughts were with the victims' loved ones, ""Enough is enough."" She slammed Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump for stalling gun safety reform, pointing to the House of Representatives passing universal background check legislation that is now ""sitting at Mitch McConnell’s door,"" as well as the Violence Against Women Act ""that is also stopped in the Senate because they’re so afraid of the NRA."" ""I sat across from President Trump after Parkland while he was telling us, 'Oh yeah, let’s get universal background checks done. Let’s get all this stuff done,'"" she said. ""He never did it. He met with the NRA the next day and he turned on it, so it is time to get this done."" The Miramar, Florida, mayor tweeted, ""My heart cries for the Virginia Beach victims lost and the survivors who must now make sense of this senseless act of gun violence. I’m committed to doing my part to help make this nation a place where these incidents never happen ever."" The former El Paso congressman weighed in on the shooting Saturday outside the SEIU Breakfast in San Francisco, calling the deadly violence ""just horrifying."" ""In the face of this, we as a country must change and ensure that we take action,"" he said, praising young activist calling for gun safety legislation. ""They’re going to force this change that we desperately need in this country, but (I'm) just incredibly saddened at the loss of life and the continuing tragedy that we’re seeing in this country,"" O'Rourke added. ""What can you say, it’s a terrible tragedy,"" the Vermont senator told reporters Saturday at the SEIU Breakfast in San Francisco, before calling for gun safety legislation. ""It speaks to the need for this country finally to do what the American people want and that is common sense gun safety legislation and that is making sure that people who should not own guns, do not own guns, and doing everything we can to make this country and our schools safer,"" he added. The California congressman, who centered his campaign announcement on gun safety, tweeted, ""As I was with a film crew recording a video on mass shootings we were told another community has suffered a mass shooting."" ""#Virginia, we mourn with you. This can never be normal. It is never too early for us to also say #EnoughIsEnough,"" he added."" The Massachusetts senator addressed the shooting when asked about her plans on gun control during the MoveOn Forum Saturday, contextualizing it in what she called a larger ""gun problem in America."" ""We talk a lot about mass shootings and I’m very sorry about what happened yesterday in Virginia Beach,"" she said. ""But it’s not just mass shootings. This is happening all across America, it's happening on sidewalks and playgrounds, in people’s backyards. It’s happening family by family across this country and it doesn’t get the same headlines, and that is wrong."" ""We have a gun problem in America, and it is putting our children at risk all across this nation."" she added. ""The shooting in Virginia Beach is a nightmare come to life - a disgruntled employee who massacred innocents,"" the businessman tweeted. ""My heart goes out to the families and individuals who were killed and injured. We have to make it harder for people to get and use guns that can cause such tragedies.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to this special edition of Hannity: Act 2, ""The Deep State's Day of Reckoning"". Now, tonight, we are inching closer and closer to real truth, real justice and holding those who abuse power at the highest levels accountable. For over two years on this program, we watched a political witch hunt like we have never seen in American politics before, based on lies and smears and outright conspiracy theories. And just like we've been telling you all week, the Russia hoax has now completely unraveled. The Mueller report is over, it is dead, it is buried. We have now had four separate investigations. Oh, the FBI nine- month investigation, House Intel Committee, bipartisan Senate committee, and even the Mueller report -- no collusion, no conspiracy with Russia. And as we predicted, it's now boomeranging right on to those who did abuse power, did try to influence the outcome of an election and then overturn a duly elected president. Act 1 is over. The curtain is beginning to rise. Act 2 begins. There is a new sheriff in town and his name is Bill Barr. And earlier today, he weighed in on the origins of the Russia probe. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Like many other people familiar with intelligence activities, I had a lot of questions about what was going on. I assumed I would get answers and I have not gotten answers that are satisfactory. And, in fact, I have more questions. Some of the facts that I learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened. JAN CRAWFORD, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: What do you mean? BARR: That's all I really will say. Things are just not jiving. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Things are not jiving. On this show now, we have been honest from the start. And in the process, over two years, we have been digging deep. We've uncovered, yes, the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern political history, maybe in all of our history. So, tonight for you, we have a special show. We have brought in together the all-star ensemble cast, those that have every step of the way been helping America get to the truth and exposing the spying scandal, this Russian conspiracy theory since the start. So, tonight, for the full hour, we're going to break it all down. We're going to do what we do night after night. We're going to stick to the facts and the truth. We're going to be honest, and when every one else, the 99 percent of liars that push hoax and conspiracy theories, the media mob, as they continue to be wrong, a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton to save their favorite candidate, the dirty Russian dossier, FISA abuse fraud, literally, purposely misleading, committing a fraud on a court on multiple occasions, using spies and informants to deep state efforts to undermine a president-elected by you, the American people, after they first tried to steal an election. Tonight, we shine a spotlight on all of this and tonight, we're taking it apart piece by piece, because we are only days away from the release now that the classification has occurred of major documents that will all expose the real election scandal, the real efforts to spy on the Trump campaign, FISA applications, 302s, Gang of Eight intel material, exculpatory material. As I said, an avalanche is coming. The cascading down with truth for the American people. There's no stopping it now. It's not a matter of if. It is when this all becomes public, so the gig is up. For the hate-Trump media mob, their Democratic allies, they've been pushing lie after lie after lie for 2.5 years ago. And also remember this which is really important, because how this all started, a phony investigation, it all started because Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. And, by the way, if you voted for Donald Trump, you are a smelly Walmart voter. I like Walmart. And, by the way, you're an irredeemable deplorable that clings to your god, your guns, your bible and religion. That's what the Democratic Party thinks of us. A massive amount of top secret classified material was found on her unsecured private server in a mom and pop bathroom closet called and managed by Platte River Networks. Yes, that's a crime, 18 USC 793. She committed real felonies and she had a clear intent when she destroyed the evidence by deleting 33,000 emails, Bleach Bit on the hard drive, busting up devices with hammers and removing SIM cards. Where's all the Democratic and media hysteria about real obstruction, with a real crime, real intention? Oh, that's right. One standard for the Clintons, one standard for Democrats and one for everybody else. Look at your screen. Look at what the violation is, 18 USC 793. We've talked often about it. So, why was Hillary Clinton cleared? Why did they rig that investigation? Why did Comey and Strzok -- you know, why did they change in May of 2016 before they ever interviewed Hillary or the other people involved? Why did they change it from the legal standard of gross negligence to extreme carelessness? There was clear, overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence that this secret classified information was mishandled and put on a server which made it illegal, multiple felonies. Clear, incontrovertible evidence she destroyed the 33,000 subpoenaed emails and did all of the things to eliminate all the evidence. And remember, the Strzok and Ppage text about the Trump voters, remember, smelly Walmart people, Hillary, remember, win 100 million to zero. Well, they were the lead investigators in this case and then immediately turned on Donald Trump. After Strzok who was the one that interviewed Clinton and actually allowed two other people in the room at the same time, that never happens. He was writing Hillary's exoneration in May, that didn't interview her until July 2nd of 2016, Comey cleared her on July 5th, 2016. But not before Cheryl Mills was granted immunity, not before the infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton and the attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch. So, what did Lynch know? When did she know it? Because Strzok and Page also say that, oh, Loretta Lynch rigged Hillary's investigation. Horribly flawed, an injustice, and if we want to save this great democratic republic that we inherited, that so many sacrificed and died for, we must have equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws and we must be ever so vigilant to be a constitutional republic. After Clinton lost, then the insurance policy kicked in. All roads lead back to the dirty Russian dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton, the DNC, with funneled money through her law firm, into an op research firm. And then, yes, a guy, a foreign national that put these Russian lies together. Then those Russian lies bulk of information as the Nunes memo, the Grassley-Graham memo says, to literally spy not only on Carter Page but a back door to spy on all things Trump campaign, all things transition team Trump, all things President Trump, put together by Christopher Steele who didn't even standby his own work, an interrogatory in Great Britain said, I have no idea if any of this is true. He was also being paid by Fusion GPS, but really paid by Hillary. And remember, DOJ official Bruce Ohr, at the time the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, he was warning in August of 2016. Steele hated Trump and Hillary paid for it and none is verified. Now even the ""New York Times"", of course, two years later in this show, says the dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the very beginning. And the State Department official, John Solomon, broke the story that Kathleen Kavalec was also sounding the alarm after meeting with Steele days, 10, 12 days before the first FISA application was signed by Jim Comey. Night after night, we have literally been unpeeling the layers of this onion and ripping the mask off all of this corruption, trying to get to the truth to expose what has happened here. This was an attempt to literally fix a presidential election and destroy a duly elected president. There is a deep state. And now, the day of reckoning has come, and, by the way, the time for accountability is now. All right. Joining us now, you look at this great panel we have. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, investigative reporter, lead guy at ""The Hill"", John Solomon, former deputy assistant attorney general, Victoria Toensing, former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova, American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera. This guy, Judicial Watch president, Mr. FOIA himself, Tom Fitton, is here, and Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, that sees his party imploding before his eyes and will admit it. First of all, and I mean this with all my heart. We wouldn't be here today, they probably would have succeeded had it not been for every single one of you. I applaud all of you for your deep digging and the hard work and the tough analysis. And you as a former liberal, really being fair and wanting our president to succeed. Thank you all. I give you all a big hand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you. HANNITY: I am just a talk show host. If all of this happened and we are all right. We already know the Russia hoax is over. How do we fix this? Where do we begin? I don't think you fix it unless you start at the beginning, which was the Hillary rigged investigation. JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: The only thing that will bring accountability to the Obama Justice Department and FBI is a federal grand jury. The president of the United States picked the perfect man at this great inflection point in history, Bill Barr. He will not be stopped. He's going to get to the bottom of this. And that's exactly the only thing that will bring the truth out. A federal grand jury, testimony under oath, subpoenaed documents, get it done, and that's where we're headed. HANNITY: And you believe all of that will happen? DIGENOVA: Mr. Barr is the perfect man at the right moment in history. HANNITY: Victoria? VICTORIA TOENSING, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think what is scary is I do not believe that the 2016 election was the first rodeo on this kind of activity. There is evidence a FISA court opinion in 2017 that talks about the Obama administration violating FISA going back to 2012. There is also evidence of how they went against their political opponents. If you remember, Mike Flynn was a thorn in the side of the Obama administration. HANNITY: Could you imagine the deputy FBI director bragging you don't need an attorney and the FBI director saying he took advantage of the chaos, setting up a 33-year vet? TOENSING: Let's go back to 2014 when they set him up with that Russian woman and had people immediately start typing they were having an affair and we know that's false. She is now suing. If that were true, you think she'd be suing. She just filed a lawsuit last week. There is evidence that this started in the early days of the 2nd term of President Obama and they just got better. HANNITY: Does this go to the Oval Office? You are jumping ahead of me? But I planned on getting that. TOENSING: Absolutely. HANNITY: John? JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: You know, dirty tricks, character assassination. They have been in elections for 40 years. What distinguishes this election is the fact that the United States government, the FBI, possibly the CIA and the NSA, were involved in carrying out a political dirty trick. That should concern us all. Never in my lifetime have I known the FBI to do these things that are now in open and for all of us to see. It has to be -- HANNITY: Even when we had the Church hearings and -- SOLOMON: No, not -- HANNITY: Nothing compares? SOLOMON: You can't ever find a time in history where the FBI and CIA sought to change the results of an election. Here, you may have that as the final outcome of this investigation. HANNITY: You know, I have an FBI flag pin on and a CIA pin both given to me. And the reason is and I make this distinction almost every night, because my family was in law enforcement. My mom was a prison guard for 25 years, my dad a family court probation guy, everybody in my family was cops and two guards that made the FBI. This is not about the 99 percent. Ninety-nine is that about right? Ninety-nine, good cops. Not what you say -- dirty cops. DIGENOVA: Dirty cops, James Comey led the way. HANNITY: When you first said it, I remember flinching on my show but I knew you were right. Sara? SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: I can't agree with them anymore that's already been said, but what I can say is this, this was a full disinformation campaign. And the reason why I say this, and we have never seen anything quite like this, is because they used the tools of the intelligence community, the tools we entrust our federally armed officers with and our CIA. HANNITY: The most powerful in the world. CARTER: Powerful agency on the planet. And they used it against their own political system. This is something that has never been seen before. All you have to do is listen to Attorney General Barr to understand that this is exactly what is happening. And as far as Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Victoria is 100 percent right. Michael Flynn was a thorn in their side. But he came from their administration. He knew where the bodies were buried. He understood what was going on. And as soon as they saw him joined up with Trump -- HANNITY: They were afraid? CARTER: They were terrified. They were terrified. HANNITY: This is how we treat 33-year veterans that we have the FBI director and the deputy FBI director bragging they set them up? CARTER: That's right. HANNITY: That they told them not to get a lawyer when they already surveilled him illegally, unmasked him illegally, and leaked raw intelligence. Am I wrong on any of those points? CARTER: You are not wrong on any of those points. Another point brought up here. This was not their first rodeo. And I think that's what scares them the most, Sean. What terrifies them is that an investigation is not just about Trump. It's about what Barr is going to uncover. This has been going on for at least a decade, for at least a decade. And these agencies are terrified their power will be pulled from them and that they're not gong to have the same type of tools and capabilities they had in the past because they abused them. SOLOMON: That's exactly right. HANNITY: You two got this started in March, way over 2 years now. I remember the conversation we had that night. At different times, you thought people in this room were illegally surveilled and unmasked. Was that true? SOLOMON: I had my concerns. We've been warned that there's some surveillance going on. Can I prove it? No, and it never stopped me for a second. I want to say something though because when you talk about the tools and what Sara just said is so true, the guys who met me at the mailbox back in March of 2017, all I -- I can't tell you much, but I can tell you that the intelligence systems being used to carry out a political dirty trick. And why did they approach me. I asked them, why are you approaching me? Because we need these tools to catch terrorists, we need these tools to get spies, and if we get caught abusing them, we may lose them in America. HANNITY: In other words, we had the premiere law enforcement agency in the world, the FBI. SOLOMON: That's right. HANNITY: Premiere intelligence agencies in the world, that's why I wear this for the 99 percent, not the 1 percent upper echelon. Gregg Jarrett, you wrote the number one bestseller, ""The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump"". Wow! Pretty good title. Very accurate. What happened? (LAUGHTER) GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST: Yes, I would like to say I was prescient, but I wasn't. I actually examined the facts, the evidence and compared it to the law and the inevitable conclusion was that these were rampant act of corruption. It's no coincidence on the very day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton, his FBI is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele, armed with the first memo of his dossier. And the agent, Michael Gaeta. who saw that document and read it, said I have to alert headquarters immediately. But, you know, the Russia hoax had been involving in the previous months. The instigator was John Brennan, the CIA director, who was outsourcing spying on a political campaign -- HANNITY: Slow down. I want to make sure highlight this. So, people -- we have laws against turning the powerful tools of intelligence on the American people. So, Five Eyes is a term we've all heard, and we have allies, and you are saying you believe that intelligence activities that would be illegal turning tools against the American people without a warrant was outsourced to our allies to circumvent the laws? JARRETT: That's right. HANNITY: Am I right? JARRETT: You know, you can't spy on American citizens on U.S. soil. Why were all of these people lured overseas? Why were these undercover agents doing their dirty work overseas? Because that way you get around American law. You know, back in the '70s, the CIA and FBI got caught red-handed abusing their positions of power. And Congress had to pass new laws. Over the years, they have been eroded by the likes of Clapper and Brennan and Comey. HANNITY: Stay right there, we got to take a break. We're just getting started. Our audience, these great patriots that all found the truth for us, they're 0.0001 percent, they will be with us for the entire hour. Also, when we come back. FISA abuse, that scandal, it is about to be blown wide open. We expect the inspector general report on this, Michael Horowitz, to be coming out any day now, as we continue tonight on HANNITY. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF: Well, I will say, on the FISA application, especially, that, you know, you heard Comey call it a mosaic. Let's just find out, people need to see what's there because I think they would cringe if they knew what the government was willing to do to its citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: House Intel Committee ranking member Devin Nunes on our show last night discussing FISA warrant abuse committed by, yes, upper echelon, high ranking officials in the FBI. Why? To spy on the Trump campaign. Oh, Jim Comey said, we didn't spy. He signed the first FISA warrant. A U.S. citizen who was caught up in this massive scandal, our next guest on this HANNITY Deep State special, Carter Page. I know you're listening. I know this impacted you. You lived through it but you in a sense were being used as a conduit into all things Trump campaign but you were spied on how many times? CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMAPIGN ASSOCIATE: There were four applications, Sean. And who knows? The details as they keep coming out, it just keeps getting worse and worse. So, we shall see. HANNITY: Do -- look, one American citizen, Carter, should not -- these are civil liberties, constitutional liberties. It bothers me that, you know, short of Alan Dershowitz and a friend, Doug Schoen is here, not many on the left seem to care. It's like the ends justify the means. What do you want the American people to know now that you were a victim of this? PAGE: Well, I've -- my feelings about it throughout the whole time is that, really, this was -- as you were alluding to, it was not an attack on me. It was an attack on candidate Trump and the entire Trump movement. It continued as President-elect Trump and his new administration. So, really, that's where the greatest damage was. And so -- HANNITY: How many times did Stefan Halper meet with you? PAGE: You know, I really lost track, Sean, multiple times. HANNITY: Did you know he was a spy? Did you know he was there to spy on you? PAGE: No, it was at a point in my life when I was under so much pressure with these false stories starting in September 2016. And, really, I was being shunned by pretty much everyone except for a few family members and long term friends. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: -- the intel community that you would tell us? PAGE: Now, it's being exposed that I was an informant for both the CIA and the FBI. It's actually funny because the reports with Brennan and Clapper saying we don't want to expose informants. Well, if you read the Mueller report, they talked about Alexander Vlatov (ph), someone I was talking, a Russian based in New York that I was giving information to the FBI about. So -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: When they interviewed you, they knew you did nothing wrong? They knew you were an American citizen that was debriefed often? PAGE: Absolutely, absolutely. HANNITY: All right, Carter. Thank you for being with us. PAGE: Thanks. HANNITY: We'll bring back our panel here. Matt Schlapp, you know, there's a political side of this, but I don't think civil liberties should be the one thing we're going to disagree on. That will be a thing that is sacred, Bill of Rights, our constitution, the rule of law, equal application of our laws, equal justice. MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: Yes, that's right. You take a step back from President Trump. And I remember serving in the Bush administration, when a lot of these extra powers, I know Mark Levin and others are writing about presidents abuse their powers. But the presidency got extra powers. Why? To go after terrorists. And I literally remember sitting in a conference room in the White House turning to lawyers who I still respect to this day and saying, doesn't it scare all of us that the government is going to have this expanded power that could look into almost anything it wanted, and if people in Congress don't ask the right questions, they could get away with that? And doesn't that scare people? And when I was told over and over again by these lawyers, don't worry, there are people in place, I wonder who they were, that have the best interest of the country, they will always safeguard these programs and we will make sure people of sterling character get to make the final decision. And so, going back to what you said about Obama, Biden, Lynch, James Comey who I have a distinction of refusing his political check for his first job in the Bush administration. What did the AG said? It just didn't pan out, or it just wasn't making sense, it didn't jive. The point is, n all this is that, take a step back from President Trump who has been so maligned. This will happen again if we don't stop it. HANNITY: The scary thing is we might not be looking at the people we need to be looking at. My government is looking at me, I'm OK, I know they will respect the constitutional rights of all Americans, just like there's process if you are on a call with a foreigner, you're identified as an American, you're not supposed to be unmasked, which happened at a massive level. Pam, you have these awesome powers. As the attorney general, you had the ability and got warrants against people. Then you see what we are discussing here. Put it together how profound that is and how dangerous? PAM BONDI, R-FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Sean, it's not power; it's responsibility. When you take an office like it's about responsibility. When you see it as power like all of these corrupt people have, that's when you're in trouble. And the most frightening thing to me is they use their responsibility as power, and anyone who got in the way was collateral damage to get to the end of what they wanted to do. And I've warned people in this room. I believe they were probably illegally taped. They would do anything-- HANNITY: I've been warned. I'm still here. Geraldo promised me a cake with a file. He did. (LAUGHTER) BONDI: They would do anything they could do to take out our President. And all of these great people in this room and you did not let it happen. And people - we're not scared, these people, to come up to speak the truth and fight against it. And what Matt just said, we've got to keep doing that. HANNITY: Geraldo, what I - we've become such dear friends. I'm going to celebrate your 50th year in broadcasting in amazing ways that you have no idea. But here's the thing. You've always said you never understood, you want Donald Trump and the country to succeed. Now, this has gone on for 2.5 years of his Presidency and still he has an incredible record on the economy, on promises he made. GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: We get one President at a time. And I think that all Americans should unite behind the President. But I want to back up just one second to what happened this morning. William Barr's interview on CBS was kind of under-stated and matter of fact. But the implication of what he said is so profound. What have we experienced? We have experienced some of the most powerful people in our government, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, using the power of the United States government to prove that the candidate Trump, President-Elect Trump, President Trump was a traitor, was a spy for the Russians, was a person whose loyalty lay outside the constitution, outside of the United States, and had sold his soul to the neo-communist devil. I think that this is so atrocious that that would be their motivating impulse, shows how distorted their hatred of the President-- HANNITY: Geraldo, if Donald Trump cured cancer and gave every American $10 million and even adopted their insane New Green Deal agenda, they'd still hate him. And - look, you've been in this business for a long time. Truth matters. Facts matter. And the American people have been - 99 percent of the media went with the lies, the conspiracy theories. And they're not admitting they are wrong that they thought for a few hours yesterday Mueller gave them what they wanted again until Mueller had to be corrected and put out a joint statement with the Attorney General saying, oops, ah, I was wrong. RIVERA: It's not just those people. It is also - look at history. Wouldn't history have been so profoundly different if William Barr had been the initial pick to be the Attorney General of the United States by Donald Trump? I'm-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You're going to - you're giving Joe a heart attack. He's - yes, it would've been. We'll take a break. We'll come back. Deep state actors, they are defiant. They're all about to be exposed. Who are they? What is going to happen next? We'll explain, as this edition of HANNITY continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to “Hannity: Act Two, the Deep State's Day of Reckoning.” Now, as the walls begin to close in on all of these deep state actors who tried to undermine Donald Trump's Presidency, well, former top intel brash John Brennan, James Comey, Clapper, among so many others, they are scrambling now to justify their dubious actions, rewrite history, and are actually now creating a circular firing squad. And we're noticing they're turning on each other, which is probably a good sign. We continue with our live panel here. I always do this at the end. We kind of know the story. This audience has stayed with us. So I want to kind of move a little bit because I don't want to rush the end part here. Tom Fitton, you keep putting in FOIA request after FOIA request. Who is in trouble? How badly? And will it happen? That's the question I get asked by my audience the most. TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, something ought to happen. I think the President is a crime victim. Carter Page obviously is a crime victim. And you had top officials, I think it can be strongly suggested, misused their office for political purposes, mishandled classified information to target someone over politics, otherwise misuse government resources to target and spy on people over politics. And the President is the number one victim. And who benefitted the most from that? Hillary Clinton and her co- conspirators in the Obama administration who avoided the consequences of her email misconduct. In many ways, the targeting of Trump on Russia froze the Justice Department from engaging in full accountability and cleaning up over the Hillary mess. And that's over-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: --over to you. FITTON: Mrs. Clinton has as much to worry about as some of these deep state actors, in my view. HANNITY: Doug, you are unique. You're a Democrat. You're a Clinton Democrat. Sorry to hear that. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: Still love you anyway. You see what is happening both between this and the New Green Deal-- DOUG SCHOEN, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. HANNITY: --and you see a disaster politically coming for the Democratic Party. SCHOEN: Right. I see, Sean, that the Democrats are moving so far left as a party. The Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren remain (ph). My party is now at its mess level, getting behind Joe Biden. The left is going to try to undermine him and make an election that is likely to be very competitive, less so. One other word, Sean-- HANNITY: By the way, I'll make a statement. I already have a dossier on creepy, crazy, sleepy Uncle Joe. SCHOEN: But let's have a real election rather than what everyone here, in the most compelling way, has described. Let me say one more thing. As a partisan Democrat, I respect everyone here. Many of these people are my good friends. What I believe as a Democrat is we need to know the facts of what happened. I'm glad we had a Mueller report. I'm glad we've been able to assess it. Let's do the same thing as Joe Digenova said on the Democratic side because what the FBI allegedly did, what the Clinton campaign allegedly did, what Comey, what Strzok, what Page did, this needs to be aired completely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. SCHOEN: I say this not as a partisan Democrat-- HANNITY: You say it as somebody who loves this country. SCHOEN: I love this country, and I want to have real elections where we debate ideas, not go through this process. HANNITY: Now I want to begin this lightning round. Who is in trouble? Do you see indictments and convictions? Everybody that I - we've been doing this for over two years. When is it coming out? When is it happening? We've got declassification. We have an AG investigation. Michael Horowitz and Huber, Durham in Boston now. Where are we going, Joe? Where is this going to end? JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: What we need is a real federal investigation of the former federal investigators. HANNITY: Wow! DIGENOVA: Bill Barr is going to do that. Will there be convictions? I don't know. Jury trials are river boat gamble. It doesn't matter. What we need is an expose of the entire process. What Geraldo Rivera said is so scary, so frightening that any American who doesn't think we need to get to the bottom of that is out of his or her mind. HANNITY: We lose the country? DIGENOVA: This is so seminal to what we are as a country. We have to know what Brennan, Clapper, Comey, all of these people did. If we don't find this out, if Barr doesn't get to the bottom of this, the body politic of this country is going to be just rent asunder. HANNITY: Tipping point for the country? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, of course, because we have to stop it now. If we don't, it will happen again. These - this just doesn't start. As I said before, this has been going on. HANNITY: That's scary. Take a break. We'll come back. By the way, when we come back, two people personally impacted by Mueller's partisan witch hunt, as we continue, and what will unfold in the days and weeks ahead. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Fox News Alert. Police now giving an update on that mass shooting at Virginia Beach. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA: Good evening. This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our hearts ache over the senseless violence that has been inflicted upon the Virginia Beach community today. My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning and will not return tonight. They were all someone's child, and many were someone's parent. They were heading into the summer weekend. That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy. Their families are facing painful loss and grief. They each leave a hole in a family, in their neighborhood, in this community, and in our commonwealth. We mourn with their loved ones, but sympathy doesn't fill that hole. We must take care of these families. These horrific tragedies test our souls. Grief doesn't pass quickly. It lasts far beyond these coming days, and these families will need support in the months and years to come. I'm also praying for those who were injured in this tragedy and hoping for their full recovery. Along with the pain of their own injuries, they face the loss of their co-workers and their friends. I want to commend the local and state law enforcement officers, the first responders, the medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation. Their actions likely saved lives. And they have experienced scenes and injuries no one should ever have to face. My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families. To them and to the City of Virginia Beach, I offer the full support of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Tonight, we are all about Virginia Beach. I'd now like to turn the podium over to our Mayor of Virginia Beach, Mayor Dyer. MAYOR BOBBY DYER, VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA: Today is Virginia Beach's darkest hour. A senseless crime happened and imposed tremendous grief upon the people of Virginia Beach, the commonwealth and this country. When we get through the shock of it all and we get through the details that we must go through over the next day or two, I believe that our community, Virginia Beach, along with our neighbors and our other cities in Hampton Roads and our commonwealth and our country, we'll be there for not only the families, because that's when they're going to need us going forward, but we're going to show that Virginia Beach is a city of resolve and dedication. And we are going to be there for all the families, the friends and our community in a big way. And with that, I thank you, and I would like to turn this over to Chief Cervera for an update. JAMES CERVERA, VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE CHIEF: As I said earlier this evening, as we are able to gather more information, we will give that information out. So this is the additional information that I have at this time. Again, it will probably change a little and it may increase as we move forward, as we're investigating this case. Right now, we have a team of investigators, detectives from the City of Virginia Beach being assisted by forensic technicians from the FBI and the state police in processing this most horrific scene. We're in the process of identifying victims and making notification to their families. I can tell you that we do have an additional victim to report. We now have 12. One victim succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. We also have four additional victims being treated at area hospitals, and we have reports that others may have self-transported. So, as we get more information on that, we will begin to release it. Our process is always to notify family members prior to releasing names. We do know who the suspect is. We have not been successful in notifying certain family members. Once we are able to do that, we will release his name once. We're going to mention his name once. And then he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families. I can tell you that when the initial call came out of an active shoot in building two. Building number two in our city houses information technology, planning, public works and public utilities, plus a printing operation. This building has a potential of having over 400 city workers at one time or other in the building. When the original call came out, immediately four officers responded. Two were seasoned veteran supervisors from the Detective Bureau and we have two K-9 handlers who were assigned to our special operations unit. They immediately made entry into the building. Due to the sound of gunfire, they were able to locate the floor on which the suspect was committing his crimes. They immediately engaged with the suspect. And I can tell you that it was a long gun battle between those four officers and that suspect. We recovered a .45 caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines that were emptied at the time. The suspect was reloading extended magazines in that handgun, firing at victims throughout the building and at our officers. I want you to know that during this gun battle, basically the officers stopped this individual from committing more crimes in that building. When the suspect went down due to his injuries, our officers then immediately rendered first aid, as they were removing him from the building to the waiting EMS personnel. I need to say that a second time. Even though he was involved in a long-term moving gun battle with these officers, when he went down, they did what cops do and they rendered first aid to this individual. He succumbed to his wound. We have found victims on all three floors of the building as well as one victim who was outside in a vehicle. Right now, as many as 90 people have sought support from the Family Assistance Center. And again, we are in the process. Our goal now is to identify everyone in that building as quick as we can, so we can make the proper notifications to the families of those victims. Do we have any questions? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, you were saying outside. What was the relation to the victim outside? I mean, not the relation, but what did you say with a vehicle? I just want to-- (CROSSTALK) CERVERA: An individual was in his vehicle when the suspect shot him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, there were reports that this was a disgruntled employee. Had he been recently fired or were there any indications of any workplace trouble? CERVERA: I have no information at this time as to the background of the individual other than he's a city employee. Again, as we work through all of this, we'd be able to give more information out later. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was current up until the shooting? CERVERA: That's correct. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chief, I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. So he started shooting victims outside before entering the building? CERVERA: There was one victim outside. He entered the building. He was armed with a .45 caliber handgun that had a suppressor on it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us more about the extended magazine? CERVERA: I'm sorry? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell us more about the magazines? CERVERA: They were extended magazines. In other words, they have more ammunition than a regular magazine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) Chief, in terms of the numbers, 12 people were killed and then the gunman was the 13th person that was killed or is that- (CROSSTALK) CERVERA: We have 12 victims-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Victims. CERVERA: --and a deceased suspect. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, were any of the victims targeted or was all of this random? CERVERA: At this time, I can't comment on that as we work through the investigation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you know if all victims were city employees? CERVERA: I cannot give you that because we are in the process of identifying the victims. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The numbers have changed a little bit. I just want to make sure we're straight with the number of victims who were taken to hospitals. Can we just get the sum total of what that number is now? CERVERA: Well, I originally reported we had 11 victims. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir. 11 victims. CERVERA: So we have an additional. One victim did not succumb to the wounds on the way to the hospital or at the hospital. And I am told that we have four others at the hospital right now going through surgeries. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So my math brings that to nine-- CERVERA: Well, your math would say that we have 12 deceased. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir. I (inaudible). So I apologize. I just don't want to make an error, but before you had said that there were six injured? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Injured. CERVERA: I did. And again, that was the information that I had at that time. It's been updated. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So now it's 10 injured? CERVERA: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. CERVERA: We have 12 deceased-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two of the six injured-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Succumbed. CERVERA: Right. We have 12 deceased and we have four who were injured. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who are currently-- CERVERA: --going through - yes, going through surgeries. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, have police had the opportunity to search the shooter's home? Had it found anything that's been of interest like additional weapons? CERVERA: We're in a process of continuing our investigation at this time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Were any other weapons found at the scene there? Reports said there was a rifle there as well. CERVERA: We're in the process of continuing - that's the best I'm going to be able to tell you at this moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, can you elaborate more on the extensive gun battle between the officers and the shooter? CERVERA: I could tell you that there were numerous shots fired by the individual. Shots were fired from various places down the hallway at the officers, at one time returned. Basically, there are - the ammunition that they had. So when we talk about this kind of a situation, and many times when we talk about an officer involved in shooting situation, it may be minimal rounds by the suspect and by the police officers. This was well beyond that. This was a long time - the best I could describe it there was a long-term gun battle for the police officers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you put into-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The timeline how long--? (CROSSTALK) CERVERA: I can't - I can't give you seconds and minutes because we don't - we don't have a stopwatch when we were engaged in this. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know the time that the suspect is dead? CERVERA: I'm sorry? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know what time the suspect died? CERVERA: Shortly after we entered the building and confronted him. So the call came out right after 4 p.m. So it'd be somewhere after that. We don't have the exact time right now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you tell us about security around these government buildings, how many police that are normally there? And are people allowed to enter these buildings with weapons? CERVERA: The individual in question is an employee. He has access to the building. He came in with a weapon today. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So he would not have been checked or--? CERVERA: No, he would not have been. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, was any officers injured? CERVERA: One officer did sustain a wound during the gun battle. Fortunately, his bulletproof vest basically saved his life. And we did - he was seen - he was tended to at the scene. But then we then brought him to the hospital afterwards to make sure that everything is OK with the officer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, when you say suppressor, is that a silencer or is that the same thing or--? CERVERA: It's a suppressor - it's a sound suppressor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was the gun recovered legally obtained? CERVERA: We're working through ATF at this time. It's part of our investigation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And police - has your department recently - I know in the past you have prepared for a scenario like this. I mean, how recently was the last time you prepared for this? CERVERA: We train continuously. We train not only as first responders for police, but we train with fire and we train with our EMS personnel because we know that when you have a major scene like this, you're going to need all first responders into that particular area. So we do train extensively, both on what we call table-top exercises as well as on all hands-on exercise in a building. So I could tell you that we do train extensively. And how many weeks or months prior, I can't give you the exact number. But our officers and our EMS personnel and our fire personnel are highly qualified, unfortunately, in a situation of an active shooter case. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chief, there were - of the four officers who entered, two were detectives and two were members of the K-9? CERVERA: The K-9, that's correct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. CERVERA: OK. Thank you. Just one final thing. And I've said it before and you heard the Governor and the Mayor speak of it. We have numerous victims and we have numerous families. Let's make sure that we keep their dignity and their respect as the number one piece of news that we're going to give out, and I know that our local media always abides by, because their lives are changed forever. The folks who work in that building, their lives have changed. I have a number of officers right now-- HANNITY (ph): Stay with us for continuing coverage of the shooting. We'll have live updates throughout the night. ""The Ingraham Angle"" starts now. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

""We want you to know who they were so in the days and weeks to come you will learn what they meant to all of us, to their families, to their friends and to their coworkers,"" said City Manager Dave Hansen. ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill."" Four people were also injured in the melee that broke out Friday afternoon in the popular Virginia resort city. The victims' names were released by police Saturday morning: Brown worked at public works for 4.5 years. She was remembered by Kimberlita Casper, who identified herself as Brown's cousin, in several Facebook posts. ""I am heartbroken. My cousin's life was taken from her today,"" she wrote. Casper remembered a conversation with Brown where she spoke of doing preaching work and traveling abroad: ""You could see the true joy she had."" Even though they were at a family funeral, the two found peace in that moment. ""We were smiling, laughing and so happy because we know what God promises in just a little while longer if we give our best and do not tire out."" Cox worked at public utilities for 12.5 years. He was the son of Ray Cox, Sr., the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach, the Washington Post reports. Cox's older brother Ervin posted a tribute on Facebook: ""My heart is hurting because my baby brother was murdered today by the shooter in Virginia Beach mass shooting. I won’t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore. I loved my brother and will truly miss his caring soul. Until we meet again in heaven"" Gayle worked at public works for 24 years. She was looking forward to a free day at a spa, which friends and neighbors told the New York Times was to be a reward for her work. “She was a super sweet lady; she always had this big smile,” next-door neighbor John Cushman told the Times. “She would always be out there in the yard, working on something and talking to my daughters.” Facebook user Kenneth Ashby, who said that he knew Gayle, remembered her as ""a happy person ... a good person."" ""A few years ago when she traveled to California on business, all she could think about was stepping in the Pacific so she could say she touched both oceans in the same day. The pictures she sent back weren't of a mature woman walking on the beach but of a middle aged kid dancing in the surf. Mary Lou will be missed by all who knew her."" Langer worked at public utilities for 12 years. She was remembered as ""a kind, faithful woman of God"" by Twitter user Nicole Newsome, who identified herself as a church family member and a journalist with the Virginian-Pilot.

He loved Scottish music and played the bagpipes in Tidewater Pipes and Drums, a southeastern Virginia pipe band. The band remembered Rapp in a Saturday Facebook post: ""Chris recently moved to Virginia Beach and immediately joined the band after learning how to play the bagpipes from our friends in the Greater Richmond Pipes & Drums. He was quiet but had a passion for the pipes and Scottish culture."" Rapp was the former director of public works for Stafford County, Virginia, the county tweeted Saturday. Snelling worked as a contractor. Friends and neighbors told the Virginian-Pilot that he was a kind, generous man who was willing to lend a hand. “He walked the halls of our church to make sure nothing happened. He protected us,” Mariana Rocha, who knew Snelling through Crosswalk Church, told the newspaper. Snelling led the church's security team, she said. Snelling had recently celebrated his wedding anniversary: “Him and his wife were best friends,” Rocha said. Gallagher worked at public works for 6 years Gusev worked at public works for 9 years. Gusev was an immigrant from Belarus, the New York Times reports. Hardy, 52, who worked at public utilities for about four and a half years, is recalled by neighbor Clay Rosser as a meticulous, religious man who kept his lawn in great shape. Rosser lowered the blade on his lawn mower an extra notch and mowed Hardy’s yard just the way he would have liked it. Rosser also erected a wooden cross with an urn and flowers in front of Hardy’s townhouse, where he lived alone. It was the least he could do for the man he described as the perfect neighbor. “So I came out here and cut it in, you know, his honor, and fashioned up a cross right there because Joshua was a devout man of faith,” Rosser said. On Saturday morning, Rosser learned his friend and neighbor had been one of 12 people slain at the municipal building. He said he placed the cross in Hardy’s yard as a reminder to others of what was lost. “But it’s not Joshua’s loss because for sure, as I am sitting right here touching this cross, this man is with our savior,” Rosser said, his voice cracking with emotion.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Police chief James Cervera says the suspect is dead following a mass shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Virginia. National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch ripped Rep. Ilhan Omar after she blamed the gun rights group for the deaths inside a Virginia Beach municipal building on Friday. The embattled Minnesota Democrat took a swipe at the NRA just hours after a disgruntled city employee went on a shooting spree that left 12 people dead and four more injured. AT LEAST 12 DEATHS AND SEVERAL INJURIES AT VIRGINIA BEACH MUNICIPAL COMPLEX, POLICE SAY; SHOOTER ALSO DEAD: REPORTS “I am outraged and heartbroken,” she wrote in a tweet. “How much longer will we ignore the pain of our communities? We need to immediately confront the power of the NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in this country.” DeWayne Craddock, the suspected shooter, died in a gunfight with police officers. He was a veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department who made multiple legal firearm purchases, including for a handgun and rifle, in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported. A police officer was also wounded, but was saved by his bullet-proof vest. The police didn’t reveal the motive for the shooting. Omar’s comment about the NRA prompted the group’s spokeswoman to question how it was related. “This was a heinous tragedy,” Loesch wrote in a tweet. “Your remarks move me to ask: What do 5 million members of the NRA have to do with this man’s crime? Was this man a card-carrying member? His purchases were legal, whose fault is that? Does he bear any blame at all? Serious questions.” TED CRUZ SLAMS ILHAN OMAR OVER NOW-DELETED TWEET ON IMMIGRATION The Minnesota Democrat has long been opposed to the NRA, often decrying the supposed influence of the group on the gun control debate in the country.

477,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/buttigieg-south-bend-shooting.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Mitch Smith and Alexander Burns SOUTH BEND, Ind. — It has been one of the biggest challenges for Pete Buttigieg since he began his improbable presidential campaign in January: Could the Harvard-educated mayor of South Bend, who often comes across like the brainy technocrat he once was as a McKinsey & Company consultant, build a following among black voters, one of the Democratic Party’s most vital constituencies? Early signs were worrisome. Few African-Americans showed up at his campaign events, even in predominantly black areas of key primary states like South Carolina. His poll numbers among black voters were low to nonexistent. And he was shadowed by criticism from some black residents of South Bend about his firing of the city’s first black police chief and his handling of economic and housing issues. But Mr. Buttigieg’s troubles intensified into a crisis on Sunday as he faced pointed questions and angry jeers from some African-American residents of South Bend at a packed town-hall-style meeting that he held in his latest attempt to respond to the fatal police shooting last week of Eric J. Logan, a 54-year-old black man. Though many in the crowd clapped politely for Mr. Buttigieg, the meeting was dominated by members of the audience who loudly yelled their objections to the event’s format and to the mayor’s answers. When Mr. Buttigieg talked about the city’s requirement that officers use their body cameras, someone called out, “Why haven’t you been enforcing it, then?” When the mayor defended his record of engaging residents on policing issues, another person shouted, “We don’t trust you.” At a few points Mr. Buttigieg asked the audience for quiet and to stop interrupting him. He listened to complaints about a pattern of police mistreatment of black people. He admitted failures. He promised to do better. But at the same time, there was little of the soothing emotional empathy that politicians strive to deliver in such moments. “There’s a lot beneath the surface when it comes to trust and legitimacy around policing and race in our city,” said Mr. Buttigieg, who was seated on a stage next to the police chief, Scott Ruszkowski. With Mr. Buttigieg just days away from his first Democratic presidential debate, on Thursday night, his difficulty quelling the frustrations and concerns among black residents here threatens to upend his well-crafted pitch about South Bend’s rebuilt downtown and overall economic strides. “A lot of tension in the air right now — you can cut it with a knife,” Blu Casey, a South Bend activist who attended the meeting, said in an interview. As for the mayor? “He’s doing bad within the black community right now,” Mr. Casey said. [Here is the latest on the state of the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.] Mr. Buttigieg openly conceded on Sunday that his efforts to recruit a more diverse police force had failed, a remarkable admission that his rivals for the nomination are sure to bring up should they need a line of attack against him. He also voiced his disappointment that a body camera, which the city bought to great fanfare, and which the officer was wearing when he fatally shot Mr. Logan, had not been turned on, leaving unanswered questions about the episode. He told the audience that he would ask for a federal investigation of the shooting and for a special prosecutor to be appointed. Protesters have requested that an outside agency review the case, but the St. Joseph County prosecutor has so far declined to request a special prosecutor. transcript “The effort to recruit more minority officers to the police department, and the effort to introduce body cameras, have not succeeded. And I accept responsibility for that.” “Do you understand? Get the people that are racist off the street. Reorganize your department. You can do that by Friday.” “First of all, thank you for that — [shouts from audience] and I appreciate that what you said is specific and actionable and constructive. I will say that if anyone who is on patrol is shown to be a racist, or to do something racist, [shouts from audience] in a way that is substantiated, that is their last day on the street. [applause] And I would love to be able to finish — I would love to be able to finish my reply if that’s O.K. I would appreciate being being able to finish my reply.” “Because what you see tonight is that African-Americans are not monolithic. We do not have the same ideas, thoughts and opinions, and we do not have the same experiences.” “I don’t know if it’s smart or not. I don’t know if it’s strategic or not. But it’s my city. And I have a relationship with everybody in this city who looks to the city to keep them safe.” Mr. Buttigieg’s apparent difficulty to soothe a crisis at home strikes at several raw points for his presidential campaign. His soaring ascent in the race has been propelled overwhelmingly by the enthusiasm of white voters, and especially college-educated whites — including some of the Democratic Party’s wealthiest political benefactors. He has repeatedly acknowledged that he is struggling to connect not just with black voters but also other minority groups that are pillars of the Democratic Party’s national coalition. No candidate in recent years has won the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, or even advanced far in the nominating process, without substantial support from African-Americans. But it is not only black voters, like Mr. Buttigieg’s constituents in South Bend, who may regard the latest developments there as unsettling for his candidacy. White liberals have also grown intensely concerned in recent years with matters of racism and social justice, and they, too, may be watching Mr. Buttigieg’s handling of events in his city with a judgmental eye. Up to this point, he has cultivated an unflappable political persona, defined by his cool intellect and seeming immunity to criticism or provocation from his critics. While his campaign carries the romantic theme of bridging a new political era, in person Mr. Buttigieg offers a results-over-emotion ethos informed by his career as a McKinsey consultant that is far from Bill Clinton’s “I feel your pain” mantra. During a tour of Mason City, Iowa, this month, Mr. Buttigieg spoke with the local mayor about macro-level municipal concerns such as downtown development and river cleanup, but spent comparatively little time with local residents talking about their concerns. And at the town-hall-style meeting on Sunday, he was serious and solemn throughout — never losing his cool, but also never wearing emotions on his sleeve. Mr. Buttigieg sat behind a small desk on a stage in a vast high school auditorium, looking out on the crowd of city residents, listening intently and rarely raising his voice. The only other two people on stage were the police chief, who sat next to the mayor, and a local N.A.A.C.P. leader, who stood several feet away and whose attempts to maintain order were mostly unsuccessful. Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr. Buttigieg, with emotion evident in his voice, said he was grieved by his constituents’ pain and committed to addressing their complaints. He said he attended Sunday’s event not out of political calculation, but out of a sense of duty. “I don’t know if it’s smart or not, I don’t know if it’s strategic or not, but it’s my city,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “I have a relationship with everybody in this city.” [‘The black vote is not monolithic’: 2020 Democrats find split preferences in South Carolina] Oliver Davis, a black member of the South Bend City Council who has been a sharp critic of Mr. Buttigieg on policing matters, paused a long time during a telephone interview on Sunday when asked if the mayor showed empathy. “If he cries and sheds tears then people say he’s weak,” he said. “If he doesn’t shed a tear people say he’s cold. If he gets angry people say he’s out of control. If he has a flat face and doesn’t say anything, people say he doesn’t feel our pain.” Mr. Davis said he admired the mayor for wading into a crowd of protesters and Mr. Logan’s grieving relatives on Friday night. “Very few people could have withstood what he went through without completely losing it,” he said. Mr. Buttigieg’s record in South Bend has played a modest role in his candidacy so far; he has tended to campaign not on his granular achievements in public office but rather on sweeping thematic arguments about political reform and national renewal. An initial round of scrutiny by the news media directed at his mayoral record in the spring — a number of news organizations, including The New York Times, examined his policies on policing, housing, economic development and more — did nothing to temper Democratic voters’ interest in that message. Voters and donors in the party have continued to embrace him, with steadily growing enthusiasm, more as a brainy spokesman for generational change than as a city executive with a complex portfolio of policies in his political résumé. But now, the most challenging elements of governing a small, racially divided Midwestern city are no longer likely to be confined to the distant background of Mr. Buttigieg’s presidential campaign. And for the first time, voters well beyond South Bend may begin to assess Mr. Buttigieg not as a theoretical leader — a man that many can plainly imagine speaking with strength and sophistication from the Oval Office — but as an actual leader, straining in real time to address one of the most significant crises of his career. And in that emotionally charged context, Mr. Buttigieg’s political identity is facing its most trying test so far, as the steely, cerebral manner that has made him a sensation on the campaign trail collides with a moment of mourning and anger in the city that has twice charged him with administering its government. Few details are known about the shooting of Mr. Logan by Sgt. Ryan O’Neill, a 19-year veteran of the South Bend police. Officers had been called around 3:30 a.m. last Sunday to an apartment building near downtown to investigate a person going through cars. Investigators said Sergeant O’Neill found Mr. Logan partially inside a vehicle, and that Mr. Logan then approached the officer with a knife raised. Sergeant O’Neill, who was wearing a body camera but had not turned it on, then shot him. South Bend’s tumult grew early Sunday when a mass shooting unfolded outside a bar. Eleven people were struck by gunfire, and one man died. The conditions of the 10 surviving victims had been stabilized by midday, officials said. [Sign up for our politics newsletter, and we’ll send you a reminder about our live chat on debate night.] Lwan Easton, an African-American resident of South Bend who attended the meeting on Sunday, said he was generally pleased with Mr. Buttigieg’s performance as mayor. But while parts of the city have indeed improved, Mr. Easton said the mayor had struggled connecting with black people and “needs to step up his game with community interaction.” “This is a defining moment for him,” Mr. Easton said. “I believe that he can probably figure this out.” Toward the end of the meeting, Verma Blackman, an African-American resident, spoke about her questions about Mr. Logan’s death, about how he was transported to the hospital in a police car rather than an ambulance, about her frustration that the body camera her tax money helped buy was not turned on. And she told the mayor that her young grandson was scared of his city’s police officers. “I’m doing everything I know how to fix it,” Mr. Buttigieg told her. As she left the high school, Ms. Blackman said she was pleased with the mayor’s response. “I’m a big fan of Mayor Pete: he answered it and didn’t tiptoe around it,” Ms. Blackman said. “That’s what I wanted: I wanted him to respond to our cries. Because we’re crying.” Advertisement",2019-06-23 00:00:00,"At Town Hall, Pete Buttigieg Confronts Tensions Around South Bend Police Shooting - The New York Times",,1,http://nytimes.com

I'm not saying Trump should be off limits; no one is, and certainly not the president of the United States. But it's ironic that the very people who sanctimoniously condemn him for his supposed incivility apparently believe they themselves don't have to be civil toward him. This is a recurring issue, but what brings it to mind today is the controversy over Pastor David Platt's praying for President Trump when Trump made an unscheduled stop at his McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Virginia, last Sunday. The president was returning to the White House from a golf outing and visited to pray for the victims of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his service, Platt was called backstage and informed that Trump was on his way to his church and would like for the church to pray for him. Trump arrived and stood onstage while Platt prayed for him, and then Trump walked off the stage without comment. Later, Platt posted a statement on the church website explaining his decision to pray for Trump, presumably because some members of the congregation complained about it. When I read about this, my first instinct was to express my disappointment with the pastor's pandering to certain Trump-hating congregants who seem to believe, like many other Trump haters, that all rules of decorum are suspended when it comes to Trump and, in this case, that even God's directives don't apply. Forget God's command to pray for our leaders, because despite His omniscience, He surely didn't anticipate a president like Trump when he inspired that passage and others. After further considering this and reading his statement, I concluded that Platt was in a very difficult situation. He must honor God's Word, but he mustn't harm the Gospel message by allowing confusion among his congregants concerning his motives to cause discord in the church. His statement is not an outright apology because he didn't express regret for obeying God's command that we pray for our leaders. ""I know that it is good, and pleasing in the sight of God, to pray for the president,"" he said. But he went on to say something that does bother me: ""I wanted to share all of this with you in part because I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision. This weighs heavy on my heart. I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God's Word in a way that transcends political party and position ... So while I am thankful that we had an opportunity to obey 1 Timothy 2 in a unique way today, I don't want to purposely ever do anything that undermines the unity we have in Christ."" You see, he didn't apologize for praying for Trump. That's good. It's also good that he affirmed that God's Word transcends politics. I certainly don't want my pastor to preach politics from the pulpit -- though some would incorrectly argue that taking a strong stance against certain sins is preaching politics. But where I think Pastor Platt erred is in expressly validating the hurt feelings of some congregants. They have no right to be hurt over his biblically mandated prayer for the president, and they ought to be repentant, rather than accusatory, for implying otherwise. It would have been fine if Platt had said, ""I was simply honoring God's Word. I was not endorsing the president from the pulpit or making a political statement."" That would be a legitimate clarification if some members thought Platt was trying to make an indirect political endorsement. He also has a strong biblical duty to promote church unity, and issuing a clarifying statement can be very helpful. But that's not all that happened, and so we are left with a message, surely unintentional, that Trump antipathy is so justified that Christians have a right to be angry when God's inambiguous Word is followed. I appreciate Pastor Platt's obedience to Scripture and the difficult situation in which he found himself. I applaud his efforts to honor the Apostle Paul's inspired command that we promote church unity. It's just too bad that he went further and sanctioned the invalid objections of congregants to his prayer for the president. Giving Platt the benefit of the doubt, I assume he meant that they would have had valid reasons to object to his pulpit endorsement of Trump, if that had occurred, but it did not. If that's what he meant, he didn't express it well, whereas the rest of his statement was quite clear -- and good. Few people were more politically opposed to President Obama than I was, but I would not object to (and would support) any pastor praying for him. Nor do I think we would be reading about any pastor apologizing for having prayed for Obama. But Trump is different. All bets are off where he is concerned. In our free country, people can treat President Trump as contemptuously as they want, but we should recognize their screaming hypocrisy when they treat him with the same level of incivility with which they condemn him.

That badly missed the forecast of 175,000 jobs from economists surveyed by Econoday. “What happened: Small business slashed 52,000 jobs in May, ADP said. Medium-sized firms added 11,000, and large companies added 68,000. Goods-producing industries shed 43,000 jobs, mostly concentrated in a 36,000 loss for construction; while the service sector added 71,000. … “Big picture: ADP’s report can be used as an early read on the closely-watched Labor Department jobs report that’s released two days later, but its track record is imperfect. In April, however, ADP came close: it reported that 275,000 private-sector jobs had been added, and the BLS reported a gain of 263,000. ADP revised its April read down to a gain of 271,000.” Marketwatch -- ICYMI … WSJ: “Powell Suggests Fed Could Cut Rates if Trade Spat Escalates” … “Oil on Track for Bear Market Due to Global-Growth Fears” -- Wondering why Trump jawbones the Fed so often? Here’s your answer. People close to the president have told us that interest rates are a subject very much on the president’s mind as 2020 approaches. ANDREW RESTUCCIA and BEN WHITE: “‘No way he’s bluffing’: Trump leans into tariff fight”: “White House officials have laid out three criteria for avoiding the tariffs: stopping Central American immigrants from crossing into Mexico from Guatemala; breaking up the transnational gangs that profit from the illegal immigrant trade; and keeping asylum seekers on their side of the border. It remains unclear how the Mexican government could satisfy those requirements before Monday … Mexican officials, for their part, remain optimistic.” POLITICO BUT, BUT, BUT … PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP in Ireland: “The drugs that are coming in. The people that are coming in, they are swamping the border. They are coming up by the millions. Mexico can stop it. They have [to] stop it. Otherwise we won’t be able to do business. It’s a very simple thing. I think they will stop it. I think they want to do something. I think they want to make a deal, and they sent their top people to try to do it. We’ll see what happens today. We should know something.” PELOSI SPEAKS … Speaker NANCY PELOSI -- who is off to Normandy for D-Day with 60 other lawmakers -- brushed back on the White House trade threat, saying she had “no paper” on what TRUMP is planning to do. She called the tariffs bad policy. -- BAD FOR USMCA PROSPECTS: Pelosi reiterated that she wanted changes in the base of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement -- a demand that would require a new round of negotiations between the three countries. The White House has pushed back on that publicly. -- ON CRITICS WHO SAY Democrats don’t know what they’re doing in investigating the president: “Make no mistake: We know exactly what path we’re on.” A message from Amazon: A recent study from the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University found that when Amazon raised their wage to $15/hr, the average hourly wage in the surrounding area rose by 4.7% as other employers followed their lead. Learn more about what else the research found. FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH … THE PRESIDENT TWEETED a quote from House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY that seems to exist in just one place: Trump’s Twitter feed. -- Trump quoted McCarthy saying this: “House Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way, & that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof. Why wouldn’t you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.” -- WE CANNOT FIND McCarthy saying that anywhere. His office pointed us to his interview with Laura Ingraham. Nothing he said there resembles what Trump quoted McCarthy as saying. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment. -- Here is what McCarthy said on Ingraham’s show Tuesday: “No. No, we support this president. And why, when you’re about to have a meeting -- the secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is meeting with Mexico tomorrow. We want to solve this crisis at the border. Why wouldn’t you help them be as strong as they can be, stand up with them? And you know what, if you give the president his strongest hand, you’ll never end up with tariffs and we’ll have a border that is secure.” -- AND HERE is what he said to Bloomberg’s Erik Wasson today (via @JenniferJJacobs): “End of the day we should support the president so we can get an agreement so we don’t have tariffs.

POTUS IN THE U.K. -- At an event in Portsmouth commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day today, TRUMP read aloud from a prayer FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT delivered to the nation at the time: “Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. … Give us faith in thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; and faith in our united crusade.” -- TRUMP had a “brief pull-aside” with German Chancellor ANGELA MERKEL, per poolers Mark Landler of the NYT and Jerome Cartillier of AFP. According to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, they discussed the crisis in Libya and “deteriorating conditions in West Africa.” A frosty pic -- “Theresa May told to ask Donald Trump for CIA torture flights report,” by The Scotsman’s Paris Gourtsoyannis: “May is facing calls to ask Donald Trump for Scottish investigators to be given access to a classified intelligence report that may hold the key to whether secret CIA flights broke UK laws against torture. Police Scotland has spent six years examining whether planes used Scottish airports to transport terror suspects to be tortured or held at Guantanamo Bay.” The Scotsman -- KFILE: “How Donald Trump for years used the royal family to gin up publicity for his properties” YIKES … “Federal investigators to examine equipment from 2016 N.C. election amid renewed fears of Russian hacking,” by WaPo’s Neena Satija: “Problems checking in voters on Election Day 2016 in Durham County made national headlines. Later, leaked documents revealed that Russians had tried to hack VR Systems shortly before the election. After the Mueller report, state officials wanted to know: Was VR Systems the company referenced? What effect, if any, did the malware have? And how could they prevent it from happening in 2020? “An examination of North Carolina’s struggle to answer those questions, detailed in court records and a dozen interviews, hints at the difficulties state officials face in shoring up security ahead of next year’s elections — a lack of technical expertise, poor communication between state and federal officials, and the apparent unwillingness, in this instance, of the federal agency involved to share information. Russian hackers targeted elections infrastructure in at least 21 states, and likely more, in 2016, federal officials have said.” WaPo -- “Study: Russia’s manipulation of Twitter was far vaster than believed,” by Tim Starks: “The Internet Research Agency campaign may not only have had more sway — reaching large numbers of real users — than previously thought, it also demonstrated ample patience and might have generated income for some of the phony accounts, Symantec found. … “The research also found that the accounts played to both sides of the aisle more than previously believed, and that most of them were fakes pretending to be regional news outlets, while a smaller subset amplified those messages.” POLITICO … The study -- NOT JUST THE U.S. … “The EU’s Embassy In Russia Was Hacked But The EU Kept It A Secret,” by BuzzFeed’s Alberto Nardelli in Brussels ON THE WORLD STAGE -- MARIANNE LEVINE: “Senators will try to block Trump’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia”: “Among the co-sponsors of the resolutions are Sens.

Speculation abounded Sunday after President Trump was photographed with what appeared to be a new hairstyle during a surprise visit Sunday to a Virginia church. The Northern Virginia pastor who prayed for President Trump on stage after an unscheduled visit Sunday explained why he did so, acknowledging ""some within our church...are hurt that I made this decision."" David Platt, McLean Bible Church pastor, told his congregation, in a statement, that his ""aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party, but to obey God’s command to pray for our president and other leaders"" as mentioned in the Bible. NEBRASKA SCHOOL THAT DECLARED CANDY CANES ‘TOO RELIGIOUS’ PULLS YEARBOOK WITH CHRISTIAN SYMBOL While the megachurch was not one of the churches that joined Rev.

Pastor David Platt, left, prays for President Donald Trump at McLean Bible Church, in Vienna, Va., Sunday June 2, 2019. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Platt read the same portion of Scripture, 1 Timothy 2:1-6, that Graham shared which specifically calls believers to pray those ""in high positions,"" before he prayed for two and a half minutes, for ""wisdom"" for the president and for leaders across the nation, explaining to his members ""it is good, and pleasing in the sight of God, to pray for the president.""

""I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God’s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God.

At left is his wife Casey DeSantis. | Lynne Sladky/AP Photo By MATT DIXON and GARY FINEOUT 06/12/2019 10:31 AM EDT TALLAHASSEE — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did an about-face on Wednesday after coming under withering criticism from the LGBTQ community, issuing a revised proclamation to commemorate the anniversary of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub that left 49 dead. The Republican initially had issued a proclamation on the eve of the anniversary of the June 12, 2016, attack on Orlando's Pulse nightclub that included no reference to the LGBTQ community or LGBTQ victims of the attack. By mid-day Wednesday, he reversed course, issuing a “corrected” document before heading to Orlando for a visit to the Pulse memorial. “Florida will not tolerate hatred towards the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities,” the new proclamation reads. DeSantis, in Jacksonville for a bill signing, said he was “not involved” in drafting the first proclamation. His spokesperson, Helen Aguirre Ferré, blamed the omission on a staff error but did not provide details. “When someone said that this wasn’t in there, I said then put it in there,” DeSantis told reporters in Jacksonville. “So we fixed it” “Sometimes these things happen and you’ve got to correct them,” he said. The first proclamation resembled one issued last year by then-Gov. Rick Scott, a fellow Republican. Scott's proclamation referenced ""Florida's LGBTQ community,"" language that was removed in the initial DeSantis document. The initial proclamation caused a firestorm across the state and on social media. ""Orlando's LGBTQ community will never be erased,"" state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, an openly-gay Democrat from Orlando, tweeted Wednesday morning. Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat who represents the district where Pulse is located, called the omission an intentional act. ""You have a governor who attempts to brand himself as moderate and yet he literally cut and paste a Rick Scott proclamation while intentionally removing and thus erasing the LGBTQ community,"" Eskamani said. ""Gay clubs are sacred to LGBTQ people and are home to equality movements,"" she told POLITICO. That Pulse shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS during the attack and posted on Facebook that he was motivated by the United States killing ""women and children by doing us airstrikes."" But the shooting nonetheless has become associated with attacks on the LGBTQ community. Fred Guttenberg, who lost his daughter, Jaime, in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, took to Twitter to question DeSantis' motives. ""What? This was an attack on the LGBTQ community committed with a gun. Was there a reason to do this?"" Guttenberg wrote, referencing DeSantis' LGBTQ omission. As the backlash gained traction on social media early in the day, DeSantis tweeted about the Pulse anniversary, this time mentioning the gay community. ""Today we mourn the loss of life of 49 innocent victims of an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando that targeted the LGBT and Hispanic community, and Florida as a whole,"" DeSantis tweeted. ""In honor of their memory, I am ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff."" Eskamani called the tweet ""damage control."" ""Advocacy matters. No doubt the Governor saw the blowback on social media for erasing LGBTQ people and is doing damage control,"" she said. ""An apology is warranted for the original Pulse proclamation."" After campaigning in 2018 as a steadfast conservative, DeSantis since taking office has worked to brand himself as a political moderate. The proclamation, though, is not the governor’s first run-in with the LGBTQ community. On Jan. 8, the day DeSantis was sworn into office, he issued an executive order pledging that his administration would ""prohibit discrimination in employment,"" but excluded the LGBTQ community from the order. ""DeSantis has reaffirmed existing protections but fumbled the opportunity to take a clear stand that discrimination in any form will not be acceptable during his administration,"" Equality Florida said in a statement at the time. Despite the blowback, the order was never changed. The LGBTQ community had asked Scott to pass an executive order establishing protections against discrimination, which he did not deliver. Eskamani also noted inaction by legislative leaders, who haven't taken up legislation that would extend discrimination protections to the LGBTQ community. Legislation advanced this year that applied to workplace protections — a more narrow version than past efforts — had bipartisan support, but failed to get a committee hearing. In the Senate, it was sponsored by Republican Party of Florida Chairman Joe Gruters, a state Senator from Sarasota, but was never part of major discussions during the 2019 legislative decision. ""Every session we fail to do anything, like how we failed to take any action after Pulse,"" Eskamani said. © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2019-06-12 10:31:43,DeSantis does about-face after omitting LGBTQ from Pulse proclamation,,18268,https://www.politico.com/

The attack was the deadliest mass shooting in the US since November. Police held a news conference Saturday morning to give updates on the investigation and to identify the victims. ""Today we all grieve,"" Dave Hansen, the city manager for Virginia Beach, said. Here's everything we know about the shooting:   James Cervera, the Virginia Beach Chief of Police, said officers in the department had a training on how to handle ""large-scale events,"" such as mass shootings, just weeks before last night's deadly attack. ""As recent as March 30, we had a large-scale training event, which incorporated not only police, but our colleagues in fire and EMS and sheriff's department to be able to respond to a large-scale event, such as this,"" he said. He said that while training is important to establish protocols ""everything changes"" during real events. ""While we train extensively, while we go over all of our protocols extensively, once you enter an environment such as this, everything changes. Things change in a moment's notice, such as the gun battle with the suspect. So we did train as recent as March 30, but officers had to make instantaneous decisions at that moment in time on how to engage the suspect. Virginia Beach police named DeWayne Craddock as the suspected shooter in yesterday deadly shooting at a Virginia Beach City building.

All but one were employees of the city, he said.    Dave Hansen, the Virginia Beach City Manager, said 11 of the 12 people who were killed in yesterday's shooting were employees of the city. ""I have worked with most of them for many years,"" he said. ""Today we all grieve,"" he said.  Police in Virginia Beach will give an update on last night's shooting rampage in a city building at 8 a.m. this morning. At least 12 people died in the shooting. The suspect has been identified as DeWayne Craddock, according to a law enforcement official and a Virginia government source. The shooter, described as a disgruntled employee, died after a gunfight with police. At least 12 people were killed by a gunman who opened fire at a city building in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Authorities said an employee opened fire and shot “indiscriminately” on Friday afternoon in a Virginia Beach municipal building that houses several city departments.  Four police officers responded to the scene and “engaged” in a “longterm gun battle” with the suspect, who was armed with a 45 caliber handgun with extended magazines and a sound suppressor, police said. The suspect was a longtime employee of the public utilities department, according to authorities. He died at the scene. Police have identified the suspect but have not yet released his name to the public because they have not yet notified his family. James Cervera, the chief of the Virginia Beach police, told reporters: “This is a devastating incident which is going to change the lives of a number of families from our city.” Victims were found on all three floors of the building, as well as one victim who was shot and killed in a vehicle before the suspect entered the building. Six victims were transported to hospitals, including one officer who was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. One victim died en route to the hospital, and four were still in surgery on Friday evening. There may be additional casualties who “self-transported” to the hospital, police said. As many as 400 people work in the municipal building on any given day. Cervera emphasized that the crime scene is “most horrific” and “can best be described as a war zone”. Survivors recounted scenes of pandemonium and fear that erupted as gunshots rang out and workers scurried frantically for cover. “We just heard people yelling and screaming to get down,” Megan Banton, a public utilities worker, told television station WAVY-TV, saying she and co-workers barricaded themselves in their office. “We put the desk up against the door because we didn’t know if they were coming in. We were just hoping that it would be over soon, and then we heard the cops yelling up the steps.” Barbara Henley, a Virginia Beach councilwoman, arrived at the building around 4pm Friday and saw a crowd of people standing outside. “Somebody told me there had been a shooting and they were told to leave. Afterward, I heard a loud male voice say, ‘Get down!’ so I did,” Henley told the Associated Press. “I’m just sick,” she added. “All these people that I work with all the time. They are such really fine people, and I just hope they’re all safe.” The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Virginia state police are assisting with the investigation. The shooting sent shockwaves through Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city and a popular vacation spot in south-eastern Virginia situated on the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said. “People involved are our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues,” he added. “This day will not define Virginia Beach. We will determine going forward today how we respond to our city,” said Aaron Rouse, a city councilman. “We will come together and we will show the strength of our city. Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, arrived on the scene Friday evening. “This is just a horrific day,” Northam said. “A lot of people are on the scene, and our thoughts are with victims and families. We are working with law enforcement and first responders to make sure we are taking care of everyone right now.”﻿ Kari Paul, Martin Pengelly and the Associated Press contributed to this report",2019-06-01 04:04:17,Virginia Beach shooting: 12 dead as city mourns 'the most devastating day',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
487,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/27/pete-buttigieg-democratic-debate-south-bend-police-shooting/1522945001/,"SOUTH BEND — One day after an anger-filled town hall with Mayor Pete Buttigieg — held following the shooting of a black man here by a police officer — an edgy crowd packed City Hall to demand answers and accountability. In that moment, soothing words helped calm the situation. ""I'm so happy to see so many people here today who are willing to stand up and use their voice and fight for what we need in this community,"" the voice said. ""But it is not a black issue; it is not a black versus white issue. It's not even a blue versus black issue. This is our problem, and if we share in the problem, we have a much better chance of sharing in the solution. But it's going to take time. It's gonna take effort, and it's a Herculean task, to be honest. ""But I would love to see South Bend be that city that everybody in the country can point to and say this is how people live in a community and this is what community is all about. ...We can be that city, but we've got to come together and we have to start listening to each other."" Buttigieg, the young presidential hopeful, did not speak those words. He wasn't there. He had flown to Miami, back to the campaign trail, earlier in the day to prep for Thursday night's Democratic debate. Nor was the sentiment delivered by a City Council member. Or a police official. Buttigieg responds to criticism: 'Because I couldn't get it done' It was, of all people, Notre Dame basketball coach Ann ""Muffet"" McGraw. The city was honoring the women's runner-up NCAA finish, and the coach used her time at the microphone to express her solidarity with the crowd, most of whom were not there to hear her speak, or to honor her team. Nonetheless, she received a loud, throaty and lengthy standing ovation. Her players, towering before the crowd of more than 150, beamed. Buttigieg wasn't entirely absent. Immediately after McGraw spoke, his staff aired a pre-recorded video of him congratulating the team. He made no mention of the shooting, no acknowledgment of the angst the crowd was feeling. Some people clapped. Politely. Like the sound of a quiet golf clap trickling through the room. Buttigieg's ambitions, or sense of duty, has left the city without a day-to-day mayor for large swaths of his two terms. In 2014, he volunteered to serve seven months as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan. In 2017, he campaigned nationally for Democratic National Committee chair. Now, he's running for president. While he and his supporters assure he can make day-to-day decisions over the phone while he's on the road, it's clear his absence is felt. Buttigieg's relationship with African Americans in South Bend, and his difficulty in reaching minority voters on the presidential campaign trail, has exploded into view since the June 16 police shooting. More than a dozen African-American city officials, community leaders, pastors and voters who spoke to IndyStar echoed a troubling sentiment: Buttigieg hasn't spent enough time talking directly to people of color or trying to solve systemic socioeconomic problems within those neighborhoods since taking office. And now, at a time when they are hurting as much as ever, they told IndyStar that Buttigieg needs to be present in the city, explaining how he's going to fix a long-fractured relationship many African Americans describe with the police department. Not by speaking at large nationally streamed town halls, or sitting in his office on the 14th floor of the County-City building, they say, but by going door to door, or directly engaging folks in smaller meetings within the city's many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Sheldon Jackson, who talked to IndyStar while he was washing his pride and joy, a mauve Chrysler 300 with chrome hubcaps and grill, said he's never seen Buttigieg in his west-side neighborhood. After watching Buttigieg's handling of the police shooting so far, Jackson said he wouldn't vote for the mayor even if he was the Democratic presidential nominee. Jackson said it doesn't feel like Buttigieg understands what he's hearing from people of color and he needs to come back to South Bend to listen. ""He should have canceled that and said, 'Look, I've got to take care of home before I do all this other stuff because it just doesn't look good.' It doesn't look good,"" Jackson said. ""He should be here, and his chief of police should be here, and they should go to every neighborhood in South Bend, Indiana, and spend time there. Just don't go show up for 5 or 10 minutes. Get out, walk around the neighborhood. If you have to go door to door, just go talk to the people and understand where they are coming from."" Buttigieg declined to meet with, or speak to, IndyStar. During the debate, he described South Bend as being in anguish and said he's determined to bring about a day, not just in South Bend but everywhere, when black and white people alike feel safe when they see the police. Former staff members and political allies who spoke to IndyStar defended his record, pointing to the unique challenges they say he faces as mayor in a crowded Democratic primary field. Democratic debate: Pete Buttigieg's policies, more to know about him before the debate City Council President Tim Scott, a political ally of the mayor's, said Buttigieg has handled the shooting well, with the possible exception of the decision to hold the town hall. Scott said emotions were too raw for a large centralized televised gathering, a point echoed by multiple people who spoke to IndyStar. ""In knowing Pete, you might not see that emotion (from him) but he truly ... he's taking to heart what is being said and wants to definitely make a difference,"" Scott said. Late Monday, amid increasing pressure from some public officials and African Americans, the county prosecutor requested an outside investigation in the shooting death of 54-year old Eric Logan. Buttigieg, who had publicly said he was open to such an investigation, released a statement that he supported the decision. Logan's family members don't think the police's version of his death adds up, and it's become clear many others in the community also have questions. Anger has been building, especially among African Americans, since the shooting. Buttigieg heard it at a march on Friday, which he skipped South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn’s “World Famous Fish Fry"" to attend. And he heard it at Sunday's town hall televised on CNN, the palpable anger of which drew headlines from coast to coast. In the past week, police officers have twice been shot at, but not hit, according to city officials. Ten people were injured, and one man was killed at a local bar shooting June 23, where brightly colored police paint marks the spots where dozens and dozens of bullets and shells landed in the parking lot. A memorial for Logan has twice been defaced, including with the words ""good shoot,"" causing friends of the family to set up a 24-7 watch. It includes a stuffed bear, flowers and candles. The official version of what happened is concise. South Bend Police say Sgt. Ryan O'Neill found Logan rooting through a car after 3 a.m. in an apartment complex after hearing reports of someone vandalizing vehicles in the area. O'Neill says he shot Logan because he was wielding a knife, advancing toward the officer and refusing orders to drop the weapon. Logan later died at an area hospital after being transported in a squad car instead of an ambulance, a decision repeatedly questioned by Logan's family and others. They wonder whether that contributed to his death. ""The ambulance department is two blocks away from the scene, so it's not like the ambulance had to come from 5 miles away,"" said Vernado Malone Sr., a friend of Logan's who works as a paramedic. At this point, the officer's account is the only one to emerge. Police say the officer had not activated his body camera. Buttigieg now will require police to do so in similar situations. No witnesses have come forward. Compounding the situation, it's emerged that O'Neill was investigated in July 2008 on claims he made racist remarks, according to court documents obtained by IndyStar. But a police review did not prove him guilty and no discipline was taken. Logan’s brother, Tyree Bonds, told IndyStar that Logan has no history of theft and wouldn't attack an armed officer with a knife. Logan does have a rap sheet that includes charges of carrying a handgun without a license and possession of drugs. Bonds questioned whether his brother was rooting through cars at all, and thinks he was walking by the apartment complex to visit his mother when police arrived. The racial remarks O'Neill allegedly made also concern Bonds. He thinks Buttigieg is saying the right things. But Bonds wants action to be taken. “He’s the mayor. He knows what’s going on. Just do your job. That’s all we ask of you,” Bonds told IndyStar while he visited his brother's memorial early Monday. “How are you, the mayor, going to run for president and you can’t even handle little South Bend.” Sounding worn out later that evening at Monday's council meeting, Bonds told the City Council the family wants justice and asked the crowd to remain calm as the investigation, which he had just earlier learned about, plays out. ""We know for a fact this is going to take a process,"" Bonds said. ""If we as a family are willing to accept that, you all got to accept it, too. I watched all of the yelling and hooping and hollering yesterday (at the town hall meeting) and that was just ridiculous. Everybody knows this stuff has been going on for a long time, now let this happen. They said they are going to get a special prosecutor, let that happen."" On Wednesday the family filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officer alleging excessive use of force. Some residents made the point of telling IndyStar they know many police officers are good at their jobs. But they're concerned about the bad ones. George Jones, a retired principal, said Buttigieg doesn't seem to know what to do in this situation. ""When you have a few officers, it tarnishes the whole police department,"" Jones said. ""Because of the fact they seem like they are protected and things are covered up. That is what this community is feeling. You have these bad officers on your staff, and you don't dismiss them, and you keep giving excuses for their behavior, and these things keep matriculating, and so that creates a friction between the police department and the community."" Komaneach Wheeler said she knows police risk their lives to help the community, and she said they helped her once with a domestic violence case. But she also knows there's been racism in the department. ""He's going through some challenges,"" she said of Buttigieg. ""We all see it nationally, whether there are tears, whether there is pain and suffering. But he is going through it. Why? Because he had a dream. And he had a dream to be a president. And he was mayor at the time. And he forgot to do some things right? So this is some consequences as well for him to prove himself."" Tiana Batiste-Waddell, an educator who has been pushing for the police department to adopt a bias-training program called Intercultural Development Inventory, said people need to know action is being taken. “There are subcultures within our city that don’t feel safe,” she said. “We don’t feel safe. We don’t trust the process; we don’t trust the people. We don't feel safe.” Buttigieg has found himself on a lonely island. He's been criticized by African Americans and now he's facing it from his own police department, with some officers apparently feeling like his response has left them hung out to dry. The South Bend Fraternal Order of Police released a letter Monday that sharply criticized his handling of the situation and made it clear they feel like he should be better supporting the department and its officers. The letter also points out Buttigieg has been silent about the shooting outside Kelly's Pub and other police encounters over the past couple weeks. ""Mayor Buttigieg has in no way unified the community,"" the open letter read. ""Mayor Buttigieg continues to only focus on one incident and one family. Buttigieg has yet to comment on the largest mass shooting in the recent history of South Bend or on one juvenile killing another earlier in the week."" Hoosier Politics: This free newsletter keeps you updated each week Jason Banicki-Critchlow, a former county corrections officer, said he knows many South Bend officers who are good people and it's too early to come to judgement. But Banicki-Critchlow, who is white, said he grew up in a diverse neighborhood and so understands others have had different interactions with police than he has. ""We have a few bits and pieces of a story,"" he said, ""but we don't have all of the evidence."" Banicki-Critchlow thinks Buttigieg is using officers as a political pawn to deflect mistakes he's made in handling the police department. He said Buttigieg is in a difficult position. ""It's tough to run for president at the level needed for that race and also to run a city in crises at the same time,"" Banicki-Critchlow said. Buttigieg tried to quell concerns about the time he is spending on the campaign trail during an interview on WUBS-FM, an African American-owned community Christian radio station in South Bend. ""There's only one mayor,"" he said, in a quote provided to IndyStar by his staff. ""I'm the mayor when I'm sitting here with you, I'm the mayor when I'm sitting in the office on the 14th floor, I'm the mayor when I'm walking down a block on the west side, and I'm the mayor if I'm traveling. So if anybody is wondering where accountability falls or where leadership will come from, so long as I hold this job it's me."" Station host and owner Sylvester Williams later told IndyStar there's little evidence Buttigieg is reaching out to more than a handful of people. He thinks the mayor should not have returned to the campaign trail so soon. ""I think that he is struggling to find solutions, because it appeared that he has not really felt the pain of the people,"" Williams said. ""He has somewhat been more analytical, political and somewhat separated from this area of pain with the people."" Williams said the trouble began in 2012 when Buttigieg demoted the city's first African American police chief, Darryl Boykins, who still is popular in the community. Public officials, community leaders and voters told IndyStar that Boykins spent time with people of color, listened and understood their concerns. They felt he was a bridge across a long troubled relationship between police and African Americans. Buttigieg needs black and Latino support to win. Here's why that could be a problem. Buttigieg demoted Boykins over his handling of a police phone-tapping incident that drew the attention of federal authorities. The tapes allegedly revealed racist remarks made by some police officers, but Buttigieg contends they were illegally made. Boykins, who has denied wrongdoing, eventually sued and settled with the city out of court, with neither side admitting fault. The police officers who were taped also sued and settled and no longer work for the department. The Rev. Graylin Watson of Jesus is Emmanuel Church said the mayor needs to reform the police department. He referenced several incidents in which he believes South Bend officers acted improperly, perhaps most notably a 2012 incident in which three police officers went to the wrong home searching for a suspect and punched, stunned and handcuffed a black man they found sleeping there. The man was later awarded just $18 by a jury in a civil suit, raising more questions among African Americans about the seriousness of which this country takes civil rights violations. ""Now we see a mayor that's not qualified to speak to a hostile situation when you got people hurting and disturbed,"" Watson said. ""But this didn't start when the mayor came in but he's covering and he's not rendered the services to the African American community, or to the Latino community or to the white community that need to be rendered."" Williams plans to hold a rally with local pastors to discuss the police shooting and race relations at City Hall on July 1. ""Lets see if Buttigieg, who is invisible on these things, will be here to hear what the pastors have to pray and have to say,"" Williams said. Political allies told IndyStar the mayor can run the city while campaigning for president and defended his response to the police shooting. Buttigieg's former chief of staff James Mueller was the mayor's point of contact within the city when he ran for DNC chair two years ago. Mueller, who is the Democratic nominee to replace the mayor, said Buttigieg made decisions via phone and email when he was on the campaign trial. Mueller doesn't believe any projects were slowed down, including one of the largest priorities while he was away, renaming a highly traveled section of downtown after Martin Luther King Jr. ""We really got efficient at maximizing the time he was in town to hitting events that he needed to hit and to be visible to show the community he was still here working on stuff,"" Mueller said. ""In terms of decision making, he and I were friends and had been working together at the city for over a year, a year and a half at that point, and so really understood what he needed to know to make a decision and how to get that to him efficiently."" We know Indiana politics: Subscribe to see all our coverage Former Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, who is now a principal at a real-estate firm in South Bend, described a similar experience when he served as point man during Buttigieg's time in Afghanistan. Back then, the city was finishing an initiative to tear down 1,000 vacant houses in 1,000 days, and Neal says everything continued smoothly. ""Part of that is his personal ability to recruit people to the city was extraordinary,"" Neal said. ""I think that was a big part of the success of the city; we had so many good people dedicated to public service."" Both Mueller and Neal think Buttigieg is handling the police shooting appropriately, saying there was no action to be taken last week while he was campaigning. Mueller likely will be the mayor in 2019 in this predominantly Democratic city, meaning he will oversee the police department. Like Buttigieg before him, he thinks adding diversity to the department would go a long way. In the past eight years, though, the department has grown less diverse as older officers have retired. Mueller thinks Buttigieg's campaign will be able to overcome this moment in time. ""These are challenging issues that almost every city in America faces and no one has solved it completely,"" Mueller said. ""Taking on this kind of challenge in a national spotlight is certainly a test for him to go through, but certainly not one that can’t be passed."" From experts: How Buttigieg's tense town hall might hurt — or help — his campaign Neal says Buttigieg cares deeply about the community, even if emotion doesn't always come through when he's speaking and listening. Buttigieg was criticized by some for not showing enough empathy at the town hall, though he teared up when talking to reporters afterward. ""I think he is more than willing to engage with folks, and I think sometimes someone of his intellect doesn't always allow people to see the humanness of him,"" Neal said. ""He is a very compassionate person."" While in Miami the week of the Democratic debate, Buttigieg defended his decision to leave South Bend on national media appearances, saying he had left the campaign trail earlier to reach out to the community. During the debate, he was asked why the police department wasn't more diverse. “Because I couldn’t get it done,” Buttigieg said. ""My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting. A black man, Eric Logan, was killed by a white officer. I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer said he was attacked by a knife but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess, and we're hurting. ""And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back."" Before returning to the trail, he had cancelled events in New York, South Carolina and California to spend time in South Bend. While back in town, he held news conferences, went to several outreach meetings, made phone calls, spoke to community and religious leaders, activists and elected officials. He also met with Logan's family. Supporters say he plans to add more diversity to the police department and point out he had some time ago implemented bias training. Not everyone is so sure things have gone so well over the years when Buttigieg is out of town. City Councilman Oliver Davis pushes back on the idea that things have gone so smoothly when Buttigieg is out of town. Davis recalls at least one building project downtown that was delayed while Buttigieg was running for DNC chair. He thinks Buttigieg held Sunday's town hall quickly in order to get back onto the campaign trail, rather than waiting to let things cool off, or speak to people in smaller groups. ""It's a situation where everything is trying to get solved so quickly because he has to go,"" Davis said. ""That's a challenge."" Davis said Buttigieg has failed to reform the police department. He shared with IndyStar an open letter he wrote to Buttigieg in 2016 that called for police to be required to use body cameras, for a citizen board to review police misconduct and for more diversity within the police department. He said none of those things have happened, until Buttigieg required body cameras to be used after this latest shooting. When asked whether Buttigieg's campaign could recover from the police shooting, Davis questioned whether it should recover. ""His campaign team lacks diversity,"" Davis said. ""Why would you want to run for president and have a non diverse team. And other leaders across the country had to call out to him and share where is the diversity of your team? That shows you that he is not ready on Day 1 when it comes to that racial and age diversity. ""Most of the people on his team are under the age of 40. You have to have a combination of people who are strong to have a strong team."" Call IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at 317-444-6036.

Lauren Underwood, D-Naperville, held an invitation-only meeting Sunday in Batavia with stakeholders and gun violence prevention advocacy groups hoping they will help mobilize efforts this summer for gun reform. The U.S. House earlier this year passed a bill expanding federal background checks for gun purchases and transfers, and another measure that would increase the waiting period that licensed firearm dealers and licensees have to wait from 3 to 10 days. ""We all know that we have a long road ahead in getting these changes made into law,"" Underwood said at a news conference after her meeting. Among those in attendance were members of the Kane and Kendall county groups of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America; state Rep. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago; Batavia Mayor Jeff Schielke and Geneva Mayor Kevin Burns. “I stand with all of you today to call on the Senate to bring these bills to a vote and send them to the president’s desk. We can’t wait,” Underwood said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell several times has expressed reluctance to consider “bipartisan, common sense legislation,” Underwood said. ""The American people speaking out boldly,"" would help convince him to do otherwise, she said. The Aurora area was ""rocked by the unthinkable"" by two shootings, she said. Most recently on Feb. 15 a worker at the Henry Pratt Co. warehouse shot and killed five people, and wounded five Aurora police officers and a worker. There was also a mass shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb on Feb. 14, 2008. Underwood wants the groups to mobilize this summer so that the U.S. Senate is compelled to call the bills for a vote. ""These bills would ensure universal background checks for every gun purchase. They are sensible and bipartisan,"" she said of the two bills. Patrick Korellis spoke at the press conference as a survivor of the 2008 Cole Hall shooting at NIU. A gunman stormed through a metal door and began to shoot in a lecture hall. Five of his classmates were killed and 21 people were injured. ""I was shot in the back of my head and arm,"" said Korellis, 33. He has since met with survivors from mass shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Virginia Tech, Columbine High School and Henry Pratt Co. ""I don't think bump stocks and assault weapons that can spit multiple rounds in a minute are necessary for people to have for protection in their home,"" Korellis told The Beacon-News. ""We had a 100 people in the lecture hall. If the shooter had an assault weapon I would not be here today,"" he said. He said that the mass shooting at the Henry Pratt warehouse in Aurora has been difficult for him. One of the victims was a graduate and another was an intern from NIU. Villa was a school resource worker prior to being elected last November. ""The way we grew up as children practicing fire drills is how children are now growing up with intruder drills,"" she said. ""The anxiety children and teachers are going through is unacceptable,"" Villa said. The purpose of the meeting with the focus groups was to have a follow-up on the status of the bills, said Underwood, who took office in January. ""We have reached a bottleneck point. We are all looking for progress on this critical issue,"" she said. While the U.S. House has done its part, she is hoping advocates will speak “boldly and loudly” to get the bills to the president’s desk for his signature, she said. ""The bipartisan nature of the legislation would suggest there is broad support on both sides of the aisle,"" Underwood said. ""We are confident both bills would pass in an equally bipartisan way on the Senate floor,"" she said. Batavia aldermen Dan Chanzit and Michael O’Brien were among those at the meeting. ""We recognize that gun violence is not a red or blue issue,"" Chanzit said. While the Batavia City Council cannot pass ordinances that will make a difference in gun laws, the local leadership can pass resolutions urging lawmakers at the state and federal levels do their job, he said. “What we heard today were marching orders,” Chanzit said.

With the second and final night of the first democratic debate taking place from 9 to 11 p.m. on Thursday in Miami, the Tampa Bay Times has complete coverage of what to expect, the candidates and what happened in the first half of the debate Wednesday night. Here’s your complete guide. Just like last night, the debate will air on NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo. We’ll also embed a live stream in this post once one comes available, but viewers will also be able to watch a stream of the debate on NBCNews.com or through an over-the-top device or subscription streaming service that carries NBC — such as Fubo, Apple TV or Sling TV. Though there’ll be ten candidates on stage, the most notable contenders in tonight’s roster will include Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg. They are four of the five top-polling Democratic candidates overall, with Biden as the clear frontrunner as it stands and Sanders firmly in second. Joining those four will be Marianne Williamson, John Hickenlooper, Andrew Yang, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet and Eric Swalwell. From left to right, here’s how the democrats will be lined up tonight, and where they stand in the latest polls: A lot can happen in a two-hour debate.

A tragic image shared 24 hours before the first debate set up a massive gulf on immigration policy between a majority of Democrats on the debate stage and President Donald Trump. When asked about the heart-wrenching photo of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter Valeria floating in the Rio Grande after drowning, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro said crossing the border illegally should be a civil, not criminal offense. A majority of Democrats on the debate stage Wednesday night backed the overhaul, putting presidential contenders directly in contrast with Trump’s alarmist border rhetoric. Read Alex Daughtery’s full story here. The wide field of Democratic presidential candidates have descended on Miami this week for two nights of debates. But how are they actually talking about Florida while here? Climate change and the Trump administration’s immigration policies are well covered. But on many other issues uniquely important to the Sunshine State, it’s unlikely Floridians will hear much. The Tampa Bay Times recently surveyed all the candidates, highlighting matters distinct to Florida that haven’t received much attention from the candidates. The survey included questions from Florida readers, and the full results can be found online. Read Steve Contorno’s full story here. The Tampa Bay Times asked every major Democratic presidential candidate to weigh in on issues of particular interest to Floridians. Fifteen responded. Here are their answers, word-for-word. Three of the questions are ours. We focused on topics important to Florida that we haven’t seen the candidates already address. The rest come directly from readers like you. We’ve highlighted the heart of every answer, but tap on the response to read their whole statement. Read Steve Contorno and Langston Taylor’s full story here. The Democrats who want to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency took the stage for the first debate of the presidential primary of the 2020 election cycle. Many of them argued that the U.S. economy isn’t working for working people. The Democratic field is so large that only half the candidates appeared Wednesday; another debate with the rest of the field was scheduled for the next night. Here are some of the candidates’ comments. Read PolitiFact’s full story here. Before she even began to speak — and she did quite a bit of that Wednesday night — Elizabeth Warren stood out among her fellow Democratic presidential candidates in a more visual way. In a row of dark-colored suits and ties, the liberal firebrand’s purple blazer caught one’s eye from center stage. Then the questions started rolling in, and it became clear that the Massachusetts senator would dominate at least a portion of the evening. Warren, the only candidate speaking at the first Democratic presidential debate who is polling in double digits nationally, was the first candidate to speak. And her policy proposals were referenced in the opening questions to other candidates, too. After rattling off the several detailed policy proposals that have brought her nationwide attention, the moderators questioned the candidates to Warren’s left and right on their positions on Warren’s stances. Read the Miami Herald’s fully story here. When the question of how to address gun violence in the U.S. reached Sen. Cory Booker, he made the answer personal, recalling when he heard gunshots in his Newark, New Jersey neighborhood. “I think I’m the only ... I hope I’m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week,” he said. “Someone I knew, Shahid Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.” On a crowded debate stage, Booker stood near front and center and managed to grab several moments in the spotlight in a two-hour span, during which he spoke for nearly 11 minutes — the longest of any candidate, according to a New York Times analysis. He used that time to stake out positions on gun control, LGBTQ rights, immigration and the economy. Read Joey Flechas’ full story here. Democratic candidates for president often invoked the 2018 school shooting in Parkland and the activism from the student survivors as they made the case for more restrictions on firearms during Wednesday night’s debate in Miami. But forgotten in the conversation was another gun-related tragedy in Florida just two years earlier: the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando. There, a man with military-style weapons killed 49 people in what was at the time the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. It remains so in Florida. The omission was not overlooked by some Orlando-area Democrats. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith said the failure to acknowledge Pulse during a gun debate in Florida “'was incredibly disappointing.” Read Steve Contorno’s full story here. Beto O’Rourke came to Miami on Wednesday night looking for a moment to help his struggling presidential campaign but may have done more — at least early on — to help his competitors. As the curtain raised on the presidential primary, O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who rose to national prominence last year while losing a close Senate race, became a convenient springboard during the first moments of the first 2020 Democratic debate for some of the other nine candidates looking to break out during night one of a back-to-back event. While President Donald Trump or even front-running Joe Biden may have been more obvious foils coming into the night, candidates farther back in the polls seemed to look instead to O’Rourke — who spent the night calling for national unity — to try and claw their way forward. Read David Smiley and Alex Daugherty’s full story here. Like many of the candidates on Wednesday night’s presidential debate stage in Miami, Julián Castro needed to win over a national audience of potential voters who largely didn’t know who he was. In large measure, he succeeded. The former San Antonio mayor and HUD secretary, who had been on the outskirts of early polling, emerged as a debate-defining voice on his signature issue of immigration. In a tangle with fellow Texan Beto O’Rourke on the subject, he also delivered a stinging rebuttal that echoed through the evening: “I think that you should do your homework on this issue.” Read Elizabeth Koh’s full story here. The second Democratic debate will be on July 30 and 31, with similar — low threshold — qualification rules. It, however, will be the last debate where so many candidates get a spot on stage. The Democratic National Convention has said it plans to raise the bar and has set the requirements for future debates as such: 1. Candidates will have to hit 2 percent in at least four polls. 2. Will have to have 130,000 unique donors. The donor threshold in particular will be challenging for many candidates who currently don’t have national followings. So the third debate could well have a far smaller lineup. Our mission is to keep you informed with stories that matter and that only we will tell.

(AP) — The pastor of a Virginia church has asked God to give President Donald Trump wisdom to lead the country.

MIAMI — On June 4, after 44 years in office, Broward County’s state attorney, Michael Satz, announced he’ll be stepping down. His departure could herald a sea change for the county’s criminal justice system, which has been marred by high-profile crimes and allegations of racist policing. Even though Broward is heavily liberal, and even though both the left and right in recent years have been inching toward criminal justice reform, South Florida voters have consistently embraced Satz, a quiet, conservative Democrat who embodies a tough-on-crime ethos. His website boasts that he once “achieved the highest total conviction rate for trials and guilty pleas in the state, a high standard his office works hard to maintain.” Now, though, three people in the running for Satz’s job are promising to keep people out of jail, not put them in. Two have declared their candidacies and a third, who narrowly lost to Satz in 2016, might run. All describe themselves as progressives. If Broward veers left, it would join a wave of progressive prosecutors swept into office since 2016, a trend fueled by millions of dollars funneled through political action committees from left-leaning billionaire George Soros. As a group, these progressive leaders are death-penalty skeptics. They want to reduce arrests for nonviolent crimes and rein in a system they say profits from incarceration. Soros-backed PACs already are ramping up for 2020. The Justice and Public Safety PAC has pumped nearly $1 million into prosecutor races in two Virginia counties. That group focused earlier efforts on candidates challenging the most draconian state attorneys or were likely to lose without Soros’ help. PAC Treasurer Whitney Tymas did not respond to a question about whether the group would fund a candidate in Broward. Satz’s office is only one of four major Broward judicial positions up for grabs in 2020. Embattled county Sheriff Scott Israel, suspended for his handling of the Parkland school shooting last year, is fighting to regain his job. So far six people have filed to replace him. Public defender Howard Finkelstein, first elected in 2004, is leaving office. Even the clerk of court race is contentious, with incumbent Brenda Forman — who is under criminal investigation — being challenged by her ex-husband, Howard Forman. Broward is home to 1.9 million people and 24 miles of coastline, but it’s known for its crime, both fictional and real. The county was the location for the first season of the TV show “Cops” and has been the setting for famous judicial proceedings, including a review of circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Then there are the pot-smoking judges and disgraced former sheriffs who faced time in jail. The mass shooting at Broward’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year jolted the nation, but as with any municipality, the majority of arrestees moving through the county’s courthouse and jails are nonviolent offenders from low-income households. “Broward is the perfect reflection of problems with the broader criminal justice system,” said Democrat Joseph Kimok, a teacher-turned-lawyer who spent three years as an assistant state attorney and has filed to run for Satz’s seat. “We overcharge, we over-incarcerate, we rely too much on cash bail.” Kimok, who earned his law degree in 2010, is best known for defending Zachary Cruz, the teenage brother of Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz. After the shooting, Zachary Cruz was arrested when he was discovered on the Parkland school campus. The case, Kimok said, reflects the “overall philosophy” of Satz’s office: “Prosecutors asked for three-quarters of a million dollars bail on a kid arrested for trespassing.” Zachary was kept in custody, which Kimok said pressured him to take a plea deal in the case. If elected, Kimok said, he would instruct his staff not to seek cash bail in cases where the accused presents no danger to the community. “Most folks that don’t show up to court, they are not running,” Kimok said. “They slept through their alarm clock that day or they’re a junkie and too high and forgot about court.” Kimok is married to a black civil litigation attorney, , and their son is biracial, which Kimok said makes him particularly attuned to racial disparities and excessive force in policing. He wouldn’t seek mandatory minimums on drug cases or file possession charges for marijuana. He would incorporate data in his decision-making and be transparent, especially in death penalty cases, he said. “The way our state attorney makes death penalty decisions is a mystery to all of us,” Kimok said. “That decision has to be extraordinarily transparent.” Jim Lewis, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who spent 12 years as a prosecutor, also is running. He considers himself a progressive, even though he ran as a Republican in 2012, facing off against Satz in the general election. Like Kimok, Lewis would stop jailing people for marijuana offenses, which he calls “a total waste of time.” He rejects the prevailing wisdom that criminals need to be incarcerated to protect the community. Experience has shown that drug abuse and mental illness are what drive people to commit crimes, he said. “Let’s use the system to fix broken people,” Lewis said. The current system is set up “so that lobbyists and the Corrections Corporation of America can make more money.” Another progressive Democrat, Teresa Williams, has formed an exploratory committee. A former Miami-Dade prosecutor, also a veteran of the Prosecution Office and now a private criminal defense attorney, Williams challenged Satz in 2016, losing by 5,400 votes. “It’s all about money,” she said. “The more cases you file, the more defense attorneys make, more the bondsmen make, the more judges you need to bring in.” “It winds up being a cycle with everyone with their heads in their wallets instead of looking at what should happen in the system. Meanwhile you’re destroying a whole group of” primarily poor black people, Williams said. Whether Williams runs again will depend on who else enters the race, which she said will be decided in the Democratic primary. “We know exactly who is voting. It’s not your average individual. These are supervoters,"" Williams said. “What you see is large voting blocs in the black community coming out of the churches. It’s not the general populace.” Whatever happens, Kimok said, “it’s an exciting time. We’ve got an opportunity here in Broward County to really do things very, very differently than they’ve been done for a long, long time.” © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2019-06-28 05:01:54,"In Broward, the race for state attorney is about keeping people out of jail",,18268,https://www.politico.com/

The School Marshal Program, which essentially deputizes teachers and other staff members, trains school staff members to carry a concealed weapon and how to respond to an active shooter situation. (Josie Norris /The San Antonio Express-News via AP) AUSTIN — An unlimited number of school district teachers and staff can now go armed on campus to help guard against future school shootings, a change spurred by the 2018 massacre at Santa Fe High School that brought the reality of school violence home to Texas. In the year since a student gunned down his classmates and two substitute teachers, killing 10 people and injuring 13 others, several Texas school districts have embraced the program that allows school staff to undergo training to become marshals certified to keep handguns on campus. Roughly half of Santa Fe high school employees have expressed interest in the program, although school officials have not yet decided whether they want more armed staff, said school board president Rusty Norman. “I’m not sure just how many could meet the qualifications and live up and do the training that we would require,” said Norman. “After the community suffered the tragedy it suffered, people are willing to look at all aspects of safety and that’s just one additional thing that does make people feel safer. There are others that are worried about just introducing guns on school campus.” With the signing of a new law on Thursday to allow districts to have as many marshals as they see fit, that’s a debate that’s likely coming to school boards all over the state. There were fewer than 40 certified school marshals in Texas in 2018. That number increased five-fold after the mass shooting in Santa Fe. For subscribers: Santa Fe school district, families reflect on changes in year since mass shooting “It is vital that we have trained professionals that can respond to violent threats in our schools,” Gov. Greg Abbott said as he signed the bill into law at the Texas Capitol on Thursday. “It empowers school districts for themselves to decide how many school marshals are necessary to better protect their students.” Others are critical of the program, saying it can lead to unintended consequences such as misfires on campus. A police officer working in a high school in Mesquite accidentally fired his gun when he tried to unload it this spring, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. No one was hurt. “There’s simply no way to allow for every scenario,” said Michelle Herskowitz, a volunteer leader from Houston with the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action, an anti-gun violence group. She said the group plans to visit school boards across Texas and urge them against allowing their teachers and staff to keep guns on campus. The school marshal program was established in 2013 following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 students and six adults. The law allows districts to train and arm school employees to respond to an active shooter. Texas Take: Get political headlines from across the state sent directly to your inbox Few signed up in the first five years of the program, but more applied after the Santa Fe shooting, with nearly 200 marshals now trained and employed in schools. School employees must undergo 80 hours of training with a law enforcement academy to learn about security, use of force, active shooter response and weapon proficiency, according to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement. Candidates must have a valid handgun license and pass a psychological exam. As well as expanding the marshal program, legislators passed a number of bills this year to improve school safety. Abbott on Thursday also signed legislation to ensure school boards stay up to date on their school safety plans; require teachers to undergo training to identify and respond to trauma; and increase access to mental health services for children across Texas. Norman said Santa Fe High School welcomes the support the new laws will provide, especially regarding mental health given students deal with pressures from social media that earlier generations never had to face. School counselors and mental health advocates had mixed reactions to adding more armed teachers and staff in schools, but said they are pleased that lawmakers are also focused on mental health and ensuring students have somewhere to turn. “The recognition in the state that it’s going to take more than marshals and guns, that our kids need access to people who can help them cope, is a huge victory this session. Huge,” said Jan Friese, executive director of the Texas Counseling Association. Andrea Zelinski is a state bureau reporter focusing on education, politics, social issues and the courts.

Kyle Kashuv, who survived the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, quickly became known as an advocate for school security. While many of his classmates marched for gun control, he presented a more politically conservative response to the attack. Kashuv met with President Donald Trump and senators in the weeks after the February 2018 shooting, in which 17 people were killed. Happy Birthday Mr.President!⁣⁣When my community was struggling, through all the confusion and pain, he was there to help. Taking the time on one of the busiest days of the administration to sit down with some just high school kid to discuss how to fix the real problems. pic.twitter.com/xNCkFEu66b Kashuv wrote on social media Monday morning that nearly two years ago, when he was 16, he and some classmates used ""abhorrent racial slurs"" in an effort to be shocking and extremist, and that images of those private conversations had recently resurfaced. He wrote a public apology, but said former peers and political opponents contacted Harvard and urged the university to rescind its offer of admission. Kashuv then described the questions and the responses he gave to school official, and wrote that he was told this month Harvard rescinded its offer. He had turned down scholarship offers from other schools, he wrote, and the deadline for accepting other offers has passed. In a direct message Monday, he said Harvard had been his first choice. ""To be honest, the past weeks have been pretty bad,"" he wrote. Rachael Dane, a spokeswoman for Harvard, said the school does not comment publicly on the admission status of individual applicants. Harvard reserves the right to rescind offers under certain circumstances, such as if students fail to graduate from high school, misrepresented information on their applications or engaged in behavior that raises questions about their moral character. In 2017, at least 10 prospective students had their admissions offers rescinded and the Harvard Crimson reported that those students had traded explicit and racially offensive messages in a private Facebook group. That decision sparked criticism from some that Harvard was censoring speech and being too politically correct and praise from others who maintained admission to the elite school is a privilege that can and should be revoked if it appears not to be deserved. Kashuv's announcement prompted similar debates on social media. Asked if he thought his political views had any bearing on Harvard's decision, Kashuv responded, ""Many people have speculated that."" He gave his account in tweets: 1/ THREAD: Harvard rescinded my acceptance. Three months after being admitted to Harvard Class of 2023, Harvard has decided to rescind my admission over texts and comments made nearly two years ago, months prior to the shooting.I have some thoughts. Here’s what happened. 2/ A few weeks ago, I was made aware of egregious and callous comments classmates and I made privately years ago - when I was 16 years old, months before the shooting - in an attempt to be as extreme and shocking as possible. I immediately apologized.  Here is my apology: pic.twitter.com/eI38ziiQE8 3/ After I issued this apology, speculative articles were written, my peers used the opportunity to attack me, and my life was once again reduced to a headline. It sent me into one of the darkest spirals of my life. 4/ After the story broke, former peers & political opponents began contacting Harvard urging them to rescind me. Harvard then sent this letter stating that Harvard ""reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission"" and requested a written explanation within 72 hours. pic.twitter.com/RfEQCvjgDX 5/ I responded to the letter with a full explanation, apology, and requested documents. pic.twitter.com/yWd6FeKWOJ 6/ I also sent an email to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to seek guidance on how to right this wrong and work with them once I was on campus. pic.twitter.com/3M1UEXXeQm 7/ Harvard decided to rescind my admission with the following letter. pic.twitter.com/P3bLkF3hHn 8/ Somewhat ironically, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion sent me this response regarding my apology: “Thank you for your email. We appreciate your thoughtful reflections and look forward to connecting with you upon your matriculation in the fall of 2020..."" pic.twitter.com/YUX67QW3KE 9/ After receiving Harvard’s letter revoking my acceptance, I responded by asking for the opportunity to have an in-person meeting to make my case face to face and work towards any possible path of reconciliation. Harvard responded by declining my meeting request. pic.twitter.com/rdsGU7BhjD Kashuv wrote on Twitter, ""Harvard deciding that someone can't grow, especially after a life-altering event like the shooting, is deeply concerning. If any institution should understand growth, it's Harvard, which is looked to as the pinnacle of higher education despite its checkered past. ""Throughout its history, Harvard's faculty has included slave owners, segregationists, bigots and antisemites. If Harvard is suggesting that growth isn't possible and that our past defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently racist institution. But I don't believe that. ""I believe that institutions and people can grow. I've said that repeatedly. In the end, this isn't about me, it's about whether we live in a society in which forgiveness is possible or mistakes brand you as irredeemable, as Harvard has decided for me. Get all the news you need to start your day in Houston. ""So what now?"" he wrote. ""I'm figuring it out. I had given up huge scholarships in order to go to Harvard, and the deadline for accepting other college offers has ended.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Hargitay said, ""No, I have not talked to her. She did resign from my board."" Fairstein was on the board of Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation, which assists survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse. In an op-ed last week in The Wall Street Journal, Fairstein condemned how she is portrayed in the Netflix series ""When They See Us."" Directed by Ava DuVernay, it tells of the wrongful conviction of five black and Latino teenagers for the 1989 assault on a white female jogger in Central Park. Fairstein, who headed Manhattan's sex crimes unit at the time, has long been criticized for her role in the suspects' interrogation in the racially divisive case. The teens said their confessions were coerced and their convictions were overturned in 2002 after convicted murderer and serial rapist Matias Reyes confessed to committing the crime alone, and his DNA was linked to it. Fairstein would go on to become a best-selling author of mystery novels. Fallout from the Netflix show has led to her being dropped by her book publisher, Dutton. Fairstein also resigned as a Board of Trustees member at Vassar College and from the victims-services agency, Safe Horizon. Hargitay spoke about Fairstein last Friday while promoting the documentary ""Emmanuel,"" about the mass shooting that killed nine black worshippers in Charleston, South Carolina four years ago. Hartigay is the co-producer of the film. When asked about her relationship with Fairstein, Hartigay said she's ""known (Linda) for a long time"" and was introduced to her by ""Law & Order"" creator Dick Wolf. In an op-ed for USA Today last year, Fairstein wrote that she inspired ""Law and Order: SVU."" ""Twenty years ago, while I was still leading what is now known as the Special Victims Unit, I had a call from Dick Wolf, creator of the Law and Order television series. He was in pre-production of a spinoff that he called 'Law and Order: SVU.' He wasn't asking me to be part of his team, but he was hoping I would spend time with two of his leading actors — Mariska Hargitay and Stephanie March — to explain our work,"" Fairstein wrote. ""Not only did I enjoy that opportunity, but it was the start of two friendships I cherish to this day."" When asked if she trained with Fairstein for ""Law & Order: SVU,"" Hargitay said: ""Not trained, I met Linda. Dick introduced me to her. I think Stephanie March did because she was playing the ADA (assistant district attorney)."" ""When They See Us,"" a four-episode series, debuted on Netflix late last month. Hargitay said she's begun watching it.

In a proclamation, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered state flags to be lowered to half staff and asked Floridians to pause to remember the victims of the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. But he initially made no mention of the gay or Hispanic communities in the proclamation honoring the 49 club-goers who were killed on Latin night in the deadliest attack on gay people in the U.S. Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani of Orange County criticized the Republican governor for the omission, calling the proclamation, ""straight-washed."" DeSantis later tweeted that the state mourns the loss of life from the attack that ""targeted the LGBTQ and Hispanic community, and Florida as a whole."" Several hours later, his office issued a ""corrected version"" of the proclamation that said Florida wouldn't tolerate hate toward the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities. ""Staff made an error in the previous version. The governor has directed that the proclamation be re-issued, including a direct reference to our LGBTQ and Hispanic communities,"" said Helen Aguirre Ferre, the governor's communications director, in an email accompanying the revised proclamation. ""The governor stands in solidarity with the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities who were attacked during this horrific act of violence at Pulse three years ago today."" When asked about the omission at a bill signing in Jacksonville, the governor said he wasn't involved in drafting the original proclamation. ""When someone said that this wasn't in there, I said, 'Well, then put it in there.' So we fixed it,"" DeSantis said. ""Obviously, we flew the flags at half staff and that was the reason we put out the proclamation. Sometimes these things happen and you've just got to correct it."" Later in the day, DeSantis and his wife, Casey, visited Pulse and laid bouquets of flowers outside the nightclub. In the U.S. Senate, Florida's two Republican U.S. senators introduced a resolution honoring the 49 people killed on Latin night. The resolution, which passed with unanimous consent, noted that the massacre was ""an attack on LGBTQ community, the Hispanic community, the city of Orlando, the state of Florida and the United States."" Gunman Omar Mateen was killed after a three-hour standoff by SWAT team members. He had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. At the time, the Pulse massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. However, another mass shooting the following year along the Las Vegas Strip became the deadliest when 58 people were killed. In Orlando, churches were ringing bells 49 times at noon, names of the slain were read at a midday church service in downtown Orlando and a Wednesday night memorial service was planned outside the Pulse nightclub, which has been closed since the shooting in June 2016. Some survivors and friends gathered at the club shortly after 2 a.m. Wednesday to mark the exact time the shooting started. Pulse owner Barbara Poma has established a nonprofit to open a memorial and museum at the site. About $14 million has been raised for the $50 million project. Six design firms have been selected as finalists and the winner will be chosen in the fall. The permanent memorial and museum are scheduled to open in 2022. ——— Associated Press writer Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida. contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-12 10:52:37, Floridians remember 3-year anniversary of Pulse shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The attorney for Douglas Haig argued that the connection to the massacre will have a ""prejudicial effect"" on Las Vegas jurors, the Las Vegas Review-Journal         reported Tuesday. ""Unlike a judge, jurors may simply be unable to set aside their passion and prejudice to render a fair and impartial verdict in this case,"" Haig's attorney wrote in recent court filings. A federal magistrate judge in Nevada has recommended for the trial judge to deny Haig's new request. ""Though the trial will present challenges, the trial judge will ensure the Defendant an impartial trial,"" U.S. Magistrate Judge Cam Ferenbach wrote in a report. U.S. District Judge James Mahan has not yet issued a decision. Haig has pleaded not guilty to illegally making tracer and armor-piercing bullets at his home in Mesa, Arizona. He is not charged in the October 2017 shooting that killed 59 people and injured more than 850. Prosecutors have said his fingerprints were found on unfired reloaded bullets found inside the hotel room where the gunman fired down at the crowd. Haig previously sought to move the trial to Arizona, citing similar concerns about an impartial jury. The court denied the request. His attorney also sought to prevent prosecutors from mentioning the Las Vegas shooting at trial. The court agreed to exclude some related evidence, but noted other procedural safeguards would reduce the possibility of prejudice. The trial is scheduled to begin in August. ——— Information from: Las Vegas Review-Journal,         http://www.lvrj.com 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-12 14:40:41, Man who sold ammo to Vegas shooter asks for trial by judge,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

515,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/sheriff-parkland-train-give-courage-63820025,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' case against the sheriff he suspended because of his department's response to the Parkland school shooting is largely tied to the inactions of a deputy who failed to enter the school after bullets began flying TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A sheriff suspended by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over the response to the Parkland school shooting testified Wednesday that he properly trained a deputy now criminally charged in the case, but he wasn't able to give him courage. Suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is fighting to keep his job after being removed three days after DeSantis took office last January. DeSantis accused Israel of incompetence and neglect of duty and failing to properly train his department for an active shooter situation. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. The case against Israel is built largely on the failure of Deputy Scot Peterson, who remained outside the school instead of entering the building as a gunman fired about 140 bullets. DeSantis' lawyer, Nicholas Primrose, focused much of his questioning on Peterson's training and Israel's decision to change the wording of a deputy's responsibilities during an active shooter situation from ""shall"" enter a building to ""may"" enter a building. ""You give them the training,"" Israel said. ""You provide them with the polices and the procedures, but no matter what the governor's attorney says at any time, if they think that I can provide any woman or man on this Earth with courage and the desire to go inside when their conscious is telling them, 'I'm not going in there.' There's no sheriff, there's no police leader, there's no football coach or there's no general that's going to get someone to go in when the human element takes over and they say to themselves, 'I'm not going in.'"" DeSantis doesn't have the final say in whether Israel will be permanently removed from office. Israel was testifying before a ""special master"" appointed by Republican Senate President Bill Galvano to gather facts and make a recommendation on whether Israel should be removed from office or reinstated. The full Senate will eventually vote on Israel's fate. Israel was first elected in 2012 and reelected in 2016. He plans to run for the position again next year regardless of the outcome of the Senate proceedings. The governor's lawyers didn't call any witnesses to back the assertion that Israel showed incompetence and negligence, instead relying on documents such as a report prepared by a commission appointed to study the shooting, a first draft report gathering information on a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and transcripts of television interviews with Peterson and Israel. But a lawyer for Israel pointed out that the document charging Peterson with nine criminal counts for failing to take action during the shooting states that Peterson was highly trained but failed to act on his training. The document was based on an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is overseen by DeSantis and the independently elected Cabinet. Israel also defended his decision to change the language in the department's active shooter policy, saying officers are trained to assess a situation before entering a building. ""The purpose of the policy is to give the officer discretion not to go into a suicide mission. If your child was inside a school, you'd want an officer to go in, but you want him to go in alive to do what he was trained to do, and that's to eliminate the threat to the students,"" Israel said when he was questioned by  his lawyer, Benedict Kuehne. Later, when being questioned by Primrose, Israel added, ""I've been a police officer 40 years and I don't know that there's a day in my life that I haven't been around police officers, and I've never met one — not one — to make a decision to go in or not go in based on 'may' or 'shall.' Police officers will make a decision based on courage — nothing more, nothing less."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-19 17:16:56, Sheriff on Parkland: I can train but can't give out courage,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Scott had bumped into Craddock in the men's restroom of the building just minutes before the shooting, and Scott says he was in complete disbelief after learning later that Craddock was being blamed for the bloodshed. At a vigil held Saturday morning, Scott says he prayed not only for the victims but also for Craddock. Scott said of Craddock: ""He was not evil. He was just another guy who had problems."" ——— Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has visited the hospital where people wounded in the Virginia Beach shooting that killed 12 are being treated. Speaking to CNN on Saturday, Northam said he talked to family members of the wounded and one of the patients. He also said he thanked the doctors and hospital staff who are helping them. Northam said such tragedies ""are becoming all too familiar."" The gunman was identified as DeWayne Craddock. Eleven city employees and one contractor were killed in the Friday afternoon shooting at a municipal building. Craddock was killed in the ensuing gunbattle with police. Northam also said he spoke with President Trump on Friday night and he offered the full support of the federal government. ——— 11:50 a.m. About 200 people have come out in Virginia Beach to pray for 12 people killed in a mass shooting at a municipal office building. The prayer vigil Saturday morning drew city workers, community leaders, and residents who just wanted to offer hugs and condolences for the lost lives. Many people openly sobbed or dabbed their eyes with tissues. Gov. Ralph Northam also attended the vigil led by a local church. Northam told the crowd: ""We grieve with you"" and ""we are all in this together."" ——— 10:55 a.m. President Donald Trump says he's spoken to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and city officials in Virginia Beach after a shooting at a municipal building there killed 12 people. In a tweet Saturday morning, Trump says he offered condolences to the community and that the federal government is there for whatever is needed. The gunman was identified as DeWayne Craddock, who had worked for the city as an engineer for 15 years. Eleven city employees and one contractor were killed in the shooting. Craddock was killed in the ensuing gunbattle with police. One police officer was hurt but was expected to recover. ——— 10:55 a.m. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called for prayers at a Saturday vigil for the victims of a shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building that killed 12 people. Northam said to pray, not just for the victims, but also for first responders to Friday's violence because they too are grieving. The gunman was identified as DeWayne Craddock, who had worked for the city as an engineer for 15 years. Eleven city employees and one contractor were killed in the shooting. Craddock was killed in the ensuing gunbattle with police. One police officer was hurt but was expected to recover. ——— 9:20 a.m. Authorities in Virginia would not say whether the man believed to have opened fire on co-workers at a city municipal building was facing any sort of disciplinary action related to his employment. Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said at a press conference Saturday that DeWayne Craddock had been employed by the city for 15 years as an engineer. Hansen said Craddock was still employed at the time of the shooting Friday afternoon and possessed a security pass that allowed him access to nonpublic areas of the municipal building. Neither Hansen nor Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera would comment on whether Craddock was facing disciplinary or termination proceedings at the time of the shooting. Some 11 city employees and one contractor were killed in the shooting. Craddock was killed in the ensuing gunbattle with police. One police officer was hurt but was expected to recover. ——— 9:05 a.m. Police say they have recovered ""additional weapons"" that were in the possession of the suspect believed to have shot and killed 12 people during a rampage at a municipal building in Virginia. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said at a news conference Saturday that the weapons were recovered at the scene as well as at the home of the suspect, identified as DeWayne Craddock. Earlier, Cervera had said that the suspect used a .45-caliber handgun with a suppressor in the killings. Unlike some states, silencers are legal in Virginia, though it is illegal to have one in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. Authorities say Craddock stormed the building and opened fire Friday afternoon at the city building before he was killed in a gunbattle with police. ——— 8:35 a.m. Officials have identified the gunman who killed 12 people and then was shot by officers at a Virginia Beach municipal building as Dewayne Craddock. Authorities used a Saturday morning news conference to focus on the victims. They projected photos on a screen and gave each victim's name along with biographical details. City manager Dave Hansen says 11 of the 12 victims were employees of the city. He says families of the victims have been notified. He says he'd worked with most of them for many years, and they ""leave a void that we will never be able to fill."" Officials identified Craddock for the first time after talking about the victims. They say they will name Craddock only once, then will not refer to him again. ——— 1:30 a.m. Authorities say a longtime city employee wielding a .45-caliber handgun with a suppressor fatally shot 12 people on three floors of a municipal building in Virginia Beach before police shot him. Four other people were wounded in Friday's shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life. Police Chief James Cervera says the suspect engaged in a ""long gunbattle"" with law enforcement officers. He says officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died. Cervera said Friday that he would release the suspect's name after authorities had contacted his family, but would mention the name only once. He said after that, ""he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families."" ——— Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Washington, D.C.; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; and Tom Foreman Jr. in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-01 08:43:44, The Latest: Officials ID gunman in Virginia Beach shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
519,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-thwarted-electronic-doors-virginia-shooting-63514551,"Police responding to the deadly mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building were unable to confront the gunman at one point because they didn't have the key cards needed to open doors on the second floor VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- Police responding to the deadly mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building were unable to confront the gunman at one point because they didn't have the key cards needed to open doors on the second floor. Over the radio, they desperately pleaded for the electronic cards and talked of bringing in a sledgehammer, an explosive charge or other means of breaking down the doors. The killer was eventually gunned down, and whether the delay contributed to the toll of 12 victims dead and four wounded is unclear. But the episode last week illustrated how door-lock technology that is supposed to protect people from workplace violence can hamper police and rescue workers in an emergency. ""That's definitely a blind spot that this particular shooting has shown,"" said Gregory Shaffer, a retired FBI agent and former member of the bureau's elite hostage rescue team. ""We need to make sure that first responders have full access to the building."" The attacker, 40-year-old city engineer DeWayne Craddock, went from floor to floor shooting his co-workers in the rampage last Friday before he was finally killed on the second floor in a gun battle with police. It was not clear how police finally got to Craddock. Virginia Beach police spokeswoman Linda Kuehn said police were unavailable to talk about the matter on Wednesday. Police Chief James Cervera said the mayhem at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center lasted nearly 36 minutes from the time the gunman started shooting until police took him down. At about the same time officers were evacuating terrified employees from the third floor, other officers were on the second floor, frantically trying to get to the gunman after he fired at them through doors and walls. On police scanners, officers could be heard becoming exasperated as they tried unsuccessfully to get into locked areas. ""We need access keys. The doors are locked, we need access keys. I know I've got citizens in one area of the second floor I can't evacuate,"" said one officer. Key cards have become a standard feature of building security at workplaces around the country. The technology has been used for decades, but it wasn't until after 9/11 that it really began to proliferate, said Tom Manger, a former police chief in Virginia and Maryland and now senior associate director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. ""It became seen as best practice. And today it is seen by most people as not only best practice but as a necessity,"" Manger said. But in many workplaces, security experts say, police often lack quick access to cards or codes — a situation that could cost them precious minutes in a mass shooting. One exception is schools, which have been at the forefront in ensuring that police can quickly get inside with their own key cards or other methods. Key card technology posed a problem for some of the police officers who responded to a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, according to a report by the city's police. Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist, killed 12 people before being shot dead in the maze-like, 600,000-square-foot building. A Washington police officer ""had the presence of mind"" to take a building access card from a deceased security guard, allowing a team of first responders to get into secure areas, the report said. Police in some cities have made arrangements to install lock boxes containing key cards or keys outside public and private buildings. But Manger said ""there's not enough key cards and lock boxes in the world"" to give emergency responders easy access to every building. ""There's no option that's perfect,"" he said. ""You've got to sort of tailor it the building and the situation. But what you can say universally is that this is a conversation and a discussion that needs to happen ahead of time to make sure that first responders can get to a place they need to go."" In the case of the Virginia Beach shooting, the police department and the operations building where the shooting took place were part of the same complex, and police had to run maybe 300 yards to get there. Both the police and the departments inside the building are city agencies. Shaffer said police are trained to break into buildings and often have the tools to do so, as the radio chatter about sledgehammers and explosives indicated, and he defended the handling of the mass shooting by the Virginia Beach force. He said police ""definitely saved lives through their fast response."" ""They did exactly what they were supposed to do and ran toward the gunfire,"" he said. ——— Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Baltimore and AP researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this story. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-05 17:08:32, Police thwarted by electronic doors during Virginia shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The funeral mass for Katherine ""Kate"" Nixon in Virginia Beach was among the first memorial services for the 12 people who died, ushering in the next phase of grief for this city on the Atlantic Coast. ""We hope that now she's enjoying the Heavenly Father's blessing,"" Eric Vogt, pastor of St. Gregory the Great, said during the homily. A program for the funeral mass showed a smiling Nixon, 42, with her husband and three children, ages 1, 6 and 13. Nixon was a compliance manager in the city's public utilities division. She had earned a civil engineering degree and was a strong advocate for women pursuing careers in that field. Nixon was also a regular churchgoer, faithfully attending Tuesday Bible studies and Sunday Mass with her family. When she wished peace to parishioners around her in the pews, her sentiments were clearly genuine, Vogt said. Matthew Lusich, a younger brother, said Nixon was the second oldest of eight siblings who became a natural leader in the family. She met her future husband in Florida when she was still living in California. But she wrote him letters every day that were adorned with stickers of Disney characters. Lusich said the entire family would later move Nixon to Florida, forming a wagon train of vehicles that traveled across Interstate 10. ""That's how important Kate was to us,"" he said. Nixon and her husband eventually settled in Virginia Beach, where she put down deep roots. Lusich said he was inspired by his sister's willingness to move away from Bakersfield, California, to pursue what she wanted out of life. ""That fearlessness and strength ... showed leadership and inspiration to me,"" he said. ""If Kate can be fearless, I'll be fearless like Kate."" Services for other victims are scheduled through Sunday. A service was held Wednesday for Christopher Rapp in Virginia's Stafford County. Another will be held for him Sunday in Virginia Beach. Brent Hobbs, 61, of Virginia Beach, had worked with Nixon and attended her funeral mass to show respect to her and her family. ""She was a great lady,"" he said. ""Always had a smile on her face."" Hobbs said he wants to attend every service for those killed. They include 11 city employees and a contractor. But he said he doesn't know if he'll have the emotional bandwidth to attend all of them. Meanwhile, police are still trying to determine a motive for the shootings. Authorities say that city employee DeWayne Craddock opened fire in the building last Friday afternoon. He was later killed in a shootout with police. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-06 01:19:55, Services begin for the 12 victims of Virginia Beach shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
521,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/obsession-1999-attack-shape-columbines-future-63706881,"Twenty years after the Columbine school shooting, residents of the suburban Denver community it serves are debating whether it's time to tear down the school DENVER -- Two decades after the name ""Columbine"" became synonymous with a school shooting, the suburban Denver community surrounding the school is debating whether it's time to tear down a building that also became a beacon for people obsessed with the killings. School officials said the number of people trying to get close to or even inside the school reached record levels this year, the 20th anniversary of the 1999 attack that killed 13 people. People try to peek into the windows of the school library, mistaking it for the long-demolished room where most of the victims died, or ask people on campus how to take a tour. The buses full of tourists have mostly stopped over the years, but not the visitors. This year alone, security staff contacted more than 2,400 ""unauthorized"" people on Columbine's campus. Then, a few days before the anniversary, a young woman described as obsessed with the attack flew to Colorado and bought a shotgun, killing only herself yet sparking lockdowns and new fears. School security has intercepted others with a similar infatuation with the crime and its teen perpetrators -- so-called Columbiners. District security chief John McDonald can rattle off some of the most frightening instances of people who came to the campus: An Ohio couple later charged with planning a domestic terror attack; a Utah teen later arrested for a bombing plot against his school; and a Texas man apprehended at the school after he said he was filled by one of shooter's spirits and intended to ""complete his mission."" ""These people, they want the building,"" McDonald said. ""They want to experience it, to walk the halls ... The only way we can stop that interest in the building is to move it. Otherwise they're not going to stop coming."" But Columbine, named after Colorado's state flower, represents more than one day to this suburban area southeast of Denver. Boisterous call-and-response chants of ""We are Columbine"" dominate school pep rallies and more solemn occasions including an April ceremony marking the anniversary. At the nearby memorial just over a crest named ""Rebel Hill"" for the school's mascot, a plaque quotes an unnamed student: ""You're a Columbine Rebel for life and no one can ever take that away from you."" ""It's not just a building, it's like a second home to us,"" said Jenn Thompson, who as a 15-year-old huddled inside a science classroom during the attack. ""It's still standing 20 years later. It represents us, still standing 20 years later."" She hopes her own daughter, now 8 years old, can attend the school, home to about 1,700 students. The fates of mass shooting sites around the United States are varied. In Newtown, Connecticut, voters authorized the demolition of the Sandy Hook Elementary School building where 26 students and teachers were killed in 2012 and construction of a new school with the same name near the original site. The building where 17 people were killed in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in 2018 is also expected to be razed; there has been no public discussion about the school's name. After a shooter killed 12 people inside an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2012, the building reopened with a new name and auditoriums identified with letters rather than numbers. In Orlando, the owner of the Pulse nightclub plans to make the site into a museum and a memorial to the 49 people gunned down there in 2016. The discussion of Columbine's future is likely to take months. An initial proposal would keep the school's new library, which was built after the attack, and construct a new school on the existing campus but further from nearby streets to give security more room to intercept intruders. An online survey gauging community support will close this week. District officials will spend the summer reviewing and summarizing responses. If they decide to present a plan to the school board in August, its members will determine whether to put the estimated $60 or $70 million expense on November ballots. Conversations with victims' families, survivors and current staff convinced district officials that changing the school's name was a non-starter, said Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Jason Glass. ""Until you've heard those thousands of people yelling 'We are Columbine' together, you don't really get it,"" he said. ""The sense of pride is real."" Some of those closest to the shooting have changed their minds over the years on the best course of action. After the attack, Frank DeAngelis, then the school's principal, met with the families of those killed, students and staff about their scarred building's future. He said the majority felt demolishing it meant ""the two killers had won."" So construction crews repaired the bullet holes, replaced broken glass and covered bloodstains and burns with fresh paint and flooring before classes resumed in the fall. The library was closed off and later torn down. Its former location became an airy atrium in the school's cafeteria with a ceiling mural of an aspen tree canopy and 13 clouds — representing the dead. But after years of coping with unwanted visitors, DeAngelis, who retired in 2014, said he now supports the proposal to demolish and rebuild the school. ""I think if we would have known or projected what was going to happen, we may have had a different discussion about going back into the building,"" DeAngelis said. Retired English teacher Paula Reed said she initially balked at the idea of demolishing the building she worked in for 32 years. Her opinion shifted a few days later. ""I never loved that building,"" Reed said. ""I loved the community, my kids, my colleagues. And their needs simply matter more than my sentimentality."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-14 01:02:57, Obsession with 1999 attack could shape Columbine's future,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

City and state officials were among the mourners Sunday at the vigil at Piney Grove Baptist Church in Virginia Beach. Rabbi Israel Zoberman of Virginia Beach was among the speakers reflecting on the events of the past 48 hours. The son of Holocaust survivors who escaped Poland in World War II said the city ""lost its beautiful but also blinding innocence"" in the attack. The vigil closed with the lighting of 12 candles standing alongside a framed photograph of the victims slain by a gunman Friday. A woman read each name aloud as she lit the candles. ——— 3:20 p.m. A Virginia Beach city employee who survived a deadly shooting at a government building says he was face-to-face with the gunman during the rampage and yelled at him to stop. Account clerk Terry Inman recalls turning around and seeing DeWayne Craddock standing inside the building with a gun on Friday afternoon. Inman says he shouted at Craddock to stop. Both men worked in the city's public utilities department. Craddock turned toward Inman and looked straight at him but didn't raise the gun or make any other gesture to indicate that he actually saw Inman or anyone else. After Craddock left the room, Inman and co-worker Ned Carlstrom heard gunshots again. They think that was when their friend and co-worker, Ryan Keith Cox, was killed. Eleven other people were also killed. Craddock died in the ensuing shootout with police. ——— 12:45 p.m. The Senate's top Democrat says a universal background check bill must be brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Sen. Charles Schumer's remarks on Sunday came two days after a gunman killed 12 people in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Schumer says the victims were hardworking government employees who were ""just snuffed out."" He says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should bring the bill that would require background checks on all gun sales in the United States to the Senate floor for a vote. The House passed similar legislation in February. Officials have said the guns used in the shooting were purchased legally. Still, Schumer says the background check legislation could help prevent future shootings. ——— 12:05 p.m. Authorities in Virginia say it took 10 minutes - or less - from the time a 911 emergency call was received for police to reach the scene of a mass shooting and track down the gunman. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said at a news conference Sunday that emergency communications workers dispatched police and other responders at 4:08 p.m. Friday for a report of shots fired at a city municipal building. The first two officers arrived at the building two minutes later. Cervera said that between 4:15 p.m. and 4:18 p.m., officers had made ""contact"" with the gunman and a gunbattle ensued. Cervera emphasized that locating the gunman was not a straightforward process since the building was constructed in the early 1970s and had since undergone changes to accommodate a growing workforce. Cervera called the building ""a honeycomb"" with three floors, numerous entrances and exits, and a basement with a tunnel that connects to another building. ——— 12:15 p.m. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said DeWayne Craddock, who killed 12 people Friday in a deadly workplace shooting, died at a local hospital after he'd received first aid from police. Cervera said at a news conference Sunday that Police immediately tried to help Craddock after he was in a shootout with police in which an officer was shot. Cervera said police got Craddock out of the building and into an ambulance. He was taken to a hospital, where he died. ""Put yourself in that position, you just took numerous rounds, one of your fellow officers was just injured, was shot, you find the individual and then you immediately switch over to 'I'm going to try and save his life' because our police officers truly believe in the sanctity of life,"" Cervera said. The injured officer was saved by a bullet proof vest, police said. ——— 11:30 a.m. The suspected gunman in a Virginia Beach massacre that killed 12 had notified a superior of his intention to resign. City manager Dave Hansen said at a news conference Sunday that ""the perpetrator's performance was satisfactory"" and that he was an employee ""in good standing"" at the Virginia Beach city department where he worked. Hansen said the employee wasn't forced to resign. Hansen said in response to a reporter's question that the shooter had notified his chain of command of his intention to quit his job via email on Friday, hours before the shooting. Authorities have identified 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock as the shooter at the municipal building on Friday afternoon. He worked in the city's utilities department as an engineer. He was killed following a gun battle with police. Police Chief James Cervera said he had ""no information"" to lead to the conclusion that the suspect had targeted anyone specifically. ——— The 12 people killed in Friday's mass shooting included 11 city employees who had served Virginia Beach for more than 150 years in total.

He was killed in a gun battle with police officers. Another media briefing regarding the shooting at the municipal center is scheduled for Sunday at 10:30 a.m. Virginia Beach officials have said they will only utter Craddock's name once, employing an increasingly common public information strategy aimed at limiting mass shooters' platforms and preventing copycat shootings.

Two New Zealand courts had previously ruled that television stations, websites, newspapers and other media could only publish images which pixelated the face of Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the 28-year-old Australian white supremacist accused of the March 15 mass shooting. But High Court Judge Cameron Mander wrote in a court note that prosecutors had advised him there was no longer any need to suppress images of Tarrant's face and he was lifting the order. The previous rulings hadn't stopped images of Tarrant from circulating on the internet, and questions remained about whether the court's rulings could be applied to media operating outside of New Zealand's borders. Prosecutors and defense lawyers, who have not commented on the case publicly, did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on Thursday. Retired law professor Bill Hodge said the initial argument for suppressing images of Tarrant was likely made to ensure witnesses weren't tainted — that they could identify the gunman from their own recollection and not from seeing a picture in a newspaper. ""I can only assume that neither side is concerned about poisoning the well of identification witnesses,"" Hodge said. The gunman livestreamed much of his attack on Facebook. The chilling 17-minute video, in which he shows his face, was copied and widely viewed on the internet even as tech companies scrambled to remove it. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the accused man's name, and last month helped lead a global pledge named the ""Christchurch Call,"" aimed at boosting efforts to keep internet platforms from being used to spread hate, organize extremist groups and broadcast attacks. The White House did not endorse the pledge, citing respect for ""freedom of expression and freedom of the press."" Hodge said Ardern and other politicians might be making a nice gesture by trying to avoid giving Tarrant the publicity he's likely seeking. But Hodge said that's been somewhat undermined after police decided last month to add a terrorism charge against Tarrant to the charges of murder and attempted murder he already faced. Hodge said the terrorism charge had never been previously tested in New Zealand's court system and it could backfire by giving Tarrant a platform to broadcast his white supremacist views, since defending himself against that charge could give him more scope to express his alleged motives. A spokesperson for Ardern said the prime minister had no comment to make on a matter for the court. Tarrant is next scheduled to appear in court via videolink on June 14, when he is expected to enter pleas to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-06 02:09:28, NZ judge allows images of man charged in mosque shootings,"decisions and verdicts,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Federal investigators comb over the VA Beach crime scene The officers who confronted an alleged gunman during a mass shooting in a packed Virginia Beach municipal building helped prevent even more bloodshed. Twelve people were shot to death and four others were injured in Friday's rampage, allegedly carried out by a disgruntled employee. But officials praised the responding officers who engaged the alleged shooter, DeWayne Craddock, 40, in a ""long-term, large gunfight."" ""There is one thing that is most evident that has come about: We in Virginia Beach are a city of heroes,"" Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dwyer said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. ""We have heroes with our military. We have many members of our public that help and save lives. But most of all, let me commend the officers, the people that ran into a building with an active shooter shooting .45-caliber bullets and saved many people without doubt, question or reservation."" Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said his officers held an active shooter drill on March 30, but all the drills could never prepare them for what unfolded on Friday. ""It is the most emotional event that one can ever go through,"" Cervera said. ""While we train extensively, while we go over all our protocols extensively, once you enter an environment such as this, everything changes. Things change at a moment's notice."" Officers had to make instantaneous decisions. Police say Craddock entered Building 2 in the Municipal Center at about 4 p.m. Friday and began shooting people ""indiscriminately."" City manager Dave Hansen said Craddock, an engineer with the city for 15 years, was able to enter offices and conference rooms within the public building with a security pass. It was unclear how many people were in Building 2 when the mass shooting occurred, but officials said about 400 people work there on any given day. Once inside the four-story building, Craddock, armed with two .45-caliber pistols, went to different floors shooting anyone who came into his sight, police said. ""Once he engaged in this activity, it just continued throughout the building,"" Cervera said. Officers responded within minutes and then exchanged gunfire with Craddock, Cervera said. ""Once they identified him and he identified them, he immediately opened fire,"" the chief said of Craddock. ""We immediately returned the fire."" The gunfight, which Cervera described as a ""long-running gun battle"" -- lasted just under 30 minutes, the chief said. ""This is not what is traditionally a police-involved shooting,"" he added. ""This was a long-term, large gunfight."" One of the officers was shot, but was saved by his bullet-proof vest, officials said. Before officers shot Craddock to death, he had allegedly killed 11 city workers and a private contractor and wounded four others. The responding emergency teams were faced with a ""horrific crime scene,"" Cervera said. ""This is a large-scale crime scene,"" he said Saturday. ""It takes not only a physical but an emotional and psychological toll on everyone who spent the night in that building. ""I can't speak enough about the courage of police and forensics are showing in that building with the carnage that exists there,"" he said. ""They are performing admirably."" The responding officers handled the crime scene where their fellow city employees were killed with ""compassion,"" Cervera said. Hansen said honor guard officers from the city's police and fire departments would work as liaisons with the victims' families. ""We're going to wrap our arms around the families,"" he said Saturday. The shooting could have been worse had it not been for the officers' quick response, Cervera added. ""Officers had to make instantaneous decisions,"" the chief said of his crew.

530,https://abcnews.go.com/US/suspected-virginia-beach-gunman-resigned-personal-reasons-massacre/story?id=63449625,"DeWayne Craddock is suspected of killing 12 people at his Virginia workplace. Suspected Virginia Beach shooter used legally-bought gun suppressor The public utilities engineer who allegedly gunned down 12 people, including 11 colleagues, at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center, emailed his boss that he was resigning just hours before he committed the massacre with legally-bought pistols and a gun suppressor, officials said. Investigators said DeWayne Craddock, 40, used two .45-caliber pistols, extended ammunition magazines and a gun suppressor in the rampage. Both guns and the suppressor, according to investigators, were purchased legally by Craddock. He bought one of the pistols in 2016 and the other in 2018. It was unclear when he purchased the gun suppressor. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera told ABC News that the suppressor does not eliminate the sound of gunfire, but he could not say whether the use of the device had any impact on the death toll in Building 2 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. Two other guns seized from Craddock's home were also purchased legally, officials said. In the short resignation email, Craddock telecast nothing of the horror that was to come on Friday afternoon. ""I want to officially put in my (2) weeks' notice to vacate my position of Engineer with the City of Virginia Beach,"" Craddock wrote in the email. ""It has been a pleasure to serve the City, but due to personal reasons I must relieve my position."" Craddock did not elaborate on what his personal issues were. The name of the person to whom the email was sent was redacted by officials. The recipient of the email wrote back, telling Craddock, ""I hope you are able to resolve your personal reasons. To be clear, your last work day will be Friday, June 14, 2019."" Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said Craddock was in ""good standing"" at work and had no ongoing disciplinary issues. Hansen said Craddock's latest work evaluation showed he had a ""satisfactory"" job performance. Police investigating the massacre have yet to release a motive for what may have prompted the bloodshed. Craddock was killed after a prolonged gunfight with police. ""We continue to speak with witnesses, and others who may have information,"" a police spokesperson told ABC News on Monday. ""It is still in the early stages of such a large investigation. Additional details, if obtained, will be shared once we reach a point where it will not jeopardize the investigation.” Investigators said Craddock, who was single and lived alone, worked as a public utilities engineer in Virginia Beach for 15 years. Just after 4 p.m. on Friday, he allegedly went on the rampage. Craddock allegedly shot and killed one victim outside the Municipal Building, then entered the four-story Building 2 and continued the massacre, using his security pass to swipe his way into inner offices and conference rooms, Virginia Beach police officials told ABC News. After killing five women and seven men, including a private contractor who was there to file a permit, Craddock got into a gunfight with police that left him dead and one Virginia Beach Police officer hurt. On Sunday, police said the first 911 calls of the shooting were made at 4:06 p.m. and that two officers arrived at Building 2 in two minutes, running there from a police station across the street. Within five to 10 minutes after entering the building, at least four officers located and engaged the suspect on the second floor of the building. The suspect fired as he moved through numerous office spaces. During the gun battle, doors were closed and locked, and people who were still on that floor were sheltering in place. At one point, the gunman was shooting at officers through a closed door. Once the gunfire subsided, officers breached the door and found the suspect mortally wounded. The victims slain in the massacre  were identified as Richard Nettleton, a public utilities engineer for 24 years; Laquita C. Brown of Chesapeake, a public works right-of-way agent for 4 1/2 years; Tara Welch Gallagher of Virginia Beach, a 6-year public works engineer; Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, a public works engineer for 24 years and a right-of-way agent; Alexander Mikhail Gusev of Virginia Beach, a public works right-of-way employee for 9 years. Also killed were Katherine A. Nixon of Virginia Beach, a public utilities engineer for 10 years; Christopher Kelly Rapp, a public works employee for 11 months; Ryan Keith Cox of Virginia Beach, a public utilities worker for 12 1/2 years; Joshua O. Hardy of Virginia Beach, a 4 1/2-year public utilities engineer technician; Michelle ""Missy"" Langer of Virginia Beach, a public works administrative assistant for 12 years; and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams of Chesapeake, a public utilities special projects coordinator for 41 years. Independent contractor Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling of Virginia Beach, who was in the Municipal Center to file a permit, was also killed. Four other victims were wounded in the shooting and remained in hospitals on Monday in critical condition. A memorial service for the victims is being planned for Thursday. On Monday, hundreds of city employees returned to work for the first time since the mass shooting. They were greeted by counselors and volunteers with therapy dogs. Building 2 of the Municipal Center remained closed, and city workers congregated in the Virginia Beach Convention Center. Hansen, the city manager, spoke to the employees, encouraging them to stick together and work through the tragedy as a ""family,"" Michelle Walz, a supervisor in the city's Parks Department, told ABC affiliate WVEC-TV in Norfolk, Virginia. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-04 09:23:13, Suspected Virginia Beach shooter used legally-bought gun suppressor,"firearms,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
531,https://abcnews.go.com/US/governor-calls-special-legislative-session-gun-control-wake/story?id=63477290,"A gunman killed 12 people at a municipal building in Virginia Beach on Friday. VA governor summons lawmakers to special session on gun safety laws Saying it's time for ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,"" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called for an emergency special session of the state legislature on Tuesday to take action on gun control in the wake of a mass shooting at a government building in Virginia Beach that left 12 people dead. ""Once more hearts are broken, lives are shattered and families are crushed,"" Northam, flanked by government leaders, said during a speech in Richmond, the state's capital. ""Once more a community is in shock and pain and grief. And once more we will hear folks offer their thoughts and prayers,"" he said. ""We must do more than our thoughts and prayers. We must give Virginians action."" The governor exercised his authorities under the state constitution to call the legislature into special session to tackle the issues, saying the state cannot afford to put off the challenge of protecting its citizens from gun violence. ""There are already those who say it's too soon after the tragedy to talk about responses. I would say to those people: 'when is the right time?'"" ""I want this to be the last time,"" said Northam, a Democrat elected governor in 2018. Northam, a former U.S. Army doctor, said that a lot of the proposals he has in mind were recommended after a gunman killed 33 people at Virginia Tech University in April of 2007. The recommendations he will make now, he said, will include banning assault weapons and ammunition magazines that can hold 10 rounds or more, requiring universal background checks and limiting purchases to one gun a month. He said he would also like to see laws passed requiring people to report stolen guns within 24 hours, allowing law enforcement to seek court orders to keep guns away from people who are a clear danger to themselves and others; and permitting local governments to regulate guns in their own communities. ""None of these ideas are radical, none of them violate the Second Amendment,"" Northam said. The National Rifle Association said the governor is ""following the gun control playbook by exploiting a tragedy to push his failed political agenda."" ""The fact is none of the governor's gun control proposals would have prevented the horrible tragedy at Virginia Beach,"" Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA Institute of Legislative Action, said in a statement. ""If Gov. Northam is genuinely interested in pursuing policies that will save lives, he should focus on prosecuting violent criminals and fixing our broken mental health system, instead of blaming Virginia's law-abiding gun owners for the act of a deranged murderer."" Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun-rights organization, called the governor's demands for a special session “political theater” designed to deflect attention from ""his recent foibles"" over photos that appeared on his 1984 medical school yearbook page of an individual wearing blackface and another dress in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. Northam has denied the photos are of him and says he does not know how they ended up published on his yearbook page. Kris Brown, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, praised the governor's decision to call for a special session. ""Time and time again, members of the Virginia legislature have chosen to put profits over people, siding with the corporate gun lobby over keeping people safe from gun violence. Now, they have an opportunity to make this right,"" Brown said in a statement. ""Gov. Northam is absolutely correct when he says that gun violence in Virginia is an emergency, and now is the time for elected officials from both parties to come together and take action, not sides. And if they choose to reject this chance, Virginia voters will remember and take action of their own come November.” Northam said that following the Virginia Tech shooting, none of the gun-control measures proposed were passed by the Republican-controlled state General Assembly. ""In fact, some failed with just four votes against them in subcommittees,"" Northam said. Northam said he would also like to see a ban on gun suppressors -- like the one legally purchased and used by the gunman in the Virginia Beach massacre. On Friday afternoon, the suspect -- identified by authorities as city public utilities engineer DeWayne Craddock, 40 -- allegedly went on a shooting rampage in Building 2 of the Municipal Center in Virginia Beach. Wielding a pair of .45-caliber pistols, both legally purchased by the suspect, and a security pass to gain access to inner offices and conference rooms, Craddock gunned down 11 city workers and a private contractor before police killed him in a gunfight. Just hours before the rampage, Craddock resigned from his job in an email, citing ""personal reasons"" that he did not elaborate on. ""This weekend's tragedy must instill in us a new urgency to act,"" Northam said. ""Virginians deserve leadership and they will be watching.

Parkland deputy charged with 11 counts in connection with high school shooting A former Florida sheriff's deputy has been arrested on felony charges over his handling of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland last year. Broward County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Scot Peterson, 56, was terminated from his position and charged with multiple counts of child neglect on Tuesday after an internal investigation found that he retreated while students were under attack in the February 2018 shooting, that left 17 people dead. Internal investigators claimed Peterson “did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting,” according to a statement. He faces seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury. “We cannot fulfill our commitment to always protect the security and safety of our Broward County community without doing a thorough assessment of what went wrong that day,"" Broward County Interim Sheriff Gregory Tony said in a statement. ""The Broward Sheriff’s Office and our first responders are now better prepared and trained to respond to an active shooter crisis."" The office announced Peterson’s arrest along with the termination of BSO sergeant Brian Miller. It said both officers had ""neglected their duties"" in the deadly shooting. “They have been terminated and will no longer be privileged to serve as law enforcement deputies for the Broward Sheriff’s Office,” the statement said. ""We have enhanced our active shooter response protocol, increased our training staff, introduced essential equipment, established training partnerships with federal organizations and are building a regional training center."" Peterson's attorney vehemently denied the accusations. ""We will vigorously defend against these spurious charges that lack basis in fact and law.

534,https://abcnews.go.com/US/deputy-charged-child-neglect-parkland-high-school-shooting/story?id=63502494,"An investigation determined that Scot Peterson failed to confront the gunman. Parkland ex-deputy arrested after inaction during attack Handcuffed and wearing tan jailhouse clothes, a fired Florida deputy sheriff appeared in court Wednesday morning to face a slew of charges stemming from his alleged inaction in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Former Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson appeared for a bond hearing in Broward County Circuit Court a day after he was arrested on seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury stemming from the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting in Parkland that left 17 students and staff members dead. ""The court does find probable cause,"" Judge Jackie Powell said during the brief hearing. She set Peterson's bail at $102,000 and ordered him to surrender his passport. Peterson, 56, had been a sheriff's deputy in Broward County for more than 30 years until he was terminated from his position Thursday when the criminal complaint was filed against him. An internal probe by the Broward County Sheriff's Office found that Peterson, who was assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas as a school resource officer, “did absolutely nothing to mitigate the MSD shooting,” according to a statement released by the agency. The agency also fired Sgt. Brian Miller, saying in a statement that both he and Peterson ""neglected their duties"" by failing to confront the alleged teenage gunman, Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school, as he rampaged through a building full of freshmen at the South Florida campus. Miller was not charged criminally. Surveillance video and police radio transmissions showed that as the mass shooting was unfolding inside Building 12, Peterson remained outside for 27 minutes. ""He's guilty. He's part of this problem. He was a coward that day,"" Manuel Oliver, whose 17-year-old son, Joaquin, was killed in the massacre, said in an interview with ABC News Wednesday. ""He was there to save students, teachers. He did nothing. Now he needs to pay for his mistake and I'm glad this is happening now."" Linda Beigel, the mother of Scott Beigel, a 35-year-old teacher who lost his life in the shooting, also called Peterson a ""total coward"" in an interview Wednesday with ABC News. She said that the gunman may have never made it to the third floor of Building 12, where her son was shot to death, if Peterson, who was armed, had immediately entered the building and confronted the shooter. ""If he did, I honestly believe there was no one on the third floor who would have been killed that day,"" Beigel said. Peterson didn't say anything during Wednesday's court hearing. His attorney, Joseph A. DiRuzzo, attempted to make a motion that there was no probable cause for the felony counts against the former deputy. But Judge Powell stopped DiRuzzo, saying, ""I'm not going to entertain any motions at this moment."" DiRuzzo also requested that Peterson be allowed 72 hours to travel to his home in North Carolina to fetch his passport. Powell denied the request. In a statement released on Tuesday, DiRuzzo said the charges filed against Peterson were ""unprecedented"" and that the former deputy was being made a scapegoat. ""We will vigorously defend against these spurious charges that lack basis in fact and law,"" DiRuzzo said in his statement. ""Specifically, Mr. Peterson cannot reasonably be prosecuted because he was not a 'caregiver,' which is defined as 'a parent,' adult household member, or other person responsible for a child’s welfare.” DiRuzzo added that Peterson was not criminally negligent in his actions, as no police officer has ever been prosecuted for his or her actions in responding to an active shooter incident. ""The State’s actions appear to be nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at politically motivated retribution against Mr. Peterson, as no other individual employed at the Broward Sheriff’s Office or Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School has been criminally charged,"" DiRuzzo said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-05 11:38:46, Ex-deputy charged with child neglect in Parkland school shooting appears in court ,murders and attempted murders,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
535,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-appears-conflate-types-fbi/story?id=63542165,"The New York congresswoman pressed a top FBI official about domestic terrorism. Remembering the Victims of the San Bernardino Shooting In a video clip that has now gone viral, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressed the FBI’s top counterterrorism official over what she called ""discrepancies"" between the FBI’s handling of violent white supremacists and Muslim extremists. ""There are holes, and there are gaps here,"" the Democrat from New York told FBI Assistant Director Michael McGarrity during a House hearing on Tuesday, claiming Muslim perpetrators have been charged as ""domestic terrorists"" while white supremacists have avoided such charges. But is that true? Not exactly. She's right that federal authorities have prosecuted such cases differently – but it's not in the way Ocasio-Cortez claimed or for the reasons she seemed to imply. Any ""discrepancies"" in prosecution are largely rooted in the laws as passed by Congress, not policy decisions made inside the FBI. During Tuesday's hearing, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged, ""It could be our fault as Congress."" And, as their back-and-forth escalated, McGarrity tried to caution her: “Some of the definitions we’re using, I think we’re talking past each other.” But Ocasio-Cortez doubled-down the next day, posting to Twitter: “[T]he FBI witness tried to say I was wrong. … but then we checked. I wasn’t.” Here are the facts: At Tuesday’s hearing, Ocasio-Cortez cited what she called two ""clear"" cases of domestic terrorism: A white supremacist's 2015 attack on a historically-black church in Charleston, South Carolina, that killed nine African-Americans, and last year's anti-semitic rampage inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 Jewish worshippers dead. The congresswoman said those two cases “were only designated and charged as hate crimes, not domestic terrorism incidents.” By contrast, according to Ocasio-Cortez, the ISIS- and al Qaeda-inspired attack inside a San Bernardino, California, municipal building in 2015 and the similarly inspired massacre at Orlando’s Pulse Nightclub a year later “were designated and charged as domestic terrorist incidents.” But Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be confusing two different types of FBI cases – a mix-up that even law enforcement officials outside the FBI often make too. None of the perpetrators in those ISIS-inspired cases was designated or charged as a “domestic terrorist.” Instead, they were each designated and charged as a “homegrown violent extremist,” which may sound like a “domestic terrorist” but is actually quite different, at least to the FBI. As McGarrity told the House panel at the beginning of the more than three-hour hearing on Tuesday: “The FBI categorizes [terrorism] investigations into two main programs: international terrorism and domestic terrorism.” International terrorists include not only extremists overseas actively involved with groups designated by the U.S. government as “foreign terrorist organizations,” but also radicals inside the United States who draw inspiration from those designated groups – known as “homegrown violent extremists.” The domestic terrorist designation, meanwhile, has little to do with international terrorism. ""Domestic terrorists"" are defined as those moved to violence by what McGarrity called “domestic influences, such as racial bias and anti-government sentiment.” Though all terrorists inside the United States seek to inflict harm and create fear, “the FBI distinguishes” between those identified as “domestic terrorists” and “homegrown violent extremists,” based on what radicalized them to violence, McGarrity emphasized. The FBI is currently investigating about 850 possible domestic terrorists and tracking another 1,000 potential “homegrown violent extremists,” according to McGarrity. ""However, what causes some confusion is that 'domestic terrorism' is not an offense or a charge,"" the then-head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, explained several years ago. The fact is domestic terrorism investigations – like those into the Charleston church shooting and the Tree of Life synagogue attack – cannot produce “domestic terrorism charges,” McGarrity reiterated Tuesday. “You’re not going to find an actual charge of domestic terrorism out there,” he insisted. There are actual terrorism charges available for cases tied to international terrorist groups. The couple that launched the deadly San Bernardino attack were killed by police, but the Justice Department prosecuted a longtime friend of theirs who purchased two weapons used in the attack. He ultimately pleaded guilty to engaging in a “conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists,” as designated by the U.S. government. He has yet to be sentenced. In 2017, the wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter was indicted on charges that said she “did knowingly aid and abet [her husband’s] attempted provision and provision of ‘material support or resources’ … to a designated foreign terrorist organization.” A federal jury acquitted her of the charges. But, unlike ISIS and al Qaeda, no network of American white supremacists has been officially designated a “terrorist group” – a move that could raise significant First Amendment concerns. And Congress has not passed laws explicitly criminalizing acts of “domestic terrorism.” To bring federal charges against domestic terrorists, the FBI and Justice Department often rely on weapons-related statutes or laws tied to hate crimes. That's why the FBI ""worked"" the Charleston church shooting and Tree of Life synagogue attack ""as both a domestic terrorism case and a hate crimes case,"" McGarrity said. “We’ll use any tool in the tool kit to arrest them,” he added. If a white supremacist were tied to some group designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government, that could allow federal prosecutors to charge the white supremacist with the same offenses as an ISIS-inspired terrorist – but no such case has ever been identified. In her Twitter post on Wednesday, a day after the hearing with McGarrity, Ocasio-Cortez called the hearing ""wild."" But in saying her team ""checked"" and that she ""wasn't"" wrong, it's unclear exactly what Ocasio-Cortez believes she was right about during Tuesday's hearing. Her office did not respond to emails seeking comment for this article. Back on Twitter, she offered this conclusion: “Neo-Nazis are getting off the hook.” Indeed, at the House hearing on Tuesday, other Democrats expressed concerns beyond the FBI, particularly over how the Department of Homeland Security is now addressing white supremacy. Rep. Debbie Wasserman, D-Florida, said the Trump administration is “send[ing] a signal that you don’t care about it as much” by shifting resources “elsewhere” and reducing requests for federal to combat domestic terrorism.

538,https://abcnews.go.com/US/start-here-anti-trump-protests-planned-uk-democrats-regroup/story?id=63450678,"Here's what you need to know to start your day. Protests expected during Trump's UK visit It's Tuesday, June 4, 2019. Let's start here. 1. London welcomes Trump Massive protests are expected across London as President Donald Trump is set to meet with outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. The state visit comes at a sensitive moment for the U.K. because of Brexit, ABC News Senior Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell says on ""Start Here."" ""This isn't just about saying, 'Hey, we like you,' this is also about any future deal that Britain desperately needs at a moment when it's about to pull itself out of the European Union,"" Pannell tells us. On Monday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted the president and first lady Melania Trump for a state banquet where she toasted the ""special relationship"" between the two nations. 2. Democrats regroup Despite a flurry of calls from House Democrats for the president's impeachment, leadership is standing firm on first building a case against Trump and getting voters on board. The House Judiciary Committee is holding a series of hearings to lay out special counsel Robert Mueller's findings. Faced with resistance from the Trump administration, and Mueller himself, to appear on Capitol Hill, Democrats have called on legal experts to testify, including John Dean, Richard Nixon's former White House counsel and a star Watergate witness. ""They're going to try and make their case, to build public support, to air all of Mueller's findings,"" ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce says. ""Whether that's going to be enough to get the public on board, that's a really tall order."" 3. Motive for massacre? Authorities in Virginia Beach still are trying to determine why 12 people were gunned down in a municipal building last week. Officials on Monday released a short email written by suspected shooter DeWayne Craddock, a public utilities engineer, giving his two weeks' notice just hours before the mass shooting. It read, in part: ""It has been a pleasure to serve the City, but due to personal reasons I must relieve my position."" Craddock died after engaging police in a gun fight. It's still early in the investigation, but there's always a motive, according to John Cohen, a former acting undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security and an ABC News contributor: ""It may not be something as clear cut as some ideological cause, but people do not go out and commit mass murder without some rationale."" 4. 'Very potent message' Amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions, the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group's deployment to the Middle East last month was prompted by U.S. intelligence that indicated Iran or its proxies were planning to attack American interests in the region. ""The threats are credible, and that's why we are here,"" Adm. John Wade, commander of the carrier strike group, told reporters allowed onto the ship on Monday. ABC News Middle East Producer Matt McGarry tells ""Start Here"" he spoke to a number of sailors who are staying positive despite any potential hostilities. ""I think it's ... a very delicate game that's being played now between Washington and Tehran,"" McGarry says. ""This USS Abraham Lincoln carrier battle group is certainly a very potent message.""

Alleged NZ mosque shooter pleads not guilty The Australian man accused of killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand earlier this year has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared via video link from a maximum security prison for Friday's hearing at the Christchurch High Court in Christchurch, New Zealand. He's facing 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one terrorism charge in connection to the March 15 massacre, to which his attorney entered not guilty pleas. The courtroom was packed with dozens of survivors and family members of those who were killed. No cameras were allowed. Worshipers were gunned down inside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch and then at a nearby mosque in the suburb of Linwood. It was the deadliest terror attack in the nation's history. Much of the attack was broadcast live on Facebook. New Zealand police say Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, wrote a rambling manifesto before the shootings and emailed it to dozens of recipients, including the prime minister's office. Six days later, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ban on all military-style semi-automatic weapons, such as the ones used in the March 15 shootings. Ardern has vowed never to say Tarrant's name. Tarrant will go to trial on May 4. He will remain in custody in Auckland, New Zealand, until his next hearing on Aug. 16. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-14 06:02:46, Alleged New Zealand mosque shooter pleads not guilty,"terrorism,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Pence hits at Biden, other Dems during NRA speech President Donald Trump stated he would ""think about"" a ban on gun silencers, following news that the suspected Virginia Beach shooter used a legally-bought gun suppressor. ""I'd like to think about it. I mean nobody's talking about silencers very much. I did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned and we're looking at that. I'm going to seriously look at it. I don't love the idea of it,"" the president told Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. The gunman suspected of killing a dozen people at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center allegedly committed the massacre with legally-bought pistols and a gun suppressor, according to officials said. As Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam urges lawmakers on the state Capitol to take up a package on gun control legislation, the rhetoric around firearms has intensified after more recent mass shootings. When asked about recent gun violence, President Trump said: “What’s happening is crazy. It's crazy what's going on with schools and not only in our country.” According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 156 mass shootings in the United States in 2019. President Trump, who recently spoke at the National Rifle Association convention, defended gun rights. ""Gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger,"" the president told NRA supporters in April. The Trump administration banned bump stocks following a mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival in October 2017 that killed 58 people. That shooter used a bump stock, a device that allows a rifle automatic or semiautomatic firing capability. But in his interview with Morgan, he quickly turned the conversation to knife crimes in London. “Piers in London you have stabbings all over where everyone is being stabbed,” the president said adding that he heard London hospitals described were described as “a sea of blood all over the floor.” “It's a sea of blood. And they don't have a gun,” the president said.  When asked by Morgan what he could do to change his mindset about gun violence, the president stated, “talk about it.” “It's a very tough subject,"" he said. ""But the bad guys are not getting rid of their guns pretty much everybody agrees with that."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-05 13:02:11, Trump: Will 'seriously look' at banning gun silencers ,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Ralph Northam has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative centered on gun-related legislation RICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia's governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after last week's deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Gov. Ralph Northam announced the date Friday. The Democratic governor says the best way to respond to the May 31         mass shooting at a municipal building is with ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers."" He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on         silencers . Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can't dictate how it's conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they've said they'll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-06-07 11:56:12,Date set for session on guns after Virginia Beach shooting,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
542,https://abcnews.go.com/US/multiple-people-injured-shooter-custody-virginia-beach-police/story?id=63408118,"Four injured victims were also admitted to area hospitals. Virginia Beach shooting: What we know so far A city worker opened fire ""indiscriminately"" at the Municipal Center in Virginia Beach Friday afternoon, killing at least 12 people before he was shot dead by police in a ""long gun battle,"" police said. Eleven of the victims died on the scene and one succumbed to their injuries on the way to the hospital, Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said during a press conference Friday night. An additional four victims were in surgery at local hospitals for their injuries and ""others may have self-transported,"" Cervera said. Two law enforcement sources confirmed to ABC News that DeWayne Craddock, 40, is the alleged suspect in the shooting. Virginia Beach city manager Dave Hansen said that Craddock was an active city employee, but declined to say if he had recently been disciplined or was the subject of complaints to human resources. Police said Sunday that Craddock was not terminated for his job nor was he in the process of being terminated. Authorities are still investigating a possible motive. Three of the injured patients were at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital, with two in critical condition and one in fair condition. Another patient was at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in critical condition, according to Dale Gauding, senior communications adviser for brand engagement at Sentara Healthcare One of the injured victims is a Virginia Beach police officer who was saved by his bulletproof vest, Cervera said. The suspect, who had access to the Municipal Center as a public utilities employee, walked into the building at around 4 p.m. and began to ""indiscriminately fire upon all the victims,"" Cervera said. There were victims on all three floors of the building, and one outside, who Cervera said was shot before the suspect entered the building. The suspect had two firearms — a long gun and a handgun — law enforcement sources told ABC News. Four officers responded to the shooting and engaged in a ""long gun battle"" with the suspect, eventually shooting him, Cervera said, noting that the officers likely ""stopped the suspect from committing more carnage."" Responding officers also secured as many victims as they could, Cervera said. A .45-caliber handgun was found with multiple empty magazines following shootout, Cervera said. ""We just heard that there was an active shooter and we just barricaded ourselves in offices to make sure that we were all safe and I called 911 just to get them to come there as fast as possible,"" said Megan Banton, a Public Works employee who was on the second floor of the building. ""My boss was like, 'This is not a drill. Get down, call 911.'"" Officials are in the process of identifying the victims, Cervara said, adding that their names would be released once all of their family members were notified. ""This is the most the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" said Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam described the shooting as ""unspeakable, senseless violence."" ""My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning and will not return tonight, as well as those who have been injured in this tragedy,"" Northam said. Authorities are asking people to avoid the Municipal Center area. The scene is now secure but it is still active, Cervera said. The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and Virginia State Police are assisting in the investigation. Cervera described the shooting as a ""devastating incident"" that ""will change a lot of lives."" ""I just don't know why anyone would do something like that,"" Banton said. ""I don't know what would possess someone to come in and start shooting at people.""

545,https://abcnews.go.com/US/gunman-virginia-beach-massacre-public-utilities-engineer-security/story?id=63418480,"The gunman was killed during a long-running gunfight. Shock and sorrow sets in for grieving Virginia Beach community A longtime city employee entered a packed building of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center using his own security pass and wielding two .45-caliber guns as he went floor-to-floor ""indiscriminately"" killing 11 co-workers and a contractor before police shot him dead during a fierce gun battle, officials said on Saturday. Eleven of the five women and seven men shot to death at the Municipal Center on Friday afternoon were city employees and the gunman who allegedly committed the killing spree was also a city engineer, authorities said. The suspect, identified by police as DeWayne Craddock, 40, allegedly used two .45-caliber pistols in the rampage, Ashan Benedict, the special agent in charge of the Washington field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. He said both guns were purchased legally by Craddock, one in 2016 and the other in 2018. Ashan said two other firearms that were legally purchased by the alleged gunman were seized from his apartment. Virginia Beach city manager Dave Hansen, his voice cracking with emotion, identified the dozen people slain by the alleged gunman, whose motive for the massacre remained under investigation on Saturday. ""Sixteen hours ago the lives of 12 people were cut short by a senseless, incomprehensible act of violence,"" Hansen said at a news conference just after 8 a.m. Saturday morning. ""Overnight, our chaplains, our human services and our family assistance staff and teams completed the most difficult task anyone will ever have to do: And that is notifying the next of kin. So today, we all grieve."" The family of the suspect posted a handwritten note offering condolences to the victims onto the front door of their home in Yorktown, Virginia. “The Family of DeWayne Craddock wishes to send our heartfelt condolences to the victims,"" the note said. ""We are grieving the loss of our loved one. At this time we wish to focus on the victims and the lives loss during yesterdays tragic event.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who loss their lives, and those recovering in the hospital.” Four of the victims wounded in the rampage remained hospitalized on Saturday. Dr. Martin O'Grady, chief of the trauma department for Sentara Virginia Beach Hospital, said a total of five patients were brought to his emergency room and that one was dead on arrival while another perished soon after being brought to the hospital. O'Grady said three patients were in stable condition at his hospital, and a fourth was in the intensive care unit of another hospital. He said one patient his staff is treating suffered ""devastating"" injuries and two had ""significant"" injuries. He said two of the patients underwent surgery. A police officer, one of the first to arrive at the shooting scene, was hurt in the incident but was ""doing well"" on Saturday, said Virginia Beach police chief James Cervera, who added the officer's bullet-proof vest saved his life. Cervera identified Craddock as the gunman. He said Craddock, who lived alone, worked in the city's public utilities department for 15 years. He was killed during a gun battle with police. The police chief said it would be the ""only time we will announce his name."" ""He was still employed,"" Hansen said of Craddock, clarifying earlier reports that the suspect had been fired. ""He had a security pass like all employees have and he was authorized to enter that building."" Craddock enlisted in the Virginia National Guard in April 1996 and served for 17 years, Cotton Puryear, a spokesman for the Virginia National Guard told ABC News. Craddock had been assigned to the 1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery Regiment as a cannon crew member, but his records indicate he was never deployed overseas. Court records show Craddock had no criminal history except for a traffic violation in 2013 in Virginia Beach. Cervera declined to comment on a possible motive for the shooting, and Hansen refused to say if Craddock had recently been disciplined or was the subject of complaints to human resources. An emotional Hansen read the names of the victims, saying he worked with many of them for years. He even served in the military with one of the victims: Richard Nettleton, a public utilities engineer for 24 years. Nettleton was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army's 130th Engineer Brigade and served with Hansen in Germany. ""This morning, I had the responsibility to inform friends, co-workers and the public of those who lost their lives yesterday. All but one of the victims were employees of the City of Virginia Beach. I have worked with most of them for many years,"" Hansen said. ""We want you to know who they were so in the days and weeks to come, you will learn what they meant to all of us, to their families, their friends and their coworkers. They leave a void that we will never be able to fill."" In addition to Nettleton, the victims were identified as Laquita C. Brown of Chesapeake, a public works right-of-way agent for 4 1/2 years; Tara Welch Gallagher of Virginia Beach, a 6-year public works engineer; Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, a public works engineer for 24 years and a right-of-way agent; Alexander Mikhail Gusev of Virginia Beach, a public works right-of-way employee for 9 years. Also killed were Katherine A. Nixon of Virginia Beach, a public utilities engineer for 10 years; Christopher Kelly Rapp, a public works employee for 11 years; Ryan Keith Cox of Virginia Beach, a public utilities worker for 12 1/2 year; Joshua O. Hardy of Virginia Beach, a 4 1/2-year public utilities engineer technician; Michelle ""Missy"" Langer of Virginia Beach, a public works administrative assistant for 12 years; and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams of Chesapeake, a public utilities special projects coordinator for 41 years. Independent contractor Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling of Virginia Beach, who was in the Municipal Center to file a permit, was also killed. Cervera said investigators and forensic technicians, including 40 sent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, worked through the night to process the crime scene and remove the victims' bodies ""with dignity and respect."" ""This is a large-scale crime scene. It's a horrific crime scene and please understand it takes not only physical but an emotional and psychological toll on everyone who spent the night in that particular building,"" Cervera said. He said that while combing the building for evidence, police recovered the two weapons used in the shooting. President Donald Trump, who was immediately briefed on the shooting, said in a tweet on Saturday that he spoke with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and the mayor and vice mayor of Virginia Beach on Friday night to offer his ""condolences to that great community."" ""The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!"" Trump tweeted. The shooting erupted about 4 p.m. on Friday when Craddock allegedly gunned down one victim outside Building 2 of the Municipal Center as he entered the front door and continued the mass shooting. ""Once he engaged in this activity it just continued throughout the building,"" Chief Cervera said. Cervera said about 400 people work inside the four-story Building 2 of the Municipal Center on any given day and that the suspected gunman ""indiscriminately"" fired at and killed employees on every floor, except the basement. Cervera said it remained unclear if there were victims Craddock was specifically set out to kill. ""Whether it's an individual or not, we do have a large-scale number of victims that were killed by the suspect,"" Cervera said. Ed Wheeden, a city employee, told ABC News that he was inside the building when he heard gunshots and a fire alarm sound. He said he initially thought the shooter was a ""disgruntled citizen upset about his tax bill or water bill."" ""Never thought it would be an employee that you talk to daily,"" Wheeden said. Another city employee, Megan Banton, said she and about 20 coworkers barricaded themselves in her boss' office. She said they pushed a desk in front of the door and hugged and held each other as the rampage was going on. ""My boss basically was like, 'This is not a drill. Get down, call 911,' and that's when I called 911,"" Banton told ABC News. ""We all just ran in her office and closed the door. Basically, we just wanted to try and keep everyone safe as much as we could and staying on the phone with 911. We wanted to make sure they were coming. They couldn't come fast enough. It felt like hours."" Zand Bakhtiari, who also works in the building, said the carnage was evident immediately. ""We knew there were casualties because we saw some people getting wheeled by,"" Bakhtiari told ABC News. ""Some of them weren't even in gurneys -- one dude was just lying on the back on the trunk of a cop car and they drove him to a secure area where the ambulance was."" Asked how well the building was secured, Cervera said, ""It's an open government building. Citizens have the right to access open government buildings. Employees have a right to access their work site."" Hansen said that while there are no metal detectors, desks are stationed nearby for administrative assistants to work with the public. ""But all accesses to the inner offices and conference rooms are secured and require this [security] pass,"" he said, pointing to his own pass. ""And, as I've told you, he [the gunman] was in possession of a pass."" Cervera said officers responded to Building 2 within minutes of receiving the first 911 call. He said two police officers, identified as detective supervisors, and two K-9 units rushed to shooting scene from the police station across the street, about 100 to 150 yards away and were met by people rushing out. ""Officers had to make instantaneous decisions on how to engage the suspect,"" Cervera said. ""They did it miraculously because ... they did save other lives,"" he said. Cervera said the officers quickly tracked down the suspect and engaged in a ""running gun battle with this individual"" that lasted less than 30 minutes before officers shot the gunman to death. He said that while Virginia Beach police officers had trained for a large-scale active shooter incident on March 30, ""once you enter an environment such as this, things change in minutes."" ""You cannot replicate the intensity of an environment such as this,"" Cervera said. He said there were no words exchanged between the gunman and police during the gunfight. ""They didn't have any engagement with him verbally,"" Cervera said. ""Once they identified him and he identified them, he immediately opened fire. We immediately returned the fire and again, I want everyone to know, this was a long-term, for lack of any other term, long-running gun battle with this individual. This is not what is traditionally a police-involved shooting. This was a long-term, large gunfight."" As police investigated the shooting, members of the public joined outside the scene of the massacre Saturday and formed a prayer circle. Several vigils are being planned in churches throughout Virginia Beach.

Then, of course, come the newspaper editorials calling for stricter gun controls. Still, however rote gun tragedies may seem now, America cannot go numb. This massacre is every bit the outrage as the last. Eleven city employees and a contractor were killed on Friday afternoon by a gunman who entered a municipal building with two handguns, one of which was reportedly equipped with a noise suppressor that may have made it harder for victims to identify the gunshots.

Hardy; Michelle Langer; Richard H. Nettleton; Katherine A. Nixon; Christopher Kelly Rapp; Herbert Snelling; and Robert Williams joined the more than 200 Americans killed in mass shootings this year. Advertisement But the script doesn’t end here, and the next acts are sadly predictable. As the details emerge after a mass shooting, gun activists typically use the particularities to poke holes in proposed gun restrictions. If the weapons weren’t assault weapons, why then, that’ll be cited as evidence of the uselessness of an assault weapons ban. If the killer obtained the weapons illegally, that’ll be said to prove that gun restrictions don’t work, since criminals just buy on the black market. And if he bought the gun legally, as the Virginia gunman apparently did, you can count on hearing the argument that the shooting proves existing gun controls don’t work. Advertisement Yes, each mass shooting is different. Killers don’t all exploit the same loopholes. But the common denominator is always the same: firearms. If we want fewer mass shootings, we need fewer guns, in the hands of fewer people. There was some hope, earlier this year, that the narrative might be changing. Shortly after taking power in the House of Representatives, Democrats passed a gun-control bill. The legislation, which would mandate background checks before all gun sales and transfers, even attracted a handful of Republican votes, an encouraging sign. Then the legislation got to the Senate — and disappeared. Individual states can make a difference: Massachusetts is considering legislation that would require a detailed analysis of guns used in crimes, for instance. More states are considering red-flag laws similar to ours, which allow police to take guns temporarily from dangerous individuals. States could also ban suppressors, as a handful have done already. But guns cross state lines easily, and there’s no substitute for federal action. The time to pressure your congressperson or senator — or, if need be, find a candidate to replace them — is now. The National Rifle Association is short on cash and reeling from scandal. Meanwhile, the lives of enough Americans have been touched by mass shootings that their voices have become powerful. And relatives of the victims of “ordinary” gun violence — murders in cities, suicides in rural America — are organizing too. Advertisement Many Americans looked on in admiration when New Zealand reacted to a mass shooting by promptly enacting new gun restrictions. It seems impossible to imagine such a response here. But the only way to break the pattern in the United States is to keep pushing: At the least, the Senate should take up and vote on the House legislation. The victims in Virginia Beach were black and white, old and young. Mass killings happen at schools, workplaces, churches. And this awful story will keep repeating itself — until Americans demand a different ending.

There are reportedly at least 11 people dead, and six others injured. Elected officials across the country have begun to send out their statements on social media. There will be one side of the gun safety “debate” that will say now (and never) is the time to “politicize,” gun violence. Those people are shitheads. Here are some examples of elected officials tired of gun violence in our country. I had planned on putting their statements for action along side other elected officials thinking and praying the paychecks they get from groups like the NRA. But their words are useless, and right now they are hiding out—afraid of the blowback they will get the moment they stick their impotent heads outside to offer up faux empathy. IÃ¢ÂÂm heartsick and praying for the victims and their loved ones. Eleven people should not have been murdered today. How many lives will it take before Congress acts to end this crisis? https://t.co/SU3oBQRol1  Jane and I are grieving for the victims in Virginia Beach and their families.The days of the NRA controlling Congress and writing our gun laws must end.

IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry that our friends, coworkers, neighbors and colleagues continue to be gunned down across America. IÃ¢ÂÂm so angry that the Senate refuses to act to save lives.  Another horrific shooting shocks the nation, this time in Virginia Beach. We grieve with those impacted even as we await more information. Already, this much is clear: it is unacceptable for America to remain the only developed country where this is routine. We must act. It truly is unacceptable.  Heartbroken for the victims and their families of the Virginia Beach shooting and grateful for the first responders on the scene. This senseless act of violence should not be normal.

549,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1862260,"For the better part of two decades, Americans have generally ignored their quietly mounting problem of homegrown domestic terrorism committed by white far-right extremists: Both the numbers and the history demonstrate that, both officially and in the media, we have underinvested in monitoring and confronting such terrorism and the forces that fuel it. Indeed, domestic terrorism is not even a prosecutable federal crime. Now that inattention is coming home to roost as the rising tide of white nationalism is threatening to swamp us with a fresh wave of domestic terrorism committed by “red-pilled” young men brimming with anger and extremism—and two recent cases suggest how poorly prepared we are to handle it in the realm of law enforcement and the courts. The arrest in the first case—out of Monroe, Washington, and the Snohomish County court system—occurred in December, when 20-year-old Dakota Reed’s violent Facebook posts under the nom de plume Rudolf Höss, taken from the commandant of Auschwitz, finally attracted police attention: “I’m shooting for 30 Jews,” he posted on Nov. 11. “No pun needed. Long ways away anyways. See you Goys.” He was freed on $50,000 bond, yet only four months later, he was booked into jail again after police found even more Facebook posts threatening mayhem and death. “Y’all mind if I go in to a random courthouse in the movie Narnia and take my M32 grenade launcher?” he asked his readers. He also posted a meme featuring the character of Yoda from Star Wars that read, “Coming for my guns, the police is. Booby trapped with explosives, my front door has been.” This time, the judge set bail at $500,000, and he has been sitting in jail since, having pleaded guilty in May to the charges. He faces sentencing on Tuesday. The problem is that, with no state or federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors wound up having to simply charge Reed with two counts of making threats to bomb or injure property—the standard sentence for which is only six to 12 months. Prosecutors indicated they intend to ask for the maximum of a year. Meanwhile, in Utah, a 27-year-old man named Christopher Cleary who spouted “incel” rhetoric and was arrested in January for threatening to carry out a mass shooting, “killing as many girls as I see,” appeared likely to see no further jail time at all, after he worked out a plea bargain with prosecutors according to which he would plead guilty to attempted threat of terrorism and receive probation as punishment. Detectives said they found no evidence he was a participant in the incel movement, consisting of men who say they are “involuntarily celibate” and feel entitled to retribution against women for this unwanted state. However, the judge in his case, Christine Johnson, rejected the plea deal and instead sentenced Cleary to five years in prison. Prosecutors later said the deal was only tendered in order to obtain Cleary’s guilty plea. The prosecutors declined to explained why Reed was not charged with a hate crime. Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, was dismayed by the inability of law enforcement to handle cases such as Dakota Reed’s more appropriately. “There’s no way that if someone was connected to Islamic extremism they would be handled this way,” Beirich told Daily Kos. “We have two totally separate terrorism regimes legally right now—one for white supremacists and one for Islamic extremists. And the latter is much more punishing and larded with legal tools that just don’t exist domestically. Some of the sentences for domestic terrorists are ridiculously light in comparison to the others.” The wildly inconsistent outcomes in these cases underscore the difficulties faced by law enforcement when dealing with the new wave of terrorism committed by perpetrators who have been radicalized online by conspiracy theories, rather than by traditional terrorists recruited by organizations and acting out their specific agendas. Authorities often overlook the very real terrorism of the new wave because the actors lack specific organizational ties—which in fact is the whole purpose of the “lone wolf” terrorism strategy adopted by white nationalists in the late 1980s. ""The weaponization of social media yields an opportunity for authorities to interdict, deter and meaningfully punish online terroristic threats, but frequently that opportunity is scuttled,"" noted Brian Levin of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. ""In an era where online rants have been precursors to violence,” he added, “one has to consider that slaps on the wrist arguably diminish the intended deterrent effect not only on the defendant, but others who share similar antipathy."" “All I wanted to be was loved,” Christopher Cleary had written in the long Facebook post that resulted in his arrest. “Yet no one cares about me, I’m 27 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend before and I’m still a virgin, this is why I’m planning on shooting up a public place soon and being the next mass shooter cause I’m ready to die.” Dakota Reed told detectives that his posts were “fictional” and he was just “venting.” However, it was clear that not only did he fantasize about killing people, but he also had the actual capability to do so: On Facebook, according to court papers, he shared pictures of himself with three AR-15-style weapons, two hunting-style rifles, an AK-47-style rifle, a pump shotgun, and at least one pistol. He gave Nazi salutes while posing with the guns in a room full of white supremacist materials. Reed’s posts professed a belief in a “Northwest Front,” a racist dream of a white nation-state in the Pacific Northwest. He shared a picture of a certificate saying he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\ “I’m over here saving up to buy more guns and ammo to kill (((rats))) and animals,” read one of Reed’s posts, from Oct. 25. In dark corners of the internet, an “(((echo)))” symbol is an anti-Semitic code to identify people with Jewish backgrounds or ties. Many other writings suggested an obsession with killing Jews. “Six years until recleamtion (sic) day in the synogauge (sic),” read one post. A day later, he wrote, “Tom stopped into the synogauge never to return.” Tom was one of his alleged pseudonyms. “Gonna make the news some more and shoot some Jews in 2025,” he posted on Nov. 24. He wrote in early December about his parents asking why he owned military-style guns. “To kill people,” he answered, according to his post. “Why else would I own them?” At his court hearing last month, Reed smirked and waved at reporters. “It’s always a challenge interpreting intent through the ‘everything-is-a-meme’ nature of his posts,” explained an FBI agent when he alerted prosecutors about Reed’s more recent posts. “But hearing the New Zealand shooter say ‘subscribe to pewdiepie’ in his video and write ‘remove kebab’ on his rifle have only reinforced how these Internet subcultures and vernacular can carry all the way into real life actions.” ",2019-06-03 11:00:10,"Law enforcement, courts are grappling with the new wave of domestic terrorists radicalized online",,115,http://www.dailykos.com

Ralph Northam announced he’s calling the legislature back for a special session on guns this summer. Northam is urging Republicans, who narrowly control the Virginia legislature, to take up bills on universal background checks, limiting the number of handguns people can buy in a short time period, banning silencers and high capacity magazines, allowing local governments more ability to limit guns in city buildings, and allowing authorities to temporarily seize guns from people who present an active threat. To this point, Virginia Republicans have responded to Northam’s gun reform proposals about how you’d expect from Republicans, but now they’re showing some willingness to at least pretend to discuss the issue. Republican Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment has said that a ban on high capacity magazines might be up for debate. Northam can’t force Republicans to do anything, of course, but he’s signaling that he plans to try to build public pressure on the issue—and that he might take some executive action bypassing the legislature if the legislature doesn’t take action.

551,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1864086,"Colorado Democratic Rep. Tom Sullivan has been making waves since he took to the streets in protests after his son, Alex, was killed in a mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. Rep. Sullivan ran on a platform of sensible gun laws and won. He, along with a blue wave of liberal legislators, came into Colorado’s House and proceeded to pass a bunch of laws the people of Colorado asked for. One of those was a red flag law that allows law enforcement to temporarily take away someone’s guns, pending an evaluation, if there is evidence that they may do harm to themselves or others. The red flag laws have been deemed “controversial” by mostly right-wing Second Amendment types the and media has adopted that label, in many cases unconsciously giving credence the overly simplified conservative pro-gun position. Colorado Republicans, not in the majority anymore, did what they do best: attack democracy. The GOP started the process of calling for a recall of Rep. Sullivan, with Colorado GOP vice chair Kristi Burton Brown saying, “Rep. Tom Sullivan needs to be recalled because, like the rest of the Democrats in the legislature this session, he did not represent the families of Colorado.” Early Tuesday morning, the Denver Post published an article explaining that the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners gun rights group didn’t feel “confident” they and their invisible support network would be able to get the required 10,035 valid signatures needed in time to set off a recall. So sad, bye bye, talk later. Just a couple of hours later, in a Facebook post, Burton Brown pretended that her forked tail was not between her legs as she explained that the GOP and their gun rights activists would be turning away from trying to have democratically elected Rep. Sullivan recalled, in order to focus on “essential efforts.” Brown attempted to blame the big L on her forehead on “outside” money pouring in to defend Sullivan. I guess that money stopped people from signing? But over the past couple of weeks, the Colorado Republican establishment has been exposing itself, with members saying truly distasteful and abhorrent things, including accusing Rep. Sullivan of “politicizing” his son’s death. Maybe, when people saw it in that light, they didn’t want to support the unpopular, and therefore anti-democratic, recall attempt. I guess all of those Colorado families didn’t want to sign your petitions. Maybe it’s hard to hold the pens when they are soaked in children's blood? It’s also fun to watch Republicans admonish everyone for wanting to consider impeaching a sitting president who has clearly broken the law, while pretending that trying to recall a representative who enacts, along with dozens of others, a gun safety law is some kind totalitarian movement into anarchy.

Assume that South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg does not want to see young black men killed by police officers. Nor does he want the crime rate in South Bend to be high. He would like to see a world where African-American residents and South Bend police work together to make communities safer. In mid-June, white South Bend Police sergeant Ryan O’Neill shot Eric Jack Logan, a 54-year-old black man, and killed him. Logan allegedly approached the officer with a knife; O’Neill shot Logan, who was taken to a hospital and soon after was pronounced dead. O’Neill was treated for minor injuries. O’Neill’s body camera was not running during the encounter and O’Neill failed to turn it on at any point. A week later, Buttigieg sat alongside the city’s police chief at a town hall event. The crowd “repeatedly shouted him down” and the mayor was “met with profanities and heckles.” “You are lying,” one attendee shouted at Buttigieg. “We don’t trust you,” said another. After the meeting broke up, a visibly emotional Buttigieg told reporters that it was difficult to see “people I’ve known for years anguished,” angry at the city and at him, adding, “and I’m angry, too.” “Right now, I’m not really thinking about the politics of it,” Buttigieg said. “I hope people can see what it’s like for a city to face up to the demons that racism has unleashed.” Meanwhile, the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police issued their own blistering reaction, declaring that Buttigieg’s focus during this incident “solely for his political gain and not for the health of the city he serves.” Mayor Buttigieg has in no way unified the community. Mayor Buttigieg continues to only focus on one incident and one family. Buttigieg has yet to comment on the largest mass shooting in the recent history of South Bend or on one juvenile killing another earlier in the week. Buttigieg’s focus on one family has left several others ostracized. He has not spoken to the families involved with the Kelly’s Pub shooting, the South Bend Police Family or the family of Sgt. O’Neill, all of whom are suffering greatly. The reaction to Buttigieg outside of South Bend has been scathing. David Axelrod declares Buttigieg offered “answers were delivered in a factual, almost clinical, manner, more in keeping with his prior life as an analyst for McKinsey & Co. than the ministerial role called for by an episode in which a life was lost.” Everyone on The View ripped him. New York Magazine asks how badly he’s bungled the response to the shooting. and a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist argues that Buttigieg is proving himself an empty suit, coasting on image and evading scrutiny of his record, driven by “media coverage that lavished praise on Buttigieg while largely ignoring his strained relationship with people of color — particularly when it comes to policing.” We are constantly reminded that Buttigieg has the golden résumé: Harvard, Oxford, McKinsey. And yet for all of his brains and accolades, Buttigieg is stumbling because governing in situations like this is difficult and requires telling people things they probably don’t want to hear. The South Bend police probably don’t want to hear that the disabled body cam sounds extraordinarily suspicious, and that the African-American community’s distrust of the police didn’t emerge out of thin air. South Bend African Americans may not want to hear that if Logan came at a police officer with a knife, then Sergeant O’Neill had the right to defend himself with deadly force. And it is probably impossible to successfully manage a crisis like this and run for president at the same time. But keep in mind, a racially charged police shooting is probably one of the milder or more routine crises a city can face. It’s not New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Los Angeles after the Rodney King riots, New York City after 9/11, or the sunken Deepwater Horizon platform dumping oil across the Gulf Coast and threatening to wreck entire industries. It’s not an earthquake, tornado, or deep recession. And as bad as it is, a racially charged police shooting isn’t nearly as difficult as the problems the president is likely to face in January 2021: North Korea, Iran, the return of trillion-dollar deficits, the debt stretching past $22 trillion, hostile states developing artificial intelligence, robotic submarines, hypersonic missiles, etc. Governing is hard and being a successful president is extremely difficult.

554,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1861685," Fox News host Laura Ingraham is drawing new scrutiny after yet another embarrassing, overtly racist segment. Ingraham’s show caps off the prime time Fox News nightly lineup, appearing after both Tucker Carlson Tonight, which has a long history of promoting white nationalist talking points, specifically around immigration, something he has in common with Ingraham; and Hannity, featuring Donald Trump’s chief propagandist, Sean Hannity. Of course, Hannity is so embedded with Trump that in 2016, he loaned out his private jet to fly Newt Gingrich to meet with Trump for a VP audition, and he reportedly speaks to Donald Trump on the phone every single night, in addition to his highly inappropriate appearances at Trump rallies, including stepping up to the podium, at the behest of Trump himself, to greet the MAGA crowds. But I digress. Back to Ingraham, who is once again embarrassing the network and likely angering the few advertisers she has left in a segment in which she defended the so-called voices of conservatism who she claims have been silenced because they’ve been banned from various social media sites. After years of looking the other way, Facebook finally banned Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen in March after determining that they had violated its community standards, specifically its rules forbidding ""dangerous individuals and organizations.""  Alex Jones. Finally banned from Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter after years of spreading conspiracy theories and outright lies. Many of these conspiracies and lies provoked his followers to harass people such as the parents of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer who was murdered in Washington, D.C., in what police said was a robbery. But what finally got him banned from YouTube was promoting a conspiracy theory that the Christchurch mass shooting, in which 51 people were murdered at a suburban mosque, was a “false flag” operation meant to discredit anti-Muslim conservatives like himself. Milo Yiannopoulos. Banned after publicly bombarding comedian Leslie Jones in a string of racist attacks and targeted harassment on Twitter. Since being banned on multiple social media platforms, Yiannopoulos has used whatever online presence he has left to tell his followers to get ready for a violent civil war. Laura Loomer. Banned from Twitter after targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar in a string of hateful attacks. She’s since turned up at Nancy Pelosi’s home in California, where she trespassed; handcuffed herself to one of the doors to Twitter’s offices; and carried out numerous other failed, embarrassing stunts. Candace Owens. She flamed out after making public remarks in defense of Adolf Hitler. Seriously. .@RepTedLieu plays recording of Candace Owens: ""I don't know Ms. Owens. I'm not going to characterize her. I'm going to let her own words do the talking. So, I'm going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler."" pic.twitter.com/xiilLBUIwF Michelle Malkin. Still up and running on social media, despite several suspensions for violating community standards. In other words, not silenced. Dan Scavino. Donald Trump’s former caddy, now his director of social media. Clearly not banned. In fact, he and Trump have flourished on social media, despite their hateful content and despite violations of community standards, such as prohibitions against targeted harassment. James Woods. Washed-up actor turned conservative big mouth. He was suspended from Twitter, not banned, in early May after the Mueller report was released, and he used the hashtag #HangThemAll in reference to the investigators and others involved in the Russia investigation. Paul Nehlen. Last, but not least, Nehlen is an avowed white supremacist who featured a “pro-white” platform in a failed run for Paul Ryan’s congressional seat in Wisconsin. I’m not going to share the actual racist image that got him banned, but it targeted Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Fox News has struggled to attract new advertisers to Ingraham’s show after losing a significant number of them in the last year, largely due to her attacks on Parkland shooting survivors and after she compared child immigration detention centers, where six children have died, to “summer camps.” Sadly, her viewership has actually increased, even as she loses sponsors over her racist and hateful content. The reality is that social media platforms can ban these people for their hateful, racist, harassing content, but until Fox News is sold to a new owner or its current executives move on, and this type of content is driven off the air, Ingraham and others like her still have the largest hate platform available. As it is now, Fox News is essentially acting as a for-profit Republican super PAC, completely aligned with the Republican Party. It’s the reason Elizabeth Warren is refusing to do a town hall on Fox News. During an appearance on ABC’s The View, Meghan McCain chastised Warren for that refusal, and Warren calmly explained to the entitled McCain that she would not help Fox News bolster its ratings with the huge audience Warren would bring, thereby enriching the very people at Fox News who create and promote hateful content. It’s worth a minute to listen to Warren explain her stance. ""IÃ¢ÂÂm just not going to help the Fox News executives raise money off my name.Ã¢ÂÂSen. @ewarren on why she declined an invitation for a Fox News town hall: Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂll go anywhere in the country Ã¢ÂÂ I want to talk to people Ã¢ÂÂ and find as many ways as I can."" https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/umTsirRMSr Oh, Meghan McCain. It’s always about you, isn’t it? Somehow, even Warren not going on Fox News is twisted to be all about McCain, who claims she isn’t racist and she used to work for Fox News and therefore Fox News can’t be racist. Never mind that she’s wrong on all accounts. And Warren is right: She’s not depriving Fox News viewers of access to her views. Fox News can show up and cover every single of one of the dozens of town halls Elizabeth Warren is doing nationwide each month. Warren is not going to give Fox News a solid hour of ratings gold and help increase its profitability. It. Makes. Sense. The bottom line is this: This country will never again be truly united as long as Fox News operates the way it has for the last 20 years, fomenting and promoting division, hatred, and racism. It’s been profitable for the network thus far; but when will Americans say enough is enough and demand that Fox News get out of the business of hate and into the business of actual news? How many advertisers need to flee? All of them.

As far as anniversaries go, D-Day is a pretty huge one. But it’s an especially big deal in the small town of Bedford, Virginia, which is home to the National D-Day Memorial. Why Bedford, you ask? Because this small town, now home to fewer than 7,000, lost the most residents per capita on the beaches of Normandy. In 1944, Bedford’s population was about 3,200, and over 30 young men from the town were in D-Day infantry companies. By D-Day’s end, 19 of the “Bedford boys” were dead, and because of the town’s size, this meant that, proportionally, this community suffered the nation’s severest losses on June 6. Over 50 years later, the town finally got a memorial honoring those and the thousands of other Americans who died that day. It’s quite something, actually. Worth a visit. It’s just a bit to the east of Roanoke and a pretty good haul from basically anywhere else. And while we’re talking about Virginia … Guns vs. But … er ...: Tragically, war zones aren’t the only places where people die from gunfire. But a lot can happen in a special session, so we’ll just have to see. History Lesson: Waaaaaaaaay back when, I wrote in this space (okay, more than once) about how Michigan Republicans, who were thoroughly put out that citizens had the temerity to not only place proposed new laws that GOP lawmakers wouldn’t pass in a bajillion years before voters as ballot measures, but to also actually get them passed into law, decided to make that process quite a lot more difficult. Drip Drip Drip-Day: Speaking of Michigan, you may remember one GOP state Rep. Larry Inman, who got indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of bribery, extortion, and lying to the FBI for trying to sell his vote last year on a contentious bill to repeal the state’s prevailing wage law. By the by, the repeal narrowly succeeded, with Inman on the winning side of the 56-53 vote. Fun fact! A two-thirds supermajority vote of the chamber is required to expel a sitting member. GTFO of the Speakership, cont.: Yes, I know I’ve covered this before, but we all crave closure, don't we? And I think this is the final chapter in this ridiculous story. Wow, that’s terrible, you’re thinking. But wasn’t there more? Oh yes. Also, can we toast that ""former acquaintance” with the texts that set all this in motion? Happy birthday to that guy, whenever it is. Welp, that’s all for this week. You should probably be out honoring war heroes or something. Or preparing for Pride. Either way, you should definitely knock off early and take a day tomorrow. Just print this out and show it to your boss, I’m sure she won’t mind.",2019-06-06 19:33:33,This Week in Statehouse Action: D-Daze edition,"politics and government,nazi policies toward jews and minorities,world war ii (1939-45),monuments and memorials",115,http://www.dailykos.com
556,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1863781,"A consensus has been quietly building among journalists that it is time to stop giving mass killers the unthinking free publicity woven into their motivations for their heinous crimes—and according to the Poynter Institute’s Kelly McBride, it’s beginning to actually take root in media behavior. At the same time, a Washington Post piece this weekend—an important piece, in fact, exploring the dark world of “incels” and an attempted mass murder in Florida—demonstrated how difficult this will be, and why it will never be practical to make omitting the killer’s name altogether an ironclad rule. It seems as though March’s horrifying massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, congealed professional journalistic opinion behind Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s firm commitment not to use the name of the killer in public, and her urging that media companies do the same—and, in fact, most large media operations complied. And afterwards, in the aftermath of shootings in Poway, California, and Virginia Beach, Virginia, they have largely continued. As McBride explains, “It’s become clear to researchers that mass shootings bear an element of contagion. Some shooters are trying to set records; they are out for notoriety. Others simply see mass violence as a solution to their problems. Either way, keeping their names out of the headlines may be a key step toward not inspiring others.” The change, as the piece explains, has been building for some time, and gaining slow consensus among journalists. It’s worth noting that relatively few Americans know or can recall the name of the perpetrator of the Oct. 1, 2017, massacre in Las Vegas—an indicator of this building shift in the professional ethos. Generally speaking, this change is a very good development, because it will remove an incentive to would-be mass shooters that we know exists—though at the same time, the change is unlikely to do anything concrete to change the dynamic that is creating these killers in the first place. That, in fact, was the subject of “He Hated Women. Then He Decided to Kill Them,” the Washington Post piece exploring the twisted shooting rampage of a man whose name—Scott Paul Beirele—dominates the story. He’s the “incel”—“involuntary celibate,” a member of the twisted misogynist cult closely related to white nationalism—who walked into a yoga studio in February and killed two women and injured five more. As we’ve been reporting, Beierle is just one of a growing flood of young white men, “red-pilled” and angry and unhinged, who have been radicalized online and are causing tremendous damage. When authorities, both in the U.S. and abroad, have talked about online radicalization in the recent past, most of us have tended to think of it in terms of radical Islamists from groups such as the Islamic State, who have been known to leverage the technology to their advantage, particularly social media. A study by terrorism expert J.M. Berger published in 2016 found that white nationalists were far outstripping their Islamist counterparts, however: ""On Twitter, ISIS’s preferred social platform, American white nationalist movements have seen their followers grow by more than 600 percent since 2012. Today, they outperform ISIS in nearly every social metric, from follower counts to tweets per day."" “Online radicalization seems to be speeding up, with young men, particularly white men, diving into extremist ideologies quicker and quicker,"" Berger said, adding that ""the result seems to be more violence, as these examples indicate. It is a serious problem and we don’t seem to have any real solutions for it. These cases also show that an era of violence brought on by the internet is indeed upon us, with no end in sight.” The radicalization process itself often begins with seemingly benign activity, such as spending hours in chat rooms or playing computer games, and these activities provide a kind of cover for the process as it accelerates. This was the subject of the Post article, which laid out the gradual process by which this young man was radicalized. It would not have been possible to explore the details of this process without using his name. It was also an utterly invaluable and perceptive piece of journalism, the kind we actually need more of if we’re going to grapple successfully with this phenomenon. That’s not to say the piece lacked problems—the largest of which is that it lacked any real reportage on the victims, who they were, and what their stories were. Because eventually, this is a phenomenon that will touch all our lives, if it hasn’t already, and ensuring that the victims don’t become mere anonymous statistics is critical to overcoming the narrative that the mass killers hope to impose on us. McBride’s article is also unhelpful in its suggestion near the end that perhaps we no longer need this kind of work (“it is no longer easy to believe that any in-depth reporting will explain the motives behind a mass shooting”). In fact, as both the Post piece and a similarly themed New York Times piece about YouTube’s role in this radicalization process made brilliantly clear over the weekend, what we’re seeing right now, in June 2019, is the massification of a relatively new phenomenon, with massive consequences for all of us. It’s both familiar and entirely new at the same time, and the need to understand it in order to grapple with it is paramount. The need not to glorify these perpetrators should not prevent us from finding ways to short-circuit the cultural and social forces that are creating them—especially when the tide of lethal violence is steadily rising. Certainly a post hoc action such as refusing to name the perpetrators will do relatively little to actually prevent the creep of white nationalist online radicalization that is the primary fuel for this phenomenon. Stories that explore how the perpetrators got there, and expose the machinations of the movements recruiting these young men into their insane belief systems, will do a lot more for us than any rule governing how or when we name them. It might be best if journalists focused on that.

557,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1864324,"Wednesday, June 12, marks three years since the mass shooting that stole the lives of dozens at Pulse, a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. It’s been three years, but for many of the survivors, the pain remains overwhelming. “We clam up and we close up because we have no one to talk to who understands,” said Sylvia Serrano. She said she hid in a club bathroom for her life. “People think, ‘You didn’t get shot so you’re OK.’ But I saw my best friend die.” In additional to Serrano’s friend, 48 other people were killed. She said that adding to this tragedy is that the shooting targeted an already vulnerable population. “LGBTQ adults are more than twice as likely to experience a mental health condition and are at greater risk for suicidal thoughts,” the Tampa Bay Times reports. “The general population doesn’t always understand how the shooting was a terrorist attack on people already at risk.” Survivors and their advocates continue to be triggered by shootings that have occurred throughout the nation in the three years since Pulse. The Tampa Bay Times article notes, “And then there’s this fact: Florida perennially ranks among the worst states in the country for mental health services and funding. Later this year, a key federal grant that has helped hundreds affected by the Pulse shooting will expire.” Three years later, Republicans in Congress continue to block any legislation to address gun violence and gun safety. Following the Pulse shooting, nearly 200 House Democrats led a sit-in to demand action on gun reform legislation, something that would not happen until they retook the House after the 2018 midterms. Legislation passed by the House is now being blocked by Republican Mitch McConnell in the Senate. Survivor Orlando Torres still needs help. Like Serrano, he hid for his life in a bathroom during the shooting. Now, terrified of using a shared restroom, he’s unable to work an office job. He works as a Lyft and Uber driver, but it’s not something that allows him to access therapy, which he again wants to do. “I just need something to correct me or put me in a straight line or put my mind or heart at ease,” he says.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and California Rep. Eric Swalwell have made gun control a central theme of their campaigns.  New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has made fighting gun violence a priority since he was elected as mayor of Newark in 2006. He is proposing a 14-part plan which includes: California Sen. Kamala Harris spent years in law enforcement before becoming a senator, first working as a prosecutor before becoming California’s attorney general. She is a proposing executive orders if Congress fails to act that would mandate: California Rep. Eric Swalwell has made gun control the central issue of his presidential campaign.  Swalwell is the son of a police officer and a criminal prosecutor.  His plan includes: Other candidates who have elaborated on their policy positions on gun control include: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has a series of gun proposals including implementing “red flag” laws that allow for the temporary removal of guns from people police or family members deem to be a threat to themselves or others. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro would block teachers from being armed in schools as part of his education reform plan. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has called for banning people on the terror watchlist from buying guns. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has rolled out a set of gun control proposals, including raising the minimum age for purchasing a gun to 21. Author and activist Marianne Williamson is proposing restrictions on gun ownership for people with documented mental health issues, laws restricting children from accessing guns including mandating child safety locks and allowing the CDC research on gun violence. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has proposed a tiered licensing system that would create varying levels of restrictions on guns based on their lethality.  View the discussion thread.

559,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1862119,"Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's primary Sunday show job was to patch up the damage done by revelations that Trump's team requested the navy move the warship USS John McCain so that Trump's hostility towards a dead veteran would not derail a Memorial Day speech to service members the White House still has to feign a bare minimum of respect towards. But he was also asked about the latest mass shooting, because on any given Sunday there is always going to be at least one new mass shooting to talk about. On Friday, 12 were killed in a Virginia Beach government building. Ex-House Republican Mick was not shy in trotting out the hoariest of House Republican concerns: That it is much too soon to talk about this. ""The mourning period hasn't even stopped yet, let alone the healing process,"" he added. ""So, let's not get too deep into politics too soon. Let's think about the families."" You can, in fact, fairly see the deep concern for the families oozing off the man and sliding down onto the studio floor. “You have laws on the books that make murder illegal, yet they still do it. Laws are not going to fix everything."" You could replace Mick Mulvaney with a Speak 'n Spell and it wouldn’t have made much difference. At this point Republicans would do just as well with an enormous spinning wheel, game-show styled, containing each of the phrases that are pulled forth to respond to each and every mass shooting. From you can't protect everybody to criminals are still going to get guns to it's not time to talk about this yet, the ol' Thoughts and Prayers Wheel spins and spins and spins. It must be said, though, that Mick Mulvaney's view of what this country should be is very peculiar, and seems to be quite different from what past visionaries professed to have in mind for us. In Muvaney's America it should ""surprise nobody"" if the military is asked to move ships around so that the sitting commander does not have an inopportune bout of the fee-fees; when it comes to the common rabble, however, even the hope of not getting murdered in your workplace is something the government cannot offer much concrete help with. If only Mulvaney and his fellow Republican functionaries spent as much time thinking about “the families” as they did attempting to put bubble wrap around anything in the would-be president’s path. Or half as much. Or, in fact, even a solid and uninterrupted forty minutes.",2019-06-02 15:00:10,"White House chief of staff: Sorry, 'too soon' to talk about gun violence.

A Silicon Valley reckoning is forcing tech companies like Facebook and Google to rectify some of the incalculable mistakes they made as they built up the internet. Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. “Reckoning” is an old English word with many different meanings. It’s the action or process of calculating; it’s a person’s view or opinion; and it’s a bill come due, with one of the synonyms for that definition being the arrival of retribution. It means, more precisely, “the avenging or punishing of past mistakes or misdeeds.” Reckoning, in all these forms, has had a modern revival this year. No word better captures the state of mind for those in Big Tech, and more specifically Silicon Valley. Let me break it down even more simply: Karma’s a bitch. And that is the unfortunate situation that Silicon Valley — most especially its big players like Facebook and Google — has gotten itself into as it seeks to rectify some of the incalculable mistakes made in building up the internet, arguably the greatest communications system in the history of the world. This will be a focus at Code Conference 2019 as we interview our speakers, including YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, Fair Fight founder Stacey Abrams, and Twitter executives Kayvon Beykpour and Vijaya Gadde. As it turns out, the billions of people who jack into the internet via all manner of new and innovative devices provided by digital masterminds have not been quite ready to deal with the immense power tech companies have handed them. While the idea of a complex mesh of humanity sharing everything and cooperating across global boundaries seamlessly is a dreamy ideal, the actual block and tackle of it has not been quite as smooth. It has turned toxic in ways that should have been anticipated but were not. In fact, the magical tools created to give everyone a voice are working just as they were created, which is the problem. Every day, it seems there is a fresh hell to deal with online. Disinformation. Hate speech. Deep fakes. Online radicalization. Addiction. Depression. And, worst of all, murderous intent that leaps off the screen and into real life. It was the New Zealand attack on a peaceful Muslim congregation earlier this year that encapsulated it all for me. A rage-filled man, who got further enraged by the other discontenteds on a dark warren of sites, used all the online tools at his disposal to complete his vile mission. As Kevin Roose wrote in the New York Times in a post perfectly titled, “A Mass Murder of, and for, the Internet”: “The details that have emerged about the Christchurch shooting — at least 49 were killed in an attack on two mosques — are horrifying. But a surprising thing about it is how unmistakably online the violence was, and how aware the shooter on the videostream appears to have been about how his act would be viewed and interpreted by distinct internet subcultures. “In some ways, it felt like a first — an internet-native mass shooting, conceived and produced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism. “The attack was teased on Twitter, announced on the online message board 8chan and broadcast live on Facebook. The footage was then replayed endlessly on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit, as the platforms scrambled to take down the clips nearly as fast as new copies popped up to replace them.” It’s the term “internet-native” that stood out the most for me. Because while this kind of hate has indeed littered the annals of human history since its beginnings, technology has amplified it in a way that has been truly destructive. This amplified hate seeps from one platform to another, so that no one company or executive can control it or be truly responsible for it. A homophobic video on YouTube becomes scary tweets on Twitter becomes threatening texts on iPhones and so on and so on. When I started to point out all these trends about two years ago, especially when I used the term weaponization to describe what I thought was happening, many in the tech industry accused me of being unduly negative, of playing a needless blame game for a problem that was not their fault. One social media executive used the metaphor of a bank robbery: “There is a getaway car, but you can’t blame the automobile itself for the crime.” Indeed not, but I countered that he had gotten it wrong on the role tech was playing. Rather than the car, I said, tech was the gun. And questions about how that gun was made and distributed — was it made more deadly or less, were there proper safety mechanisms built in, were its creators fully aware of its awesome power to destroy — were what mattered. And, of course, there was the key question of how it was regulated. But instead of the Second Amendment protecting it, the internet sector is trying to use the First Amendment as its shield, initially making the questionable case that it can do anything it wants because its platforms have become the neutral public squares of the modern age. That’s not true, of course. They actually built massive private squares, where the owners get all the benefits and very little of the responsibility. But that mindset is over, as every day brings vexing new ethical quandaries and drops them at the feet of the digerati to fix. And that is also where we are now, as tech companies move to batten down their systems and have been forced to start making hard decisions on how their platforms are used. Meanwhile, all sides of the political spectrum are weighing in, looking for legislative solutions that will put guardrails in place. That includes everything from new laws to fines and taxes to antitrust actions that could break up companies into more responsive and manageable parts. That’s why the next year will perhaps be the most interesting in the short history of the modern tech age, with everyone having to drastically reassess how to move forward and manage all that has been invented. It’s a scary moment for tech, because it has long been lauded — largely by itself — as the industry that was going to change the world. It did that in ways we never could have imagined, and that has presented tech’s truest challenge: not to come up with groundbreaking ideas, but what to do next to ensure that the best parts of it live on. And tech living on is what I would like to see, because what has made tech so special has been its boundless energy for trying to get to what’s next. With the world facing so many profound problems that tech can help with, from climate change to food supplies to job shifts, we need our best minds to be free to invent. I look forward to those inventions too, and I hope that going forward, we think them through a little harder as we progress.

Many employees at the home goods retailer Wayfair staged a walkout Wednesday after discovering what they believe is a large order of bedroom furniture the company fulfilled for a contractor that works with facilities detaining children near the US-Mexico border. According to a letter signed by almost 550 employees, Wayfair has sold $200,000 worth of furniture to a nonprofit organization called BCFS. An order from BCFS was surfaced in the company’s Slack (a group chat platform) last week, and concerns began circulating when employees looked into the organization’s mission. As per the organization’s website, BCFS “partners with government agencies, corporations, non-profits, and community leaders to develop programs and service models that combat challenges in health and human services.” In 2018, the New York Times reported that BCFS “has received at least $179 million in federal contracts since 2015 under the government’s so-called unaccompanied alien children program, designed to handle migrant youths who arrive in the country without a parent or other family member.” The furniture, according to the employee letter, was sent to a facility opening in Carrizo Springs, Texas, that will be “outfitted to detain up to 3,000 migrant children.” These kinds of facilities have come under increasing scrutiny and condemnation as reports about appalling conditions emerge. For the record, here’s the letter the employees sent, which includes the details of the B2B order that wayfair fulfilled. pic.twitter.com/mfKs1krawu Wayfair’s leadership responded to the employee letter with its own statement, which Twitter user @FizFashizzle posted. The user is not a Wayfair employee, but two employees confirmed it was sent by CEO Niraj Shah to employee organizers. The letter neither confirms nor denies the sale was made. As business leaders, we also believe in the importance of respecting diversity of thought within our organization and across our customer base. No matter how strongly any one of us feels about an issue, it is important to keep in mind that not all employees or customers agree. Your fellow employees hold a wide range of opinions and perspectives and Wayfair, as a mass-market brand, is oriented to serve a broad and diverse customer base. As a retailer, it is standard practice to fulfill orders for all customers and we believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate. We believe all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, investors and suppliers included, are best served by our commitment to fulfill all orders. This does not indicate support for the opinions or actions of the groups or individuals who purchase from us. A Twitter account with the handle @wayfairwalkout tweeted that employees at Wayfair’s Boston headquarters would be conducting a walkout Wednesday afternoon, and urged the company to donate any profits made from the BCFS sale to RAICES, an organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees. A BCFS representative responded to an inquiry from Vox several hours after this story was first published, writing, “We believe youth should sleep in beds with mattresses.” She then recommended that Vox reach out to the US Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children & Families for comment. HHS did not respond to a previous request before the initial publication time, but did send along a statement after the BCFS statement appeared on Vox. “Those who are protesting Wayfair’s sale of beds for unaccompanied alien children need to ask themselves what the alternative should be to keep the children comfortable,” said Evelyn Stauffer, director of communications at HHS’s Administration for Children and Families. The statement continued: ORR [the Office of Refugee Resettlement] is working tirelessly to add shelter capacity so the children are not in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities designed primarily for adults. ORR shelters and cares for the children while working to place them with appropriate sponsors once they leave CBP custody. This includes purchasing brand new beds for the children and other supplies. We appreciate businesses that are able to quickly supply these necessities to provide comfort to the children. The public backlash against Wayfair has been swift, with customers vowing to boycott the company until it stops doing business with border facility contractors. Politicians have also weighed in. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about the walkout, saying: “Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children.” Rep. Ayanna Pressley took to the platform as well: “I proudly stand in solidarity w/ the hardworking individuals at #Wayfair who are walking out in the name of #justice & humanity.” Elizabeth Warren, the 2020 hopeful and senator for the company’s home state of Massachusetts, tweeted: “The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for.” I stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for. https://t.co/L3hqbazX4l Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children.They asked the company to stop. CEO said no.Tomorrow, they‘re walking out.This is what solidarity looks like - a reminder that everyday people have real power, as long as we’re brave enough to use it. https://t.co/667abeLDTG Vox had a scheduled interview Tuesday with a Wayfair representative for an unrelated story. An hour before the call, the rep emailed that she “had a conflict come up” and would need to reschedule. She has not responded to a subsequent request for comment on the BCFS sale or walkout. Vox spoke with two Wayfair employees about the situation, which has unfolded over the past week. “It became an issue of, ‘What the hell? We need to do something about this,’” the first employee said on a call with Vox. About a dozen Wayfair employees got together to discuss how to formally organize a response. “Let’s just make sure that we’re not profiting off this at all, that not a dime of this is going to the company, and that we’re donating it to charity to combat these terrible camps that are out there that we just don’t want to have anything to do with.” The organizers were hopeful that Wayfair would take their concerns seriously, since the company had pulled ads from Laura Ingraham’s show last year after she made inflammatory comments about Parkland mass shooting survivor David Hogg. “We do have faith that our leadership can do the right thing. It’s just frustrating that this is what it’s taking right now,” the employee said. Wayfair co-founder Steve Conine held a meeting with employees Tuesday afternoon to discuss their concerns. According to the first employee, who was present at the meeting, Conine said the company would donate the money, though it wasn’t clear how or under what conditions. “There are questions about which charity to give to avoid anyone being seen as too political,” the employee told Vox. “They said no outright to the ACLU. A lot of it was them not trying to commit to anything too specifically.” The original employee letter also requested that Wayfair “cease all current and future business with ... contractors participating in operation of migrant detention camps” and to “establish a code of ethics for B2B sales that empowers Wayfair and its employees to act in accordance with our core values.” The employee said someone asked Conine if the company could meet those demands, and Conine responded that he couldn’t give the answer they wanted to hear. He also reportedly said that he was personally opposed to the detention centers, though he did not agree they should be called concentration camps, to which employees responded in unison, “Yes they are.” (This whole account was corroborated by the second employee Vox spoke to, who was also present at the meeting.) At least some employees were not satisfied by Conine’s response, and decided to push forward with Wednesday’s walkout. “If anything, we probably just gained a lot of people that we wouldn’t have had otherwise,” said the employee. Wayfair executives at the meeting assured staff they would not be retaliated against if they participate. “There’s been a lot of comparisons internally comparing us to IBM in the mid-1930s, and we don’t want to be IBM,” said the employee. (IBM assisted Hitler in taking census counts, which were used to identify Jews in Germany.) “We weren’t necessarily looking to drag Wayfair through the mud. This is not the opinion of the entire group, but now that it’s out there, honestly I’m glad it is. People need to know about this.” Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

At least 12 people have been killed in a mass shooting at a municipal center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, police confirmed Friday. Police have identified one shooter, who died after a firefight with police. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera described him as a city public utilities employee. “Today is Virginia Beach’s darkest hour,” Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer said Friday night at a press conference. This story is still developing. Here’s what we know so far, and what we don’t. Spoke to Virginia Governor @RalphNortham last night, and the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Virginia Beach this morning, to offer condolences to that great community.

It's Candy Month, Adopt-A-Cat Month and, if we can squeeze it in, Accordion Awareness Month.  Ramadan is in full swing through Wednesday, the Tony Awards are Sunday, and Atlantic hurricane season rolls on through November. (We've already had storm Andrea, so the official first storm of this season is Barry). Plus: according to my wall calendar the Queen gets two freakin' holiday celebrations, one in New Zealand (today) and one in Australia (the 10th). There's a full “strawberry” moon on the 17th, so be prepared to amble into the back yard, think of Neil Armstrong, and give it a wink.  Sequel mania hits the Toy Story, Men in Black and Shaft franchises.  Oh, and a special message from our Maine mosquitoes: ""Come on up—we'd love to have ya for a drink sometime."" P.S. ""Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon!""  So who drew the black spot this year?  I gotta get these rocks thrown and then park my butt on the couch in time for Judge Judy. Focus, people, focus! JEERS to justifying the unjustifiable. In the wake of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach (12 dead, scores injured), here's today’s List of Conservatives’ Reasons for Why This Happened: Junk food…expulsion of God from schools…a “moral vacuum”…video games…""toxic masculinity”…Obamacare…political correctness…brass curtain rods…the deep state...solar radiation…too many shrubs...not enough thoughts and prayers...disloyalty to Trump...violent movies except the ones starring Chuck Norris, Jon Voight, or James Woods because they're patriots…too many doors… ...socialism…global cooling…Antifa...alligators in the sewers…vaccines...Nancy Pelosi and her liberal San Francisco agenda...songs with violent lyrics but not Ted Nugent’s songs with violent lyrics because he’s a warrior for Jesus…illegals…the fake media...Scandinavia…voter fraud…and, of course, George Soros. But not guns. Oh, no. Never the guns. That would be crazy. CHEERS to strength in numbers. The Puritans were out in force up in the tiny Maine hamlet of Waterville over the weekend, their undies all a'twist over an event at a local book store during which a drag queen read stories to children celebrating diversity and kindness.  And when I say ""out in force,"" I mean a tiny handful who were outnumbered 20-to-1 by supporters of the event who stood outside, preventing the nabobs of negativism from ruining the event. (Then again, book stores are like kryptonite to right-wingers, so most stayed away purely out of fear that their faces would melt at the sight of a copy of Huckleberry Finn.) Ophelia, a drag queen from Topsham, read from two books about inclusion. […] Jessica Gorton of Readfield said she brought her 8-year-old son to the reading to show him that each person is unique and to accept people’s differences. “I think it’s important to support diversity---diversity of thought, diversity of how people present themselves,” she said following the reading. HereÃ¢ÂÂs a look outside of ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Book Celler in Waterville. Hundreds are inside and outside supporting their Drag Queen Story Hour. A smaller protest of the event is across the street @newscentermaine pic.twitter.com/tv6JQCOWcw [O]utrage blew up on social media after the event was announced, including a negative post and comments by Waterville Mayor Nick Isgro and comments on the Facebook page Maine Conservative Grassroots. One woman, Nyssa Damon, held up a colorful sign that read “God save the queens,” which seemed to sum up the event for supporters of the reading. But it had a happy ending. To show there were no hard feelings, the children who attended the event walked over with finger paint and spent an hour helping the protesters correct all the spelling errors on their signs. CHEERS to moments worth remembering. Eleven years ago today: ""Our primary season has finally come to an end...Because of you, I can say that Iwill be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States of America.” “America, this is our moment!  This is our time!"" —Barack Obama, June 3, 2008 Meanwhile, the 2020 primary season is just getting started. Sensory-deprivation chamber, don’t fail me now. JEERS to draining the dictionary. This is outrageous. Spelling bees are not beanbag, and life isn’t about ""survival of the octo-fittest.""  But that universal truth was swept aside Thursday night by the meddling, sleep-deprived moderators of the National Spelling Bee, who decided they'd had enough and whipped out a blow-torch to carve up the championship trophy into eight pieces: The unprecedented outcome was made possible after a shock announcement by official pronouncer Jacques Bailly at the conclusion of the 17th round – the second in a row with no eliminations – where he acknowledged that organizers were fast running out of challenging words and that any speller still alive after three additional rounds would be declared a champion. “Champion spellers, we are now in uncharted territory,” Bailly said. “We do have plenty of words remaining on our list. But we will soon run out of words that will possibly challenge you, the most phenomenal collection of super spellers in the history of this competition.” He added: “We’re basically throwing the dictionary at you, and so far you are showing the dictionary who is boss.” I say it should be an endurance contest, with the trophy going to the last kid who doesn’t drop from exhaustion. But there was one upside to the history-making evening that made me smile: a whole bunch of right-wingers' heads exploded when they heard that the winners included Rishik, Saketh, Shruthika, Sohum, Abhijay, and Rojan. I expect we'll hear calls to build a wall around next year's Spelling Bee. (And India will pay for it, believe me, believe me.) JEERS to the Big Whiffer.  On June 3, 1888, ""Casey at the Bat"" was first published in The San Francisco Examiner.  Who can forget those immortal final words… Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light, And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout; But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has gotten overrun by Imperial Walkers and the forces of Kylo Ren and tossed into the Sarlacc pit, thus securing the victory of the Empire because, funny coincidence, it turns out that Casey was really the last Jedi. Oops, I almost forgot: Spoiler Alert. - Ten years ago in C&J: June 3, 2009 JEERS to America’s al Qaeda.  Terrorism reared its ugly head again in the U.S. yesterday when a lone gunman, backed in spirit by an army of anti-abortion zealots whose rhetoric against their target regularly included words like ""murderer,"" ""demon,"" ""killer,"" and, of course, ""Nazi,"" shot and killed a Kansas doctor in church. Our condolences to George Tiller's family, friends and supporters, who have now seen their worst fears realized.  Digby says: It seems as if there's somebody shooting up churches and killing cops on the basis of some wingnut obsession every few months now.  I wonder why?  How many years has it been since there was a left wing terrorist killing in the US? ... Said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, an anti-abortion activist: ""No one should use this tragedy for political gain."" Perhaps we could just sweep it under the rug and carry on with the slut shaming, bloody pictures and calling doctors murderers.  No need to bring up this little bump in the road.  It would be rude. I noticed this morning in some ABC News video footage that Tiller’s murderer Scott Roeder had a little fish symbol stuck to the back of his car.  In the middle it says ""Jesus.""  My sentiments exactly. - And just one more… JEERS to more of Mr. Maniac’s manure. As promised, here’s the bottom half of this month’s record-breaking list of people and things that made Trump look like an even bigger jackass in May: ""Russia helping me get elected"" Nancy Pelosi's prayer for his sanity The ""Fuck Trump"" tweet he tweeted His new nickname: ""Brokeahontas"" His dishonest new Interior Secretary His corrupt transportation secretary Obama's speech to Britain's Parliament His love affair with Kim Jong Un, Part II His misunderstanding of who pays tariffs The carrier strike force whose cover he blew His massive tax increase on the middle class $102 million abuse of taxpayer funds for golf His White House booze hounds at Mar-A-Lago Republican congressman Justin Amash (R-MI) The $62 million he screwed U.S. farmers out of The ""Trump states"" that are the worst to live in His bullshit claim that Obama spied on him in 2016 Say this for the guy: he’s really good at selling one thing: Bullshit Mountain franchises.

564,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/the-startling-image-of-the-blood-spattered-victim-of-the-virginia-beach-shooting,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Michael Luo View on Twitter  On Friday afternoon, a longtime employee of the city of Virginia Beach—an engineer in the public-utilities department—entered the municipal complex where he worked with a .45-calibre handgun and began shooting. According to the authorities, at least a dozen people, on three floors of the building and in a car outside, were killed, along with the shooter. Alyssa Andrews had been parked next to the complex, with her year-old grandson, waiting for her daughter, who was inside paying a parking ticket. Andrews noticed that the roads were blocked off. She saw SWAT officers running up the street. “The police were just running back and forth with machine guns in their hands,” Andrews said, in an interview on CNN. “I just saw a police officer run in front of my car with this gentleman that had just gotten shot.” Andrews, a nurse, asked if she could help. “They said, ‘No, stay in your car.’ ” Before the man was taken away, she snapped a photo, which ran on the front page of Saturday’s Virginian-Pilot. The stocky, bearded man, in a green striped shirt and khaki pants, with a lanyard around his neck, is a victim. That much we know. It is unclear where he was shot. His left hand is bloodied. The dark maroon of the blood spatter seems darkest on the right side of his chest, near his shoulder. The splotches also appear to be more concentrated on his left leg. The police officer standing in front of him has his hand on his right shoulder, in a gesture of comfort, the kind you would extend to a stranger when words fail and you lack the intimacy to pull the person into an embrace. The officer’s back is to the camera; his face is hidden. He seems to be looking past the bloodied man, perhaps alert to the still-present danger. The eyes of the man who has just been shot are vacant. His lips are parted slightly, his brow furrowed in a mask of incredulity and despair. “I pray that he’s O.K.,” Andrews told CNN. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization formed in 2013, tracks gun-related violence in the United States. The data tables on the archive’s Web site offer the most direct explanation for why Friday’s shooting registered as a non-event for so many us: it marked the hundred and fiftieth mass shooting in the country this year. (The archive defines a mass shooting as any incident in which four or more people, not including the shooter, are shot or killed.) Friday, May 31st, was the hundred and fifty-first day of the year. Mass shootings, in other words, have become daily events in the U.S. Yet there is something undeniably startling about the photo that Andrews took. For all the images that have been broadcast from mass shootings—scenes of children scurrying from their schools in single file, with their hands in the air, of heavily armored police with assault weapons stalking buildings, of long trains of ambulances queuing up to take victims away—it is unusual to see actual blood. We are more accustomed to seeing these kinds of images from war zones, where news photographers are often able to witness the carnage of combat up close. By contrast, the setting of Andrews’s photograph is visibly suburban. A sidewalk stretches behind the injured man. On the car next to the officer is a barely legible sticker of a ball, with the word “Fastpitch.” A no-parking sign is prominent on the right. It makes for a jarring composition. In 2013, the Connecticut state legislature voted overwhelmingly to block public access to graphic images of those killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, as well as future homicide victims, owing to privacy concerns. Dan Malloy, the governor at the time, quickly signed the bill into law. There is a case to be made, however, that the country needs to be exposed to these kinds of images if we have any hope of being jolted from our collective inurement to the ravages of gun violence. I am guessing the details of Virginia Beach will soon blur in my memory, alongside the litany of other mass shootings that have dominated cable news and quickly receded. But my memory of the man in the green shirt will endure. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

President Donald Trump showed off an unfamiliar look on Sunday, swapping his trademark swept-back hairstyle for a slicked-back look that caught many by surprise. The president had the new style on a visit to McLean Bible Church in Virginia on Sunday before flying to the UK for a state visit. By the time he landed just outside London on Monday, he had returned to his familiar style. Trump's short-lived new style generated intense debate on social media, with some speculating that the president's uncharacteristically flat look was actually ""hat hair."" Read more: Trump boarded Air Force One in high winds — and the photos of his hair are mesmerizing Trump arrived at the church, for a service for victims of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach on Friday, straight from the golf course at his club in nearby Sterling, wearing a baseball cap and slacks. He removed his cap to join the pastor David Platt in prayer for the 12 people killed in the shooting. He did not address the congregation. Trump's hair has been a subject of speculation and fascination over the years. Jimmy Fallon confirmed it was real during the 2016 campaign, when Trump appeared on Fallon's show and allowed the host to mess up his hair. And Michael Wolff wrote in his 2018 book, ""Fire and Fury,"" that the president's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, had revealed to friends the secrets of her father's hairstyle, saying it's the result of surgery, dye, and an elaborate process of sculpting and hairspray to fix it in place.",2019-06-03 09:44:26,"Trump changed trademark hair for one day, swapped back for UK visit - Business Insider","politics and government,biographical information",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com
566,https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/2019-democratic-debate-elizabeth-warrens-caution-on-guns," New Yorker writers respond to the news. By Michael Luo June 26th 2019, 11:39 P.M. The question from Chuck Todd to Senator Elizabeth Warren was direct: “What do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there, and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with them?” It was an effective query, one that, arguably, cuts to the heart of America’s gun problem, which claimed nearly forty thousand lives last year. A 2017 study estimated that there are three hundred and ninety-three million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, a rate of 120.5 guns for every hundred residents, twice that of the second-highest nation, Yemen. Yet Warren, who has been battling with Senator Bernie Sanders to win over the Democratic Party’s left wing, sidestepped the question. She offered up a quotable sound bite—“Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country, and we need to treat it like that”—and talked about the need to “double down on research,” an allusion to how the N.R.A. succeeded, during the mid-nineteen-nineties, in effectively cutting off federal funding for gun-violence research. Yet she was unwilling, even after Todd probed her a second time, to raise the possibility of policies like the mandatory gun-buyback program that Australia undertook two decades ago, after a devastating mass shooting, which was found to be effective in reducing gun deaths. Gun-control advocates have made undeniable strides in this country over the last few years, but Warren’s caution on the issue was a reminder of how politically fraught the issue remains, at least in the eyes of some candidates.",2019-06-26 23:39:03,2019 Democratic Debate: Elizabeth Warren’s Caution on Guns,"politics and government,united states politics and government,medicine and health,gun control,firearms",1101,http://www.newyorker.com/

The federal charges against Holden James Matthews come two months after the churches received more than $2 million in donations. In April, a fundraising effort to support three historically black Louisiana churches that were burned down by arsonists made national headlines when it received more than $1.9 million in donations in the span of a week. Now, two months later, the man believed to be behind the arson attacks has been formally charged with federal hate crimes. The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that 21-year-old Holden James Matthews — a white man and the son of a sheriff’s deputy in Opelousas, Louisiana — has been indicted by a federal grand jury. Matthews, who local authorities said “demonstrated the characteristics of a pathological fire setter” when he was arrested in April, also faces state arson and hate crimes charges. In a press release announcing the June 6 indictment, DOJ argued that Matthews “was motivated to set the fires because of the religious character of these properties.” The agency notes that he faces six charges, three counts of “using fire to commit a felony” and three counts of intentionally damaging religious property. The latter qualifies as a hate crime under the Church Arson Prevention Act. “Our freedom to safely congregate in these churches and exercise our religious beliefs must be jealously guarded,” US Attorney David C. Joseph said in the Wednesday statement. “Today we are one step closer to justice for the parishioners of these churches and the St. Landry Parish communities affected by these acts.” If convicted, Matthews could face a maximum of 20 years in prison for each count of damaging religious property, as well as a minimum of 10 years on the first count of using fire to commit a felony, and 20 years for the final two counts. He could also be subjected to supervised release or fines. The three churches, all of which were located in Louisiana’s St. Landry Parish and were home to predominantly or exclusively black congregations, were intentionally burned over a 10-day span in late March and early April, according to local officials. The first fire occurred on March 26 at St. Mary Baptist Church. On April 2, Greater Union Baptist was burned. Two days later, flames destroyed Mount Pleasant Baptist Church. The fires were investigated by local authorities with the assistance of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). A GoFundMe effort to help the churches rebuild was created on April 10, but the page didn’t receive a massive amount of donations until April 16, one day after a massive fire damaged parts of the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The cathedral quickly saw a wave of international financial support, with three of France’s richest families pledging to donate more than $500 million to efforts to rebuild the cathedral and the Trump administration also promising to provide aid. With efforts to support the Notre Dame Cathedral drawing massive sums, activists, journalists, and politicians took to social media in the US to note that as the fundraising effort continued, people should also pay attention to the Louisiana churches, which were left reeling by arson and had been struggling to reach their donation goal. The message was further amplified by figures like former secretary of state and former first lady Hillary Clinton, journalist Yashar Ali, and retired NFL player Benjamin Watson. “It is imperative that we show this community and the entire country that these types of acts do not represent who we are,” Watson, who was active in fundraising efforts when they began, tweeted on April 15. The rebuild of Notre Dame will be well funded. In the past month, three historically black churches in Louisiana were destroyed by a racist arsonist. He has been charged with hate crimes, but these churches need your help. Please join me in donating https://t.co/gj1BcNsGpu The GoFundMe fundraiser was hosted by the Seventh District Baptist Association, a group of 60 churches active in southwest Louisiana, and was also supported by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and the pastors of the three burned churches. The fundraiser noted that all the money raised “will be disbursed equally among all three churches for not only rebuilding their sanctuaries, but for the purchase of all necessities lost in the fires, including pews, sound system, musical instruments, etc.” The fundraiser initially sought to raise $600,000 for the churches, but after reassessing the damages, the amount was tripled to $1.8 million. On the day of the Notre Dame fire, the campaign had raised less than $100,000 according to the New York Times. One day later, the campaign had raised roughly $1.4 million. By the time the campaign was closed, it had raised more than $2.1 million, exceeding its increased goal. When the church burnings first came to national attention in early April, the fires were quickly compared to a long history of attacks on black churches in the US, including the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, the wave of fires at 145 black churches across the US from 1995 to 1996, and the 2015 mass shooting of black worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the wake of the Charleston shooting, several fires at black churches across the country fueled concerns of a wave of arson targeting black houses of worship. “For decades, African-American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African-American community,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson noted in an April 8 statement. “As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been targets of violence.” In Louisiana, authorities initially avoided suggesting that the three fires were racially motivated. Congregants noted that the fires had claimed decades of history, reducing Bibles, century-old financial records and documents, and handwritten sermons to ash. “All you see is charcoal,” Freddie Jack, president of the Seventh District Baptist Association, told the New York Times. “It’s a total, complete loss at all three sites.” Even with the surge in funding, the churches face a long road ahead as their congregations begin the process of rebuilding. The Times notes that while each church had insurance, the coverage is limited and will not cover all the costs. Jack added that the churches will also need to be built to fit standards passed after Hurricane Katrina, requirements that will likely increase the costs of the rebuilding efforts. Members of the Louisiana churches say that they are prepared to move forward, that the fires have not shaken their faith, and that they are thankful for the outpouring of support. “It’s going to help our community,” Rev. Gerald Toussaint, pastor of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, told CNN. “What the devil meant for bad, God’s going to turn it into something good.”  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

570,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/03/the-parkland-provocateur-kyle-kashuv-prepares-to-graduate,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Andrew Marantz Bill Nye, the climate-change activist and science educator, appeared on “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” recently. “The planet’s on fucking fire!” Nye shouted. “This is an actual crisis!” Kyle Kashuv, a high-school senior who has more than three hundred thousand Twitter followers, claimed to be outraged, but not about the climate-change message. “Dear Bill Nye,” he tweeted. “Cursing like a middle-schooler on XBOX Live doesn’t make me respect you—it makes you look like a joke.” Kashuv would know. Just a few years ago, he was a middle schooler himself. He then attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida. In early 2018, he survived the mass shooting at the school; after that, he became a student activist. Unlike the other well-known activists from Parkland, Kashuv is a fierce right-winger and an opponent of gun control. In the months after the shooting, he appeared on Fox News, took a photo with Clarence Thomas, and met with the President and the First Lady in the Oval Office. “This young man is truly extraordinary,” Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and a close friend of Donald Trump, Jr.,’s, said last year, bringing Kashuv onstage at Utah Valley University. Turning Point, a nonprofit with an annual budget that exceeds eight million dollars, promotes conservatism at high schools and colleges across the country. Kirk named Kashuv the organization’s high-school outreach director. “The more prominent he got, the more I was bothered by his hypocrisy,” Ariana Ali, one of Kashuv’s classmates, said about him recently. “He pretends to be this God-fearing, squeaky-clean type, but everyone who knows him knows that’s not who he really is.” Who he really is, according to Ali, is a bigot. According to another classmate, Kashuv “used the N-word frequently,” both in text messages and in person. A different classmate said, “He was obsessed with ranking which women were most attractive, by race. Out of nowhere, he’d go, ‘Wanna hear my racial ranking system?’ ” Political disagreements are one thing, Ali said, “but Kyle’s behavior was way, way over the line.” Ali had several more anecdotes attesting to this. She also, as they say, had the receipts. On Twitter, Ali posted a video of Kashuv and some of his classmates chatting on a Google Doc in December, 2017. They were supposedly studying for their A.P. American-history midterm, but, around midnight, the review session went off the rails. At first, the attempts at humor were innocent enough. (On one page, the names of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party were changed to “Fed boyos” and “Demdem Reppy swag.”) But Kashuv’s contributions were more unhinged. He referred, in capital letters, to “MY Jewish Slaves.” Elsewhere, he wrote the N-word eleven times in a row. “I’m really good at typing” the word, he explained. “Practice uhhhhhh makes perfect.” The same day that Ali put the video out on Twitter, Kashuv posted a statement announcing his resignation from Turning Point. A few days later, he tweeted another statement. He acknowledged having used “callous and inflammatory language,” but he didn’t apologize. A Turning Point spokesperson called Kashuv’s comments “unacceptable” and “un-American.” (Kashuv declined to comment.) The Kashuv scandal was not Turning Point’s first association with white supremacy. Earlier this month, a video surfaced in which Riley Grisar, the president-elect of a Turning Point chapter in Nevada, utters the phrase “white power” while a woman shouts, “We’re gonna rule the country!” Earlier, it was revealed that Crystal Clanton, another Turning Point leader, had texted a Turning Point employee, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all.” R. C. Maxwell, a “brand ambassador” for Turning Point who goes by Black Hannity on Twitter, defended the organization. He wrote, “To say those random incidents are indicative of a larger problem of racism would be unfair.” Diante Johnson, the president of the Black Conservative Federation, disagreed: “If you’re comfortable making racist comments, that means someone has made you think it’s acceptable.” Kashuv, who will graduate this month, has been accepted to Harvard. He wrote on Twitter that, before enrolling, he plans to spend a gap year in Washington, D.C., “working to build a brighter tomorrow.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Four presidential candidates shared their plans to close the racial wealth gap during the South Carolina event. A handful of Democratic presidential candidates spent Saturday sharing their plans to address America’s growing racial wealth gap, highlighting the benefits of their economic plans amid an ongoing fight to gain support from black voters, a crucial part of the Democratic electorate. Four presidential candidates — Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — were in South Carolina for the Black Economic Alliance Presidential Forum, which was dedicated to discussing the significance of “work, wages, and wealth” in black communities. An edited taping of the forum was broadcast on BET on Sunday morning. The forum occurred as several presidential candidates ramp up their black outreach efforts in an attempt to break away from a crowded primary field. Black voters are roughly one-fifth of the Democratic electorate and are especially powerful in states like South Carolina, where black voters make up as much as 60 percent of the Democratic voting bloc. Several polls of black voters in recent weeks have noted that this group is especially concerned about economic issues heading into the 2020 election. Economic issues are a broad category, and a range of topics, including wages, unemployment, entrepreneurship, student debt, gentrification, and mass incarceration, were all discussed at the Saturday forum. While their focuses on Saturday differed, the candidates’ proposals all fit into a set of larger goals: ensuring that black people have access to capital and ending a growing racial wealth gap that has left white families with 10 times the wealth of black ones. The racial wealth gap is a topic that has seen increased attention this cycle: Candidates have been actively describing the ways that economic disparities are rooted in historic actions that cause economic issues to impact communities of color differently. This attention has sparked discussions about not only the racial wealth gap but also reparations, affordable housing, and the continued effects of discrimination. The forum offered a view into how the candidates in attendance plan to address these issues. And their remarks showed that while 2020 candidates may largely agree on the need to address racial economic disparities, they have very different plans for how to actually do so. Seven candidates were invited to participate in the Black Economic Alliance forum. Four candidates accepted, while three others — Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, and former former Vice President Joe Biden — did not attend in person, instead sending in video messages. The candidates who did not attend have fared better in the past few months in polls of South Carolina’s voters, and Biden continues to lead the field among likely voters in the state. But the forum allowed the four candidates who spoke — all of whom have either failed to capture the attention of South Carolina’s voters or have had inconsistent polling in the state (although Warren has surged significantly in recent weeks) — to explain how they understand one of the most important issues for black voters. They had varying degrees of success in doing so. Here’s what each candidate said on Saturday they would do to economically empower black Americans: O’Rourke was first up at the forum, and said the federal government could play an important role in combating gentrification. He also defended his record in Congress and attempted to explain how he planned to overcome his low support among black voters. The former Congress member spoke about the importance of understanding how a history of discrimination and expulsion from wealth building continues to harm African Americans, specifically citing the pay gap between black women and white men and the impacts mass incarceration have had on black employment. He called for using measures like the Paycheck Fairness Act, a congressional proposal that would bar employers from asking about a job applicant’s salary history; it would also require employers to share salary data with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to eliminate pay discrimination. O’Rourke went on to say that he supported ending the war on drugs, citing its disproportionate impact on communities of color. O’Rourke released his small business plan on Saturday. It calls for the creation of 200,000 new small businesses and pledges to create a $10 billion small business credit initiative for “economically distressed areas.” Warren was next to speak, and she opened her remarks with a brief acknowledgment of the fourth anniversary of the 2015 mass shooting at Charleston’s historically black Mother Emanuel Church. She then launched into an overview of a number of policy proposals targeted at black communities, including her plan for a $50 billion fund for historically black colleges and universities, her proposal to erase student debt for the majority of borrowers, and her plans to increase the wages of child care workers. Warren noted that plans like these were necessary to counter federal policies that had denied African Americans a chance at wealth building. “Why do we have that kind of black-white wealth gap? A big part of it is because of discrimination that was actively fostered by the US government,” she said. The bulk of her time was focused on a discussion of her “economic patriotism” plan, which calls for greater investment in and support of American jobs and workers. She specifically pointed to her recently announced small business plan, which would provide $7 billion in grants to minority-owned businesses. Her plan would aim to create 100,000 new businesses to O’Rourke’s 200,000, but she would focus on grants rather than loans. Warren added that all grants would be distributed through a new “Small Business Equity Fund,” which would be overseen by experts who are women and people of color. Like other proposals the candidate offered, the plan would be funded by a wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans. According to the New York Times, Warren left the stage to a standing ovation. Buttigieg entered the Saturday forum polling at less than 1 percent among black voters, and openly acknowledged that he has more work to do to increase his profile and build trust with voters of color. Like other forum attendees, Buttigieg also discussed the importance of acknowledging the historical disadvantages of black communities, saying that the country “can’t take racist policies and replace them with neutral policies.” Much like O’Rourke, Buttigieg spoke more broadly about the need to improve access to housing; he also spoke about mass incarceration, saying that the government could use a carrot-and-stick relationship with states to encourage the adoption of practices that would help reduce the number of incarcerated people from black and brown communities. Buttigieg also spoke of the importance of integrated neighborhoods, calling for a “21st century Homestead Act,” which he calls the “Douglass Plan” after activist Frederick Douglass. He says the plan would make it easier “to build wealth and equity while also building up neighborhoods in historically underserved areas and making sure we ... support those most at risk of being driven out.” The final speaker at the forum was Booker, who pointed to the fact that as a black man who lives in and represents a low-income black and brown community, he intimately understands the issues faced by black Americans, specifically citing the need to address issues like mass incarceration and affordable housing. “This isn’t just about African American communities,” Booker said. “You cannot have a large segment of the population denied equal access to markets or capital or health care, and not think that is a cancer that affects the body as a whole.” As for policy, Booker largely focused on promoting his “baby bonds” plan, which would create a savings account for all newborn children in the US, with yearly federal contributions to the account decreasing as parental income increases. The Times notes that Booker was also one of the more well-received candidates to the forum, and that he was the only other candidate to receive a standing ovation. Several polls of black voters taken in the weeks before the Black Economic Alliance Forum have found that black Americans are especially worried about the economy and its impact on things like education and access to health care. These attitudes were most recently captured in polling released by the Black Economic Alliance shortly before Saturday’s forum. In that poll, 57 percent of black respondents said they were somewhat or very dissatisfied with the state of the economy; 81 percent said it was “very hard” to reach the American dream. Like other surveys of black voters, the Black Economic Alliance survey found that Biden holds a significant lead over the rest of the field, with 36 percent of black adults saying they were enthusiastic about his candidacy. But survey respondents also said they are much more likely to support candidates with clear policy plans to improve the economic prospects of black communities, suggesting that at least some voters would be willing to pivot to a different candidate than Biden. Survey respondents said they are worried about a number of issues, including growing costs of living, an inability to find employment, and discrimination. And they said they are looking for a number of things to help themselves and their families, including access to affordable health care, affordable college, and more well-paying jobs with benefits. Many of these concerns were on full display steps away from the Saturday forum, as a group of black workers participated in a rally led by the Fight for $15 and demanded that political candidates pay close attention to the needs of black workers and their communities. Booker, O’Rourke, and Buttigieg met with demonstrators in the hours before and after the presidential forum. The Black Economic Alliance argues that the economic concerns of black voters show that it is crucial for political candidates to clearly state how they plan to address the need for “work, wages, and wealth” in black communities. And while the Saturday forum allowed some candidates to further articulate their plans, the group says it will be important for all the candidates to offer serious plans and discuss them regularly. “Make no mistake, black voters will determine who sits in the White House and walks the halls of Congress, in both the House and Senate,” Akunna Cook, the executive director of the Black Economic Alliance, said on Saturday. “We will ensure that all the candidates, regardless of party, are prioritizing our issues in this election.”    Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

572,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/ahmari-french-orban/591697/?utm_source=feed,"A faction of the religious right has concluded that if liberal democracy does not guarantee victory, then it must be abandoned. About the author: Adam Serwer is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he covers politics. By the tail end of the Obama administration, the culture war seemed lost. The religious right sued for détente, having been swept up in one of the most rapid cultural shifts in generations. Gone were the decades of being able to count on attacking its traditional targets for political advantage. In 2013, Chuck Cooper, the attorney defending California’s ban on same-sex marriage, begged the justices to allow same-sex-marriage opponents to lose at the ballot box rather than in court. Conservatives such as George Will and Rod Dreher griped that LGBTQ activists were “sore winners,” intent on imposing their beliefs on prostrate Christians, who, after all, had already been defeated. The rapidity of that cultural shift, though, should not obscure the contours of the society that the religious right still aspires to preserve: a world where women have no control over whether to carry a pregnancy to term, same-sex marriage is illegal, and gays and lesbians can be arrested and incarcerated for having sex in their own homes and be barred from raising children. The religious right showed no mercy and no charity toward these groups when it had the power to impose its will, but when it lost that power, it turned to invoking the importance of religious tolerance and pluralism in a democratic society. That was then. The tide of illiberalism sweeping over Western countries and the election of Donald Trump have since renewed hope among some on the religious right that it might revive its cultural control through the power of the state. Inspired by Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Vladimir Putin in Russia, a faction of the religious right now looks to sectarian ethno-nationalism to restore its beliefs to their rightful primacy, and to rescue a degraded and degenerate culture. All that stands in their way is democracy, and the fact that most Americans reject what they have to offer. The past few weeks have witnessed a nasty internecine fight among religious conservatives about whether liberal democracy’s time has passed. Sohrab Ahmari, writing at First Things, attacked National Review’s David French for adhering to a traditional commitment to liberal democracy while “the overall balance of forces has tilted inexorably away from us.” Would the left have stood by liberal democracy in the face of such circumstances? In fact, the balance of forces tilted away from the left’s cultural priorities for most of my lifetime, and the left’s response was to win arguments—slowly, painfully, and at incalculable personal cost. Many religious conservatives see antidiscrimination laws that compel owners of public accommodations to serve all customers, laws that might compel priests to break the seal of confession if they are told of child abuse, and the growing acceptance of trans people as a kind of impending apocalypse. It is no surprise that among their co-partisans, Ahmari seems to have the upper hand here; in such circles, “Crush your enemies” almost always plays better than “The other side has rights too.” The concerns Ahmari airs are not wholly without merit: Religious conservatives are not paranoid to imagine themselves pariahs someday in the future because of their views; it was not so long ago that liberal champions such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton held public positions that today would be described by the left as bigotry. Nor should the left expect to win every battle with the right over matters of religious conscience; there will be moments when its opponents are correct. The same wall between Church and state that prevents the state from being dominated by the Church also bars the state from dictating the religious commitments of the Church. A law that compels Catholic priests to break the seal of confession, for example, likely runs afoul of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, despite the state’s obvious and compelling interest in preventing child abuse, and despite the Church’s abysmal record in doing so. In spite of their disagreements, Ahmari and French are in accord about a great deal when it comes to abortion, women’s rights, and LGBTQ rights. French’s adherence to liberal democracy is a commitment to a set of rules under which these goals can be pursued in a pluralistic society: through public discourse, the courts, and the ballot box. For Ahmari and his ilk, this is insufficient. He seems to believe not only that the state should always settle such disputes in his favor, but that it should prevent cultural and political expressions he finds distasteful. This isn’t an exaggeration. In a since-deleted tweet, Ahmari praised Alabama Public Television for refusing to air an episode of the cartoon Arthur in which the titular character’s male teacher marries another man; his attack on French was preceded by another since-deleted eruption, over Drag Queen Story Hour at a public library, in which he cried, “To hell with liberal order”; and he has since suggested the humanities should be defunded because “they may be lost to us for good.” If this is where Ahmari and his cohort are while the GOP still controls the courts, the Senate, and the presidency, imagine what they’ll be willing to countenance should they lose them. Ahmari’s demands here outline the United States that illiberals would like to see: one that resembles Orbán’s Hungary, where rigged electoral systems ensure that political competition is minimal, the press is tightly controlled by an alliance between corporations and the state on behalf of the ruling party, national identity is defined in religious and ethnic terms, and cultural expressions are closely policed by the state to ensure compliance with that identity. It is no surprise that the vast majority of black and Latino Christians see a secular but pluralist left as more trustworthy allies than conservatives who rail against “poisonous and censorious multiculturalism,” and darkly warn of a plot to “displace American citizens.” When Ahmari was asked, however, by Jane Coaston at Vox what his “ideal order” would look like, he said, “Working mothers wouldn’t be expected to return to work a mere eight weeks after giving birth.” This sort of obvious, coy insincerity about the actual nature of the changes they seek is one of the major reasons religious conservatives like Ahmari have lost so much ground in the public square, and why the left is inclined to view their demands for religious exceptions to be thinly veiled excuses for discrimination. The question of whether working mothers deserve more generous maternity leave does not represent a bitter split between the religious right and the secular left, nor is it given prominence in his manifesto, which focuses on crushing the left, or, as he put it, fighting “the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” Although the intraconservative critiques leveled by Ahmari and his allies sometimes take on the language of opposition to market fundamentalism, they are not truly opposed to the concentration of power and capital. These critics observe the decline in wages and community that has resulted from this concentration, and propose to do nothing at all about it other than seize that power for themselves, to be used to their ends. The illiberals see the wealthy and upper-middle classes getting married, forming families, and raising children much as they did in the 1950s, and conclude that the problem with working-class Americans is not the diminished political power relative to their bosses, but the absence of a sharp enough lash, whether from the state or from a culture that has escaped the religious right’s grasp. Gillette should be making commercials about women staying at home and fathers going off to work, not dads teaching their trans sons to shave for the first time. This understanding also helps illuminate the right’s eruption over YouTube’s decision to demonetize (but not remove) the channel of Steven Crowder, a conservative YouTuber who called the Vox reporter Carlos Maza a “lispy queer,” among other slurs. A world in which one can refer to gay people as “lispy queers” without repercussion is one in which the illiberal right is winning the culture war, so it matters little that YouTube is no less a private business than Masterpiece Cakeshop, and has a right to define the rules for using its platform. The same sort of protests that the right decries as illiberal when deployed against right-wing speakers on college campuses are suddenly a legitimate tactic when used against Drag Queen Story Hour. The objective here, in Ahmari’s words, is to defeat “the enemy,” not adhere to principle, and that requires destigmatizing anew the kind of bigotry that was once powerful enough to sway elections. Indeed, the illiberal faction in this debate retains Trump as its champion precisely because the president is willing to use the power of the state for sectarian ends, despite being an exemplar of the libertinism to which it is supposedly implacably opposed, a man whose major legislative accomplishment is slashing taxes on the wealthy, and whose most significant contribution to the institution of the family is destroying thousands of them on purpose. It is power that is the motivator here, and the best that could be said for these American Orbánists is that they believe that asserting an iron grip on American politics and culture would offer the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Every authoritarian movement has felt the same way. I don’t want to overstate the significance of this dispute between French and Ahmari. They are yelling at each other in a walled garden; conservative pundits in ideological magazines have little influence over a base whose opinions are guided by the commercial incentives of Fox News and right-wing talk radio, and the partisan imperatives of the Republican Party. If they possessed such influence, Trump would not be president. The question of whether the Republican Party would abandon liberal democracy for sectarian ethno-nationalism was decided in the 2016 primary, and all French and Ahmari are doing is arguing about it after the fact. The commercial and social incentives for conservative writers to succumb to Trumpism are vast. Some, like French, have had the integrity to stick to their stated principles. Others, like Ahmari, have already fallen. Today’s skirmishes among conservatives resemble the irregulars in 1865 shooting at one another because they had not yet heard of Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox. And the support Ahmari has drawn suggests that the conservative intelligentsia will offer less resistance to authoritarianism than it did in 2015 and 2016. Trump is the symptom of the Republican Party’s turn toward illiberalism, not its cause; even before Trump ran for president, some Republican elites were plotting to diminish the political power of minorities and enhance those of white voters. Whatever their disagreements, the leaders of both the populist and establishment wings of the Republican Party have concluded that they cannot be allowed to lose power simply because a majority of American voters do not wish them to wield it. The president speaks of imprisoning his political rivals, and his voters cheer. He valorizes political violence, and his followers take note. His attorneys argue both that Congress cannot investigate criminality in the executive branch and that the president has the authority to end criminal investigations into himself or his allies, while ordering them against his opponents. Trump’s supporters exult in the head of state attacking private citizens who demand equal rights, then wave the banner of free speech exclusively in defense of expressions of bigotry. In the end, Trump will dictate the course of his party on these matters, and his base will do whatever he gives it license to do. Writers such as French and Ahmari cannot shape this course; they can only argue about it after the fact. What is notable is that crisis of faith in liberalism for this faction of the religious right comes only now. It is true, as The New York Times’ Ross Douthat writes, that “liberalism has never done as well as it thinks at resolving its own crises.” Yet this faction did not abandon its faith in liberalism’s capacity to solve problems during the decades of Jim Crow. It did not cry, “To hell with the liberal order!” over mass incarceration. It did not erupt in fury over the shattering of Latino families at the border, or the Trump-made aftermath of the catastrophe in Puerto Rico. It did not question whether liberalism had failed after the first, third, fourth or 15th mass shooting at a school, or because it is typical for Americans to beg strangers on the internet for money to cover their health-care costs or after an untimely death. The state of emergency occurred when, and only when, liberal democracy ceased to guarantee victory in the culture war. The indignity of fighting for one’s rights within a democratic framework is fine for others, but it is beneath them. Some perspective is in order. Douthat looks to the future and asks whether a society “dominated by virtual reality and eugenics and mood-stabilizing drugs, post-familial and post-religious and functionally post-human,” would “deserve the political loyalty of (let us say) a traditional Christian or Muslim, just because it still affords them some First Amendment protections? It is reasonable to say that it might not.” Black Americans did not abandon liberal democracy because of slavery, Jim Crow, and the systematic destruction of whatever wealth they managed to accumulate; instead they took up arms in two world wars to defend it. Japanese Americans did not reject liberal democracy because of internment or the racist humiliation of Asian exclusion; they risked life and limb to preserve it. Latinos did not abandon liberal democracy because of “Operation Wetback,” or Proposition 187, or because of a man who won a presidential election on the strength of his hostility toward Latino immigrants. Gay, lesbian, and trans Americans did not abandon liberal democracy over decades of discrimination and abandonment in the face of an epidemic. This is, in part, because doing so would be tantamount to giving the state permission to destroy them, a thought so foreign to these defenders of the supposedly endangered religious right that the possibility has not even occurred to them. But it is also because of a peculiar irony of American history: The American creed has no more devoted adherents than those who have been historically denied its promises, and no more fair-weather friends than those who have taken them for granted. Undetectable in the dispute on the right is any acknowledgment of the criticisms of liberal democracy by those who have been fighting for their fundamental rights in battles that are measured in decades and even centuries; that the social contract implicitly excluded them from the very rights white Christian men have been able to assert from the beginning. Perhaps to do so would be to acknowledge the fundamental immaturity underlying the American Orbánists’ critique: that what they describe as a crisis of liberal democracy is really just them not getting exactly what they want when they want it.",2019-06-14 06:00:12,The Illiberal Right Throws a Tantrum,"politics and government,religion and churches,homosexuality,suits and litigation,women,editorials,discrimination,marriages",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
573,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/06/virginia-shooters-unique-strategy-should-scare-the-hell-out-of-americans-terrorism-expert/,"The shooting in Virginia Beach, in which a disgruntled city employee killed 12 people at a municipal building, is the deadliest mass shooting so far in 2019. But it is also ""ominous"" for one other unusual reason, wrote Harvard professor and former Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem in the Washington Post: the shooter used a suppressor, or as it's known in common language, a silencer. ""What ends lives? Gunfire. What saves lives? The sound of gunfire,"" wrote Kayyem. ""Gun violence in America is unique not simply because of our culture but also because we have lawful weaponry that can kill many people very quickly. In terms of death-to-time ratio, single-shot weapons are preferable to multi-round handguns and handguns are preferable to the semiautomatic, and the favorite of mass shooters, the AR-15. It's a simple calculation of time,"" wrote Kayyem. ""But the Virginia Beach killer seemed to want the anonymity of silence, a tool of the coward, not one seeking fame or a blaze of glory. None of the videos or manifestos we’ve seen from New Zealand to Las Vegas appear to be part of the Virginia Beach story. The killer wanted silence."" Suppressors are currently legal in 42 states, although they are regulated under the National Firearms Act and are thus heavily taxed and expensive to obtain. Gun rights activists have made a considerable push to deregulate them, insisting that they are a safety mechanism that protects the hearing of shooters, that they do not actually 'silence' a gun, and that it would be impractical to use one in a mass shooting. ""It is true that suppressors do not quiet guns; industry experts often cringe at the popular reference to 'silencers,'"" wrote Kayyem. ""Instead, suppressors act like a car muffler — both devices were pioneered by the same inventor, Hiram Percy Maxim — by cooling and dissipating the gases that emanate from the chamber as the trigger is being pulled. That alters the sound enough that the gunshot's normal sound — a suppressed gunshot can sound like a chair scraping on the floor — is difficult to identify."" Kayyem speculates that the use of a suppressor may have added to the Virginia Beach gunman's body count by confusing victims, who, while they still heard the gunfire, may not immediately have recognized it as gunfire, or else may not have been sure where it was coming from. ""To protect life, time is of the essence,"" concluded Kayyem. ""And sound adds precious seconds."" CNN's Jim Acosta scolded his audience on Saturday as he charged that not enough is being done to hold Republicans to account for their ""Big Lie"" of voter fraud and attacks on democracy with voter suppression laws. ""This week, President Biden took on the big lie and the insurrection,"" Acosta noted. The president warned the nation is still in danger after the events of January 6th.""         Ahead of the Monday sentencing of Paul Allard Hodgkins, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch is calling for the judge to impose time in prison. ""What happened on Jan. 6 wasn't just about trespassing and property damage. Anything less than prison time for anyone who participated would diminish the seriousness of a direct assault on American democracy,"" the editorial board wrote. ""Not since the Civil War era has there been such a brazen assault on the legitimacy of the U.S. government and democracy itself.""

Dicks also stopped firearms to people under the age of twenty-one. “A number of people have said to me that this had to be a really hard decision. It was not,"" Stack told The Washington Post. ""Dick’s, which has seen a national expansion under Stack’s leadership, is one of the biggest players in the nearly $70 billion sporting goods market,"" the newspaper noted. ""The company’s most recent firearms policies have come at a cost. For the fiscal year ending Feb. 2, same-store sales fell 3.1 percent, according to company earnings. Stack has blamed much of the slump on gun issues. More than 60 employees quit after the Parkland announcement."" But, Stack is pushing forward and may have success by entirely ending gun sales. ""Last year, Dick’s took all guns out of 10 stores and filled the empty space with products targeted for those markets, such as sports team merchandise.

575,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/05/white-man-accused-of-shooting-two-black-men-had-a-phone-filled-with-mass-shooting-videos-prosecutors/,"Prosecutors in Florida this week revealed that a white man who has been accused of shooting two black victims had ties to white supremacist movements and had a phone filled with videos of mass shootings. The Tampa Bay Times reports that prosecutors discussed 31-year-old shooting suspect William Shutt's ties to extremist groups during a bail hearing on Thursday in which they successfully argued that he should be denied release before going on trial. During the hearing, prosecutors asked St. Petersburg police Detective Christina Kenney whether the alleged suspect had any connection to ""alt-right groups"" that promote white supremacist ideology. Kenney replied that there was, although she was not allowed to elaborate further on this point. Additionally, prosecutors showed that Shutt's cellphone contained several videos of mass shootings, ""including footage of the March 15 massacre at a New Zealand mosque that was livestreamed... a video of a man shooting a police officer and a video of a man whose face was pounded with an axe until he died."" Police say that Shutt, a military veteran, stockpiled weapons at the home of a man who employed him as a caretaker. Shutt also took several photos of his weapons with his phone. This past March, Shutt allegedly opened fire on a car with two black men inside who had pulled up alongside his car in his neighborhood in St. Petersburg. 42-year-old victim Quentin Hicks died during the shooting, while 31-year-old victim Tyler Oliverbrooks Acker was wounded. Shutt faces charges of second-degree murder and attempted murder. When Donald Trump defeated all of the other Republican candidates in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election — even though he lost the popular vote — one of the people who was celebrating was paleoconservative Patrick Buchanan, who realized that Trumpism was Buchananism. This week in an in-depth essay for The Bulwark, Never Trump conservative Brian Stewart examines Buchanan's influence on Trumpism, which has replaced Reaganism as the dominant philosophy of the Republican Party. And Stewart argues that Trump has, in essence, turned the party of Ronald Reagan into the party of Patrick Buchanan. The New York City-based Stewart writes, ""Picture this: In a clash and clang of antagonism toward the Republican establishment, a sizable portion of the base of the party congeals around a vociferous, divisive figure…. This rambunctious tribune repudiates both the substance and style of the Republican Party — for decades the vessel for the conservative program — including its vigorous support for free trade and a decent international order…. His speeches infuriate both the Democrats and the GOP establishment, which only cements his bond with the base. Not Donald Trump in 2016, but Pat Buchanan in 1992.""         According to a report from CNN, high-ranking officials in the Arizona Republican Party fear any chance they might have had of reclaiming a U.S. Senate seat has been irreparably crippled by the highly-criticized audit of the 2020 presidential ballots in Maricopa country at the behest of former president Donald Trump. With reports trickling out that the months-long controversial audit uncovered no evidence of widescale fraud that denied Trump the state's 11 electoral votes, Republican campaign consultants worry that a campaign against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) will fall flat because the eventual nominee will undoubtedly have to spend precious time explaining away the failed venture.      In conversations with attendees at Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines, Iowa, the Boston Globe's James Pindell found plenty of evangelicals who approved of Donald Trump's four years in office after voting for him, but want him to stay out of the 2024 presidential race. With Trump making rumblings about running once again after losing to President Joe Biden, Pindell wrote that he talked to 15 self-admitted Trump voters and not a single one expressed any interest in voting for the one-term president again.

577,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/06/how-the-good-guy-with-a-gun-became-a-deadly-american-fantasy/,"At the end of May, it happened again. A mass shooter killed 12 people, this time at a municipal center in Virginia Beach. Employees had been forbidden to carry guns at work, and some lamented that this policy had prevented “good guys” from taking out the shooter. This trope – “the good guy with a gun” – has become commonplace among gun rights activists. Where did it come from? On Dec. 21, 2012 – one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut – National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Ever since then, in response to each mass shooting, pro-gun pundits, politicians and social media users parrot some version of the slogan, followed by calls to arm the teachers, arm the churchgoers or arm the office workers. And whenever an armed citizen takes out a criminal, conservative media outlets pounce on the story. But “the good guy with the gun” archetype dates to long before LaPierre’s 2012 press conference. There’s a reason his words resonated so deeply. He had tapped into a uniquely American archetype, one whose origins I trace back to American pulp crime fiction in my book “Hard-Boiled Crime Fiction and the Decline of Moral Authority.” Other cultures have their detective fiction. But it was specifically in America that the “good guy with a gun” became a heroic figure and a cultural fantasy. Beginning in the 1920s, a certain type of protagonist started appearing in American crime fiction. He often wore a trench coat and smoked cigarettes. He didn’t talk much. He was honorable, individualistic – and armed. These characters were dubbed “hard-boiled,” a term that originated in the late 19th century to describe “hard, shrewd, keen men who neither asked nor expected sympathy nor gave any, who could not be imposed upon.” The word didn’t describe someone who was simply tough; it communicated a persona, an attitude, an entire way of being. Most scholars credit Carroll John Daly with writing the first hard-boiled detective story. Titled “Three Gun Terry,” it was published in Black Mask magazine in May 1923.      The May 1934 issue of Black Mask features Carroll John Daly’s character Race Williams on the cover. Abe Books “Show me the man,” the protagonist, Terry Mack, announces, “and if he’s drawing on me and is a man what really needs a good killing, why, I’m the boy to do it.” Terry also lets the reader know that he’s a sure shot: “When I fire, there ain’t no guessing contest as to where the bullet is going.” From the start, the gun was a crucial accessory. Since the detective only shot at bad guys and because he never missed, there was nothing to fear. Part of the popularity of this character type had to do with the times. In an era of Prohibition, organized crime, government corruption and rising populism, the public was drawn to the idea of a well-armed, well-meaning maverick – someone who could heroically come to the defense of regular people. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, stories that featured these characters became wildly popular. Taking the baton from Daly, authors like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler became titans of the genre. Their stories’ plots differed, but their protagonists were mostly the same: tough-talking, straight-shooting private detectives. In an early Hammett story, the detective shoots a gun out of a man’s hand and then quips he’s a “fair shot – no more, no less.” In a 1945 article, Raymond Chandler attempted to define this type of protagonist: “Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. … He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor, by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it.” As movies became more popular, the archetype bled into the silver screen. Humphrey Bogart played Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade and Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe to great acclaim. By the end of the 20th century, the fearless, gun-toting good guy had become a cultural hero. He had appeared on magazine covers, movie posters, in television credits and in video games. Gun rights enthusiasts have embraced the idea of the “good guy” as a model to emulate – a character role that just needed real people to step in and play it. The NRA store even sells T-shirts with LaPierre’s slogan, and encourages buyers to “show everyone that you’re the ‘good guy’” by buying the T-shirt.      The NRA sells shirts with LaPierre’s quote. NRA Store The problem with this archetype is that it’s just that: an archetype. A fictional fantasy. In pulp fiction, the detectives never miss. Their timing is precise and their motives are irreproachable. They never accidentally shoot themselves or an innocent bystander. Rarely are they mentally unstable or blinded by rage. When they clash with the police, it’s often because they’re doing the police’s job better than the police can. Another aspect of the fantasy involves looking the part. The “good guy with a gun” isn’t just any guy – it’s a white one. In “Three Gun Terry,” the detective apprehends the villain, Manual Sparo, with some tough words: “‘Speak English,’ I says. I’m none too gentle because it won’t do him any good now.” In Daly’s “Snarl of the Beast,” the protagonist, Race Williams, takes on a grunting, monstrous immigrant villain. Could this explain why, in 2018, when a black man with a gun tried to stop a shooting in a mall in Alabama – and the police shot and killed him – the NRA, usually eager to champion good guys with guns, didn’t comment? Most gun enthusiasts don’t measure up to the fictional ideal of the steady, righteous and sure shot. In fact, research has shown that gun-toting independence unleashes much more chaos and carnage than heroism. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study revealed that right-to-carry laws increase, rather than decrease, violent crime. Higher rates of gun ownership is correlated with higher homicide rates. Gun possession is correlated with increased road rage. There have been times when a civilian with a gun successfully intervened in a shooting, but these instances are rare. Those who carry guns often have their own guns used against them. And a civilian with a gun is more likely to be killed than to kill an attacker. Even in instances where a person is paid to stand guard with a gun, there’s no guarantee that he’ll fulfill this duty. Hard-boiled novels have sold in the hundreds of millions. The movies and television shows they inspired have reached millions more. What started as entertainment has turned into a durable American fantasy. Maintaining it has become a deadly American obsession.

580,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/06/22/dallas-lone-wolf-shooting-shows-how-were-always-in-danger-even-with-improved-security/,"newsCrime By Kevin Krause 5:00 AM on Jun 22, 2019 CDT It's a fear that's crept into everyone's mind. You're walking down a street on an ordinary day, turn a corner, and hear a barrage of gunfire from an assault rifle. The shooter has multiple clips of ammo and no fear of death. That was reality on Monday for Don Miles, who was walking to the Commerce Street entrance of the Earle Cabell Federal Building when Dallas' latest lone wolf assault happened. He ran across the street, into traffic, to get away. ""I really didn't know exactly where the bullets were coming from. The shots were just ringing out. People were running out the door. I didn't know if he was inside or where he was,"" Miles said during an interview Friday. Our security is better. Our response is faster. And yet potential targets remain everywhere. When Brian Clyde attacked the federal courthouse before he was killed by officers in a gun battle, it was at least the third time since 2015 that an aggrieved, heavily armed gunman opened fire on police in and around downtown Dallas. Although officers on the scene stopped Clyde's short-lived rampage, someone suitably armed who is highly motivated can get into almost any facility to potentially commit mass murder, security experts say. There is also the risk that creating fortresslike defenses in major cities will encourage terrorists and other bad actors to seek out so-called soft targets like movie theaters and restaurants, or target small towns or suburbs where security is light or non-existent. Despite advances in high-tech security measures, from place to place and event to event, the level of security can be vastly different. It's been a reality for a long time now, since 9/11 or even the Oklahoma City bombing of the '90s, that we are always in danger. Experts say the best thing you can do to stay safe is to remain alert and report suspicious activity. ""There is no silver bullet to any of this stuff,"" said Nadav Morag, an associate professor at Sam Houston State University and chairman of its security studies department. Even after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, Americans were willing to tolerate only so much infringement of their freedoms to increase security, Morag said. Metal detectors are one thing. But U.S. national security agencies cannot, for example, monitor our social media, internet or phone activity, and interactions without the reasonable suspicion that requires a warrant. Even if a family member reports an unstable relative, authorities are limited in what they can do — unless the person has committed a crime or is an immediate threat to themselves or others. ""We have to accept that this is a reality,"" Morag said. ""It's a trade-off."" If we as a society want to have unfettered access to guns, ""we have to live with the repercussions,"" said Morag, who served as senior director of the Israeli National Security Council. In some big cities like New York, concrete barriers and other obstacles are showing up in public spaces to try to prevent terrorists from using vehicles to mow down pedestrians. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, and facial recognition software is beginning to be used at large sporting venues, a situation eerily reminiscent of North Korea or a George Orwell novel. It's also not unusual to see heavily armed police milling about during large events. While prevention remains a tricky subject, response efforts have improved greatly. Kevin Oden, Dallas' assistant emergency management coordinator, said Dallas is as prepared and equipped for active shooter events as any other city in the nation. Last year was the Office of Emergency Management's most ambitious, having pulled off the city's largest full-scale mass casualty incident exercise at the Majestic Theatre. Police officers are equipped with techniques and firepower that were once the sole purview of SWAT. And Dallas medics with ballistic gear can now enter disaster and mass-casualty scenes to rescue and treat victims without waiting hours for the threat to subside, Oden said. ""That's where we have to be,"" he said. Monday's attack on the courthouse was the perfect example of the most difficult threat to detect: the self-radicalized lone wolf. Confidential informants and other intelligence efforts that traditionally have worked against terrorist organizations are useless against this person, whose methods and motivations are typically known only to himself. There is no one harder to stop than the person who doesn't care what happens to himself, said Kyle Olson, a Virginia-based security consultant. ""If you are willing to die for your cause, you are a very, very potent weapon,"" he said. ""It's a big challenge."" Still, experts point out that Monday's attack was a relatively rare event. Government statistics reveal a total of 160 active shooter events in America from 2000 to 2013. The FBI defines active shooters as those ""actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas,"" not including incidents tied to gang or drug violence. The median number of deaths was two. And just 1 percent of murder victims were killed during such incidents, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""We give them more credit than they deserve,"" Morag says, because the threat is often not proportional to the response. The shooters are trying to create a big impact, he said. In Dallas, few have forgotten the downtown sniper who in 2016 killed five officers in an ambush following a protest march. A police robot killed him hours later. And many remember the 2015 attack on the police headquarters building in which the shooter was killed before he could harm anyone. Miles, 66, a Dallas charter school building director, said he is still shaken by Monday's attack. ""It scared me to death,"" he said. ""I'm looking to the left and right all the time. It makes you paranoid because you don't know what might happen any day."" Morag said people are more likely to die in vehicle accidents than in a mass shooting or bombing. But people don't drive less because of it, he said. Israelis are willing to tolerate considerably more intrusion into their lives for security, such as checkpoints, given the threat level in that country, Morag said. How much Americans will tolerate is a ""function of how threatened we feel,"" he said. He called it a ""psychological function."" Immediately following the September 2001 attacks, lawmakers passed the Patriot Act that added a number of restrictive security measures. But as the threat recedes, the public is less likely to agree to laws and policies that limit freedoms, Morag said. Americans don't seem receptive, for example, to the idea of metal detectors at entrances to shopping malls and movie theaters, he said. Americans, he said, do not want to become like China, which is investing heavily in technology such as artificial intelligence, facial recognition and the monitoring of social media — and not all in the name of security. Olson, the security consultant, said absolute security is unattainable. By definition, we live in an open society, he said. Commerce and schooling ""demand that people be able to come and go."" Whether it's a business, a school or a courthouse, people will walk through the front door who you don't know, Olson said. Danny Defenbaugh, a longtime FBI supervisor in Dallas who now runs a security and investigative firm, said the one person who's most important for security is the receptionist, who will be the first to come into contact with a potential threat. ""You find that they don't have any training,"" he said. Companies and governments are investing more in surveillance systems like video cameras, but Olson said their use is limited. ""My problem with that is, it's good at telling you what happened after the fact,"" Olson said. Some cities such as London are using cameras proactively, he said. They have people who monitor live feeds to look for certain behavior, he said. In Sydney, Australia, security workers will follow people on CCTV over a multiblock area if they view something suspicious, he said. But that, Olson added, has ""a certain Big Brother quality to it."" ""In the abstract, I don't like the idea of Big Brother watching me all the time,"" he said. But should something bad happen, Olson said, people will immediately ask: Why weren't you watching this person? Oden, the city's emergency management official, said his department is gearing up for a regional full-scale exercise called the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attack. The event, paid for by a grant, will help North Texas prepare for an attack on par with the deadly Easter bombings in Sri Lanka earlier this year. On that day, three churches and three hotels were targeted in coordinated suicide bombings. The terrorist attacks killed 258 people, and wounded at least 500 others. Oden said the exercise will be held as soon as March 2020. Another tool Dallas police have is called a ""fusion center,"" where criminal intelligence data is collected and shared among federal, state and local police looking for threat indicators. The city's fusion center provides ""real time tactical intelligence to officers in the field responding to emergency calls,"" according to the Dallas police website. Matthew J. DeSarno, the new special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, has worked in counterterrorism during his career in big cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C. He said cooperation and information sharing among law enforcement in North Texas is the best he's ever seen. ""That's critical to protecting cities because the first responders will be local police departments,"" he said. Oden said Dallas police do a great job developing relationships with private security and having plenty of officers in the downtown area that's home to prime targets for terrorists like City Hall. But that can do only so much. ""There will never be enough cops, enough security,"" Oden said. Clyde, the 22-year-old courthouse shooter, was considered a lone wolf or, as the FBI calls them, ""homegrown violent extremists."" Defenbaugh says they are usually young men who are ""determined to make a name for themselves."" DeSarno called it a challenging problem because you have ""mental health issues combined with some multiple grievances."" ""We are taking steps to be more effective against that threat,"" he said. DeSarno, Oden and other security experts say it is up to the public to act as a first line of defense and report any suspicious activity. That includes warning signs on social media, Oden said, such as a fascination with guns and violence. It creates a challenge for loved ones who are around a potentially violent person, DeSarno said. In many cases, people are close enough to see some warning signs. DeSarno said they should not be fearful of embarrassment if they are wrong. They should dial 911, he said. That actually happened in Clyde's case. A relative warned the FBI in 2016 that he shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun because he was depressed and suicidal. But because there was no specific threat, the FBI said it had no legal reason to pursue an investigation. DeSarno said he doesn't want citizens to be paranoid and fearful. But they should raise their level of ""situational awareness,"" rather than walking around with ""earbuds on and your face in your phone."" Know where building exits are, for example. If you had to evacuate a building, where would you go? ""For the average person day to day, just live your life and take a second sometimes to be aware of your surroundings,"" Oden said. Miles, still shaken by Monday's shooting, said he has already started. ""I'm definitely going to be watching, if someone even looks suspicious,"" he said.

        Salvador Hernandez Last updated on June 18, 2019, at 10:48 a.m. ET Posted on June 17, 2019, at 10:20 p.m. ET Alex Jones, the infamous conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder, handed over several emails containing child pornography to the lawyers for families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims who have filed a lawsuit against the far-right media figure. The child pornography was found in 12 emails of more than 57,000 messages that were turned over by Jones to lawyers representing families of the school victims, Jones' attorney Norm Pattis said. One of the images was discovered when consultants hired by attorneys for the Sandy Hook families began to review the files, prompting them to contact the FBI, according to court documents. On his radio show Friday, Jones insinuated he had been the victim of a conspiracy that involved attorneys on the opposite side of the lawsuit planting child pornography in his emails. ""You're trying to set me up with child porn!"" Jones said, while announcing a $1 million reward to his viewers to find and prove the material had been planted. ""Imma get your ass,"" Jones warned. ""One million dollars, one million, you little gang member. One million dollars to put your head on a pike."" Families of students killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012 have sued Jones and Infowars for defamation over his repeated claims that the shooting was a hoax. The lawsuit alleges that Jones and his guests continuously suggested the mass shooting had been faked and that relatives of the victims who spoke out about their loved ones' deaths had been “crisis actors.” Jones has said he believes the shooting occurred, but that it is his right to be able to question the events from the shooting. “I am proud of questioning Sandy Hook,” Jones said during his show Friday. ""I was not the progenitor, or the daddy of it. The public questioned it, so it was the tail wagging the dog.” As part of the lawsuit, Jones had been ordered to turn over thousands of Infowars emails referencing the shooting as part of the lawsuit's discovery process. Ana Márquez-Greene, pictured, was one of 26 people killed in a shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. The trove of data containing the child pornography was handed over to the FBI, which reviewed the material and found additional images in the cache. According to court filings, FBI investigators told attorneys that the pornography — which would be a crime to possess — ""had apparently been sent to Infowars email addresses."" Jones' attorney, Pattis, told BuzzFeed News the emails had not been opened by anyone at Infowars, including Jones. ""Neither he nor his defense, nor for that matter lawyers for plaintiffs knew the material was embedded in emails until a big data processing firm found them,"" Pattis said in an email. It's still unclear where the emails or the images came from, Pattis said, adding that Infowars had seen a ""spike of this sort of thing"" after the 2016 election. But on his show Friday, Jones insinuated the discovery was part of a conspiracy to peg him as a pedophile, and singled out one of the attorneys representing Sandy Hook families. ""We all know who did it,"" Jones said on his show as the camera focused on a Wikipedia entry for Chris Mattei, a trial lawyer for the firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, which filed a suit against Jones. Jones was also seen pounding on the picture of Mattei with his fist. ""What a good American, what a good boy,"" Jones said of Mattei. ""I'm gonna kill..."" he said before trailing off. During the segment, Jones repeatedly denied being being aware of the images and tried repeatedly to link pedophilia and child abuse to Democrats. ""I like women with big giant tits and big asses. I don't like kids like you goddamn rapists,"" Jones said. ""I literally would never have sex with children, I don't like having sex with children, I would never have sex with children. I am not a Democrat. I am not a liberal. I do not cut children's genitals off like the left does."" In a court filing Monday afternoon, attorneys representing Sandy Hook families asked the judge in the case to review video from Jones' show and accused him of threatening Mattei and his firm. Pattis denied that the Infowars host was threatening anyone and said ""to suggest otherwise is to engage in precious pleading."" The day after the show was broadcast, Jones apologized for cursing and backtracked from his accusations suggesting that the images had been planted. ""I'm not saying that the lawyers for Sandy Hook families set this up or did this,"" Jones said. ""Whoever sent this, for whatever reason, this shows the escalation and the insanity of all of this."" Jones also backed off his $1 million reward offer for those he suggested planted the pornography, saying he ""did become unhinged"" during the rant Friday. “Technically, I did not issue the offer correctly,” Jones said. “(Pattis is) going to explain this. So the original press release they put out stands: $100,000.”  Salvador Hernandez is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

Grace Beahm Alford/Staff Four years after a self-avowed white supremacist gunned down nine black worshippers who welcomed him into their Bible study, Charleston area churches are striving to strike a balance between ramped-up security and open-door accessibility. The June 2015 deadly shooting an international conversation about safety in sanctuaries. Though a handful of churches were employing off-duty police officers prior to the Emanuel AME Church attack, several have since hired off-duty law enforcement for Sunday morning worship and nighttime Bible studies, along with updating security surveillance systems and active-shooter training to protect themselves in places of worship. Those affected mainly have been minority groups assembling in synagogues, mosques and historically African-American churches, whose personal safety and property have been targeted by far-right white extremists. For many congregations, it has been a challenge to take necessary precautions while maintaining a hospitable environment. St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, a congregation located a few blocks from Emanuel AME Church, hired an off-duty officer shortly after the mass shooting. The Rev. Eric Childers, pastor of St. Matthew's, said security issues can be divisive since some church members feel it sends an unwelcoming message. The action raised concerns within his congregation, he said. Ultimately, church members decided that uniformed law enforcement would act as a deterrent, but the officer would patrol outside the sanctuary. “We initially asked the officer to be visible but invisible,"" Childers said. Mt. Zion AME Church on Glebe Street bolstered security efforts as well. Ushers, the first to greet guests as they enter the sanctuary for worship, were trained to identify suspicious persons, such as those who choose to sit in the balcony though there are many available pews on the ground floor, said the Rev. Kylon Middleton. The multi-ethnic congregation has kept its doors open to the community, actively recruiting parishioners of different races and backgrounds. Middleton, a close friend of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was among those killed at Emanuel, regularly has engaged in gun violence reform initiatives, prompting many to send him hate mail and death threats, he said. But this hasn't deterred Middleton and Mt. Zion from serving the community. The church hosts several community events, including public discussions on racism. ""We can’t be afraid to open our doors and so skeptical that we miss opportunities to connect with people,"" Middleton said. In North Charleston, Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church's 1,500-member congregation had a security team that was ""pretty relaxed"" before the Emanuel tragedy, said A.A. Williams, who heads the church's security team. Now, a 14-member team that includes retired law enforcement and military members helps keep the sanctuary safe, and the church has plans to update its video surveillance. The police department encourages churches to implement in-house safety measures. Law enforcement adds an extra layer of protection, but ultimately, the department can't station an officer at every house of worship, Charleston Police Department Deputy Chief Jerome Taylor said. Some small churches can't afford security. The pay rate for off-duty Charleston police officers is $30 per hour. Congregations who can't afford to hire an officer still can  ask the department for increased patrol, Taylor said. Locking side doors during worship services, updating security surveillance system and creating an ""all hazard"" plan that outlines steps to be taken in case of an emergency are essential, he said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also offers materials that help organizations guard against violent perpetrators. Members should be trained to look out for suspicious activity, such as guests with backpacks. If there's any reason to believe danger looms, parishioners should contact law enforcement. “You can’t be too cautious,"" Taylor said. ""If it doesn’t look right to you, and you are very familiar with the environment, it's not right. ... If you see something that’s not right, say something.” Some congregations are careful not to overreact, noting that safety and hospitality go hand in hand and many houses of worship receive homeless people simply seeking food or a place to stay. At St. Matthew's, ushers are trained to engage in conversations with strangers. If someone in the church behaves in a manner that warrants concern, that's an opportunity to go talk to them, said Paul Visentin, who heads the church's security task force. “Most of the time, you’re going to find out your suspicions are unfounded,"" he said.
