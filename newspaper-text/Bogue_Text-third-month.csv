training standards months ago lived mom hard say sure issues may contributed radicalization cases might personal grievances rather political ones lead radicalization example white man may concerns immigration specifically white americans losing majority status coming decades also might feel like bring issues public discourse without quickly dismissed racist sees issues go unaddressed become worse might dig deeper answer might time lead extremism rather personal meaning someone might deeply feel political grievances articulated drawn movement articulation daveed gartenstein-ross counterterrorism scholar foundation defense democracies told groups take advantage types issues try recruit people often downright devious tactics altier gave example saw research white supremacists interviewed one fellow said would go schools would put things racist fliers black children lockers black kids would think certain white kids although white kids actually putting fliers black kids would beat white supremacists would come protect them. lock someone groups foster radicalization may start interacting group radicalized altier explained hanging people might become radicalized … actually group constantly subjected ideology reinforced people around may cut people becomes self-reinforcing mechanism. various extremist groups isis white supremacists look people socially isolated lack purpose life groups reel people giving sense purpose begin radicalize also one reason altier argued people eventually get groups realizing really believe particularly cases involve mental illness issue extremist group took advantage course plenty true hardcore believers causes well always case covers contributors self-radicalization groups take advantage people radicalize still lot debate leads radicalization common factors important examples give something rough consensus experts spoke showing many kinds issues lead someone extremist views acts radicalization result messaging extremists deploy attract people specific grievances one way prevent radicalization may develop countermessaging addresses grievances way avoids radicalization context white supremacists part addressing may mean expanding overton window meaning acceptable talk public discourse put things limits empower bad actors talk things people willing gartenstein-ross said instance right difficult white man bring concerns changing racial demographics without getting labeled racist maybe concerns anything race may concerned group belongs loses status well economically socially good response could point example new york city diverse still people including white men lead prosperous lives below-average crime rate contrary dog whistles may suggest person never kind discussion dismissed racist concerns changing demographics go away might search answers outside mainstream might lead extremist group especially true experiences sociologists call white fragility white people asked answer potential racism become defensive pushing denial done anything wrong cases hardening racist attitudes much previous piece wrote research mean people call racism front suggest public political discourse race may need better address underlying concerns lead people racism also making clear racism unacceptable may comfortable conversation potentially necessary gartenstein-ross pointed president donald trump rise less extreme example much 2016 election trump considered long-shot candidate someone held far many extreme unconventional views become president may extreme unconventional views made successful reflecting concerns people immigrants muslims appealed way candidates underlying concerns behind racist views addressed trump opponents instead often dismissed trump crude racist insane another example countermessaging several experts pointed life hate organization largely made former members far-right movement directly intervenes radicalized individuals help leave extremist organizations lifestyles organization explains personal experience highly unique skill sets developed sophisticated understanding draws individuals extremist groups equally important leave compassion opposite judgment understand roles compassion empathy play healing individuals communities. countermessaging also involve robbing extremist messages platform example twitter ban people explicitly racist views trolling people color getting others harass makes much harder impossible someone use platform get message issue radicalization issue violence bergen said lot people radical ideas stupid ideas country going commit acts violence. end one issue several experts raised people need vigilant communities even families watching signs radicalism potential violence need give information authorities necessary consider chilling statistic 2014 study gill horgan deckert 64 cases family friends aware individual intent engage terrorism-related activity offender verbally told them. although right-wing offenders compared others less likely … make verbal statements friends family intent beliefs. findings suggest friends family coworkers play important roles efforts seek prevent disrupt lone-actor terrorist plots researchers concluded many cases aware individual intent engage violence report information relevant authorities. consider warning signs attack charlottesville based reports

fairly vocal racist views told mom would go rally alt-right umbrella term white nationalists charlottesville authorities family peers took warning signs threats seriously kinds cases attack could although hard say certain prevented experts readily acknowledge difficult people want report children family friends police cases truly necessary part involves taking right-wing terrorism seriously serious threat one often underplayed altier said inherent bias frame islamist versus far right-wing white supremacist terrorism. pointed charlottesville car attack example guy ran people car muslim deliberately ran people car immediately would terrorist attack. downplaying far-right violence way society diminishes sense urgency people might otherwise hear relatives hinting acting violently makes harder actually prevent attacks experts also suggested addressing root causes radicalization terrorism particularly socioeconomic mental health issues turn kinds grievances lead extremism gets fairly weedy discussion exactly create stronger social safety net jobs better mental health care system exactly best prioritization resources experts skeptical solutions root causes would much effect people jobs families end committing terrorist attacks look perpetrators 2015 san bernardino shooting married child husband also held job plenty white supremacists mentally ill received good education
