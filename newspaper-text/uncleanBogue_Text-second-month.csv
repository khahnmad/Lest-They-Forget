4,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/tBFIqv5BSUI/,"The New York Times has published a piece that details how Sarah Palin is, well, suing the New York Times. The defamation lawsuit revolves around an editorial piece that was published on the same day of the recent shooting at a congressional baseball practice (which injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others). In the legal papers, Palin alleges that the newspaper included a harmful statement about her that it “knew to be false.” The piece in question — called “America’s Lethal Politics” — drew connections between a Palin political ad and the 2011 mass shooting at an Arizona town hall meeting, which killed six people and wounded Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords. The editorial further suggested that the massacre was prompted by political incitement due to the ad’s “cross hairs” illustration. Upon complaint from the former VP candidate and Alaskan governor, the paper published a correction, which Palin found inadequate: The editorial said there was a link between political incitement and the mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded Representative Gabby Giffords and said that Ms. Palin’s “political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” The Times later issued a correction, saying that there was no established link between political statements and the shooting and that the map circulated by Ms. Palin’s PAC had depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath the stylized cross hairs. As the New York Post points out, the correction was a particularly embarrassing one because the ad’s illustration was not as described in the editorial, which was easy enough to disprove. Further, there was no causal link established between Palin’s ad and the Giffords shooting because the gunman — Jared Loughner — had grown obsessed with the congresswoman beginning in 2007, long before Palin’s ad surfaced. At press time, the New York Times committed to “vigorously” defending itself against the suit.

6,http://www.rttnews.com/story.aspx?Id=2788155,"Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate, filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Co. on Tuesday for the alleged defamation in a recent editorial. In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Palin stated that the editorial falsely portrayed her as responsible for inciting the 2011 shooting of Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords. According to her, The Times violated the law and its own policies when it linked her to the mass shooting. Palin is seeking more than $75,000 in damages, according to the lawsuit. The newspaper published the editorial online on June 14 in the wake of the shooting at a baseball field where Republican lawmakers were practicing for an annual charity game. Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, was critically injured in that shooting.  The editorial cited a link between political incitement and the mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded Giffords. The paper stated that Palin's ""political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."" Later, The Times issued a correction noting that there was no established link between Palin's ad and the shooting. It also stated that the map circulated by Palin's PAC had depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers. In the Twitter account also, the paper sent out the correction about the lack of a link, and apologized. In the lawsuit, Palin said that The Times's response ""did not approach the degree of the retraction and apology necessary and warranted by The Times's false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited murder.""

12,http://www.ibtimes.com/carmichael-show-canceled-nbc-after-season-3-amid-controversial-mass-shooting-episode-2560145,"NBC has decided to cancel “The Carmichael Show” after only three seasons. However, the episodes that have yet to air in Season 3 will still be released as scheduled. Cast member Jerrod Carmichael confirmed the cancellation via a statement released to Deadline. “For three seasons, (okay 2.5), I got to make a show that I love with my friends. It’s something I’ve wanted to do since I was 13. Now, I’m excited to go make other things that I love. Thank you to every person who worked on or watched ‘The Carmichael Show,’” he wrote. Read: “World of Dance” officially renewed by NBC for Season 2 Since its inception, the series has received positive reviews from viewers and critics. However, Deadline reported earlier this month that NBC is not yet close to renewing the show for a fourth season. NBC also released a statement expressing their gratitude to the cast and people behind the multi-camera sitcom. “We are enormously proud of ‘The Carmichael Show’ and Jerrod’s talent and vision to do a classic family sitcom that also taps into issues and relevant stories from the real world. We thank and salute the cast, crew and producers – and especially Jerrod – for three critically-acclaimed seasons,” the statement read. Meanwhile, “The Carmichael Show” also made headlines this month after NBC decided to postpone the release of the show’s mass shooting-focused installment. The episode was originally scheduled to air on the network on June 14, but was pushed back to June 28. After the network decided to push back the mass shooting episode, Carmichael released a statement saying that NBC should follow through and release the installment as planned. As of late, the network has already released a total of six episodes out of the 13 confirmed installments for Season 3. On June 30, 20th Century Fox TV presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman released a statement expressing their love for Carmichael, his cast, showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the writers and production team. “It’s a rarity that a comedy series tackles the social and political issues of the day in such a clever and hilariously funny way. This show was special, and we will miss it,” they said. “The Carmichael Show” airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EDT on NBC.",2017-07-01 02:18:21,‘The Carmichael Show’ Canceled By NBC After Season 3 Amid Controversial Mass Shooting Episode,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

Two of the victims are in critical condition, but all of the victims are expected to survive. No-one has been arrested, and there are no suspects at this stage, Little Rock Chief of Police Kenton Buckner said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon. #UPDATE 28 injured in the W 6th Street Shooting, 25 from GSW's and 3 from unrelated injuries. At this time, ALL are expected to survive. The shooting unfolded at around 2:30 a.m. at the Power Ultra Lounge nightclub after ""some sort of dispute ensued in the audience during event,"" said Chief Buckner. Off-duty officers working the parking lot during the event saw some members with the headline performer, rapper Finese 2 Tymes, enter the venue from a second entrance with a weapon after police tried to stop them at the main entrance. Buckner estimates about 20 to 40 shots were fired inside of the venue as a dispute erupted between two groups in the audience, but it is still not confirmed who fired the weapons. A number of people were injured after being trampled while they attempted to exit the building, while a couple were hurt when they jumped out of windows in the two-story building. The oldest victim is 35-years-old and youngest victim is 16, Buckner added. All victims are African-American. AT THIS HOUR: Police still investigating shooting at Power Ultra Lounge in LR. 17 shot, no suspects. LIVE update co… https://t.co/jzx8VMEDXS Buckner said the shooting may be related to ongoing violence in Little Rock related to rival groups in the area. But he emphasized the importance of not conflating rap music with violence. ""I don’t want to broad brush that genre of music,"" he said. ""I don’t want anyone to broad brush or anything because most of the people in there had nothing to do with the conflict they just happened to be true victims of stupidity."" Facebook The event taking place was a concert by rapper Finese 2 Tymes, according to the venue's Facebook event page. ""Prayers go to the innocent people and there family that came out to support me, last night in Little Rock Ark.,"" the rapper wrote in a Facebook post. ""The violence is not for the club people. We all come with 1 motive at the end of the day, and that's to have fun."" Reporters for local ABC affiliate KATV shared video purporting to be cellphone footage of the shooting as it unfolded.

Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola told reporters the lounge would be shut down and that the operators would be evicted. He also said he would work with state agencies to crack down on people on parole and probation who carry weapons. ""We got to take these repeat gun offenders off the streets,"" he said. ""We believe this is a small group of repeat offenders bent on violent crime."" By Saturday night, the night club had been officially evicted by its landlord, according to the Associated Press. A representative for the landlord posted the eviction notice on the door of the club late Saturday, notifying the owners that they must vacate the property within three days ""due to your failure to maintain the premises in a safe condition."" In a statement Saturday, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he and his wife were praying for the recovery of the victims. He also pointed to what seemed to be a rash of violent incidents in Little Rock, and said the state would be providing resources to the city to address the increase in violence. ""Little Rock's crime problem appears to be intensifying,"" Hutchinson said in the statement.

X OUR PICKS: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Police say 25 people were shot after gunfire rang out Saturday at a rap show at a downtown Little Rock nightclub, prompting pleas from top leaders to curb the growing violence in Arkansas’ capital city. Police said the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge was the result of a dispute among clubgoers and not an active shooter or terror-related incident. Little Rock police said Saturday that 25 people were shot and three others suffered unrelated injuries. All were expected to survive, police said. Police early Saturday cordoned off the block as crime-scene technicians gathered evidence from inside and outside the club. Glass from the club’s second story windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters that “some sort of dispute broke out between people inside” the club and that there are “probably multiple shooting suspects.” A video posted online by a club patron, Darryl Rankin, showed a packed house for Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tenn. About a half-minute into a break in the raucous concert, several bursts of gunfire rang out — more than 24 shots in an 11-second period. Rankin told the Associated Press that he was recording the show on Facebook Live when gunfire erupted and that one of his friends is now at a hospital with a bullet “stuck in his spine.” Courtney Swanigan said she was near the front of the club with her sister when gunfire erupted about an hour into the show. They were not injured. She didn’t know what led to the shooting, but she said she saw someone onstage with a handgun amid the melee. “I just closed my eyes, got down on the ground and put my hands on my head,” Swanigan said. A posting in all capital letters on Finese 2Tymes’ Facebook page expressed thoughts and prayers for those injured and said: “THE VIOLENCE IS NOT FOR THE CLUB PEOPLE. WE ALL COME WITH 1 MOTIVE AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND THATS TO HAVE FUN.” The shooting follows a week in which there have been about a dozen drive-by shootings in Little Rock, though there’s no indication the events are linked. “Little Rock’s crime problem appears to be intensifying,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “Every few days it seems a high profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning’s event. I have spoken this morning with Mayor Stodola and I have offered both my heart felt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community.” Early Saturday, Raida Bunche waited outside the club after she had heard from a friend that her son had been at the club. Later Saturday morning, she said she found out her son ran out once the shooting began and was unharmed. “I’m sick of all the killing and I’m tired of all the shooting, the kids getting hurt,” Bunche said. Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials suspended the club’s alcohol license hours after the shooting occurred and set a hearing for July 10. “We feel the events which are alleged to have occurred warrant our decision to suspend liquor sales at this location pending further action by the board,” Mary Robin Casteel, director of Alcoholic Beverage Control, said in a statement. The club’s Facebook page promoted Friday night’s show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appears to be a gun at the camera. A call to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes’ booking agent wasn’t immediately returned Saturday. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said on Facebook that more information would be released at a news conference Saturday afternoon. “My heart is broken this morning — my prayers are with the victims of this tragedy,” he wrote. He went on to add, “We are committed to doing everything possible to bring safety to our city. We need everyone to help.” In May, one person was killed and six people were hurt in a mass shooting at a downtown concert in Jonesboro, Ark., about 115 miles northeast of Little Rock. In that case, two men were charged with first-degree murder and six counts of first-degree battery. Arkansas lawmakers earlier this year approved a measure expanding where concealed handguns can be carried, including bars if allowed by owners, for licensees who undergo additional training. The law takes effect in September, but the training likely won’t be available until early next year.

18,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/02/rapper-who-was-performing-when-shots-rang-out-litt/,"The rapper who was performing at a downtown Little Rock club when shots rang out Saturday morning has been arrested on an unrelated charge in Alabama, and he is considered a ""person of interest"" in the Little Rock case, authorities said. Ricky Hampton, who works under the name Finese 2Tymes, was performing at Side Effects Club in Birmingham Saturday night. The U.S. Marshal Service arrested him along with 25-year-old Kentrell Gwynn as the two men were returning to the club, according to multiple media reports. The Marshal Service said Hampton's arrest was on an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault with a gun in Forrest City. Little Rock Police Department spokesman Steve Moore said Hampton's arrest was not related to the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge in Little Rock, where 25 people were wounded by gunfire and three more injured in other ways. When ATF officers searched Hampton's silver Mercedes, they retrieved two handguns and an AK-47, KATV reported. Records show Hampton was booked into the Jefferson County jail in Birmingham shortly after 3:30 a.m. He was being held there without bail. Little Rock Police spokesman Lt. Steve McClanahan said later that Hampton will be extradited back to Little Rock to face a federal weapon charge tied to the Forrest City case. Authorities in Little Rock hope to talk to him then about the nightclub shooting. ""We know that he was there at the lounge, he was a performer, he left prior to our arrival, we do need to talk with him because we can put him at the scene, so he is a person of interest,"" McClanahan said. Records listed the charge against Hampton as being a fugitive from justice. Check back for updates and read Monday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.

20,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/03/two-killings-push-lr-total-to-29-201707/,"Little Rock detectives Sunday morning began investigating the city's 28th and 29th homicides of 2017. Police responded to the first -- an apparent murder-suicide -- just before 3:30 a.m. at 1600 Elm St., according to Lt. Steven McClanahan, a Little Rock Police Department spokesman. Officers entered an apartment at the complex and found Anna Williamson, 28, of Little Rock dead inside. McClanahan said Williamson didn't appear to have suffered gunshot wounds and that a cause of death won't be released until the medical examiner has made a final determination. In a nearby apartment, police found the body of Williamson's boyfriend, Ernest Purdiman, 28, of Little Rock with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. [INTERACTIVE: Map shows locations of all homicides in Little Rock in 2017] Police believe Purdiman, who didn't live at the apartment complex, killed Williamson before shooting himself, McClanahan said. A crowd of residents gathered outside the apartment just before noon Sunday. Several claimed to know the suspect and victim, but they declined to talk about either person or their deaths. Homicide detectives were summoned again at about 8:15 a.m. after a family member found Naomi Estrada, 36, of Little Rock dead at her home at 46 Westmont Circle in southwest Little Rock. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] Estrada, too, didn't appear to have been shot, and her cause of death won't be released until the state Crime Laboratory conducts an autopsy, police said. Detectives are searching for a suspect who knew Estrada, but no name or information about that suspect was released. ""We want the public to know that neither of these incidents were random in nature,"" McClanahan said. He added that neither incident was connected to Saturday morning's mass shooting at a downtown club, Power Ultra Lounge, nor the recent spate of violent crimes linked to feuding gangs. Estrada's neighborhood, which was lined with crime-watch signs, was quiet as coroners removed her body from the home Sunday morning. A child's tricycle and other toys filled the carport, and about a dozen potted plants lined the front of her small blue house. The Rev. Benny Johnson of Arkansas Stop the Violence -- a group that raises awareness of crime -- rallied a group of city leaders, clergy and state legislators at the Little Rock Police Department's 12th Street substation on Sunday afternoon. Johnson, who organized the gathering after Saturday's mass shooting left 28 injured, criticized local and state officials. Their response to Saturday's shooting, Johnson said, far outweighed responses to violence in areas like the one surrounding the 12th Street police substation. ""We should have an outcry over every shooting that occurs, not just those north of Interstate 630,"" Johnson said.

Less than two minutes remaining. Opponent driving inside the 30. Fourth-and-10. Which player - regardless of era - do you want rushing the quarterback? Would it be a viable move to inquire about the veteran corner from the Patriots? Stephon Gilmore is clearly unhappy with his current situation in New England. It's been a while since you would think of the Dallas Cowboys offensive line and not think of likely future Hall-of-Famers Tyron Smith and Zack Martin. Kellen Moore and Jason Garrett have eerily similar career paths. When it comes to Kellen Moore and Jason Garrett you probably wouldn’t draw a lot of comparisons between the two. It's the ""dead season"" for NFL action, which means we turn our attention towards lists and rankings, as we do each year at this time. We know that football would not be the same without nicknames. The Dallas Cowboys have historically liked having an experienced veteran as the backup to a franchise quarterback. But while Dak Prescott is every bit the latter, Dallas seems to be going with a relative unknown in Garrett Gilbert as the current QB2. The Cowboys edge rusher shed some light on things happening behind the scenes. Randy Gregory has certainly had an interesting career arc thus far, and in a way he’s still just getting started. Since 2018, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper has held the distinction as the No. 1 wideout on the club. Could that be changing soon? Welcome to the Daily Blitz by DSP Media in partnership with CowboysSI.com. What would it take to get Xavien Howard? We are just talking here. Just talking out loud. That’s the whole foundation of coming up with trade ideas, right? The Dallas Cowboys had their eyes set on either Patrick Surtain or Jaycee Horn in the NFL Draft to pair with Trevon Diggs to form a starting duo at cornerback for the foreseeable. Carlos Watkins was drafted by the Houston Texans in the fourth round of the NFL Draft as a player with potential as a pass-rushing defensive tackle. He was seen as an ascending talent, coming into his own as his collegiate career came to a close. There are questions about who makes the Cowboys roster and how the depth chart will look. It is now less than a week until the first Dallas Cowboys 2021 training camp practice in Oxnard. The summer desert is almost over. The Dallas Cowboys will report to training camp in less than a week’s time, and all will finally be right with the world. Across the league, there’s a perception that the NFC East will be a three-team race for the division crown. A division with its fair share of struggles over recent years doesn’t have a clear-cut favorite. What’s in a name? Everything, when it comes to standing the test of time. Actual accomplishments are paramount to being remembered throughout history. Certainly a guy without a catchy nickname can earn his way into the lasting memories of fans and opponents alike, but when that guy has a smooth moniker to accompany him into lore? All Amari Cooper has done since entering the league in 2015 is produce at a high level. However, the disrespect when it comes to where he ranks in terms of the best wide receivers in the NFL continued this week when he failed to make ESPN’s top 10 list. Plus other Cowboys news and analyst from around the league. Stephen Jones admits Cowboys mistake, should’ve ‘Signed Dak the first time around’ - Todd Brock, Cowboys Wire Hind sight is always 20/20. ""This is where I wanted to go. I wanted to be in blue."" That sentence Micah Parsons said moments after he was taken with the 10th overall pick by the Dallas Cowboys last April made him an early fan favorite. The Dallas Cowboys 2021 season will unofficially begin next week in Oxnard, California once training camp commences. Several intriguing rookies will be fighting for early playing time, such as Jabril Cox, Kelvin Joseph, and Nahshon Wright. Dak Prescott’s return under center should certainly be the most-watched storyline for 2021. And rightfully so. But we'll be watching the big guys upfront, too. DALLAS - ""One more, one more,"" said Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott in his final offseason session with personal trainer Josh Hicks.  With In fairness to anyone trying to pick the winner in the NFC East: It's almost never the same team that actually wins it. So should the 2021 selection be a different club than last year? Football season is just about here. We have just about made it to training camp time in the National Football League. It is always a sight for sore eyes after the long offseason. The old saying is, ""Hindsight is 20/20,'' and the Atlanta Falcons vision was nearly perfect in 2020. The Falcons selected cornerback A.J. Terrell 16th overall in the first round from Clemson. Smith has no concerns about Prescott getting back to form after his injury. Mike McCarthy‘s second season in Dallas could be his last unless his team is able to put together a playoff run. The Cowboys currently have only Garrett Gilbert, Cooper Rush and Ben DiNucci behind Prescott. The last time the Cowboys were on the show in 2008, they went 9-7. In 2002, they went 5-11. Dallas missed the playoffs in both seasons. The Cowboys were on the show twice before, and they missed the playoffs the ensuing season in each instance.

24,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/03/darren-mcfadden-went-little-rock-club-after-shooti/,"Dallas Cowboys running back and former Arkansas Razorback Darren McFadden says he went to the scene of a mass shooting in Little Rock because some of his relatives were among the victims. In a statement posted to his Twitter account Monday night, McFadden said he went to the Power Ultra Lounge early Saturday after the shooting to check on family and ""offer any help I could."" McFadden said he went to the downtown club after getting a call from his nephew. ""He told me that he got shot, many other people were shot and that some of my relatives were among those shot,"" McFadden said. ""Out of concern for all of the people affected by this horrible tragedy, I went down to the scene to check on my relatives and to offer any help I could."" McFadden issued the statement about two hours after the news director for Little Rock's NBC and Fox affiliates posted a video on Twitter showing McFadden outside the club as police investigated the shootings. In all, 25 people sustained gunshot wounds in the shooting during a rap concert at the venue and three others were injured trying to escape. Thanks everyone for checking in and praying for my family. Just to answer a few questions: pic.twitter.com/QTAF0mbVIR [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] No suspects have been named, though authorities in Alabama did later arrest the performer — Ricky Hampton, who raps under the name Finese 2Tymes. A federal complaint has been filed against Hampton related to a shooting outside a Forrest City club days earlier. He has been called a person of interest in the Little Rock shooting. Authorities said at a news conference that the club shooting may be tied to an ongoing dispute between feuding Little Rock groups. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported last month that eight unsolved shootings in Little Rock were believed to be connected and that three of them occurred outside McFadden's mother's home. One of those eight shootings injured McFadden's niece. Read Tuesday's Democrat-Gazette for full details Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

28,http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/ml/gay-pride-events-proliferate-but-yankees-remain-a-holdout/2329770,"NEW YORK — On a recent Saturday night at Citi Field, the New York Mets rolled out the red (and orange, yellow, green, blue and violet) carpet for the gay community. The Coca-Cola sign in the outfield was lit up in rainbow colors. The Kiss Cam was filled with same-sex couples smooching. The color guard carried a rainbow flag. And gay officers from the New York and Nassau County police departments were honored, as was a gay war veteran. The Mets are hardly alone in offering such welcoming gestures. The NBA had its own float, with commissioner Adam Silver aboard, in the Pride March in Manhattan last month. That same day, the Cubs' World Series trophy — draped in a rainbow flag — rode on a float in Chicago's parade. And many sports teams, including a large majority in baseball, have hosted gay-themed events. But one team that has not done so is the New York Yankees, even though their city helped give birth to the modern gay rights movement. That most teams have chosen to stage a pride day or night at their ballparks is not surprising, because thematic promotions to draw fans have long been part of baseball's culture. Those events have ranged from the infamous Disco Demolition Night once staged by the Chicago White Sox to the Mets' Jewish and Irish heritage nights. The San Francisco Giants will host an African-American heritage night in September. The Yankees have in recent years largely shied away from promotions with an ethnic or cultural flavor, although there are regular instances when they honor a cause with a brief pregame ceremony, such as last year's Puerto Rican Day Parade. And while the Yankees have chosen to refrain from holding a gay pride event at Yankee Stadium, a team spokesman, Jason Zillo, said there had been involvement behind the scenes. Among the examples he cited: the work by general manager Brian Cashman and assistant general manager Jean Afterman with organizations that assist lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths; a pregame ceremony last year to acknowledge those killed in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando; and an invitation to Billy Bean, the gay Major League Baseball executive who promotes inclusion, to speak with Yankees players on the major- and minor-league levels. ""Everyone of every nationality, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation and/or preference is welcome at Yankee Stadium every day,"" Zillo said in a statement. ""We are a long-term believer in diversity and inclusion, and have always looked to create a safe and supportive environment for all fans to enjoy their experience here."" Years ago, the doors of the old Yankee Stadium were opened for the closing ceremony of the 1994 Gay Games, and 40,000 people showed up. Nevertheless, in an era when Major League Baseball has taken steps to promote inclusiveness, most notably with the hiring of Bean in 2014, the Yankees have shown no inclination to hold a night for LGBT fans. The Cubs are believed to be the first team to have had such an event, in 2001, and by the end of this season, only three teams besides the Yankees — the Los Angeles Angels, the Cincinnati Reds and the Milwaukee Brewers — will apparently not have had one, according to the website Outsports.com and news reports. (In addition to the Yankees, the Angels confirmed that they had not had a pride event. The Brewers and the Reds did not respond to requests for comment.) ""If big-market teams like the Dodgers, Cubs and Nationals can do it, it begs the question: Why aren't the Yankees doing it?"" said Bill Gubrud, who helped organize the initial event at Wrigley Field. The Yankees, not unlike their uniforms, which look essentially the same on Aaron Judge as they did on Joe DiMaggio, are often not quick to change. They have been steadfast in their decades-old grooming policy, which keeps players from having long hair or beards. And while the Mets and other teams have extended netting down the foul lines this season in an effort to further protect fans from foul balls and shattered bats, the Yankees have not taken that step. Most pride days, or nights, are not generated by a major-league team itself, but by an outside organization. Gubrud was selling ads for a gay newspaper in Chicago when he called the Cubs years ago about buying an ad. When they agreed, he asked how many tickets would have to be sold to have a gay-themed event at Wrigley Field. He was told 2,000. ""I'll take them all,"" Gubrud said. The Philadelphia Phillies began hosting their pride night soon after, when Larry Felzer, a lawyer, organized what would become an annual event. The Phillies took it over last year, but the event's infrastructure had been established by Felzer. The Dodgers' pride night, begun four years ago, has become so popular that promoters are bidding to host it. David Kilmnick, chief executive of the LGBT Network, spurred the Mets to resume their pride night last season (the team had one more than a decade earlier), and he also approached the Yankees. He met with Yankees representatives at a diversity meeting sponsored by Major League Baseball during spring training in 2016 and pitched them for 15 minutes on the idea of a pride event as well as workplace-sensitivity training. It was the last he heard from the team, he said. ""I haven't received any interest,"" he added. Though Bean has worked closely with the Yankees in other areas of inclusiveness, the team has not spoken with him about a pride event. ""If the Yankees approached me, I'd be front and center in getting it done or putting it out there,"" Bean said. ""This is a process. I don't want teams to feel like they're pressured. It has to be organic."" Bean, who spoke at the Yankees' major-league and minor-league camps in spring training, said that the team had been supportive and that the conversation about pride events was relatively new. ""The idea of a team not hosting a pride night is not a complete assessment of its stance on inclusion, especially where baseball's responsibility lies,"" he said. Still, Bean cited the importance of having such events, especially in a place like New York. Too many LGBT baseball fans, he said, have memories of being ostracized in Little League or hearing disparaging comments while sitting in the stands at a major league game. When teams host pride events, Bean said: ""It's part of us getting better and understanding the value of being inclusive. There's a massive significance to that message."" To some, like Kilmnick, pride nights are an opportunity to further a conversation and to extend engagement with teams beyond a night at the ballpark. He noted that there had still not been an openly gay major-leaguer. (David Denson, a low-level minor-league player for the Milwaukee Brewers, came out as gay two years ago; he has since retired.) ""Pride night was more than about ticket sales and it's more than just another theme night or promotion night,"" Kilmnick said. ""It was about having a place at the ballpark for the LGBT community to come down and feel safe, and believe — especially for the younger people — that they could be a major-leaguer and not hide."" Kilmnick said his organization, which does anti-bullying work with Long Island and New York City schools, had plans to do a pride night with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League in September. He was surprised to learn that the Yankees had never had such an event, but then the lifelong Mets fan in him emerged. ""The Mets have been the underdog and the Yankees have been the elite,"" he said. ""In that way it doesn't surprise me. You'd think the Mets would come out for those underdogs in society, but I think it's time the Yankees stand up and do something for the LGBT fans and the Bronx.""",2017-07-08 06:05:00,"Gay pride events proliferate, but Yankees remain a holdout",,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

32,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/11/street-gangs-blamed-for-double-shooting/,"Police believe a double shooting in Little Rock last month involved two rival street gangs, according to a department spokesman. The double shooting in the 4500 block of Montclair Road on June 24 is also connected to an incident of gunfire that took place two days earlier near West 23rd and South Harrison streets, according to Lt. Steve McClanahan, a police spokesman. The two connected incidents come as Little Rock has seen a surge in violent crime compared to the same period last year. Violent crime in Little Rock has also attracted state and national attention in the wake of a mass shooting at a downtown nightclub on July 1 that injured more than two dozen people. A victim told authorities that the ""Monroe Gang"" was responsible for the June 24 shooting, according to a police report. The street gang is also known as the Monroe Street Hustlers. Authorities have arrested Glean Finley, 17, in the Montclair Road shooting. McClanahan said Finley is a member of the gang. Finley has been charged with two counts of first-degree battery, one count of aggravated assault, one count of unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle and three other charges related to the shooting, court records show. McClanahan said arrests in violent crime cases allow authorities to take criminals off the streets, if convictions are made, and put them behind bars for extended periods of time. ""It's a win for the community. It's a win for that neighborhood,"" he said. According to an arrest affidavit, one witness told police that he was outside talking to people in a silver Kia when another vehicle rolled up. The witness told police that Finley, also known as ""Lil Glean,"" was in the passenger side of the vehicle that rolled up. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] Ban violence-fueling concerts, JP urges Ban violence-fueling concerts, JP urges The witness said Finley pointed a firearm outside the window and began shooting, according to the affidavit. The bullets hit two people -- 21-year-old Curtland Watson and a 19-year-old woman who was found shot in the Kia. McClanahan said the woman was not the intended target of the shooting and was an innocent bystander. When officers arrived on scene, they found the 19-year-old shooting victim in a passenger seat, according to the affidavit. Authorities found Watson on the ground near the intersection of Peyton Street and Montclair Road, suffering from several bullet wounds to his lower abdomen, the affidavit said. Matthew Hood, 16, was also on scene when the shots rang out on Montclair Road, according to the affidavit. Hood told police he was talking to people who were inside the silver Kia, outside 4508 Montclair Road, when shots came from a vehicle that drove by, according to the affidavit. McClanahan said Hood is a member of a gang that is a rival to the ""Monroe Gang."" McClanahan declined to identify the gang. Hood surrendered to police on July 5 after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest, court documents show. That warrant stemmed from an incident of gunfire that occurred on June 22, according to Hood's arrest affidavit. In that incident, police responded at around 3:03 p.m. after receiving calls about people in two cars shooting at each other, the court documents said. Police found several .40 caliber shell casings near the intersection of South Harrison and West 23rd streets. One caller reported that one of the vehicles was a smaller gold car, and police soon located a gold Kia Spectra a ""short distance away"" from the scene, according to the affidavit. Police pulled the car over, but three people in it -- Watson, Hood, and a third man -- tried to flee on foot, authorities said. Officers found a black .40 caliber handgun in the floorboard of the front passenger side, the same door Hood fled from when police pulled the car over, according to the court documents. An arrest affidavit was signed by a judge on June 30, and Hood surrendered to police at the 12th Street Substation on July 5, according to an arrest report. He has been charged with handgun possession by a minor, the report states. McClanahan said investigators are ""looking into"" whether the Montclair shooting is connected to the July 1 mass shooting at Power Ultra Lounge, a case that garnered national headlines. A total of 25 people were wounded by gunfire during the shooting, and three others were injured while trying to flee the nightclub. As of Monday afternoon, police have made no arrests in that case, McClanahan said. The department is sending cellphone video taken inside the nightclub to the FBI for enhancement, he said, and authorities are still encouraging concert-goers at Power Ultra Lounge during the shooting to contact police. The shooting came as crime in Little Rock has been trending upward compared with the same time period last year. According to preliminary police department data, authorities have logged 1,386 violent crimes this year in the city as of June 26, up 24 percent from what police reported through the same date last year. Police include homicide robbery, rape and aggravated assault in their violent crime figures. City, state and police officials are looking to combat the surge in violent crime. On Friday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the formation of an investigative task force made up of local, state and federal authorities to help stem crime in the city. The group -- made up of Little Rock police, the Pulaski County sheriff's office, the Arkansas State Police, the FBI, Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control and Arkansas Community Correction -- will share information and resources to identify and arrest violent criminals in Little Rock. In his weekly letter to the city, Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said he was confident the multiagency law enforcement group ""will be very helpful in curbing the violence perpetrated by a small group of individuals who have been bent on retaliation."" He added that Little Rock police have dedicated ""enormous resources to determining who is responsible."" Information for this report was provided by Aziza Musa of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Andrews, (c) 2017, The Washington Post Clint Eastwood seems to be ending his career by making films about people many consider real-life heroes, as evidenced by “Sully” and “American Sniper.” Of course, in true Hollywood tradition, actors played the lead roles – Tom Hanks as Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger and Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the sniper. His next film follows a similar pattern. “The 15:17 to Paris” will present the true story of the three young California men, including a National Guardsman and a U.S. Airman, who stopped a suspected ISIS terrorist attack on a train traveling from Brussels to Paris in 2015. Only this time, in an rare Hollywood move, the heroes will play themselves in the movie. Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos and Spencer Stone, the three men who thwarted the attack, will join a cast of seasoned actors including Jenna Fischer, Judy Greer and Ray Carasani, Variety reported. The movie is based off a book the three men co-wrote about their experience, titled “The 15:17 to Paris: The True Story of a Terrorist, a Train, and Three American Heroes.” The three, friends since middle school, were traveling in Europe when they found themselves on a high-speed train with a heavily armed man named Ayoub el-Khazzani, a suspected Islamist militant, attempting a mass shooting on Aug. 21, 2015. And they helped stop it, all because they decided to switch seats. As The Washington Post’s Michael Birnbaum wrote days after the thwarted attack: “We decided to get up because the WiFi wasn’t so good on that car,” said Sadler, 23, a college student. “We were like, ‘We have a ticket to first class. We might as well go sit in first class.” About half an hour after the train pulled away from Amsterdam, they switched to the car where the shooter soon opened fire, he said. Along with two other men, they tackled, then disarmed, a suspected Islamist militant who packed two guns, a knife and nine clips of ammunition into his rucksack. “He seemed like he was ready to fight to the end. So were we,” said Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, his left arm in a sling, his right eye bloodshot and watering. Eventually, they tied up el-Khazzani and began tending to the wounded. Stone then saw that another passenger had been severely wounded by a bullet during the attack and was “squirting blood” from his neck. Stone said he barely felt any of his own injuries, so he focused on saving the other victim’s life. He stuck two of his fingers into the passenger’s wound to hold an artery closed until paramedics showed up. Their actions were met with worldwide praise. They were publicly lauded by President Barack Obama, who invited them to the White House, and they received the Legion of Honor, France’s highest decoration, from former French President François Hollande. Skarlatos even competed on “Dancing with the Stars,” where he opened up about his crush on dancer Emma Slater. They also received a book deal, and their story was published on the first anniversary of the thwarted attack. Perseus Books Group, the book’s publisher, described it as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” “I never thought I’d be writing a book,” Stone told The Post’s Ron Charles in 2016. “People kept telling us, ‘You guys should write a book.’ We were like, ‘What are we going to make a book about?’ We can’t make a whole book about a two-minute fight.” But the book focuses on more than the fight. It follows the three friends’ intertwining lives, often flashing back to their childhoods. Likewise, the movie will follow the three young men’s lives over many years. Though they will portray their most recent selves, Paul-Mikel Williams, Max Ivutin, Bryce Gheisa, Cole Eichenberger and William Jennings will play young versions of the three. Rarely do people play themselves in films. When they do, as the Associated Press pointed out, they’re generally already actors – such as John Malkovich in “Being John Malkovich” or Bill Murray in “Zombieland.” Production on the film is “underway,” according to a news release by Warner Bros., but it does not yet have a release date.

Steve Scalise, who was critically injured last month during a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, was moved from the intensive care unit of a Washington hospital, a person with knowledge of his condition said. Scalise, R-La., spent the past week in the intensive care unit and underwent surgery for the management of infection, his office said. Massachusetts Detained researcher sent to Iran An Iranian cancer researcher who was detained at Boston’s Logan International Airport has been sent back to his home country, said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokeswoman Stephanie Malin. Mohsen Dehnavi arrived Monday to start work at Boston Children’s Hospital. The hospital said Dehnavi was prevented from entering with his wife and three children despite holding a J-1 visa for visiting scholars. Malin said the family’s detention was for “reasons unrelated” to President Donald Trump’s executive order on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries. New Jersey Bridgegate mastermind sentenced David Wildstein, the professed mastermind in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, was spared prison when he was sentenced for his role in the blocking of lanes near the George Washington Bridge as political revenge against a New Jersey mayor. Wildstein instead got three years’ probation, 500 hours of community service and more than $20,000 in fines and restitution. Brazil Lula convicted of corruption Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was convicted of corruption and money laundering and sentenced to nine years in prison, a stunning blow to a man once hailed across the hemisphere as an innovative leftist leader.

He had moved to Colorado. But after coming back to the Chicago area for a family event, he moved with a relative to Joliet and got a new job, according to a relative who asked to only be identified as Nena. On Friday, he had traveled to the city to get a haircut. At some point during the trip, Marin, 26, ended up in the 4600 block of South Washtenaw Street in the Brighton Park neighborhood on the city's Southwest Side. About 10:20 p.m., someone inside a silver SUV opened fire, striking Marin multiple times. He was pronounced dead two minutes later at the scene, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Multiple rifle casings were found at the scene, according to a law enforcement source. It marked the latest shooting where police believe a rifle was used on the city's Southwest Side. Family members and nearby residents gathered along 47th Street, watching as detectives and officers worked the scene of the shooting. A small boy slept on his mother's shoulder outside of the crime scene. Another small boy carried a sippy cup and a phone. Relatives gave each other hugs as they arrived to the scene and tried to piece together what happened. ""Who was he here with?"" a woman shouted. Three other women walked up to the police tape to speak to an officer. ""Dave's still on scene,"" the officer told the teary-eyed women. Nena said Marin had a young son. Though the medical examiner's office listed Marin as living in the 7300 block of South Francisco Avenue, Nena said he had been recently been living in Joliet. She described him as someone who was close to his family and always wanted to make someone laugh. ""He'll be missed,"" Nena said. ""We'll miss his smile and his goofiness."" Less than half a mile away from Friday's shooting, two people were killed and eight others were wounded in May during a mass shooting that involved a rifle near 46th Place and Rockwell Street. In February, the Tribune reported that gangs in Back of the Yards and Brighton Park were increasingly using rifles. At the time, there were more than 30 shootings believed to have been tied to semi-automatic rifles in the two neighborhoods over the previous nine months. At least 46 people were shot in those attacks, 13 fatally. Police suspected the rifles were being passed around by members of four rival Hispanic gangs in the area — La Raza, the Almighty Saints, Satan Disicples and Gangster Two-Six. Since February, several more people have been shot by rifles in that area. Among them were two Chicago police officers shot and wounded in early May at 43rd Street and Ashland Avenue in Back of the Yards. A woman, who did not want to be identified, stopped by the crime scene after coming home from dinner. She feared a child could have been shot, because she often sees children playing in the area that was the focus of the police investigation. In the 25 years that she's lived in the neighborhood, she has seen violence fluctuate. Not too long ago, she attended community meetings to address the aftermath of the mass shooting at 46th Place and Rockwell. She recalled how eerie the neighborhood felt. ""I don't know if it's ever been this bad,"" she said. She tries to keep her children busy with activities such as a summer program her teenage son is attending at Harvard University. ""Because they don't need to be in the neighborhood,"" she said. Nena said Marin's family lived in the area, but many had moved out because of the violence. ""We all grew up in this area, but we left because of the crime,"" she said. ""Everyone's friends die around here."" Chicago Tribune's Peter Nickeas contributed.

There is a possibility of an armed man, reportedly an off-duty cop, barricading himself inside an apartment complex in the area of 7th Street and Central Avenue, reports said. The situation has compelled police officers to urge the residents to stay indoors, reports said. A woman dialed 911 at about 7:20 p.m. local time (10:20 p.m. EDT) asking for help, Seal Beach police Sgt. Michael Henderson said. The police said the line went dead immediately after the woman's call. Multiple witnesses said they heard gunshots fired in the apartment building, according to a report. Read: Laquan McDonald Case Leads To 3 Chicago Officers Being Charged With Felony A barricade situation continued till late night. ""This is an ongoing tactical situation,"" said Henderson adding, ""The SWAT team has been deployed.""  Officers tackled the situation with precaution and expanded the lockdown area after 10 p.m. local time. Dylan Bolander, a 14-year-old who lived on the second floor of a building along 7th Street near Central Avenue, told police about the moment he heard the gunshots. According to Bolander, a woman staying on the top floor came down running asking for help. She looked petrified and told Bolander that a man staying next to her apartment was an off-duty cop whom she had overheard yelling at his girlfriend. Moments before the gunshots were fired, the woman overheard the cop's girlfriend yelling, ""No, don’t do this,"" Bolander told the police. It is not known whether the shooter's girlfriend is alive or not, reports said. Another witness, Greg Meier, who works as a maintenance man in the building and lives on the first floor, said he returned home after having dinner at a nearby restaurant and was watching TV when he heard three gunshots, the Orange County Register reported. He added: “Next thing I know police are showing, barricading the street and running around with guns."" Several people residing in the area took to Twitter asking about the current situation while those who are not aware of what had happened, expressed concern.     Read: Megyn Kelly Confronts Alex Jones On Sandy Hook Shooting Claims On Her Show Henderson said the SWAT team is using ""technology to ensure the safety of officers"" while determining whether the suspect and/or victim were inside the apartment. No further gunshots were reported, he said, according to NBC Los Angeles. In 2011, a gunman burst into a beauty salon in Seal Beach and went on a shooting rampage killing nine people. The attacker was reportedly loaded with weapons when he attacked the salon. After shooting down people, he stormed out of the salon, jumped into a car and fled, according to the New York Times.",2017-07-17 05:58:14,"Seal Beach Shooting Suspect Could Be An Off-Duty Cop, Residents Forced To Stay Indoors",,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

X OUR PICKS: SYDNEY — Half a world from where an Australian woman was shot dead by a Minneapolis police officer, Tuesday’s front-page headline in her hometown Sydney newspaper summarized Australia’s reaction in blunt terms: “AMERICAN NIGHTMARE.” In Justine Damond’s native country, news of the meditation teacher’s baffling death has dominated the airwaves, newspapers and websites for days, feeding into Australians’ long-held fears about America’s notorious culture of gun violence. “The country is infested with possibly more guns than people,” said Philip Alpers, a gun policy analyst with the University of Sydney who has studied the stark differences in gun laws between the nations. “We see America as a very risky place in terms of gun violence — and so does the rest of the world.” While police officers carry guns in Australia, deadly shootings by police are exceedingly rare; only a handful are reported each year, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. And though the U.S. doesn’t keep a national database of deadly police-involved shootings, even incomplete statistics show there are hundreds every year. America’s reluctance to strengthen its gun regulations and its seemingly endless stream of shooting deaths have long been a source of confusion and concern in Australia, which instituted tough gun ownership laws in 1996 following a deadly mass shooting. At the time, then-Prime Minister John Howard — a conservative — warned Australians against following America’s lead on gun control, saying: “We have an opportunity in this country not to go down the American path.” RELATED: Rosario: Another fatal police shooting here begs for answers The Australian government’s official travel advice to those heading to the U.S. specifically warns tourists to be on guard for gun crime, and urges Australians living in the U.S. to be familiar with “active shooter” training drills. Australian media coverage of America’s frequent mass shootings is often tinged with disbelief — “another day, another shooting in America” is a common refrain on newscasts. The death of Damond, a 40-year-old meditation teacher who was reportedly dressed in her pajamas when she was shot by a police officer late Saturday, has sparked a similarly stunned reaction. The story has led network newscasts and was splashed across newspapers’ front pages. Sydney’s Daily Telegraph ran an editorial headlined “A senseless and tragic death.” Authorities have released no details on what prompted Saturday’s shooting, which occurred after Damond called police to report what she believed to be an active sexual assault in an alley near her home. Damond’s Sydney-based family issued a statement Monday saying they were trying to come to terms with the tragedy and understand why it happened. On Tuesday, her father spoke out publicly for the first time. “We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,” John Ruszczyk told reporters. “Justine was a beacon to all of us. We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

47,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywge5g/david-lynch-is-obsessed-with-the-ways-cars-kill-us,"About halfway through David Lynch's Wild at Heart and as Chris Isaak's ""Wicked Game"" plays on the radio, the film's heroes—lovers-on-the-run Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lulu (Laura Dern)—notice something odd in the middle of the dark, two-lane highway: scattered clothes. They drive forward and see more clothes creating a loose trail of garments that lead off the highway and into the desert. There, among the shrubs and chirping crickets, idles a car that's been flipped upside down. Its headlights shine on the body of a man lying face up, his face covered in blood. A moment later, a woman (Sherilyn Fenn) stumbles out from the darkness, dazed from whatever's gone on behind her own bloody head wound. She notices the dead man, complains about the ""sticky stuff on her hair,"" falls down, coughs up blood, and dies. ""She died right in front of us,"" says Lulu. ""Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?"" Why, indeed! The scene is incongruous with the rest of the film, with absolutely no further discussion in the movie's plot other than a moment of Sailor and Lulu wondering if the accident is a bad omen for their journey. But it's an ideal example of Lynch showcasing his bonafides as the most American of film directors, cracking the façade and examining the lurking horror within the concept of ""America."" Analyzing the seedy underbelly of seemingly innocent norms has been a mainstay throughout Lynch's career—perhaps most on the nose in the opening of Blue Velvet, when he bypasses the pristine white picket fence for a close-up of the savage ants tangling in the grass below. It's not surprising, then, that throughout his career, Lynch has mined nightmare fuel from the most benign horror in American life: the automobile. To Lynch, cars are anything but simply vehicles of transport. In Blue Velvet, they're an enclosure for a sadistic psychopath to trap a fresh-out-of-high-school sleuth for a joy ride. In Lost Highway, they're a souped-up ride that a mob boss uses to ram a tailgating dickhead off the road before offering a violent lesson on the importance of consulting the user's manual. In Mulholland Drive, they're the deus ex machina that get the dreamlike events started. In the original run of Twin Peaks, they're clues planted in the want ads; in Twin Peaks: The Return, they play a role in the grisly accidental hit-and-run committed by Richard Horne. (Even Boxing Helena, the 1993 debut film from Lynch's daughter Jennifer, contains one of the the most unintentionally hilarious hit-and-run crashes you're likely to see on film.) So what is it about cars that Lynch finds so compelling? It could be something personal. In his book Weirdsville, USA: The Obsessive Universe of David Lynch, Paul A. Woods mentions how the scene in Wild at Heart could be based on a ""horrific traffic accident"" in Virginia that killed a childhood friend of Lynch. (It should be noted that I couldn't confirm this perspective elsewhere.) But cars-as-horror-devices could simply be what happens when a director that's spent his life in America distills the experience into his work. There are more cars in the US than anywhere else in the world for plenty of reasons: For one, there's a ton of people, and there's a lot of space those people want to get to. But more deeply than that, Americans love their cars in a visceral, not merely pragmatic way. Route 66, rockabilly, drive-in movies, hot rods, NASCAR—these are purely American creations, born from the cultural cross-pollination of consumerism and the ""personal freedom"" it allows. There's a reason Bruce Springsteen sings about cars, and it's the same reason Jay Leno collects them. Yet behind the elegance of a waxed fender lies the mundane and dangerous realities of driving life in America. There's the skyrocketing average commute times, the stressors that lead 80 percent of Americans into road rage at least once a year, and the more than 30,000 people a year killed in car accidents. Automobile accidents account for roughly the same number of deaths in America as guns (albeit when categorizing two-thirds of gun deaths as suicides). And car crashes are violent and painful incidents, what with the intermingling of metal and flesh. (Luckily, if it's a really bad one, you won't even know it.) But while gun control is a hot-button issue that loudly bullies its way into the media spotlight whenever there's a new mass shooting, there's nothing about the constant beat of automobile deaths. They're something we've come to accept as the cost of living in America—a necessary evil to ball up and toss into the waste bin in the back of your mind. They're something to get over, because it's never going to change. So rather than galvanizing support around public transit or demanding more safety regulations to keep up with the rising average speeds, we hop into our cars—when we're drunk, stoned, or fiddling with our phones—and merge among the other propelled boxes of metal and gears. We don't even spend a single moment hoping that our tender flesh and brittle bones remain intact on the ride, because if we did, we'd never have the guts to leave the driveway. All of this, of course, is stuff Lynch already knows, either from his personal experiences, glimpses revealed during meditation sessions, or just the mundane horror you end up getting drenched in when you spend your life in America. It's no wonder Lynch remains popular abroad: He's the best filmmaking tour guide America has. Follow Rick Paulas on Twitter.

Of course, I believe the No. 1 fake in the news is none other than Trump himself. Charles Isgrig in his recent letter got it right. Trump promised to drain the swamp, but he has replaced it with a cesspool. I think we all have Trump fatigue. BETTY IRENE McSWAIN Fort Smith A wide world of bugs Bugs. Most everybody hates them. We spray them, swat them, step on them and curse them to little avail. They in turn bite us, sting us, live on us and even in us. I suppose the two most despised bugs are flies and mosquitoes. Others that I would list in the top 10 of most hated bugs are fleas, ticks, chiggers, lice, ants, termites, locusts and disgusting cockroaches. Yellow fever, malaria and bubonic plague are just a few of many diseases spread by these tiny critters. Most bugs (a general term) are insects, but not all, and I'll confess I don't always know the difference. When ill, we sometimes say we have a bug, but never we ""have an insect."" We may bug another person but we never ""insect"" another person. To put a bug in someone's ear means to give a hint or reminder. It would be interesting to know that idiom's origin. There are more than one million identified species of bugs which make up about half of all living creatures. Unless we happen to be entomologists, we generally think most of them are pests. Those weird ancient Egyptians considered the scarab beetle, also known as the dung beetle, to be sacred. Moses, with a little help from above, sicced flies, gnats and locusts on the Egyptians trying to persuade Pharaoh to release the Hebrews. Pests they may be, but they can be interesting little creatures. A few we consider beneficial to humans. The honey bee, ladybug and dragonfly come to mind, and what a poor world it would be without butterflies and fireflies. JOHN McPHERSON Searcy Addressing addresses Mr. Bill Davis is correct in that the almost universal use in our country of ""you guys,"" as a plural for any- and everyone who is being addressed, is regrettable. However, there is an ""explanation"" which may help to soothe our indignation somewhat, although this is not offered as a defense. Unlike many other familiar languages one might study, the English language plural for ""you"" is the same as the singular word ""you."" While it is correct for a coach, when addressing his women's softball team, to say ""we expect you to play your very best in this crucial game ..."" we are more likely to hear ""we expect you guys to play your very best, etc."" In earlier years in New York, we heard ""youse,"" in Tennessee it was ""you-uns,"" and in the general South, ""y'all."" But now, those territorial ""you"" plurals have given way to the more convenient and multipurpose ""you guys."" I don't think there is any disrespect intended, but we tip extra for servers who address my husband and me as ""y'all""! CHARLOTTE M. COPELAND Maumelle What will solve issue I have been listening to and reading the media since the mass shooting in Little Rock. The governor has appointed a joint task force aimed at stemming violent crimes in Little Rock. I believe the task force has two chances at being successful--slim and none. Unless a vast majority of citizens voluntarily obey the law, there is no way a government can enact and enforce enough laws to control the citizens. There are four things that control the life of every individual who has ever lived: politics, economics, religion and family. If you doubt this truth go live in Syria for five years and tell me it is not true. If millennials will finish high school, get a full-time job, get married and then have children, in that order, they have only a 3 percent chance of living in poverty. However, if they have children before marriage, they have a 54 percent chance of living in poverty. Any sociologist will tell you there is a positive correlation between education, family, poverty and crime. How many inmates in the Arkansas prison system have come from a single-parent household? How many minority members did the governor put on the joint task force? GERALD GRIFFIN Benton Access isn't the point I am stunned the news media hasn't pursued the Republicans' default use of the word ""access"" when speaking of their Obamacare replacement bill and its coverage of pre-existing conditions. Here's a shocker: How many Americans from the poorest among us to the billionaire titans of business have ""access"" to health care? Answer: 100 percent! I have ""access"" to private jets and their promise to transport me to the far corners of the planet. I have ""access"" to jewelry stores and their brilliant offerings dripping with flawless, precious stones. I have ""access"" to Sloan Kettering and its world-class cancer care. I have ""access"" to virtually everything within my universe except for one potentially devastating barrier: Money. And lots of it. Hey, America, no health-care program designed by the government alters our ""access"" to health care. The GOP's position is disingenuous, dishonest and a downright lie. Always follow the money. I believe the GOP replacement health-care plan will make billionaires more wealthy while the poor among us are left to die. It's economic Darwinism institutionalized. Beyond sad.

Mayor Mark Stodola is set to detail his plan, called LR for Life, at 2 p.m. at city hall. A news release announcing the presentation said the plan centers on ""six pillars"": stopping violence, strengthening the city's police department, improving the criminal justice system, investing in prevention, promoting jobs, opportunity and education, and rebuilding neighborhoods. Crime in Little Rock has drawn increased attention since a July 1 shooting at a downtown nightclub injured more than two dozen people. Five days after that mass shooting, Gov. Asa Hutchinson unveiled a multi-agency effort targeted at aiding law enforcement in Little Rock. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

52,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/19/aurora-sandy-hook-survivors-posey-murphy/,"Trending: The 6-foot, 230-pound University of Colorado fullback limped out of the locker room on a sore ankle after a thumping on the football field. Waiting for him was a boy half his size, a boy who shared a deeper pain that sprang from a horror that others couldn’t begin to imagine. Jordan Murphy and Reichen Posey shared something else, too: a love for football and a need to reach out to someone else who could understand. So their story began Nov. 13, 2015, at Folsom Field. “It was more like a football idol than ‘Hey, here’s a guy who went through the same thing’ at that point,” recalled Reichen’s father, Dave. “It was this massive guy who came walking up to him, super-soft voice but a huge dude who looked like he could eat you. I can just remember Reichen looking up at him and staring at him, almost speechless.” Bullets and tragedy brought them together, but football and empathy are their bond. Both families have reluctantly become members of what Dave has called The Club No One Wants to Join. Jordan, now 24, escaped the Aurora theater shooting on July 20, 2012 — five years ago Thursday. Twelve were killed and 70 injured. Reichen, now 11, and his sister Amyla, 13, survived the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Dec. 14, 2012, that left 27 dead, including 20 children. The Aurora and Sandy Hook shootings shocked a nation already too familiar with mass shootings, and they launched new efforts to reshape gun policy in Colorado and the United States. They continue to have emotional repercussions for those touched by them, even five years later. “To see your family change in a day was really hard. I just wanted it back,” said Reichen’s mother, Carly. “I just wanted to fix it, and when I couldn’t fix it, that was hard because I’m a mom.” The day after Sandy Hook, the Poseys moved to Colorado, where they’ve since found safety, friendship and hope, as well as an unbreakable bond with the Murphys. Every few months since that first meeting in Boulder, the Poseys and Murphys have gathered to check in, to catch up and to pick up where they left off. Conversations are typically about life. Regular life. Often football. “These guys here?” Carly said, looking over at Jordan and his mother, Laura, during a recent barbecue at the Poseys’ home in Parker. “They’re like family.” Just before midnight July 19, 2012, Jordan and his friends settled in the fourth row of theater 9 in the Century Aurora 16 cineplex for the premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises.” About 15 minutes into the film, the theater’s exit door cracked opened and a gunman burst in and opened fire. The symphony of chaos from the firearms and the crowd’s shrieks filled the room. When the gunman paused, Murphy trailed his friends as they crawled to the aisle and sprinted out. A bullet whizzed an inch over Jordan’s head before piercing the drywall. Laura and her husband, Ken, awoke to two missed calls and a harrowing text message from Jordan still saved on Laura’s phone. There was a shooting. But he escaped and was OK. “Praise God,” he wrote. The tragedy marked the deadliest mass shooting in Colorado since Columbine in 1999. Less than two weeks later, Jordan and the rest of the Colorado football team returned to his place of horror, by going to the movies ahead of preseason camp. “That first one helped, just getting it out of the way,” Jordan said. His greatest therapy resumed days later at camp. “All I was doing all day was football,” he said. “It just helped to switch the subject instead of thinking about it every second of every day.” The morning of Dec. 14, 2012, 6-year-old Reichen walked into school wide-eyed in anticipation. It was a Friday, and they were going to make gingerbread houses and his mother was going to arrive later to help. Then, “I just heard a bunch of loud noises,” Reichen said. His teacher peeked out the classroom door and shut it quickly. “If we’re all together, we’ll be safe,” he remembers her telling students as she ushered them to the back of the room. “Then a guy slammed the door opened and he shot my teacher twice and she fell to her knees,” Reichen said. “Then he shot a little kid.” Reichen was in classroom 10 of Sandy Hook Elementary when the gunman killed Reichen’s first-grade teacher, Victoria Soto, and five of his classmates. When the gunman stopped to reload, Reichen ran out of the room, past the bodies of the school principal and psychologist in the hallway. He kept running — to a nearby firehouse that was locked, then to the house of someone who took him in for safety. All the way, he thought of his fourth-grade sister, Amyla, who had been hiding in a hallway closet as bullets sprayed the school. “I thought she was dead or something,” Reichen said. “Then my mom came with my sister, and I just started crying harder. Just tears of joy and relief.” The next day, the Poseys moved to Colorado where Reichen’s father was transferred for work and where many other members of The Club No One Wants to Join reside. But for the 1,677 days since Dec. 14, 2012, the images and memories remain etched in Reichen’s mind in high-definition. Every detail, every color, every sound reminding him daily of an innocence lost. His memory of the shooting is vivid and even helped investigators piece together the shooting timeline. But years after were lost time. “It was just too much,” his father said. “Like, ‘I can’t bear the load of what’s going on and I can’t handle going to school. My head’s too full. At 6 years old, trying to figure out what that means — what does that mean for me if I walk outside? Is someone going to shoot me?’ ” In that time, Reichen couldn’t escape the memory of the “murdering day,” as he described it. He had trouble leaving the house except to attend school at Frontier Elementary in Parker, where every day he had to return to his place of horror. To help him finish first grade, Carly and Dave tag-teamed to ensure that one of them was there from the first bell to final bell. They knew the mornings of strength and fortitude would be overtaken by tears and fear. Reichen couldn’t sit or stand still, so many days were spent in the school’s occupational therapy room with his mom or dad, or outside with Maurice Carter, Frontier’s building engineer. “He’s like my favorite person ever,” Reichen said. “I call him Mr. Maurice. We started playing football and just became good friends.” When Reichen arrived at Frontier, Carter was prepped on his story and showed him the locked doors and all the escape routes. When Reichen had trouble sitting in class, Carter pulled him out to play football, typically three times a day. “I’ve never talked to him about (Sandy Hook),” Carter said. “In the five years I’ve known him, we’ve never talked about it.” That first year, Reichen wouldn’t go in the front yard of his new home. He wouldn’t go to a restaurant or the grocery store — the intercom would remind him of the one at Sandy Hook. He refused to brush his teeth and often wore his superhero costumes to regain some control in a world of confusion. During his counseling sessions, he talked while on a treadmill. Before Sandy Hook, he and Amyla were inseparable. After the shooting, Amyla distanced herself. “Because she was like, ‘I almost lost him,’” Dave explained. “‘If I don’t like you anymore and you die, then I don’t have to lose you.’ That kind of changed after about two months.” Amyla found comfort in baking, so her parents kept the kitchen stocked with cocoa, flour and butter. Reichen found comfort in the backyard with his mom or dad throwing a football, back and forth, back and forth until neither could throw any longer. “Forty footballs in three years. That’s where that net came in,” Dave said, pointing to the steel lattice draped across the backyard fence. 2012 used to be all-consuming and inescapable. “Now, it’s just there in the background and certain things will make me think about it more,” Carly said. “But our lives are normal now.” The aftermath of Sandy Hook and Aurora will never fade completely, and the families say they find solace in the good that has come of the tragedies. Friendships such as theirs are appreciated more now, they say. Life and its little moments are, too. Reichen still has his hard ones, but they are fleeting. Like at the fireworks on July 4. This year, though, he didn’t beg to leave. His mother still has her moments, too. She still doesn’t like to take pictures. “Because I feel like those will be my last memories,” Carly said. “So I just live in the moment. For the longest time, I’d see pictures from before Sandy Hook and think that could have been all I had — was pictures.” For the longest time, Laura Murphy felt compelled to stare at pictures. “I’ve looked at pictures of those 12 victims hundreds of times because that was the face to everybody else,” she said. “I kept thinking, ‘What’s the face that sits next to you on that couch?’” And then there’s that photo from 2013 that Dave saved. It’s of Reichen asleep in his parents’ room wearing an NFL Rams jersey and cradling one of the many footballs he’d toss in the backyard with his parents. Reichen says football is his favorite sport and Jordan is a big reason. Not long after their first meeting at Folsom Field, Jordan attended one of Reichen’s flag football practices. And last fall, Jordan ran a clinic for athletes Reichen’s age at Lutheran High, where he is now the school’s strength and conditioning coach. That clinic was one of Reichen’s introductions to tackle football. The Poseys know that when Reichen gets anxious — and it’s rare nowadays — a mention of Jordan calms him. In turn, Reichen is often Jordan’s inspiration. “I didn’t have to go to a movie theater again if I didn’t want to,” Jordan said. “He had to go to his figurative movie theater every day. So I admire his courage.” Their bond puts them in a select club, joined by only two who are happy to be included. Membership is lifelong. “They don’t talk about it so much,” Dave said. They just know. It’s just football and sports. There’s an understanding and comfort.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2017-07-19 18:38:05,Five years ago they survived Aurora and Sandy Hook.

53,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/20/little-rock-mayors-plan-reduce-violence-city-inclu/,"Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola on Thursday afternoon announced a six-pillar approach to reducing violence in the city in the wake of a mass shooting that left 28 people wounded and generated national attention. The “LR for Life” plan, largely a more detailed outline to one previously publicized, was unveiled in the rotunda of Little Rock’s city hall in downtown. It came two days after the 32nd homicide in Little Rock this year claimed the life of a newcomer to the city and about a day after police shot a suspected shoplifter and subsequent carjacker outside a Chick-fil-A restaurant on the city’s west side as he attempted to flee. Police had not named the man shot outside the eatery as of Thursday afternoon. He did not have life-threatening injuries. ""We must understand that one person alone cannot solve or, for that matter, be blamed for our challenges,"" Stodola told city leaders, residents and reporters crowded in the building. Among the objectives named to combat violence were disrupting acts before before they start, “aggressively” prosecuting repeat offenders, strengthening Little Rock’s police force, rebuilding deteriorating neighborhoods and promoting opportunities for employment and education. As part of the strategy to lessen violence, Stodola unveiled the creation of Ceasefire Little Rock, a program modeled after ones in other cities that utilize intervenors in attempts to resolve disputes among disconnected youth and young adults before they turn violent. The mayor also referenced ongoing work by the Police Department's violent crimes apprehension teams and a recently created task force to engage in investigations. Stodola stressed the importance of stopping domestic violence — which he noted was behind 17 percents of homicides between 2009 and 2016 in Little Rock. On the issue of dozens of vacant positions in the Police Department, the mayor said that steps are being taken to increase recruiting. ""The current environment [makes it] increasingly hard to find citizens willing to become police officers,"" Stodola said, adding that ""Little Rock is not alone in this challenge."" To ease the burden on Little Rock police, a civilian squad is set to be formed to handle low-level traffic offenses and administrative duties, he said. Recruitment efforts will include promoting open positions in the news media as well as launching a marketing campaign and a new website. Stodola said that in order to keep officers on the Little Rock force, incentive packages will be offered. Eighteen officer recruits are set to become certified by the end of August. Two additional recruitment classes are set for later this year. Three grants applications have been submitted to the Department of Justice that would help the city coordinate responses in crime hot spots, form a Gun Crimes Intelligence Unit, purchase software to analyze instances of crime, expand training and enhance community outreach. Concerns over violence grew after a mass shooting early July 1 at Power Ultra Lounge, 220 W. Sixth St., in which a onslaught of gunfire left 25 people with gunshot wounds and three others hurt as they tried to leave. The shooting at the since-shuttered nightclub was said to have resulted from a dispute between “rival groups” during a concert by Memphis rapper Finese 2Tymes, whose real name is Ricky Hampton. Hampton, 25, has been named a “person of interest” in the shooting. His bodyguard, 25-year-old Kentrell Gwynn, faces federal charges related to the gunfire. Little Rock’s recent spate of violent crime has also sparked a reaction from state and federal officials, who have called for a broadened and more extensive approach to tackling the issues plaguing Arkansas’ capital city. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson unveiled a plan last month aimed at reducing instances of gun violence through a bolstering of Little Rock’s investigative resources. A joint task force will allow authorities to share intelligence and target violent offenders. It is expected to be composed of up to 20 officials from various local, state and federal agencies. An idea considered earlier this month in Pulaski County Quorum Court to enact prohibitions against concerts or performers with lyrics that could potentially “promote or incite violence” garnered little support.

55,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43d85p/since-pulse-lgbtq-bars-have-upped-security-and-activists-are-worried,"It's not unusual for lines to stretch down the block at Portland's Blow Pony, a monthly queer dance event that brings up to 2,000 people to a warehouse in the city's industrial Inner Eastside. But one Saturday night in June of last year, a restless crowd waited in a particularly sluggish line for the doors. While the event has always had a security presence, organizers upped the ante last year for its ninth-annual Queer Mutiny Fest, held during Portland's pride weekend. The most visible change was what slowed the pace of the line: Staff peeked in bags and waved metal-detecting wands around the bodies of guests to check for weapons before anyone was permitted to step into the club. A number of regulars I spoke with in line expressed that such measures were rarely, if ever, seen at LGBTQ events in Portland. But Blow Pony was only one of many such events to increase security that week. Six days earlier, on June 12, 2016, the Pulse shooting had happened. It was the single deadliest mass shooting in US history. The carnage sent tremors through the LGBTQ community. More than just a place to get drunk, gay and lesbian clubs have long served as community centers and a refuge from societal persecution. That's why for many, the news amounted to the literal violation of a haven and the metaphorical desecration of a sanctuary. Pulse immediately raised concerns of copycat attacks. This was in part because the security at gay bars is often on the lenient side—metal detectors and armed guards are a rare sight. Some clubs admitted that measures as simple as bag checks weren't a part of security protocol until the Orlando massacre. A few gay bars insisted on maintaining the status quo. For example, the owner of Larry's Lounge in Chicago told TIME that he refused to give into fear and would carry on with business as usual. But by and large, a flurry of headlines declared that club owners, parade organizers, and local authorities would elevate security for the remainder of 2016 pride festivities. It was yet another reminder to a community all too accustomed to violence that no space is ever entirely safe. But the subsequent impulse to fortify security at LGBTQ bars and events also serves to underscore patrons' marginalization—stressing the dialectic between pride and an instinct for safety. It's particularly concerning for trans and queer people of color, who are often victims of violence at the hands of the very police and security forces that are supposed to protect them. Orlando, of course, was far from the first attack on an LGBTQ space. Gay and lesbian venues have long been victims of homophobia, from decades of police raids at gay clubs to the 1973 arson at a New Orleans club that killed 32 people to the 2000 fatal shooting at a bar in Roanoke, Virginia. But Pulse was different. The fact that Pulse was the deadliest terror attack on US soil since 9/11 made it feel like a harbinger of a more muscular and increasingly visible security presence at queer bars, clubs, and events. The question didn't seem if security at queer spaces would change but how and to what degree. More than one year later, major LGBTQ event producers and bar managers say they have responded to perceived terror threats by implementing a range of security measures, some obvious and others less so. But questions remain as to what impact these changes might have on patrons, particularly those most marginalized in the queer community. Some are unsurprising and immediately noticeable, such as armed guards, metal detectors, and frisking. For example, a prominent gay nightlife venue in Los Angeles beefed up security in hopes of making guests feel more at ease. ""We have at least one visible armed guard every night at the Abbey and the Chapel"" in response to Pulse, said owner David Cooley, who has also outfitted security staff with body cameras and turned to West Hollywood authorities for formal training. In Orlando, the Pulse Latin Night event relocated after the shooting to a new venue, also called the Abbey, which has made its security presence more visible over the past year. ""Our biggest concern immediately following Pulse was to make sure we could provide a place where our guests felt safe,"" said owner Wendy Connor. ""We have added additional security personnel, added wanders to check people at the door, and provided additional security training to our staff."" Other actions that venues have taken are less obvious to patrons—such as hiring private security companies and seeking assistance from local police departments. LGBTQ bars in the nation's capital, for example, have recently taken steps to collectively prepare staff for emergency situations. ""DC bars and restaurants have undertaken coordinated and continuing efforts to further enhance local security preparedness,"" said Mark Lee, a veteran gay event producer and venue manager. He served as executive director of the DC Nightlife Hospitality Association at the time Pulse occurred. In the wake of attacks in Orlando, Paris, and Manchester, the trade association—which includes LGBTQ-owned and -centric venues in its membership—facilitated multi-day training sessions in which city officials and regulatory agencies participated. ""Most of these precautions are not visible or discussed by venues, for obvious reasons,"" Lee said. Those training sessions were certified by the Nightclub Security Consultants (NSC), which pioneered standardized security-training programs in the hospitality industry when it launched in 1998. CEO Robert Smith spent two decades with the San Diego Police Department as a patrol officer and he said that experience informed the curriculum for NCS's variety of courses. The owners of the queer venues that I spoke with said they turned to companies like NCS for training on how best to respond to a variety of emergency scenarios. But in his work with more than 1,000 bars, Smith generally believes queer ones remain among the safest when it comes to situations like fighting and disruptive behavior. ""LGBTQ bars and clubs are not insecure at all,"" he said, explaining that, in his view, patrons tend to be of ""very like mind and heart"" and therefore have fewer altercations. Even so, ""security"" is a loaded word, and ""safe space"" is a matter of perspective. For many in the LGBTQ community, gay bars have often proven to be unwelcoming to people of color. They're the site of astonishing racism and sexual harassment. So even as club managers and event producers take steps to elevate security, a number of activists see these moves as problematic. ""When we talk about 'safety,' we really need to talk about who that safety is for,"" Emmelia Talarico, a lead organizer for grassroots activist organization No Justice No Pride (NJNP), told me. ""For many trans and queer folks of color, increased security and a heavy police presence doesn't make spaces safer."" Spurred by a controversy over uniformed police participation in pride marches, NJNP gained notoriety this past June by protesting at parades across the country. Talarico believes that many white, cisgender gays and lesbians think they can count on the police to protect them, and the police's relationship with gays and lesbians has indeed improved since Stonewall, especially in major cities. But many queer people haven't had such positive experiences, particularly trans women and trans people of color, who are disproportionately targeted and harassed by police, according to a 2016 report from the Movement Advancement Project. While there's no palpable link between a culture of police brutality and the standards of private event security, Talarico has her reasons for viewing them both through a similar lens: ""We live in a society based on white supremacy and transmisogyny,"" she said. ""Any 'security' entity that exists within this system without explicitly working against those forms of oppression is going to perpetuate it—it's rare that a security presence in white-, cis-dominated queer spaces is explicitly trained or committed to working against forces of marginalization."" These kinds of critiques are unavoidably anecdotal. No data exists about private security in queer spaces. But Talarico does see hope. She cites the DC-based Safe Bar program as an example, an initiative of anti-sexual assault nonprofit Collective Action for Safe Spaces that aims to help bar owners identity and intervene in instances of harassment. ""The lens for their training is explicitly anti-racist, trans-inclusive, and rejects criminalization, which is critical,"" she said, suggesting it represents a step in the right direction for security at queer venues. Even so, protesting a dominant culture and correcting those injustices are two different things. That's why a few recent queer events—such as this June's Trans Day of Action—have explored alternatives to mainstream security models. As was the case with Blow Pony. Last month it returned with its tenth annual pride party, at a new venue with a less visible security presence than the year before: No metal detectors or wanders were in sight, and the line moved quickly. Event organizers confirmed in an email that licensed security was on site, but said they were relying more on support from other community groups this year. ""We've also received a lot of support from our local antifa [anti-fascist] chapters, who have been a great help,"" the email read. Blow Pony organizers declined to elaborate on what role groups such as Rose City Antifa might play in the event's security protocols, emphasizing the tumultuous nature of the current political climate. A Rose City Antifa spokesperson responded similarly. ""There isn't really anything that we could tell you that wouldn't run the risk of compromising our security activities,"" the email read. ""We can tell you that white supremacists and other bigots have threatened LGBTQ events in Portland, both in the past and present, and that a number of local groups are working to defend our community against those threats.""

57,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/25/shootings-in-lr-kill-man-boy-20170725/,"Two people were killed in separate shootings late Monday night in Little Rock, just hours after two others were injured in a single shooting. Little Rock police responded to a reported drive-by shooting at 10424 Stardust Trail, near the intersection of Chicot and Mabelvale Cutoff roads, at 9:44 p.m. Once there, they found a 30-year-old male victim who had been shot multiple times in the upper body, said police spokesman Lt. Steve McClanahan. The victim, who was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead there, was not identified by police Monday night. McClanahan said witnesses reported seeing a vehicle drive away from the scene, and police were talking to one of the occupants of that car. A short time later, at 10:05 p.m., police were called to a shooting at the Pleasant Pointe Apartments, 1502 Green Mountain Drive. According to McClanahan, officers found a 14-year-old male who had been shot inside one of the apartments. He was pronounced dead at the scene. McClanahan said police are looking for a suspect described as a 15- to 20-year-old black male, 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet tall. The homicides were the city's 33rd and 34th of the year. Earlier Monday, two people were wounded in a shooting at a Little Rock home, according to McClanahan. [HOMICIDE MAP: Interactive map of killings in Little Rock, North Little Rock this year] Both victims, a 20-year-old man and a woman whose age was not disclosed, were shot inside the residence at 4208 W. 19th St. Monday afternoon, according to McClanahan. Police were dispatched to the house at 2:56 p.m., he said. The woman had been shot in the head and the man was hit in the hand, McClanahan said. Neither victim had life-threatening injuries, he said. Police do not believe there is any threat to the public from the afternoon shooting, and McClanahan said investigators on Monday were trying to piece together how the two victims were involved. ""We are still trying to figure out exactly the dynamics of how the shooting took place,"" McClanahan said. Terra Crumpton, who was in the house when the shooting occurred, said the shooting was a freak accident Crumpton, who said she's a friend of the couple, said the girlfriend is pregnant and in her first trimester. Crumpton was in another room Monday afternoon when she heard one loud shot and began to panic, thinking she might have been shot herself, she said. ""It scared me almost to death,"" she said. She rushed out of the room to find the woman on the floor and the man screaming out of panic and worry, she said. Crumpton said the two victims were a happy couple -- too happy for a domestic shooting to occur between them. ""I feel sorry for both of them ... that's their first baby,"" she said. As of Monday afternoon, 137 people have been wounded by gunfire in Little Rock so far this year, according to police spokesman officer Steve Moore. He said it was not immediately clear whether the total included victims of accidental shootings. Either way, Moore said the number of people hurt by gunfire has trended upward this year. Last year, 79 people were wounded by gunfire in Little Rock from January to July, and a total of 150 were wounded in the entire year, according to department data. Little Rock has seen a surge of violent crime this year, a trend accented by a mass shooting at a downtown Little Rock nightclub early July 1. A total of 25 people were wounded in the shooting and three others were hurt trying to flee the club, authorities reported. ""It's very concerning,"" Moore said of the increase in shooting victims. ""And it was concerning before we had [the nightclub shooting.]"" The shooting gained national attention and prompted Gov. Asa Hutchinson to announce the creation of a joint investigative force comprised of local, state and federal authorities. At the city level, Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola last week announced dozens of new and existing methods to combat crime in the city.

62,http://time.com/5011599/gun-deaths-rate-america-cdc-data/?xid=homepage,"Firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence in major cities like Chicago, newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. In 2016, there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S. — 4,000 more than 2015, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows. Most gun-related deaths — about two-thirds —in America are suicides, but an Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015. The increase in gun-related deaths follows a nearly 15-year period of relative stasis. “The fact that we are seeing increases in the firearm-related deaths after a long period where it has been stable is concerning,” Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s Center for Health Statistics, told the New York Times. Fortune reported last week that the mortality data also showed an increase in drug-overdose deaths, largely do to the ongoing opioid epidemic. In the wake of Sunday’s mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland, statistics on guns and gun-related deaths are bound to come up as the nation yet again struggles to understand what led to the deaths of 26 people, including children as young as 18-months-old, and how to keep future events like this from occurring. Less than 24 hours after the Texas shooting, the all-too-familiar pattern has already begun to unfold. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have offered their condolences to the families and prayers to those recovering. Many Democrats immediately began demanding gun-safety measures, and President Donald Trump said the shooting was prompted by a “mental health situation,” and wasn’t about firearms. “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries,” Trump said. “But this isn’t a guns situation.” Trump’s statement comes after he rescinded a rule that would have made it more difficult for the mentally ill to buy weapons earlier this year. The Department of Health and Human Services also says that only “3-5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness.” That’s not to say mental illness is not a factor. About 90% of those who die as a result of suicide experience some type of mental illness, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and access to firearms is listed among the group’s risk factors for suicide.

Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and kill six other people in January 2011. (The editorial was published online on June 14, the day several Republicans were wounded in a mass shooting, but appeared in print the following day.) It would normally be very difficult for Palin to win a defamation lawsuit simply because of a factual error. As a celebrity and a political leader, she falls under the tough standard first established by the Supreme Court (ironically) in New York Times Company v. Sullivan (1964), which is “actual malice.” In this context, “malice” does not refer to an emotion but to “reckless disregard for the truth” — that is, knowing something is false but printing it anyway. In this case, the Times is indicted by its own reporting. Just days after Loughner’s shooting spree, the Times reported that he was mentally ill and had been focused on Giffords since 2007 — well before Palin became a national figure: What the cacophony of facts do suggest is that Mr. Loughner is struggling with a profound mental illness (most likely paranoid schizophrenia, many psychiatrists say); that his recent years have been marked by stinging rejection — from his country’s military, his community college, his girlfriends and, perhaps, his father; that he, in turn, rejected American society, including its government, its currency, its language, even its math. Mr. Loughner once declared to his professor that the number 6 could be called 18. … He also may have felt rejected by the American government in general, and by Ms. Giffords in particular, with whom he had a brief — and, to him, unsatisfactory — encounter in 2007. Therefore, the Times had reason to know that what it claimed in its editorial — that “the link to political incitement was clear” — was false. It went on to explain that Palin was responsible because her political action committee had circulated “a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” In fact — as the Times had to know, because it linked to an article by ABC News about the map — the “cross hairs” were above districts, not individual politicians. All of that likely amounts to actual malice under Sullivan. The fact that the Times issued corrections — half-heartedly — would not affect its liability for defamation, but might affect the damages it would face as a result. Certainly Palin can claim that she has been damaged by the editorial: as  she tweeted June 15, similar smears had significantly damaged her reputation and perhaps her political aspirations. (2/2) …WHY someone would no longer be in public eye? Think constant libel & slander have anything to do with it? — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) June 15, 2017 Palin’s complaint does not specify damages, but does ask for a jury trial, and a jury — even in New York, where the lawsuit was filed — might be very sympathetic to her claims, in an age when journalists are loathed even on the left. The Times‘ only possible defense would be that the editorial page is devoted to opinion, not factual reporting. The courts give more leeway to statements in opinion articles because a reasonable reader might take them with a grain of salt. Yet that would force the Times into arguing that the facts on its editorial page — which it takes very seriously — should not be regarded as such. Essentially, the Times would have to that claim its editorials are “fake news.” On Tuesday, the Times vowed to defend against Palin’s lawsuit “vigorously.” That could be a very costly approach, not only in monetary terms but in terms of the Times‘ reputation. It would also allow the Times‘ conservative critics to shine a spotlight — for the months or years that a trial would take — on allegations that it practices “fake news.” Better to offer Palin an apology, a full retraction, and generous compensation.

          / CBS News Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was nearly killed by a gunman during a 2011 shooting that claimed six lives, said in a statement Wednesday that she is ""heartbroken"" about the shooting at a congressional baseball practice session that injured one congressman and several others who were present. ""It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, nor if you're a senator or a representative, nor a staffer or a sworn officer,"" Giffords said. ""If you serve the institution of Congress, you're connected to your colleagues, current and former, by a shared sense of service to ideals far greater than yourself. This shooting is an attack on all who serve and on all who participate in our democracy."" The shooting in Alexandria, Virginia was carried out by James T. Hodgkinson, 66, who died of his injuries after being shot by Capitol Police. Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, the third-ranking House Republican, was injured, as were a congressional staffer, a lobbyist, and two police officers. The hospital where Scalise is being treated said the congressman is in critical condition. ""I am heartbroken for the pain of Congressman Scalise, the other victims, and their family, friends, and colleagues who survived,"" Giffords continued in her statement. ""I am thankful for the great courage of the Capitol Police, who were my protectors after I was shot and became my friends. I also know the courage it takes to recover from a shooting like this, and I know Steve and everyone there this morning have such courage in great supply."" Giffords nearly died after being shot in the head on January 8, 2011 during a public event in the parking lot of a Safeway outside of Tucson. In the wake of that incident, she and her husband, former astronaut Mike Kelly, founded ""Americans for Responsible Solutions,"" a group dedicated to reforming gun laws and reducing violence. Kelly spoke with Face the Nation on April 14, 2013, several months after a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut claimed 26 lives, including 20 small children. At the time, a push was underway in the Senate to pass a bill that would strengthen background checks for gun purchasers, among other reforms. The bill ultimately failed to clear the Senate, but while it was still under consideration, Kelly explained why he believed the effort was so important. ""Right now, 40 percent of guns are bought at gun shows or…over the internet without a background check,"" Kelly explained. ""So it's very easy for the criminals, the dangerously mentally ill to get a gun. So closing those loopholes I think is the number one thing we can do to reduce gun violence in this country."" Kelly compared the push to strengthen gun laws to past reforms that have improved the health and safety of Americans. ""In the 1970s, you know, we had the Clean Air Act that addressed pollution,"" he recalled. ""We didn't get rid of all pollution in our country, but it did make our water cleaner and our air cleaner. And gun violence legislation can do the same thing. We're not going to stop every murder from a gun. We're not going to stop every mass shooting, but we can reduce gun violence with commonsense legislation."" CBS News' Bob Schieffer also asked Kelly about how his wife was doing. ""Gabby's doing great,"" he replied. ""You know, she works really, really hard at her rehab. She does physical rehab, occupational, speech therapy. She's now reenergized by, you know, being involved in something that's going to improve people's lives. So she's doing great."" First published on June 14, 2017 / 4:05 PM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

65,http://time.com/4968108/las-vegas-deadliest-shooting-modern-us-history/?utm_campaign=time&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&xid=time_socialflow_facebook,"In the days since Sunday’s shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, as Americans have struggled to comprehend the meaning of the event, one fact has been a stark reminder of the act’s impact: that, with at least 59 dead and more than 520 injured, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. That phrasing has been inescapable this week, but it also raises a question: in this context, what does modern mean and why does that descriptor matter? That word’s inclusion is key because mass deaths caused by guns have long been a part of American history. But describing those events and recent ones accurately is more complicated than simply drawing a chronological line between them. “Mass shooting is really a new name for a very old, familiar problem,” says criminologist Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History. On Easter Sunday of 1873 in Colfax, La., white citizens gunned down and hung perhaps as many as 150 African Americans. On Dec. 29, 1890, U.S. Army soldiers killed 200 Lakota Native Americans with machine guns at South Dakota’s Wounded Knee Creek. And some historians now believe that more than 300 people died in Tulsa, Okla., between May 31 and June 1, 1921, when whites torched the area’s African-American neighborhoods, driving out victims like Mary J. Parrish, who described fleeing with her baby daughter in hand “amidst showers of bullets from the machine gun.” Then why separate modern American history from what came before? Why not include all of these events on a given list? In practical terms, one reason is that it’s difficult to determine the exact number of victims murdered in the 19th century — a problem that persists today, too. There’s also a vocabulary issue, as different words used to describe similar events can affect perceptions of their significance. “The mid-2000s is around the time that the phrase ‘mass shootings’ started being used more and more,” Duwe says, “whereas during the 1980s and the 1990s, the phrase ‘mass murder’ is used.” (His research uses the term mass public shooting to describe incidents in which four or more victims are killed with a gun in a public location.) And on a deeper level, the matter of who the victims are underscores why terms like “modern” are used to clarify statements about shootings, as a reminder that even if earlier such events are hard to count they did happen. Many have argued this week and in the past that events like the Colfax Massacre and Wounded Knee are seen as separate because, within American history, the deaths of Native Americans and African Americans have not been seen the same as the deaths of white people — and that failing to specify “modern” history while talking about events like Las Vegas only underscores that idea by implying that earlier shootings don’t count. That goes for other minority groups too: For example, on Sept. 2, 1885, white miners in Wyoming went after Chinese miners with guns and hatchets and torched their neighborhoods, killing at least 28 by some counts in what’s known as the Rock Springs massacre. The fact that the earlier shootings in question targeted minorities illustrates what Duwe says is a noteworthy shift in the motives for such crimes. “Prior to the 20th century a lot of mass killings were [orchestrated by] the ‘haves’ murdering the ‘have nots,'” he says. In more recent history, “what we’ve seen is people who have perceived themselves as ‘have-nots’ murdering those they perceive as the ‘haves.'” This shift fosters perception that there are two separate eras of mass shootings, “modern” and pre-modern, even though they are all examples of times when many people were killed by guns. It also means, Duwe points out, that many of these earlier cases were tacitly or explicitly condoned — the killers were the ones in power, after all — so criminal charges were rare. That’s not to say that mass public shootings of the “modern” type didn’t exist before the last few decades. As Duwe notes, increased urbanization after the industrial revolution is correlated with a rise in mass public shootings, because cities mean more people tend to be together in a close area, and such events go back at least to the beginning of the 20th century. For example, a man named Gilbert Twigg killed nine when he fired into a crowd at a concert in Winfield, Kans., in 1903, an event the New York Times called a massacre. These two types of mass shootings — by haves and have-nots — thus overlap chronologically, raising the question of where to draw the line for the beginning of modern American history. One possible starting point could be the 1966 Texas Tower shooting. Because that event was captured on television and came following a period of relative domestic tranquility, in terms of violent crime in the U.S., it felt to many people as if it were an “unprecedented” new phenomenon, Duwe says. According to his research, there have been more than 180 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, but the vast majority of them (more than 80%) have taken place since 1966. And yet it’s clear that there’s no easy way to compare current atrocities to past ones, especially as news stories continue to evolve. One solution to the problem was proposed in the wake of the 2016 mass public shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, by the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists: avoiding such superlatives completely, as comparing a new tragedy to those in history “does it no justice.” Write to Olivia B.

66,http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/senator-warns-u-s-pace-mass-shootings-ever-2017/2019074/," There is perhaps no one in Congress who cares more deeply about the issue of gun violence than Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and he'sÂ extremely concerned about the rate of mass shootings in the United States in 2017. Murphy hasÂ seen firsthand the devastating impact a mass shooting can have on a community.Â HeÂ wasÂ elected to the Senate just a month before 20 children and six adults were brutally gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. For Senator Murphy, addressing gun violenceÂ was always going to be a top priority, but he's particularly alarmed by what he's seen so far this year. ""We are on pace for more mass shootings in 2017 than any year in our history, and nobody knows that, "" Murphy tellsÂ Elite DailyÂ in a conversation on gun violence in the era of Trump. So far this year, there have been 194 mass shootingsÂ in the United StatesÂ and more than 8,300 deaths due to gun violence, according to Gun Violence Archive. Comparatively, there were 384 mass shootings in 2016, and 334 in 2015. In Murphy's view, the frequency of gun violence in the United StatesÂ has left much of the country desensitized, and people only seem to care when mass shootings occur on an ""epic scale."" While a shooting involving 20 or more people will gain people's attention, daily shootings involving four or more people just don't seem to generate the same response, Murphy argues. ""We are normalizing the pace of gun violence in this country, and that has tragic consequences,"" he says. The senator has a point. But between theÂ debate over health care in CongressÂ and theÂ ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia, gun violence seems to have taken a backseat from both a legislative standpoint and in terms of media coverage. It doesn't help that both the White House and Congress are controlled by pro-National Rifle Association (NRA)Â Republicans. In this sense, it's easy to feel somewhat helpless on the issue of gun violence while Trump is president. But, Murphy actually seems quite hopeful about the long-term future, given the energy and activism he's seen from the anti-gun violence movement. In Murphy's view, it would be a huge victory for the anti-gun violence movement if it were able to ""hold the law where it is over the course of the next year and a half."" He's careful to note that the gun lobby accomplished a lot the last time Republicans controlled Congress and the White House, and he urges people to be active in the 2018 and 2020 elections. Murphy seems encouraged by the fact most ofÂ the public seems to be on the side of change when it comes to gun violence. ""We need laws that make sure law-abiding citizens can own weapons, and that criminals and people with serious mental illness can't. It's pretty simple"" Murphy says.Â ""The vast majority of the American public support those kind of laws."" HeÂ understands that nothing is going to happen overnight on this issue. The senatorÂ said, ""Everybody has to understand that no great social change movement found success overnight, and every great social change movement met lots of failure before they found success,"" he adds.Â ""We have to be patient. We're up against a political juggernaut."" Murphy notes it took 10 years, for example, for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which instituted a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchasers in the United States, to be passed after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. While the senator saysÂ he hopes it doesn't take a decadeÂ for a background check bill, which would also require background checks for gun sales by private sellers,Â to get passed, he preaches patience on this issue and understands change doesn't come easily. After the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise in Alexandria, Virginia, there was debate over whether it was appropriate to ""politicize"" what happened. In the wake of that shooting, MurphyÂ says his first priority was ""trying to ensure my friends were still alive."" But, Murphy adds, Relatedly, the senator also takes issue with aÂ controversial ad recently released by the NRA. ""There's no way to watch that ad without seeing it as a preview of civil conflict between the left and the right,"" Murphy says. He believes the ad essentially calls on NRA members to arm themselves to prepare for a ""physical conflict against progressives."" The Connecticut senator is clearly aware of the strength of the gun lobby and the lengths it's willing to go to gain support among the public. But he's also encouraged by the progress he's seen in states that have taken measures to reduce gun violence, including in Connecticut. ""States that take all available measures to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people have radically lower rates of gun violence than states with permissive laws,"" Murphy says. Even if Trump and Republicans in Congress won't fight for gun reform, there are things everyone can do -- including fighting for change at the local level -- to help make the country safer. As Murphy puts it, This is easier said than done, of course, but not impossible.",2017-07-18 09:33:02,Senator Warns The U.S. Is “On Pace” For Most Mass Shootings Ever In 2017,,70102,http://elitedaily.com/#spider

By Peter Hessler When Karen Kulp was a child, she believed that the United States of America as she knew it was going to end on June 6, 1966. Her parents were from the South, and they had migrated to Colorado, where Kulp’s father was involved in mining operations and various entrepreneurial activities. In terms of ideology, her parents had started with the John Birch Society, and then they became more radical, until they thought that an invasion was likely to take place on 6/6/66, because it resembled the number of the Beast. “We thought we were going to have a world war, there would be Communists coming, we’d have to kill somebody for a loaf of bread,” Kulp said recently. She was thirteen when doomsday came. The family was living in Del Norte, Colorado, and they had packed gas masks, ammunition, canned food, and other supplies. As the day went on, Kulp said, she began to think that the invasion wasn’t going to happen. “And then I thought, I’m going to have to go to school tomorrow.” In time, Kulp began to question her parents’ ideas. Her father became a pioneer in far-right radio, re-broadcasting the shows of Tom Valentine, who often promoted conspiracy theories and was accused of anti-Semitism. The family sometimes attended Aryan Nations training camps. “It was for whites only,” Kulp said. “It would teach you that whites were the supreme race, all of that shit.” She pointed to her heart: “It just didn’t fit in with this right here.” By the time Kulp was twenty, she had rejected her parents’ racism. She worked as a nurse, eventually specializing in geriatric care, and during the nineteen-eighties she participated in pro-choice demonstrations. Last autumn, she was energized by the Presidential election. In Grand Junction, the largest city in western Colorado, Kulp campaigned with a group of citizens who became active shortly after the release of the “Access Hollywood” recording, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about assaulting women. One of the campaigners was a working mother named Lisa Gaizutis. Her eleven-year-old son had friends whose parents had declared that they would move to Canada if the election went the wrong way, so he did everything possible to free up his mother’s afternoons. “He said he’d take care of himself as long as I was campaigning,” Gaizutis remembered, after the election. “He’d text me and say, ‘You can stay late, I’m done with my homework.’ ” The majority of these activists were women, but their backgrounds were varied. Laureen Gutierrez’s ancestors had come from Spain via Mexico; Marjorie Haun was a special-education teacher who had left her job because of a vocal disability. Matt Patterson was a high-school dropout who, through a series of unlikely events, had acquired a classics degree from Columbia University. All of the activists had arrived in the same place, as fervent supporters of Donald Trump, and on the day of the Inauguration they met in Grand Junction to celebrate. On January 20th, nearly two hundred people attended the Mesa County Republican Women’s DeploraBall. They watched a live feed of the Presidential Inaugural Ball, and they took photographs of one another next to cardboard cutouts of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan, which had been arranged on the mezzanine of the Avalon Theatre. The theatre has an elegant Romanesque Revival façade, and it was built in the twenties, during one of the periodic resource-extraction booms that have shaped the city and its psyche. Grand Junction, with its surrounding area, has a population of some hundred and fifty thousand, and it sits in a wide, windswept valley. There are dry mountains and mesas on all sides, and the landscape gives the town a self-contained feel. Even its history revolves around events that were suffered alone. Residents often refer to their own “Black Sunday,” a date that’s meaningless anywhere else: May 2, 1982, when Exxon decided to abandon an enormous oil-shale project, with devastating effects on Grand Junction’s economy. The region is a Republican stronghold in a state that is starkly divided. Clinton won the Colorado popular vote by a modest margin, but Trump took nearly twice as many counties. The difference came from Denver and Boulder, two populous and liberal enclaves on the Front Range, the eastern side of the Rockies—the Colorado equivalents of New York and California. “Donald Trump lost those two counties by two hundred and seventy-three thousand votes, and he won the rest of the state by a hundred and forty thousand votes,” Steve House, the former chair of the state Republican Party, told me. “That means that most of Colorado, in my mind, is a conservative state.” It also means that Colorado’s economy and culture change dramatically from the Front Range to the Western Slope, on the other side of the Continental Divide. Between 2010 and 2015, the Front Range experienced ninety-six per cent of Colorado’s population growth, and the state’s unemployment rate is only 2.3 per cent. But Grand Junction lost eleven per cent of its workforce between 2009 and 2014, in part because the local energy industry collapsed in the wake of the worldwide drop in gas prices. Average annual family earnings are around ten thousand dollars less than the state figure. Most Grand Junction Republicans initially supported Ted Cruz, and, in August, 2016, after Trump won the nomination, a young first vice-chair of the county Party named Michael Lentz resigned. Lentz decided that advocating for Trump would contradict his Christian faith; he was particularly bothered by Trump’s attacks on immigrants and on the press. “I spent a month trying to come to grips with it, but I couldn’t,” Lentz told me. In October, Matt Patterson, who grew up in Grand Junction but now lives in Washington, D.C., returned to his home town to serve as the Party’s regional field director for the Presidential campaign. He lasted for four days. This was shortly after the “Access Hollywood” tape was leaked, and Patterson’s first act as field director was to propose that the Party hold a Women for Trump rally. But the county chairman refused. “His exact words were, ‘That’s picking a fight we can’t win,’ ” Patterson told me. He quit the campaign and organized the rally on his own. In his estimation, most Republicans would find Trump’s comments repugnant, but they would be even more resentful of the coastal media that was pushing the story. The Women for Trump rally was a local turning point. More than a hundred people showed up, and it galvanized a group of activists. Like other grassroots supporters across the country, they named themselves after Hillary Clinton’s comment that half of Trump’s adherents were racists, sexists, and others who belonged in a “basket of deplorables.” The Deplorables’ approach to the election was fiercely unapologetic. Karen Kulp told me that Trump wasn’t racist; he was simply calling for immigrants to be held accountable to the law. She said she would never support a hateful candidate, because her childhood contact with extremist groups had made her sensitive to such issues. For Kulp, who is in her mid-sixties and describes her income as limited, the campaign was empowering. Like many in Grand Junction, she believed that Trump would kick-start the local energy industry by reducing regulations. She told me that she had never shaken the sense that the country is under threat. “I think America is lost to us,” she said. “Because of the way I was raised, that is baggage that I will have for the rest of my life.” The Deplorables funded their own activities, and they pooled money in order to buy Trump shirts, hats, and buttons from Amazon, because the official campaign provided almost nothing. “I made about a dozen Amazon orders,” Kulp said, at the DeploraBall. “Every shirt you see here tonight, I bought.” At the Avalon, the crowd fell silent while a woman prayed: “Thank you for giving us a President who will, with your help, restore this nation to her former glory, the way you created her.” Less than two weeks later, the Deplorables effectively took over the county Republican leadership, with members winning three positions, including the chair. Others looked farther afield. “If Trump won Wisconsin, he could have won Colorado,” Patterson told me. “The issues were here—immigration and energy.” He believed that without the infighting of the last campaign they could do better. In 2018, there will be an election to replace John Hickenlooper, the Democratic Colorado governor, who will vacate his seat because of term limits. At the DeploraBall, Patterson told me that the Republicans can win the governorship and then, two years later, deliver Colorado to Trump. He said, “We’re going to start on the Western Slope and do a sweep east and color it red.” Like many parts of America that strongly supported Trump, Grand Junction is a rural place with problems that have traditionally been associated with urban areas. In the past three years, felony filings have increased by nearly sixty-five per cent, and there are more than twice as many open homicide cases as there were a decade ago. There’s an epidemic of drug addiction and also of suicide: residents of Mesa County kill themselves at a rate that’s nearly two and a half times that of the nation. Some of this is tied to economic problems, but there’s also an issue of perception. The decrease in gas drilling weighs heavily on the minds of locals, although few people seem to realize that the energy industry now represents less than three per cent of local employment. They’ve been slow to embrace other sectors, such as health care and education, which seem to have more potential for future growth. During the campaign, Trump’s descriptions of inner-city crime and hopelessness often seemed cartoonish to urban residents, but not to rural voters—in Mesa County, Trump won nearly sixty-five per cent of the vote. Pueblo, another large rural Colorado county, has a steel industry that’s been on the wane since the nineteen-eighties. Its county seat now has the state’s highest homicide rate, and last election the county switched from blue to red. Far from Denver and Boulder, there are many places where an atmosphere of decline has lasted for two or more generations, leaving a profound impact on the outlook of young people. Matt Patterson told me that as a boy he had always hoped to escape his home town. In 1985, when he was twelve, almost fifteen per cent of the homes in Grand Junction were vacant, because of the effects of Black Sunday. Patterson’s dream was to become a magician. His parents were middle class—his father sold lumber; his mother worked in insurance—and they were upset when he dropped out of school at the beginning of tenth grade. He moved to South Florida, where he established himself as a specialist in closeup magic. He worked in restaurants, performing sleight-of-hand tricks for diners, and eventually he expanded into private parties, trade shows, and cruise ships. By his early twenties, he was earning more than forty thousand dollars a year. Years later, he described the experience as a “brutal education,” and he self-published a business manual for aspiring magicians. Some advice is technical: for magic, silver Liberty half-dollars are better than Kennedys; in low light, use cards that are red instead of blue. The manual was written long before Patterson entered politics, but any candidate would recognize the wisdom of sleight of hand. (“A good friend once told me that the only difference between a salesman and a con-man is that a salesman has confidence in his product.”) In 1997, Patterson was riding in a car that was hit by a drunk driver, and the bones of his left arm were shattered into several dozen pieces. After six surgeries, he suffered permanent nerve damage, decreased arm mobility, and no future as a closeup magician. Having acquired his G.E.D., he enrolled in classes at the University of Miami. The quality of Patterson’s writing impressed an instructor, who persuaded him to apply to Columbia. The year that Patterson turned thirty, he became an Ivy League freshman. He majored in classics. Every night, he translated four hundred lines of ancient Greek and Latin. In class, he often argued with professors and students. “The default view seemed to be that Western civilization is inherently bad,” he told me. In one history seminar, when students discussed the evils of the Western slave trade, Patterson pointed out that many cultures had practiced slavery, but that nobody decided to eradicate it until individuals in the West took up the cause. The class booed him. In Patterson’s opinion, most people at Columbia believed that only liberal views were legitimate, whereas his experiences in Grand Junction, and his textbook lessons from magic, indicated otherwise. (“States of mind are no different than feats of manual dexterity. Both can be learned through patience and diligence.”) “Look, I’m a high-school dropout who went to an Ivy League school,” Patterson said. “I’ve seen both sides. The people at Columbia are not smarter.” He continued, “I went to Columbia at the height of the Iraq War. There were really legitimate arguments against going into Iraq. But I found that the really good arguments against going were made by William F. Buckley, Bob Novak, and Pat Buchanan. What I saw on the left was all slogans and group thought and clichés.” Patterson graduated with honors and a reinvigorated sense of political conviction. For the past seven years, he’s worked for conservative nonprofit organizations, most recently in anti-union activism. In 2013, the United Auto Workers tried to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, where Patterson demonstrated a knack for billboards and catchphrases. On one sign, he paired a photograph of a hollowed-out Packard plant with the words “Detroit: Brought to You by the UAW.” Another billboard said “United Auto Workers,” with the word “Auto” crossed out and replaced by “Obama,” written in red. In Patterson’s opinion, such issues are cultural and emotional as much as economic. He believes that unions once served a critical function in American industry, but that the leadership, like that of the Democratic Party, has drifted too far from its base. Union heads back liberal candidates such as Obama and Clinton while dues-paying members tend to hold very different views. Patterson also thinks that free trade, which he once embraced as a conservative, has damaged American industries, and he now supports some more protectionist measures. His message resonated in Chattanooga, where, in 2014, workers delivered a stinging defeat to the U.A.W. Since then, Patterson has continued his advocacy in communities across the country, under the auspices of Americans for Tax Reform, which was founded by the conservative advocate Grover Norquist. “So now I bust unions for Grover Norquist with a classics degree and as a former magician,” he told me. As a magician, Patterson went by the name Magnus, taken from Albertus Magnus, the thirteenth-century saint and supposed alchemist. Patterson is of slightly less than average height, with features that are nondescript in a way that allows him to shift easily from one appearance to another. At the DeploraBall he wore a fedora, a pin-striped suit jacket, and eyeglasses with stylish John Varvatos frames. But at other times he dresses with the flair of a goth: black T-shirt, leather bracelet studded with skulls, silver ring decorated with a flying bat. Sometimes he paints his fingernails black. These accessories vanish when it’s time to interact with factory workers, voters, or Republicans in Middle America. In July, 2016, Patterson bet a friend two hundred dollars that Trump would win the Presidency. His conservative Washington friends didn’t take Trump seriously, but Patterson believed that the candidate’s ability to connect with voters was uncanny. (“Remember that you will be performing for people of varying degrees of education, in varying degrees of sobriety, and your routines must be easily understood by all of them.”) Last October, three weeks before the election, Donald Trump visited Grand Junction for a rally in an airport hangar. Along with other members of the press, I was escorted into a pen near the back, where a metal fence separated us from the crowd. At that time, some prominent polls showed Clinton leading by more than ten percentage points, and Trump often claimed that the election might be rigged. During the rally he said, “There’s a voter fraud also with the media, because they so poison the minds of the people by writing false stories.” He pointed in our direction, describing us as “criminals,” among other things: “They’re lying, they’re cheating, they’re stealing! They’re doing everything, these people right back here!” The attacks came every few minutes, and they served as a kind of tether to the speech. The material could have drifted off into abstraction—e-mails, Benghazi, the Washington swamp. But every time Trump pointed at the media, the crowd turned, and by the end people were screaming and cursing at us. One man tried to climb over the barrier, and security guards had to drag him away. Such behavior is out of character for residents of rural Colorado, where politeness and public decency are highly valued. Erin McIntyre, a Grand Junction native who works for the Daily Sentinel, the local paper, stood in the crowd, where the people around her screamed at the journalists: “Lock them up!” “Hang them all!” “Electric chair!” Afterward, McIntyre posted a description of the event on Facebook. “I thought I knew Mesa County,” she wrote. “That’s not what I saw yesterday. And it scared me.” Before Trump took office, people I met in Grand Junction emphasized pragmatic reasons for supporting him. The economy was in trouble, and Trump was a businessman who knew how to make rational, profit-oriented decisions. Supporters almost always complained about some aspect of his character, but they also believed that these flaws were likely to help him succeed in Washington. “I’m not voting for him to be my pastor,” Kathy Rehberg, a local real-estate agent, said. “I’m voting for him to be President. If I have rats in my basement, I’m going to try to find the best rat killer out there. I don’t care if he’s ugly or if he’s sociable. All I care about is if he kills rats.” After the turbulent first two months of the Administration, I met again with Kathy Rehberg and her husband, Ron. They were satisfied with Trump’s performance, and their complaints about his behavior were mild. “I think some of it is funny, how he doesn’t let people push him around,” Ron Rehberg said. Over time, such remarks became more common. “I hate to say it, but I wake up in the morning looking forward to what else is coming,” Ray Scott, a Republican state senator who had campaigned for Trump, told me in June. One lawyer said bluntly, “I get a kick in the ass out of him.” The calculus seemed to have shifted: Trump’s negative qualities, which once had been described as a means to an end, now had value of their own. The point wasn’t necessarily to get things done; it was to retaliate against the media and other enemies. This had always seemed fundamental to Trump’s appeal, but people had been less likely to express it so starkly before he entered office. “For those of us who believe that the media has been corrupt for a lot of years, it’s a way of poking at the jellyfish,” Karen Kulp told me in late April. “Just to make them mad.” In Grand Junction, people wanted Trump to accomplish certain things with the pragmatism of a businessman, but they also wanted him to make them feel a certain way. The assumption has always been that, while emotional appeal might have mattered during the campaign, the practical impact of a Trump Presidency would prove more important. Liberals claimed that Trump would fail because his policies would hurt the people who had voted for him. But the lack of legislative accomplishment seems only to make supporters take more satisfaction in Trump’s behavior. And thus far the President’s tone, rather than his policies, has had the greatest impact on Grand Junction. This was evident even before the election, with the behavior of supporters at the candidate’s rally, the conflicts within the local Republican Party, and an increased distrust of anything having to do with government. Sheila Reiner, a Republican who serves as the county clerk, said that during the campaign she had dealt with many allegations of fraud following Trump’s claims that the election could be rigged. “People came in and said, ‘I want to see where you’re tearing up the ballots!’ ” Reiner told me. Reiner and her staff gave at least twenty impromptu tours of their office, in an attempt to convince voters that the Republican county clerk wasn’t trying to throw the election to Clinton. The Daily Sentinel publishes editorials from both the right and the left, and it didn’t endorse a Presidential candidate. But supporters picked up on Trump’s obsession with crowd size, repeatedly accusing the Sentinel of underestimating attendance at rallies. The paper ran a story about vandalism of political signs, with examples given from both campaigns, but readers were outraged that the photograph featured only a torn Clinton banner. The Sentinel immediately ran a second article with a photograph of a vandalized Trump sign. When Erin McIntyre described the Grand Junction rally on Facebook, online attacks by Trump supporters were so vicious that she feared for her safety. After three days, she deleted the post. In February, a bill that was intended to give journalists better access to government records was introduced in a Colorado senate committee, which was chaired by Ray Scott, a Republican. The process was delayed for unknown reasons, and the Sentinel published an editorial with a mild prompt: “We call on our own Sen. Scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward.” Scott responded with a series of Trump-style tweets. “We have our own fake news in Grand Junction,” he wrote. “The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill.” Jay Seaton, the Sentinel’s publisher, threatened to sue Scott for defamation. In an editorial, he wrote, “When a state senator accused The Sentinel of being fake news, he was deliberately attempting to delegitimize a credible news source in order to avoid being held accountable by it.” The Huffington Post and other national outlets mentioned the spat. When I met with Scott, he seemed pleased by the attention. A burly, friendly man who works as a contractor, he told me, “I was kind of Trumpish before Trump was cool.” “We used to just take it on the chin if somebody said something about us,” he said. “The fake-news thing became the popular thing to say, because of Trump.” He believed that Trump has performed a service by popularizing the term. “I’ve seen journalists like yourself doing a better job,” Scott told me. He’s considering a run for governor, in part because of Trump’s example. “People are looking for something different,” he said. “They’re looking for somebody who means what they say.” In late February, shortly after the exchange between Scott and Seaton, an entrepreneur named Tyler Riehl started a campaign against the Sentinel. He wrote on Facebook, “If I’ve learned one thing from Donald Trump’s election it’s that we can ignore the political pundits telling us we must play nice with the press—even when they’re crooked and dishonest.” Riehl announced a five-hundred-dollar reward for anybody exposing “local media malfeasance,” and he fashioned a hundred newspaper delivery boxes decorated with a “Ghostbusters”-style icon that read, “FAKE NEWS.” Riehl distributed the boxes at a rally called Toast for Trump, which was dutifully covered by the Sentinel, along with a fact-checked head count (a hundred and twenty). In Grand Junction, I learned to suspend any customary assumptions regarding political identity. I encountered countless strong working women, some of whom believed in abortion rights, who had voted for Trump. Cultural cues could be misleading: I interviewed one gentle, hippieish Trump voter who wore his gray hair in a ponytail. An experience like leaving a small town for an Ivy League college, which might lead some people to embrace more liberal ideas, could inspire in others a deeper conservatism. And so I wasn’t entirely surprised to learn that Tyler Riehl, like me, was a former Peace Corps volunteer. He had served in Slovakia. “Every time you get to look at how somebody else lives, it gives you perspective that’s useful,” Riehl told me. In 2000, he was sent to a village in eastern Slovakia, where he advocated for bicyclists’ rights. Riehl told me that living in a post-Communist society strengthened his appreciation for freedom, truth, and the virtues of small government. Now he was applying that idealism to his current campaign. “I do unequivocally state that the Sentinel is full of fake news,” he said. Some residents found these attacks deeply misguided. “I think there’s a lot of emotion involved, and people are bringing opinions from the national debate into the local arena,” Bill Vrettos, a consultant with the Alternative Board, which advises businesses, told me. He described his politics as “radically middle-of-the-road,” and he didn’t believe that the Sentinel was slanted. In his opinion, a small-town newspaper plays a different role from that of a big publication, and he mentioned a recent incident in which two high-school students had killed themselves within a twenty-four-hour period. Before the Sentinel reported anything, Seaton, the publisher, had organized a meeting with school officials, mental-health experts, a suicide task force, and the father of a boy who had killed himself. The experts warned about copycat suicides, so the newspaper kept the deaths off the front page. I met with Seaton at the Sentinel’s downtown office, where a conference-room wall is decorated with two framed front pages that reported the news from historically tragic dates: September 11, 2001, and May 2, 1982. The building has a three-level Goss printing press that is capable of turning out a hundred and fifty thousand issues per hour, because it was purchased in the early eighties, when people once again thought the oil-shale industry was about to take off. The current circulation is around twenty-five thousand. Seaton is from a Kansas-based family that owns eight newspapers around the Midwest; in 2009, they acquired the Sentinel. “I come from a long line of Republicans,” he told me. “My great-uncle served in Eisenhower’s Cabinet as Interior Secretary.” But he admitted that he finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile himself to today’s conservative movement. “The Party is too accommodating of elements that I would consider fringe, bordering on hate groups,” he said. Seaton formerly worked as a corporate lawyer, and he believed that he had a valid case of defamation against Ray Scott. But he had decided not to proceed with a lawsuit. He worried that Trump uses the term “fake news” so often that its interpretation might change by the time a case reached judgment. “Maybe those words have lost their objective meaning,” Seaton said. During the election season, it’s common for some people to cancel their subscriptions, but last year the Sentinel lost more of them than usual. That’s one of the ironies of the age: the New York Times and the Washington Post, which Trump often attacks by name, have gained subscribers and public standing, while a small institution like the Sentinel has been damaged within its community. Seaton didn’t know how to handle the fake-news accusations, although he had considered inviting Tyler Riehl to shadow a reporter for a day. He had also thought about doubling the reward for local media malfeasance. That five hundred dollars still hasn’t been claimed. In the past eight months, I have never heard anybody express regret for voting for Donald Trump. If anything, investigations into the Trump campaign’s connections with Russia have made supporters only more faithful. “I’m loving it—I hope they keep going down the Russia rabbit hole,” Matt Patterson told me, in June. He believes that Democrats are banking on an impeachment instead of doing the hard work of trying to connect with voters. “They didn’t even get rid of their leadership after the election,” he said. But Trump’s connection with supporters also involves a great risk. Many Presidential acts that feel satisfying—the unfiltered insults, the attacks on institutions—also make it difficult to achieve anything practical and positive. And the resulting legislative failures typically inspire more emotion. In late June, after the Senate delayed a vote on the health-care bill, Trump embarked on a Twitter spree, labelling various organizations fake news and claiming that Mika Brzezinski, the MSNBC host, had recently had a facelift that left her bleeding in public. Excuses are naturally built into this toxic cycle. Supporters can always say that Trump was never given a chance, and that the media, the Russia investigation, and other conspiracies have worked against him. In such a climate, it’s difficult to prove incompetence: true pragmatism would be quick and dirty, but emotional cycles can be sustained for much longer. I find it easy to imagine myself at a rally in 2020, standing in a pen while people scream at me. Smaller places may also be particularly vulnerable to the President’s negative tone, which makes it harder to find practical solutions to local problems. In Grand Junction, the average age of a school building is forty-four years, and the district is ranked a hundred and seventy-first out of a hundred and seventy-eight in the state, in terms of funding per student. Property taxes, which fund the schools, are among the lowest of Colorado cities. In November, two measures that would increase school funding will be on the ballot, but the last time such a proposal came to a vote, in 2011, it was rejected. Voters have also not approved an increase in the sales tax since 1989. The next ballot will propose a rise of about a third of one per cent, in order to fund local law enforcement and public-safety services. Even as crime has risen, resources have dropped; the county currently has 1.15 deputies per thousand residents, in comparison with a state average of 2.28. Police departments are so understaffed that many areas aren’t patrolled. “They just bounce from service call to service call,” Daniel Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney, told me. Approximately fourteen per cent of the population is Hispanic, although that figure would be higher if it included undocumented immigrants. When I asked Rubinstein about people who don’t have legal status, he said, “That’s never been a significant proportion of our crime problem.” Trump supporters also seemed to understand this. I never heard anybody blame Hispanics for local crime, or make racist remarks about them; it was much more common to encounter Islamophobia, although the nearest mosque is about four hours away. In a climate of intense distrust of government, it will be particularly difficult to persuade voters to approve new funding. Some residents told me that they want further cuts in education—even in the high desert they were determined to drain the swamp. But there are long-term costs to this mentality. One bright spot in the economy has been the growth of Colorado Mesa University, the largest institution of higher education on the Western Slope, but it’s hard to become a true college town when public schools are so badly underfunded. In June, at an economic conference at the university, I met Erik Valk, the founder of Principelle, a Dutch company that manufactures medical devices. Valk was thinking about opening a production center in Grand Junction, because he loved the natural setting, but he was concerned that the culture might be too inward-looking. “I’m trying to discover if there is a trend in this direction—whether they want to open to the world,” Valk said. “I spoke with the sheriff this morning and he has a funding problem, and he has a crime problem.” One person told me half in jest that the best way to get voters to approve new funding would be to blame everything on a lack of support by Denver élites: a tax increase in the guise of rugged self-reliance. “It’s about creating an us-versus-them victim narrative,” he said. He was being cynical, but he was also acknowledging the power of perspective and feeling. This seems to be the weakness of the Democratic Party, which often gives people the impression that they are being informed of their logical best interests. On the other side, people feel ignored or insulted—this was why they responded so strongly to Clinton’s use of the term “deplorables.” “What she said was, ‘If you don’t vote for me, you’re morally unworthy to talk to, to take seriously,’ ” Patterson told me. In Grand Junction, it was often dispiriting to see such enthusiasm for a figure who could become the ultimate political boom-and-bust. There was idealism, too, and so many pro-Trump opinions were the fruit of powerful and legitimate life experiences. “We just assume that if someone voted for Trump that they’re racist and uneducated,” Jeriel Brammeier, the twenty-six-year-old chair of the local Democratic Party, told me. “We can’t think about it like that.” People have reasons for the things that they believe, and the intensity of their experiences can’t be taken for granted; it’s not simply a matter of having Fox News on in the background. But perhaps this is a way to distinguish between the President and his supporters. Almost everybody I met in Grand Junction seemed more complex, more interesting, and more decent than the man who inspires them. During my conversation with Brammeier, I asked why she had entered politics. “I got pregnant when I was sixteen,” she said. Grand Junction has a high teen-pregnancy rate, and Brammeier had been one of eight girls, out of about two hundred in her twelfth-grade year, who had babies. The town has no Planned Parenthood clinic or designated abortion provider, and in 2015, for reasons both fiscal and ideological, the Republican-controlled state senate voted down a bill that would have provided funding for an effective state-wide contraception program. “Our state senator Ray Scott voted to defund it,” Brammeier said. Private funds filled the gap until last year, when it was included in the state budget. Brammeier told me that she wants to improve the community for her daughter: “She was on my back when she was three months old, and I was canvassing for Obama.” Who could stand before this woman and deny the power of her experience? But that was true on both sides; there were many hard-earned faiths in Grand Junction. In early March, I talked with Governor Hickenlooper, who had just met with Trump in Washington, along with other governors. “He was different from anything I had seen on TV,” Hickenlooper said, mentioning that Trump seemed intent on solving problems. But, since then, Hickenlooper has become sharply critical of the Administration. Last week, he announced that Colorado will join the U.S. Climate Alliance, and he told me that he will be “aggressive” in resisting Trump policies that contradict Colorado’s interests, especially with regard to the environment. “Our goal is not just to meet Paris, but to go beyond Paris,” he said. In 2014, Hickenlooper was reëlected with only forty-nine per cent of the vote, and next year’s election for his replacement will likely be close. In the middle of June, George Brauchler, one of the more conservative candidates in the Republican primary, came to Grand Junction and spoke to local members of the Party. Around sixty people attended, including some Deplorables. Brauchler is a district attorney in the Denver suburbs, where he prosecuted James Holmes, the perpetrator of the mass shooting, in 2012, in a movie theatre in Aurora. After Brauchler gave a short speech, the first question came from a heavyset man wearing a baseball cap: “What do you think about Sharia?” Brauchler kept it short—“Not a fan”—and moved on. “You’re from a liberal area,” another man said. “How are you going to handle that kind of media attack? Because you are going to be deluged with that liberal mentality from Boulder and Denver.” Brauchler said, “I’ve developed great relationships with the local media, and in part that happens through transparency and accountability. These are people who largely just want to report on stories and tell the truth as best they can.” Not long ago, I might have fixated on certain details of Brauchler’s speech. He complained about the overregulation of fossil fuels, and how the owners of electric Tesla cars don’t pay state gasoline taxes. But why split hairs? He didn’t threaten to throw other candidates into prison, and he didn’t ask people to vote for him while simultaneously telling them that the election might be rigged. His facts were real facts. He had worked in public service. He used the sentence “I’m not a rich guy.” He spoke well, and among his listeners he drew out one of the best qualities of Coloradans—not anger or fear or self-victimhood but a certain quirkiness that is at once direct and slightly off kilter. Afterward, a woman in her sixties approached Brauchler. “I kinda like you,” she said. “I’m a Libra,” he replied. “You remind me of my ex-husband.” In his speech, Brauchler expressed support for the President, but he separated himself from Trump’s tone. When I asked him about the Administration, he said, “I just would like there to be some deëmphasis on the stylistic stuff and more focus on the substantive stuff.” He mentioned health-care reform and the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. “If we fail to deliver on those things, there are going to be consequences,” he said. His comments made me wonder whether another bad few months will lead to more open separation by Republican candidates. This would be the hardest thing for supporters to accept—that the emotional appeal of Donald Trump means far less to professional politicians. During my last meeting with Matt Patterson, I asked whether Trump’s behavior might limit his effectiveness even while appealing to his base. “I see your point,” Patterson said, but he still believed that Trump would accomplish great things. “If Trump turns out to be a failure, I’ll take responsibility for that,” he said. “For my share.” We were at a coffee shop, and Patterson wore his goth look: silver jewelry, painted nails. “I’ve never been this emotionally invested in a political leader in my life,” he said. “The more they hate him, the more I want him to succeed. Because what they hate about him is what they hate about me.” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated Karen Kulp’s family name.

70,http://time.com/4970279/fight-over-gun-control-isnt-really-about-guns/?iid=sr-link8,"Over the roar of the guitar, the gunfire erupted. At first the country-music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas thought the loudspeakers were malfunctioning or that the pyrotechnics had gone awry. But as the bodies crumpled, the crowd began to grasp the horror that was unfolding. The rapid pop pop pop exploded around Doris Huser, 29. She and her 8-year-old daughter had been in the bathroom, but when the shooting began, they pushed back into the crowd, toward the sound of the bullets, in search of Huser’s 5-year-old son and her developmentally disabled sister. They could feel the bullets pinging off the concession stands, ricocheting off the pavement around them. About 50 yards away, Tyler Reeve, a 36-year-old country artist and songwriter, dove into a production trailer with five friends and lay on the floor as hundreds of rounds rang out. “It was like a war zone,” he says. Piles of bodies were everywhere. Blood collected in pools. Everyone was screaming. Melissa Bayer, who had just left a nearby Hooters, witnessed the mayhem from a hundred yards away. This a mass shooting, she thought. This is what it looks like. If their initial reaction to the opening salvos at 10:08 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 1 had been confusion, the 22,000 concertgoers spent the next nine to 11 minutes of protracted gunfire trapped in a nightmare that, for so many Americans, has somehow become grimly familiar: the shaky cell-phone footage of carnage, the photographs of innocent victims in the newspaper, the profiles of horror and heroism. There was the 48-year-old woman who heard her husband, a father of four, collapse on the asphalt next to her, and the young man who sprinted alongside his eight-months’-pregnant wife, running for their lives. There was the 30-year-old woman who lay on top of her 21-year-old brother to protect him from the hail of bullets, “because he has big goals in life.” But when the shooting ended, this terror would be in a class apart. Stephen Paddock, 64, who smashed the windows of his 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino suite and trained an assault-style semiautomatic weapon on the helpless souls four football fields away, broke another dismal record for American murder. At least 58 dead, at least 527 wounded, by a man who, for no immediately discernible reason, lugged an arsenal of 23 weapons into his high-roller suite and then rained of hundreds upon hundreds of bullets into a tightly packed crowd. Twelve of his high-powered rifles were modified with legal parts that made them function like automatic weapons, capable of unleashing nine rounds per second, a rate of fire rarely seen off the field of war. The military-grade rounds, fired from what seemed to be large-capacity magazines, produced so much gun smoke they set off the detectors in Paddock’s suite. Year after year, mass shootings have broken record after record for casualties. From a university in Virginia to a gay dance club in Orlando, the body count has increased, creating an image of an unstoppable national slaughter. High-profile battles over background checks and gun-show loopholes have stalled on Capitol Hill, even as gun-rights advocates introduce new provisions to weaken the existing constraints. But it’s not an unfixable problem. New laws could at least limit the carnage when a murderer opens up on a crowd. We have decided that grenade launchers should not be widely available; why should we not say the same for devices that allow bullets to be fired at a rate of more than 400 rounds per minute? Nor is the political divide as unbridgeable as it appears. The National Rifle Association (NRA) and its allies are not all-powerful: the lobby relies on the intensity of a small cadre of fervent supporters, and it does lose races, such as last year’s campaign to replace Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The majority of gun owners believe in some form of regulation, and several Republican Senators have suggested they are open to compromise. The challenge in bringing change is that the debate over gun rights isn’t really about guns at all. It’s about what they represent: cherished freedoms, a reverence for independence. The guns are a rejection of political correctness that creeps into everything. Even the most incremental move to constrain deadly weaponry seems to many Americans to cut against their rights. In the blood-soaked scene on the Vegas Strip, those deeply held beliefs collide with our collective horror. The question now, as the victims try to make sense of slaughter on a military scale, is where do we draw the line? If that is a political question, it is has proven a confounding one. There are an estimated 265 million guns in the U.S., according to one study from Harvard and Northeastern universities–greater than the total number of votes cast in last year’s presidential election. They are owned by 30% of the adult population. That’s not a constituency to be dismissed. But not all gun owners are against all forms of gun control. A Quinnipiac University poll in June 2017 showed 94% of voters support background checks for all gun buyers–including 93% of Republicans. The same poll found that a majority, 57%, believed guns are too easy to buy, and only 35% thought more people carrying guns would make Americans safer. A Pew survey of gun owners found that almost 30% of them support stricter gun laws. “There’s a complete disconnect,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat. So why are measures like closing background-check loopholes and limiting high-capacity magazines not already law? It’s partly because a small but intense group of gun-rights advocates oppose them. A paltry 3% of households own half of all of the guns in America, and they vote. It is they who argue most vocally that if existing gun-control laws can’t stop mass shootings, why would new laws be any better? Change might make people feel good, this argument goes, but it wouldn’t protect Americans. “Short of a total ban on firearms, nothing being suggested would have stopped this kind of shooting,” says Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, of the Vegas massacre. In one sense, history supports that argument. In 2004, Bill Clinton’s ban on semiautomatic rifles, known as assault weapons, expired. But rather than spiking back up, the rate of gun homicides continued to drop. From 1993 to 2014, that rate declined from seven firearm-related homicides per 100,000 Americans to half that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gun-rights advocates used that as an example of gun-control laws not working. In truth, Clinton’s “ban” was so full of loopholes no one believed it had been responsible for much of the decline in firearm-related deaths in the first place. But it is less logic than political fear that has thwarted the passage of even modest gun-control measures. As the NRA and like-minded groups have become expert at harnessing a relatively small group of uncompromising gun-rights advocates, politicians fear being targeted in their next election. The combination of money and motivation has been powerful. So fierce was the NRA’s opposition to Hillary Clinton last year that 1 in 8 ads on the air in Ohio was on guns; that ratio was 1 in 9 in North Carolina. Trump won both states. “The source of the NRA’s power is not simply money,” says Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America. “The NRA’s power comes from the ability to swing voters in tight, close elections. There are a lot of single-issue, pro-gun voters out there that listen to the NRA’s recommendation.” And, in the space of gun-rights groups, the NRA is considered one of the more moderate voices. That power opened the door to expand gun rights on the state level. After 2004, while advocates for limits on guns attempted to fight their way back on a federal assault-weapons bans, gun-rights groups were pushing to unravel restrictions elsewhere. At the state level, concealed-carry laws were loosened or abolished at a rapid clip. Many states started accepting the gun-license standards of their counterparts, often regardless of whether they were more lax than their own. In Nevada, 38% of adults own guns, private gun sales are legal, and there are no state regulations limiting magazine capacity. Even on the federal level, where there appeared to be a political stalemate, gun-rights advocates found ways to make progress on the margins. In 2010, a gun-parts manufacturer asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for permission to market a “bump stock” that when fitted to a semiautomatic weapon would allow the single-fire device to unleash a constant barrage of bullets. While the sale and ownership of machine guns have been strictly controlled since the 1930s and such weapons are very rare among civilians, the company argued their device would benefit handicapped gun enthusiasts, and the ATF assented. Right up until Vegas, gun-rights advocates were trying to advance laws loosening gun restrictions through the Republican-led Congress. Buried in the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, which was intended to enhance recreation opportunities on federal land, were provisions allowing the purchase and use of “suppressors,” similar to silencers used by the military and the restraints on the regulation of armor piercing bullets. The Horror in Las Vegas seemed to change nothing at the Capitol. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, promoted the virtues of mental-health care when he met with reporters Oct. 3. To his left stood Steve Scalise, a member of Ryan’s leadership team, who was back on the job for the first time in months after a disgruntled shooter ambushed congressional Republicans on a softball field in May. In an interview days earlier, Scalise had told 60 Minutes that the attack on him did not diminish his belief in the Second Amendment and credited his security detail with saving his life. “If it’s not a gun, it’ll be a hand grenade, or it will be a knife or an ax,” he said. Later, on Oct. 3, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell dodged queries about guns and ended his weekly Q&A with reporters at the Capitol after just three questions. “It’s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any,” McConnell said. In many corners a sense of hopelessness settled over the post-Vegas debate. “If Sandy Hook didn’t result in legislation that either eliminated or restricted the type of guns that can be sold, or the people to whom they can be sold, nothing will ever change,” says Patrick Dunphy, an attorney who has sued a gun shop. “When you have someone slaughtering kids in a grade school, if that isn’t enough, what is?” But it’s foolish to say nothing could have diminished the scale of the Vegas massacre. The evening of Oct. 3, law-enforcement officials said that 12 of the 23 weapons in Paddock’s suite were equipped with bump stocks of the kind that had first received government permission for manufacture in 2010. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who has raised the alarm about bump stocks for years, said she planned to revive her ban on such accessories. “This is the least we should do,” the California Democrat said. Her bill, introduced the next day, immediately drew widespread support among Democrats. Republicans kept a skeptical distance, at least at first. Meanwhile, other Democrats are shooting for symbolic victories. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is pushing for a Select Committee on Gun Violence, a move that may leave Republicans red-faced when they oppose it. Others are considering how to wrangle Republicans to join previous attempts to finally fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs to figure out just how much of a public-health risk guns pose. And those lobbying for tighter controls on guns say they’d rather focus on the big, stalled fights than the ones that might make a difference on the margins. “The instances of gun violence in this country using fully automatic weapons or weapons approximating fully automatic fire are a small minority of the gun violence,” says Billy Rosen, deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety. Some are hoping for help from an unlikely quarter: President Trump. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer tried to find some daylight between Trump and the NRA, which spent a record $30 million on his campaign against Hillary Clinton. “Before he was a candidate and marched in lockstep with the NRA,” Schumer said, “Donald Trump expressed very a reasonable position on gun control.” In a way, Trump does remain the biggest unknown. He became the first President to address the NRA’s convention in 34 years, in April, but in 2000 he wrote, “I support the ban on assault weapons, and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” And the President does pride himself on being a dealmaker. West Wing aides worried that a single segment on cable television, or a moment in Trump’s visit to Las Vegas on Oct. 4, might provoke an impulsive statement with the power to reshape the gun-rights debate in America. But the president stayed on message when asked about gun control as he visited survivors at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. “We’re not going to talk about that today,” he said. Former White House strategist Stephen Bannon tried to quash talk of such an unlikely deal telling Axios that the blowback for any Trump surprise on gun control would destroy the President’s governing coalition. Bannon is probably right that Trump won’t flip, because the cornerstone of this debate, after all, isn’t really about guns. It’s about something much more important to Trump’s base: government power vs. individual rights. Many of the most fervent gun-rights advocates are also furious that the Government–Big G–makes them buy health coverage or pay a fine or pay taxes that underwrite large federal programs. To many of those voters, unfettered access to guns is a gesture of protest that mirrors the nation’s anxiety about the next century–one where many Americans may think of their firearms as a defense against change. But that’s not what Stephen Paddock was about, at least as far as anyone has been able to determine so far. Wealthy and white, he was an accountant and real estate investor with no apparent criminal record and no history of mental illness, according to his family. He lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nev., about 90 miles northeast of Las Vegas, so fresh that it appears to have been built yesterday. The manicured golf course at Sun City Mesquite is an oasis of green in the surrounding desert. The parking lot by the rec center is filled with Jeeps and Kias. Neighbors say Paddock–who lived with his girlfriend, a high-limit casino hostess who hailed from the Philippines but had Australian citizenship–mostly kept to himself. According to his younger brother Eric, Paddock liked cruises and Mexican food and taking trips to Vegas to play high-stakes video poker. He mailed cookies to his elderly mother in Florida. What we do know is that Paddock planned his mass murder meticulously. All of Paddock’s 47 guns–recovered by law-enforcement officials from his hotel suite, his home in Mesquite and another in Reno–appear to have been legally purchased across four states. After arriving at the Mandalay Bay on Sept. 28, he set about building his bunker. Over the course of three days, he ferried 23 guns, two tripods and hundreds of rounds of ammunition up to his room, one or two bags at a time. Below, in his car, he had bags of ammonium nitrate, which can be used to make a powerful explosive. As a high roller, he may have had his pick of the unclaimed rooms, free of charge. The elevators to his car bypassed the lobby. No one bothered him until his massacre was in progress. He knew they were coming; he had rigged video cameras in the hallway to give him a warning when police approached. As law enforcement closed in, he put a handgun in his mouth and pulled a trigger for the last time. The ease with which Paddock evaded security is a reminder of both how hard it is to stop a determined killer who hasn’t set off alarms in advance. Casinos have cameras everywhere, and officials are now reviewing hours of surveillance footage to see how he spent his weekend in a city best known for bachelorette parties, professional conferences and boys’ weekends away. And it wasn’t just the city’s wide-open attitude that may have made it an inviting target. The glitzy boulevard is a symbol of our culture of decadence: there’s a reason that the Islamic State released a 44-minute propaganda video in May calling for supporters to conduct attacks there. But it is also now a place that exemplifies an American attribute, limited not just to Nevada: resigned resilience. At 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 3, less than 36 hours after the worst mass shooting in modern history began upstairs, guests at the Mandalay Bay were back on the casino floor. The slot machines were humming. Two poker tables were in full swing. Racing fans filled the sports book. It was hard to tell whether the reaction came from strength or acquiescence. But there it was: another roll of the dice, another pull of the lever. –With reporting by SEAN GREGORY/NEW YORK; and TESSA BERENSON, NASH JENKINS, ZEKE J.

July 18, 2017 In this rural outpost, a pair of statues collectively called “Reconciliation” celebrate two natives and their heritage, Jewish financier and presidential adviser Bernard Baruch and African-American baseball legend Larry Doby. The town library features a bronze figurine of an African-American boy reading a Langston Hughes poem. And the police chief tells his officers they should acknowledge, in everyday conversations with black residents, policing’s legacy of racism — and find ways to apologize. And yet even here in Camden, a town of 7,000 with a history of acceptance and openness, African-American resident Jacqueline Greene-Stuckey recalls a small white child pointing at her in the grocery store and asking, “Mommy, mommy is that the (n-word)?” The South’s stubborn, persistent history of racial prejudice is usually not so brazenly on display. But the 2015 Charleston shooting, in which a white supremacist killed nine congregants at an African-American church, has created an opening for addressing its racial legacy head-on, says civil rights and political organizer Bud Ferillo. In the wake of the mass shooting, he helped set up the South Carolina Collaborative for Race and Reconciliation at the University of South Carolina (USC), an initiative designed to encourage communities to address racism by building stronger alliances and friendships across racial lines. Camden, given its history, will be among the first communities in South Carolina to participate in the program, which debuts this fall. “[South Carolina] is the home of American slavery. It was the major port of entry for 40 percent of slaves into the United States, nullification, states’ rights, secession, the act of secession, the start of the Civil War,” Mr. Ferillo says. “Now, in South Carolina, there’s a crack in the door, because of an interest on the part of community leaders to address this racial alienation that has persisted for so long. African Americans have been waiting for 350 years to have this conversation.” Alfred Mae Drakeford, who recently became Camden’s first African-American mayor with a 24-vote win in November, recruited the black participants for the initiative; her predecessor, Tony Scully, recruited the white half of the group. The initiative is focused around “welcome tables” that have even numbers of white and black participants who engage in exercises that build trust and foster deep, substantive dialogue. Camden’s welcome table will have 24 participants, guided by two facilitators. Mayor Drakeford and two others, Ms. Greene-Stuckey and Connie Rouse, say in an interview in Drakeford’s small City Hall office that they are eager for the conversations to begin. There are specific issues they would like to address, such as how black children are treated in schools and ensuring African-Americans have a shot at civic leadership posts. But they also said they believe that a conversation on race is vital on its own. While many, white and black, remain happily segregated in their view, the three said opportunities to address challenges when they arise as a unified community are sometimes lacking as African Americans are underrepresented on town boards and other leadership positions. Camden is about 35 percent black. “In Camden, there’s no hatred, there’s not anger, there isn’t protest, but there is clearly two communities,” says Ms. Rouse, a writer and activist. Drakeford says that as the only black member of the City Council for years, she didn’t want to be seen as the African-American community’s de facto voice. But that is often what happened. “If I didn’t put it on the table, it wasn’t discussed,” Drakeford says. Greene-Stuckey chimes in: “A lot of the time we say we’ve done it [transcended racial problems], and that’s the biggest lie I’ve ever heard.” The three start talking about Drakeford’s historic election. The only black member of the City Council for years, she ran against a fellow councilwoman, and while former Mayor Scully didn’t endorse anyone formally in the election, many knew he had said that when he stepped down he would back the other candidate. Scully wrote a column in a local publication that said both were good choices and had the character and experience to be mayor. He also wrote: “As I see it, the core question remains, which candidate do you want to serve as the voice and the face of Camden?” With the race behind her, Drakeford is reluctant to talk about the incident, but gives a knowing smile. Her friend Ms. Greene-Stuckey chimes in, “We know exactly what he was saying,” she said, drawing attention to the “face” comment. Tellingly, Drakeford has never discussed the issue with Scully, even though she considers him a friend. Scully, who is in his 70s and had moved to Camden from Los Angeles in 2005, says he has thought deeply about racial issues throughout his career in theater and when he was mayor of Camden. When USC and Ferillo approached him about the race and reconciliation initiative, he made sure that the town embraced the effort. At first, in response to a reporter’s questions about his letter, he expresses exasperation at the thought that his words could have been called racist. “I don’t have to participate in fighting and I’m just not going to do it if that’s what this [reconciliation initiative] is going to be. I just can’t,” he says. But then he adds, “That’s maybe why we need the welcome table if she perceives that as race.” This small example of how race is a factor in the eyes of some and not others is common in small communities, says Susan Glisson, who has guided USC’s program and also helped start the Mississippi initiative it is modeled after. That model, developed by the University of Mississippi’s William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation, sprung out of former President Bill Clinton’s Initiative on Race talks in the late ’90s. In 2004, the institute’s efforts helped pressure authorities to bring charges and convict Edgar Ray Killen, a notorious Ku Klux Klan murderer. Since then, some victories have been high-profile, like the University of Mississippi’s public efforts to reconcile its racial history – part of a nationwide trend of universities confronting their past association with slavery. Others have been quiet, such as groups building trust to speak to each other across racial lines. “You have to change hearts and minds … in small groups. It’s tedious, long term work,” says Ms. Glisson, who now runs a consulting firm called Sustainable Equity that provides the community-based model for racial reconciliation. Glisson uses civil rights-era community organizing principles and methods, among others, to foster substantial dialogue among the groups she works with. She has found over the years that establishing from the very beginning that shame isn’t productive helps lead groups to get to know one another and want to tackle problems. “We say at the very outset that this not blaming or shaming anybody,” Glisson said. “Nobody alive today invented racism.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

Clubgoers screamed and scrambled for cover as dozens of gunshots rang out during a rap concert, leaving more than two dozen people injured in a shooting that police said may be gang-related. (Mitchell Pe Masilun/The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP)  Ricky Hampton, 25, of Memphis, Tenn., also known as Finese 2Tymes, was arrested on outstanding charges of aggravated assault with a gun out of Forrest City in eastern Arkansas, the U.S. Marshals Service said. A second man also was taken into custody, and two handguns and an assault rifle were seized from the Mercedes in which the two men were riding, said Cliff LaBarge with the U.S. Marshals Service in Alabama. The firearms will be sent to a crime lab in Arkansas to determine whether they match shell casings found at the scene of the shooting early Saturday at the Power Ultra Lounge, said Little Rock Police Lt. Steven McClanahan. McClanahan described Hampton as a “person of interest” and said the rapper will be extradited to Arkansas so that police can interview him. McClanahan said no arrests have been made in the shooting in which 25 people between the ages of 16 and 35 suffered gunshot wounds, and three others were hurt afterward. He said police did not recover any weapons at the scene of the shooting, which authorities believe may have been gang-related. “We are definitely looking at that possibility,” McClanahan said. “We know that gang members were present inside.” Prison records from the Tennessee Department of Corrections show a Ricky Hampton with the same date of birth, home town and a similar appearance was released from prison in August 2016 after serving six years for two counts of aggravated robbery. Material advertising the concert by Finese 2Tymes showed a man pointing a gun at a camera, drawing a rebuke from Mayor Mark Stodola. Hampton was being held Sunday without bond in Alabama. A message posted on the rapper’s Facebook page Saturday offered thoughts and prayers for those injured: “THE VIOLENCE IS NOT FOR THE CLUB PEOPLE. WE ALL COME WITH 1 MOTIVE AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND THATS TO HAVE FUN.” A woman who answered a phone number listed on Finese 2Tymes’ Instagram account for booking said the rapper didn’t consider canceling the Birmingham show, despite the shooting, because he wasn’t responsible for what happened. The woman didn’t give her name before hanging up.
The volley of gunfire inside the Power Ultra Lounge came so fast that investigators believe multiple people had to have been involved. Police Chief Kenton Buckner credited quick work by first responders for there being no fatalities. City officials said they would move Monday to shut down the club under a “criminal abatement” program. State regulators suspended the club’s liquor license Saturday, and a representative for the landlord’s office later posted an eviction notice on a door to the club. The notice stated that the club must move out of the property within three days “due to your failure to maintain the premises in a safe condition.” About 30 people attended a news conference Sunday with Arkansas Stop the Violence, which is seeking more resources to fight poverty and crime in the southern half of the city. The event was held in front of a police station near where a boy was shot in a drive-by last week. Get the latest news delivered daily!

74,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-man-killed-in-brighton-park-rifle-shooting-who-was-he-here-with-20170715-story.html,"David Marin tried to escape the city's violence. He had moved to Colorado. But after coming back to the Chicago area for a family event, he moved with a relative to Joliet and got a new job, according to a relative who asked to only be identified as Nena. On Friday, he had traveled to the city to get a haircut. At some point during the trip, Marin, 26, ended up in the 4600 block of South Washtenaw Street in the Brighton Park neighborhood on the city's Southwest Side. About 10:20 p.m., someone inside a silver SUV opened fire, striking Marin multiple times. He was pronounced dead two minutes later at the scene, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Multiple rifle casings were found at the scene, according to a law enforcement source. It marked the latest shooting where police believe a rifle was used on the city's Southwest Side. Family members and nearby residents gathered along 47th Street, watching as detectives and officers worked the scene of the shooting. A small boy slept on his mother's shoulder outside of the crime scene. Another small boy carried a sippy cup and a phone. Relatives gave each other hugs as they arrived to the scene and tried to piece together what happened. ""Who was he here with?"" a woman shouted. Three other women walked up to the police tape to speak to an officer. ""Dave's still on scene,"" the officer told the teary-eyed women. Nena said Marin had a young son. Though the medical examiner's office listed Marin as living in the 7300 block of South Francisco Avenue, Nena said he had been recently been living in Joliet. She described him as someone who was close to his family and always wanted to make someone laugh. ""He'll be missed,"" Nena said. ""We'll miss his smile and his goofiness."" Less than half a mile away from Friday's shooting, two people were killed and eight others were wounded in May during a mass shooting that involved a rifle near 46th Place and Rockwell Street. In February, the Tribune reported that gangs in Back of the Yards and Brighton Park were increasingly using rifles. At the time, there were more than 30 shootings believed to have been tied to semi-automatic rifles in the two neighborhoods over the previous nine months. At least 46 people were shot in those attacks, 13 fatally. Police suspected the rifles were being passed around by members of four rival Hispanic gangs in the area — La Raza, the Almighty Saints, Satan Disicples and Gangster Two-Six. Since February, several more people have been shot by rifles in that area. Among them were two Chicago police officers shot and wounded in early May at 43rd Street and Ashland Avenue in Back of the Yards. A woman, who did not want to be identified, stopped by the crime scene after coming home from dinner. She feared a child could have been shot, because she often sees children playing in the area that was the focus of the police investigation. In the 25 years that she's lived in the neighborhood, she has seen violence fluctuate. Not too long ago, she attended community meetings to address the aftermath of the mass shooting at 46th Place and Rockwell. She recalled how eerie the neighborhood felt. ""I don't know if it's ever been this bad,"" she said. She tries to keep her children busy with activities such as a summer program her teenage son is attending at Harvard University. ""Because they don't need to be in the neighborhood,"" she said. Nena said Marin's family lived in the area, but many had moved out because of the violence. ""We all grew up in this area, but we left because of the crime,"" she said. ""Everyone's friends die around here."" Chicago Tribune's Peter Nickeas contributed.

She took slow, stiff steps past the paratransit minivan she was driving for work on the South Side that morning. It was parked at a Citgo gas station in the Marynook neighborhood. A 50-year-old man was fatally shot inside the van early Tuesday when someone tried robbing him of his cellphone, police said. The man was standing in the 8300 block of South Stony Island Avenue and talking with the driver, who was sitting in the parked van just after 3:15 a.m. when a gunman came up and forced the man inside the van. The gunman fired shots, striking the 50-year-old man in the right arm, the chest and back, police said. He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in critical condition and later pronounced dead. He was one of three people killed and eight wounded in shootings across the city between Monday and Tuesday mornings. Officials had not identified the victim Tuesday morning. A spokeswoman for Pace, Maggie Daly Skogsbakken, said the victim was not a passenger and there were no passengers on board. She also said Pace's contractor employee, the driver, was not hurt. ""We are deeply saddened by the shooting that occurred early this morning. At this time, we are focusing our efforts on supporting those involved and assisting law enforcement's investigation in any way we can,"" Skogsbakken wrote in a statement for Pace. Roy Gill, who said he is married to the Pace driver, said an early morning phone call from his wife woke him, and he rushed to the gas station to see her, only to have to wait at the edge of the yellow crime scene tape. ""She's shaken up,"" said Gill, 47, a truck driver. ""She just told me to come."" His wife, 41, had worked for Pace years earlier and stopped, but about two years ago she resumed driving for the company. She gave rides to disabled and elderly people on federal aid across the city and the suburbs, he said. She usually started work between 2:15 a.m. and 3:45 a.m. A Pace dispatcher would send her to pre-ordered rides, he said. He advised her against stopping off the road overnight. As he was making phone calls and pacing the sidewalk, Gill said he was thinking of a different time he was on the same side of a crime scene. ""We just lost two boys,"" he said. His sons James, 18, and Roy, 21, were killed on Christmas night in a mass shooting as his large family was celebrating on a crowded porch in the East Chatham neighborhood. The Gill brothers were shot about 9:20 p.m. in the 8600 block of South Maryland Avenue after an evening of shooting dice with cousins outside. Five other people were wounded in the shooting, most of them relatives of the Gill brothers, family said at the time. On Tuesday, Roy Gill again waited behind crime scene tape, after another confrontation with the city's gun violence. Before they drove away, a Pace official in a neon yellow vest hugged Gill.

As the deputy press secretary went off on CNN and the media for what she called a “constant barrage of fake news directed at this president,” Karem interrupted her for a little light reading of the riot act. “Come on!” Karem fumed. “You’re inflaming everybody, right here, right now with those words.

On Friday, Jerrod Carmichael announced that he’s leaving NBC’s “The Carmichael Show.” And with that announcement, “The Carmichael Show” was history. If you’re wondering what’s going on, Carmichael released a statement through his publicist. “For three seasons (okay 2.5), I got to make a show that I love with my friends,” he said. “It’s something I’ve wanted to do since I was 13. Now, I’m excited to go make other things that I love. Thank you to every person who worked on or watched The Carmichael Show.“ Just like last May, we heard renewal negotiation between NBC and 20th TV had been difficult, with the two sides far apart and talks going slowly. With no clear indications from the network one way or the other, I hear 20th TV quietly sent out feelers to other networks to gauge potential interest in case NBC opted to cancel the show. Things between NBC and “The Carmichael Show” have never smooth, it seems. There’s always been friction as far as the parties were concerned. In fact renewal negotiations between NBC and 20th TV had been difficult, with the two sides far apart and talks going slowly. “The Carmichael Show was such a wonderful show that we choose to focus today not on its loss but on the three incredible seasons we had the pleasure to produce,” said 20th Century Fox TV Presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman today in a statement. “We are thankful to the brilliant Jerrod Carmichael and his talented cast, and to showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzell, our fantastic writers and devoted production team. It’s a rarity that a comedy series tackles the social and political issues of the day in such a clever and hilariously funny way. This show was special, and we will miss it.” ALSO RECOMMENDED: CRENSHAW CHRISTIAN CENTER MEMBERS REACT TO ‘BETRAYAL OF GOD’ BY FORMER PASTOR FRED PRICE JR. (WATCH) The Carmichael Show cast Deadline made this observation: Season 3 of The Carmichael Show — a rare critically praised multi-camera sitcom — was produced for this midseason but was held until May 31. There had been concerns the delay would chip away at the show’s timeliness, which had been part of its DNA as the show had regularly taken on hot-button subjects like police violence. But Season 3 has proven very timely — two weeks ago NBC postponed at the last minute an episode that deals with a mass shooting as it fell on a day of two real-life mass shootings in the U.S. — including the one at a congressional GOP baseball practice. The network’s decision was publicly criticized by Carmichael who called it “criminal.” That episode aired last night. It was just last week, that “The Carmichael Show” took on the N-word and whether white people can say it on the heels of the controversy surrounding comedian Bill Maher’s use of the word on his HBO show. Ratings-wise, The Carmichael Show has been relatively stable. Airing on Wednesdays behind Little Big Shots and its offshoot Little Big Shots: Forever Young, the comedy’s adults 18-49 ratings have stayed within the 0.7-0.9 in Live+Same Day. Lil Rel Howery, a “Carmichael Show” cast member, posted a statement about the show ending. The #CarmichaelShow is ending after this season. We’re super sad to see this series end ?

Local police said 25 were shot during the incident, while three others sustained related injuries. Little Rock Chief of Police Kenton Buckner said that victims who did not sustain gunshot injuries were trampled on as concert goers raced to exit the venue. Others were hurt after jumping out of a window to escape the commotion. The Little Rock Police Department listed one victim as critically injured, but later confirmed that said victim is now in stable condition. The other injuries didn't appear life-threatening and authorities are hopeful that all the victims will make a full recovery, ABC News reported. Wounded victims are now being treated in hospitals near the area. Victims range from 16 years old to mid-20s. According to the police a dispute broke out during a concert at Power Ultra Lounge and an exchange of gunfire took place at around 2:30 a.m. CT. At the crime scene, windows on the club's second story were shattered and empty drink cups were scattered across the ground. Although there was no immediate information on the shooters, the police already ruled out terrorism. The police said the following on its Twitter account.""We do NOT believe this incident was an active shooter or terror related incident. It appears to have been a dispute at a concert""Buckner nevertheless said that the shooting is ""very alarming and certainly disturbing."" He added that there are ""probably multiple shooting suspects,"" Time wrote. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be assisting the Little Rock police in investigating the shooting, officials said. A video posted online from the event showed the club packed with people as rapper Finese 2Tymes performed. Gunfire started to go out a half-minute into the concert break. More than 24 shots were fired within an 11-second timeframe. Courtney Swanigan said she and her sister were near the front of the club when the shooting erupted. She claimed she saw someone on stage holding a handgun during the chaos. ""I just closed my eyes, got down on the ground and put my hands on my head,"" Swanigan recalled. The club's Facebook page has a poster of Finese 2Tymes's Friday night concert, showing what appears to be a man pointing a gun at the camera.#BREAKING: Video shows moments leading up to at least 17 people being shot at nightclub in downtown Little Rock (Courtesy: Darryl Rankin). pic.twitter.com/aBgYfF4FNu— Mitchell McCoy (@MitchellMcCoy) July 1, 2017Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials suspended Power Ultra Lounge's alcohol license hours after the shootings occurred.

80,http://elitedaily.com/news/25-people-shot-little-rock-arkansas-club-heres-know/2008691/," America was rocked by another mass shooting on Saturday, July 1, when more than two dozen people were shot at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas. UPDATE: Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said in a press conference on Saturday afternoon that police were still investigating the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge, and that he believed the public was not in any danger. He confirmed that Power Ultra Lounge's liquor license had been suspendedÂ and that the clubÂ was being evicted. Buckner said that the 28 injured appeared to all be African American, ranging between 16 and 35 years of age, and two remained in critical condition. Buckner addedÂ that off-duty police officers who had been working as security at the venue had stopped at least one attendee from entering the club with a weapon, but that it was believed that others carrying weapons had been able to enter. Police are stillÂ uncertain as to how many shooters there were. EARLIER: Police said that 25 people had been shot and three more hadÂ unrelated injuries in a dispute among clubgoers attending a performance at Power Ultra Lounge in downtown Little Rock, the Associated Press reported on Saturday. All are expected to survive. Police said that they believed that multiple people fired weapons, but the shooting is not believed to be terrorism-related. In the video, captioned â2timesâ with a sunglasses emoji and posted around 4 a.m. on Saturday, clubgoers are seen singing along with performer Finese 2Tymes, before a short pause in the music. A few seconds later, shots ring out in several bursts. The video goes dark for a time, and finishes with the filmer apparently checking himself for wounds. Darryl Rankin, who posted the video, told the AP that one of his friends was among the wounded, with a bullet in his spine. Musician Finese 2Tymes shared his condolences in an all-caps Facebook post. âPRAYERS GO TO THE INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THERE FAMILY THAT CAME OUT TO SUPPORT ME, LAST NIGHT IN LITTLE ROCK ARK. THE VIOLENCE IS NOT FOR THE CLUB PEOPLE,â he wrote. On Twitter, some were calling attention to the lack of comment from President Trump, particularly in light of his social media activity earlier the same day. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson issued a statement via Twitter, expressing his condolences to the victims and addressing crime in Little Rock. A police press conference about the shooting is scheduled for 3 p.m., and this story will be updated with any additional information.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, says a Times editorial earlier this month ""falsely stated as a matter of fact"" that Palin had incited the attack, in which a gunman shot 19 people, killing six of them. The Times published the editorial on June 14, shortly after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a baseball field in Alexandria, injuring Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and several others. Drawing a parallel to the Arizona shooting, the newspaper's editorial board wrote that both attacks fit a ""sickeningly familiar pattern"" and that the ""link to political incitement was clear."" ""Before the shooting,"" it read, ""Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral district that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."" The description was inaccurate. The map had put cross hairs over targeted electoral districts but not Democratic politicians. Following a wave of backlash on social media, the Times issued an apology and corrected the editorial, saying no connection between political incitement and the Arizona shooting was ever established. The Washington Post's Fact Checker found that the Times had relied on a thoroughly debunked talking point in its description of the map and noted that the Arizona gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, had no clear political views. A Times spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday: ""We have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously."" Palin's lawsuit alleges the Times ""violated the law and its own policies"" in the editorial and criticizes the newspaper for not mentioning Palin by name in its correction. ""Given that the entire premise of the Palin Article was the 'disturbing pattern' of politically incited violence emanating from a non-existent link between Mrs. Palin and Loughner's 2011 crime, which The Times conceded did not exist, the entire Palin Article should have been retracted - not minimally and inadequately corrected - and The Times should have apologized to Mrs. Palin,"" the complaint reads. Palin's lawyers allege the Times knew when it published the editorial that there was no link between Palin's political activities and the mass shooting in Arizona. The complaint lists a series of Times articles indicating that Loughner's attack was not politically motivated, including a January 2011 commentary in which columnist Charles M. Blow argued there was ""no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting."" The Times reported regularly on Loughner's criminal case, which did not turn up any evidence that his actions were politically motivated, the complaint says. There was also nothing to suggest he saw a map of the targeted districts that the editorial mentioned, it says. The lawsuit also says the Times's statements linking Palin to Loughner's crimes ""stood in stark contrast"" to how it covered the motives of James Hodgkinson, the gunman who fired on the lawmakers in Alexandria before being fatally shot by police. ""The Times concluded that there was not a connection between Hodgkinson and his professed penchant for Democratic stances sufficient to warrant implicating Democrats or the Bernie Sanders campaign as inciting factors for Hodgkinson's attack,"" the complaint reads. Palin has drifted out of the limelight since her unsuccessful bid for the White House with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and parted ways with Fox News, where she was a political commentator, in 2015. But she still commands a massive following on social media, particularly among conservatives, and continues to advocate for right-wing causes. As a public figure, she will have to prove among other things that the Times knowingly published false information about her to prevail in her lawsuit.

83,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/29/review-brownsville-in-berkeley-reloads-a-life-cut-short-by-gun-violence/,"Trending: We the people are inured to gun violence. Death by gunshot is so common in this country that it’s rarely considered newsworthy unless it’s a mass shooting. Even after the most horrific massacres, the immediate political response is to resolve to do nothing whatsoever to make it any harder for such a tragedy to happen again. And again. And again. Every shooting victim has a story, and to know that story is to feel compassion that we as a nation seem ill-equipped to consider. Again and again, people with a vested interest in keeping guns on the streets speak ill of the dead, try to dig up dirt to make it seem like that person had it coming. They want desperately to believe that some people deserve to die, because we as a nation are in the killing business, and business is booming. The latest show at Berkeley’s Shotgun Players, Kimber Lee’s “brownsville song (b-side for tray),” is all about bringing to life a promising and compassionate young man who was reduced to a statistic when he was shot dead in a snap decision by some touchy kid who might not have even thrown a punch if he hadn’t had easy access to guns. Lee’s play was developed at the 2013 Bay Area Playwrights Festival before premiering at the Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of Louisville in 2014. Shotgun’s last show, David Greig’s play “The Events,” was about a survivor of a mass shooting struggling to understand what happened and why. Lee’s play deals with some similar themes, as Tray’s grandmother grapples with her grief and tries to find out why he was shot, but the incident itself is discussed only briefly. Mostly the play is about Tray himself, played with open-hearted playfulness and occasional prickliness by Davied Morales, and the weight of his absence. We begin with his grandmother Lena (Cathleen Riddley, formidable in her fury) forcefully insisting in a brutally eloquent monologue that we do not start the story with her despair as just another grieving loved one. It should be his story, not hers. We follow Tray’s frustration trying to compose a personal essay for his college scholarship application. We witness the tenderness with which he looks after his little sister, Devine (11-year-old Mimia Ousilas, bright and withdrawn), who comes out of her shell whenever he’s around. We see his easy friendship with Junior (William Hartfield, amiably raucous), who’s always hanging around on the street and possibly getting into trouble. Most tellingly, we see how forgiving and generous he is with someone who let his family down terribly in the past but is trying to do better now (shamefaced and anxiously fidgety Erin Mei-Ling Stuart). The play moves freely between the time shortly before and shortly after Tray’s death. With Tray frequently strolling onstage mere moments after his absence has been keenly felt, the back-and-forth between past and present is so fluid that at times you might wonder whether the story is actually wandering in and out of an alternate reality in which Tray never died. That cognitive dissonance is amplified by Devine continuing to talk about Tray as if he’s still there. One of the most heartbreaking moments in the show simply consists of her setting a place for her brother at the table as if he’s still coming home. Director Margo Hall drives home the senseless tragedy of Tray’s death powerfully in her staging. Lighting designer Allen Wilner punctuates scene changes with searchlights scanning the stage as a grim reminder that this place — this neighborhood, this country — is a crime scene. From time to time the thumping bass of a slowly passing car haunts Joel Gimbell II’s sound design, suggesting that at any moment somebody else’s story could come to a sudden halt. Even if it doesn’t happen right here and now, we know it’ll happen again all too soon. Contact Sam Hurwitt at shurwitt@gmail.com, and follow him at Twitter.com/shurwitt.

The officer filed a suit in U.S. District Court claiming that Black Lives Matter leaders --- including DeRay Mckesson --- were responsible for the mass shooting that left the officer injured. As Reuters reported, the officer is seeking at least $75,000 in damages. Three police officers were killed in a 2016 attack in Baton Rouge when a former U.S. Marine sergeant named Gavin Long opened fire on police. Baton Rouge had been the center of protests for weeks after police officers killed a black man named Alton Sterling under murky circumstances, Reuters noted. Just 10 days before the attack in Baton Rouge, five police officers were killed in Dallas by a man angered at what he saw as nationwide racial bias by police. The police officer filing the suit against Black Lives Matter was not named, but the lawsuit claims the officer was shot by ""a person violently protesting against police, and which violence was caused or contributed to by the leaders of and by 'BLACK LIVES MATTER.'"" Though Black Lives Matter is a largely decentralized movement with local branches that operate independently, DeRay Mckesson is seen by many as the ideological leader. Mckesson, who is named in the lawsuit filed by the Baton Rouge police officer, has said in the past that his position as a leader of the often controversial movement is used to being a target.Baton Rouge police officer injured in deadly ambush sues Black Lives Matter https://t.co/SekSECSu6L pic.twitter.com/cbk151sz7Z— CBS News (@CBSNews) July 8, 2017In a 2016 interview with Uproxx, Mckesson said he has received many death threats for his activism, but has been determined to keep the movement going forward and always seeking justice.

89,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/offtopic/~3/6oBqXnrDXiw/ct-little-rock-nightclub-shooting-20170701-story.html,"LITLLE ROCK, ARK. — Clubgoers screamed and scrambled for cover as dozens of gunshots rang out during a rap concert in downtown Little Rock early Saturday, leaving 28 people injured from an 11-second melee that police said may be gang-related. The volley of gunfire inside the Power Ultra Lounge came so fast that investigators believe multiple people had to have been involved. Police Chief Kenton Buckner credited quick work by first responders for there being no fatalities. Twenty-five people between the ages of 16 and 35 suffered gunshot wounds, and three others were hurt, perhaps while fleeing, Buckner said. Two people were in critical condition Saturday afternoon. Police said officers did not have any suspects in custody. Courtney Swanigan, 23, told The Associated Press that when the gunfire rang out, ""I just closed my eyes, got down on the ground and put my hands on my head."" City officials said they would move Monday to shut down the club under a ""criminal abatement"" program. State regulators suspended the club's liquor license earlier Saturday. On Saturday night, a representative for the landlord's office posted an eviction notice on a door to the club. The notice stated that the club must move out of the property within three days ""due to your failure to maintain the premises in a safe condition."" ""We know we've got to use a hammer, we've got to use a big hammer on the people who would do violence with guns and hurt people,"" Stodola said at an afternoon news conference. He said the city must ""keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people"" and suggested that people refuse to patronize clubs that seem to promote violence. Material advertising the concert by Tennessee rapper Finese 2Tymes showed a man pointing a gun at a camera. ""A promotional video with a gun on the front cover inviting people to a concert ... should also be totally unacceptable in our community,"" the mayor said. The shooting capped a violent week in Arkansas' largest city. Police had responded to a dozen drive-by shootings over the previous nine days. ""This does appear to be a continuation of disputes from some of our local groups,"" Buckner said. ""You've seen some of the things playing out in our streets that has resulted in drive-by shootings."" The shooting occurred around 2:30 a.m. about 1 mile east of the state Capitol building. First-responders are stationed through the central part of the city and hospitals are a quick ride away. ""We had professional people responding to that incident and they did what they were trained to do, and I know they probably had something to do with the fact we didn't have any fatalities,"" Buckner said. He also credited divine intervention. About 100 people gathered at Second Baptist Church on Saturday night for a candlelight vigil, seeking healing for those injured, and the community. Stodola sat in the front row. ""God bless our community. ... God bless our first responders,"" Robert Holt, president of Let Our Violence End and pastor at Healing Waters Outreach Center, said at the vigil. Top state officials offered to help the city respond to an increasing number of incidents. ""Little Rock's crime problem appears to be intensifying,"" Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. ""Every few days it seems a high-profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning's event. I have spoken this morning with Mayor (Mark) Stodola and I have offered both my heart felt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community."" A Facebook video posted from inside the club included audio of at least 24 rounds fired in about 11 seconds. Darryl Rankin, who posted the video, said a friend of his who attended the concert with him had a bullet ""stuck in his spine."" Buckner said police had not yet spoken with the rapper, who he said has outstanding warrants in the state. Calls to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes' booking agent weren't returned Saturday, but a message was posted on the artist's Facebook page offering thoughts and prayers for those injured: ""THE VIOLENCE IS NOT FOR THE CLUB PEOPLE. WE ALL COME WITH 1 MOTIVE AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND THATS TO HAVE FUN."" Police cordoned off the area as technicians collected evidence from the scene, which is near a Roman Catholic cathedral and a First United Methodist Church center. A number of worshippers gathered for a funeral at St. Andrew's while police continued their work. Glass from the Power Ultra Lounge's second-story windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. In the parking lot, a silver Toyota had what appeared to be a streak of blood on the front passenger-side door. ""I'm sick of all the killing and I'm tired of all the shooting. The kids getting hurt,"" said Raida Bunche, who was waiting outside the club after hearing from a friend that her son had been inside. She found out later that he had run from the club when the shooting started and was not hurt. Before Stodola announced that the city would shutter the club, officials at the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control office suspended the club's liquor license and set a July 10 hearing on three potential charges: disorderly conduct, allowing possession of weapons on the premises and ""failure to be a good neighbor."" The club's license has been suspended 11 times for failing to pay taxes, and it has been cited seven times for 14 various violations including unknowingly furnishing alcohol to minors and allowing alcohol to leave the premises since 2012, ABC Director of Enforcement Boyce Hamlet said. Arkansas lawmakers this year passed a law allowing concealed handguns in bars, with permission of the businesses' owners and if the gun permit holder completes additional training. The law takes effect Sept. 1, but the training likely won't be available until next year.

90,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/07/01/little-rock-police-several-injured-after-nightclub-shooting/,"Trending: By ANDREW DeMILLO and TAFI MUKUNYADZI LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Police say 25 people were shot after gunfire rang out Saturday at a rap show at a downtown Little Rock nightclub, prompting pleas from top leaders to curb the growing violence in Arkansas’ capital city. Police said the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge was the result of a dispute among clubgoers and not an active shooter or terror-related incident. Little Rock police said Saturday that 25 people were shot and three others suffered unrelated injuries. All were expected to survive, police said. Police early Saturday cordoned off the block as crime-scene technicians gathered evidence from inside and outside the club. Glass from the club’s second story windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters that “some sort of dispute broke out between people inside” the club and that there are “probably multiple shooting suspects.” A video posted online by a club patron, Darryl Rankin, showed a packed house for Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tennessee. About a half-minute into a break in the raucous concert, several bursts of gunfire rang out — more than 24 shots in an 11-second period. Rankin told The Associated Press that he was recording the show on Facebook Live when gunfire erupted and that one of his friends is now at a hospital with a bullet “stuck in his spine.” The shooting follows a week in which there have been about a dozen drive-by shootings in Little Rock, though there’s no indication the events are linked. “Little Rock’s crime problem appears to be intensifying,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “Every few days it seems a high profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning’s event. I have spoken this morning with Mayor Stodola and I have offered both my heart felt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community.” Early Saturday, Raida Bunche waited outside the club after she had heard from a friend that her son had been at the club. Later Saturday morning, she said she found out her son ran out once the shooting began and was unharmed. “I’m sick of all the killing and I’m tired of all the shooting, the kids getting hurt,” Bunche said. The club’s Facebook page promoted Friday night’s show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appears to be a gun at the camera. A call to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes’ booking agent wasn’t immediately returned Saturday. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said on Facebook that more information would be released at a news conference Saturday afternoon. “My heart is broken this morning — my prayers are with the victims of this tragedy,” he wrote. He went on to add, “We are committed to doing everything possible to bring safety to our city. We need everyone to help.” In May, one person was killed and six people were hurt in a mass shooting at a downtown concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Little Rock. In that case, two men were charged with first-degree murder and six counts of first-degree battery. ___  Get the latest news delivered daily!

The claim comes in a new court motion that Samy Mohamed  Hamzeh, 25, should be released on bail pending his trial, now set for February. The motion reveals new details about the defense's claim of entrapment, gleaned from hours of now-translated Arabic conversations the informants recorded. His family says Hamzeh, who was born in the U.S. but lived much of his childhood in Jordan before moving to Milwaukee at age 19, was set up by the FBI. The request for Hamzeh's release says he is a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, a solid work history and a job waiting for him, and a family who supports him. They argue Hamzeh should be released on GPS monitoring and give up his passport. While the news of Hamzeh's arrest in early 2016 carried overtones of terrorism — federal prosecutors said he was planning to kill at least 30 people to ""defend Islam"" — the resulting charges were two counts of possessing a machine gun and one count of possessing a silencer, all of which he bought for $570 from undercover FBI agents. Each count carries up to 10 years in prison. Hamzeh's attorneys, federal public defenders Craig Albee and Joseph Bugni, note that the criminal complaint against their client fails to mention that despite the hours of recorded Arabic conversations with the informants, he ultimately ""rejected their overtures and lectured his informant friends about why such a plan would be wrong."" The new court filings identify the informants only as Steve, who first met with FBI agents in September 2015 and later indicated he ""no longer had papers allowing him to work"" in the U.S, and Mike, ""a seasoned informant,"" introduced to Hamzeh later. The defense expects to learn about the informants' motivations from required government disclosures closer to trial. The attorneys' request for a bail hearing took so long because they had to have ""several hundred hours"" of the recorded talks translated into English and transcribed. Those transcripts, the defense filings say, ""reveal that at trial Hamzeh has a strong case for entrapment."" The motion says the complaint also doesn't describe everything that led up to Hamzeh briefly possessing the machine guns and silencer in January 2016, when he was arrested. The informants, the motion states, ""frequently lobbied Hamzeh to get a machine gun despite his repeated protests that all he wanted was a legal handgun to protect himself."" The alleged plot had an unusual target, the Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic Center, 790 N. Van Buren St. According to the defense motion, discussion of the Masons first came in January 2016. The informants told Hamzeh the Masons were affiliated with the Islamic State and the enemy of Islam, and that three men had watched YouTube videos purportedly showing Masons eating hearts. Hamzeh later told others about how Mike had begun constantly denigrating Masons and first floated the idea of attacking the Milwaukee center. The Scottish Rite group was actually a fraternal organization whose membership had declined from 6,000 in 1985 to about 700 today. The center was mostly rented out for weddings and other events and is now planned for sale and conversion into a hotel. A psychiatrist who evaluated Hamzeh in jail concluded he does not fit a profile of someone who would kill strangers and ""has a strong moral code with a very prominent conscience and empathy."" His attorneys note that by the time Hamzeh's trial would start in February, he will have been in jail 25 months, and that even if convicted, the guideline range sentence for the crimes is 24 to 30 months. The defense characterizes much of the recorded talk as mere bravado by Hamzeh and obvious attempts by Steve and Mike to steer him toward discussion of jihad and machine guns. ""There is also no evidence that Hamzeh ever made any plans or was doing anything other than making empty boasts to express his resentment about Israel or to gain attention,"" reads their brief in support of the bond motion. ""That’s not to say the conversations aren’t unsettling, but there is nothing to show an intent to take the leap from pontificating within the comfort of Milwaukee’s coffee shops about Palestine and the treatment of Muslims to Hamzeh risking his life in Gaza."" A hearing on Hamzeh's request has been set for July 12.",2017-07-03 08:00:00,Man charged in mass shooting plot at Milwaukee Masonic center seeks release,,36,http://www.jsonline.com/
96,https://www.cnet.com/news/taking-trolls-to-court-lawsuit-targets-the-daily-stormer/#ftag=CAD590a51e,"The victim of a troll attack takes on the neo-Nazi who runs ""the top hate site in America."" The result might prompt trolls to think twice before they post. Tanya Gersh has been the target of online harassment since December 2016. Editor's note: In July, CNET News published a special report exploring how hate spreads over the web. The stories in that series examined Internet-fueled intolerance. Our reporters explored, for example, what happens when online hate speech crosses into real life, the ways neo-Nazis use social media and how racists co-opted cartoon character, Pepe the Frog. Some of CNET's female reporters shared their own experiences of being harassed online. The timing of the package --  ""iHate: Intolerance takes over the internet"" -- was uncanny. As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, America slid into a Summer of Hate. People threatened places of worship, defaced cemeteries and intimidated others because of the way they look or dress. And a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, heavily promoted on extremist websites, left three people dead. The web's role in recruiting people to hateful, extremist organizations is back in the spotlight after The New York Times profiled a young neo-Nazi in Ohio. The story portrayed the man's decidedly ordinary life and raised, but didn't answer questions, about how he was  radicalized. Our reporting may provide a few answers, which is why we're republishing some of our stories. WARNING: The themes of the following story are disturbing. The language includes religious, ethnic and gender slurs. CNET has preserved much of the ugly wording in order to present a clear picture of attacks on real people. Tanya Gersh heard gunshots when she picked up her phone. It wasn't the first time. A real estate agent and mother of two, Gersh became the target of a barrage of hate last year for trying to help Sherry Spencer sell a property in Whitefish, Montana, and use part of the proceeds as a donation for a human rights group. That caught the eye of neo-Nazis, who were convinced Gersh was pressuring Spencer to sell. Why were neo-Nazis enraged by a proposed real estate transaction? Because Spencer is the mother of Richard Spencer, a leader of the ""alt-right"" movement of self-identified white nationalists. They believed Gersh was extorting Spencer. The hate directed at Gersh came in all forms. She got angry phone calls, hateful texts, intimidating emails and racist social media posts. People she'd never met urged Gersh to kill herself. A chunk of the filth was even directed at her 12-year-old son via his Twitter and YouTube accounts. Gersh, who is Jewish, also received Christmas cards with messages such as ""Thanks for demonstrating why your race needs to be collectively ovened"" and ""You are surprisingly easy to find on the internet. And in real life."" ""Kike."" ""Whore."" ""Bitch."" Now Gersh is taking on the man who started it all. In a federal lawsuit filed in April, Gersh accuses Andrew Anglin, who publishes the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, of invading her privacy, intentionally inflicting emotional distress and violating Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act by organizing more than 700 instances of harassment since December 2016. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, is representing Gersh. ""It would have been so much easier for us to lay as low as possible and let it all blow over,"" Gersh said in an interview. ""But it wasn't an option for us because of the pain that was caused."" In an email, Anglin, who bills his publication as ""The World's Most Genocidal Republican Website,"" said he was exercising his right to free speech. ""Whether you agree with what I have to say or not, I think all Americans can agree I have a right to say it,"" he wrote. ""We're going to put together the best First Amendment defense we can."" Anglin's attorney, Marc Randazza, sent a prepared blurb in the form of an image that read, ""The wall that protects the First Amendment is not manned with pretty happy smiling thoughts and easy-to-love characters."" Gersh's lawsuit, if successful, could change the environment for hate sites, making it clear to trolls they can be held responsible for the repercussions of what they write, at least in US civil cases. The SPLC has used similar tactics against hate groups since the 1980s, according to its newsletter, the SPLC Report, though many of those cases occurred before widespread adoption of the internet. Criminal cases are often hard to pursue, experts say, in part because law enforcement officials may not understand online harassment the way they understand stalking, for example, or take it as seriously as other kinds of intimidation. The situation is complicated by the fact that no one law enforcement agency goes after cyberharassment in particular. US laws around hate on the internet date back to the earliest chat rooms and bulletin boards. By the '90s, they'd begun to address electronic harassment. But the laws were narrow and generally addressed a method, say harassment over the phone, rather than a broad range of intimidating behavior, says Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland and author of the book ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace."" And they aren't used often, she says. ""We do have a suite of laws. We have been improving them over time, but we need to use them,"" Citron said. ""When we don't use them, harassers just get to say 'f--- you' and walk away."" Federal and state laws have evolved since the era of dial-up internet and they cover crimes ranging from cyberstalking to harassing telephone calls. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense under federal law and roughly half the states have statutes covering cyberstalking and cyberharassment. Prosecutors won nine convictions in 22 cyberstalking cases in 2014, and 11 out of 19 in 2015, according to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (PDF). Last year, the UK rolled out guidelines for prosecutors that detail the intersection of criminal offenses and online communications. The act of inciting a harassment campaign -- what the guidelines call virtual mobbing or dog piling -- falls under the Serious Crime Act 2007. Lawsuits, like Gersh and the SPLC's, are occasionally filed. The first successful cyberstalking case in California dates to 1999, when a man named Gary Dellapenta was sentenced to six years in prison after he posed as his own ex-girlfriend online and invited people to act on fake rape fantasies. He even gave them her address, prompting six men to show up at her door. But it's hard to sue an anonymous troll, and big social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, are protected by the Communications Decency Act. The act protects online services and businesses from being held accountable for what their users say or do on them. Even if you know who to sue, lawsuits take time and cost thousands of dollars. In many cases, plaintiffs probably won't recoup that amount even if they win. In 1998, fair housing advocate Bonnie Jouhari sued Ku Klux Klan leader Roy Frankhouser and, in a separate complaint, Ryan Wilson and neo-Nazi group ALPHA HQ, after she was targeted for helping victims of discrimination take legal action. Jouhari, who is white, was labeled a ""race traitor."" The groups posted her picture and address online, an early example of a tactic now known as ""doxing,"" to encourage others to torment her. Jouhari and her daughter ended up moving across the country to escape the harassment. Click to see more from iHate. Jouhari settled with Frankhouser, who agreed in May 2000 to an apology delivered on ""White Forum,"" a public access show, and 1,000 hours of community service. She was also was awarded $1.1 million in the suit against Wilson. But she never saw a dime because Wilson said he had no money. Legal experts say Jouhari's case isn't unusual. ""You might get the satisfaction of suing someone,"" said New York Law School professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who founded the Institute for CyberSafety. ""But you'll spend thousands out of pocket that you're never going to see back."" David Dinielli, one of the SPLC attorneys representing Gersh, says her case is different. The goal is to send a message to people trafficking in hate online. ""One of our principal points in bringing this lawsuit is to make certain that people know that they can't simply hide behind their keyboards in order to conduct their terrorism,"" Dinielli said. ""We want to send a message to people like Andrew Anglin and others who think they can wreak havoc on people's lives, simply by calling on people to launch a troll storm."" It's unclear how many people read The Daily Stormer, which takes its name from Der Stürmer, a Nazi tabloid. In a July 4 post celebrating the fourth anniversary of its launch, Anglin, the publisher, wrote the site had become internationally recognized, adding ""And last month, we had 4.3 million unique visitors."" ComScore, an analytics firm, says the Stormer had 83,000 unique visitors in May 2017 but that it often falls below the roughly 50,000 unique visitors per month the firm requires to qualify for measurement. What's clear is that the Stormer, which the SPLC calls ""the top hate site in America,"" uses its readers to project hate. Its readers have included Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the man who last year killed Jo Cox, a British member of Parliament. Anglin also spearheads a ""Troll Army"" and has mounted numerous campaigns against people who fall afoul of his views. Targets have included Luciana Berger, a British parliamentarian, and Julia Ioffe, a journalist who wrote about First Lady Melania Trump. Anglin initiated his attack against Gersh on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after Sherry Spencer posted an article to Medium accusing Gersh of bullying her into selling her property. The property had become the focus of Whitefish locals because of negative attention the town was getting as a result of Richard Spencer, who initially owned part of it, according to the lawsuit. Sherry, who lives in Dallas, has said her son no longer has an ownership stake. Anglin encouraged his readers to participate in ""an old fashioned Troll Storm"" and tell Gersh what they thought of her ""Jew agenda."" He published her address, telephone number and Twitter handle, as well as contact information for Judah Gersh, her husband, and Love Lives Here, a local group that promotes diversity. Anglin also included the Twitter handle of Gersh's son, whom he called a ""creepy little faggot."" He encouraged them to visit Judah's office, tell him what they thought of his wife's behavior and ""advise him to get a leash on that hoe."" In a subsequent post, Anglin directed readers to leave Google and Yelp reviews of the law firm where Gersh's husband works, providing links to the pages to make it easier. As in previous troll operations, Anglin cautioned participants against threatening Gersh. ""NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT,"" he wrote. Anglin may believe such disclaimers exculpate him, or clear him of responsibility, the SPLC lawsuit says. Andrew Anglin Six days later, Anglin expanded what he now called a ""MEGA TROLLSTORM,"" asking readers to contact the Gershs' employers and clients. He provided contact information for Tanya's employers, plus phone numbers and emails for the parent company. He also included contact details for groups affiliated with Love Lives Here, as well as those for Judah's clients. It didn't take long for the trolls to gather. The complaint describes a ""tsunami of threats"" that came in voice mails, emails, phone calls and Holocaust imagery. One tweet directed at Gersh's son included a picture of an oven with the message, ""psst kid, theres a free Xbox One inside this oven"". At one point, Anglin announced a march on Whitefish that he initially planned to end at Gersh's house. The march was to be called the ""James Earl Ray Day Extravaganza,"" named after the man who assassinated Martin Luther King, Jr. Anglin ""postponed"" the event because he couldn't get a permit. On April 18, Gersh and the SPLC filed a lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of the state anti-intimidation act. How the case will turn out remains to be seen, in part because SPLC lawyers can't find Anglin. Dinielli, Gersh's lawyer, said his team hasn't been able to serve Anglin and he hasn't stepped forward to receive the complaint. A November 2016 article in HuffPost said Anglin ""appeared"" to be in Berlin, while other reports have placed him in Russia and Ohio. In July, CNN reported that Anglin said he lives in Lagos, Nigeria. As of late October, SPLC lawyers completed another step in trying to serve Anglin, running a notice for six weeks in a Franklin County, Ohio newspaper that called for Anglin to answer the complaint. In November, the defense added Montana-based attorney Mathew Stevenson. ""It's about to get interesting,"" Randazza said via email Monday. Anglin and Stevenson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Gersh's lawsuit isn't the only one Anglin is facing. Sirius XM radio host Dean Obeidallah, who is Muslim, filed a defamation lawsuit in August after a Daily Stormer post said Obeidallah had masterminded the May bombing of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Much like SPLC, Obeidallah's lawyers are also trying to find Anglin and serve him with the lawsuit. ""The purpose of the lawsuit is to seek recovery for the damages he caused with his dangerous lies but also to send a message that minority groups will not be bullied into silence by him and his kind."" Obeidallah said via email. ""We will continue to call out the dangers of white supremacy and do our best to not allow those views to ever be normalized in the United States."" Anglin is named in a third lawsuit stemming from the Stormer's role in promoting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left three people dead in August. Eleven residents seek monetary damages, as well as a ban on events similar to the white nationalist march. They say Anglin and other white nationalists violated state and federal civil rights laws. ""The people of Charlottesville deserve their day in court, and those responsible for the violence on August 11 and 12 must be held accountable,"" said Brett Edkins, communications director for Integrity First for America, a nonprofit funding the suit. ""We are pleased to be supporting this historic case,"" Anglin's battles haven't been all legal, either. After the violence in Charlottesville in August, GoDaddy and Google refused to host The Daily Stormer. The site has bounced around and at several points ended up on the dark web. Most recently it resurfaced using a domain in Hong Kong. The site has appeared online intermittently but reports suggested it would be shut down. Anglin was born in 1984 and grew up in Ohio. He went to high school in a suburb of Columbus, where he listened to punk rock and cultivated the air of an outsider, according to a profile in Columbus Alive. He started to get interested in conspiracy theories and in his early 20s moved to the Philippines to teach English. In 2013, Anglin started The Daily Stormer, which picked up from Total Fascism, an earlier website he'd created. In a biographical post from March 2014, Anglin says, ""I ask myself what Hitler would do if he'd been born in 1984 in America and was dealing with this situation we are currently dealing with and also really liked 4chan and Anime."" An article posted on April 27 and still on the site's home page, which sports ""Jewish Problem"" and ""Race War"" sections, asks readers to donate to save the publication. The article's headline reads ""SPLC is Suing Anglin! Donate Now to STOP THESE KIKES."" An Anglin supporter also started a campaign to raise $150,000 for Anglin's legal defense on a far right crowdfunding site called WeSearchr. The fund-raising drive exceeded its goal in pledges after a little more than a month. A victory by Gersh and the SPLC wouldn't mean the end of trolling, but it might send a message. And it might raise a speed bump in the road for Anglin and other online hate sites. ""We have to establish what is right as we grow into this new online society and make a very clear statement to hate groups that they can't do this to people,"" Gersh said.

97,http://www.thewrap.com/sarah-palin-sues-new-york-times-for-libel/,"The former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate claims Times editorial falsely accused her of inciting the shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords Sarah Palin Sarah Palin, former running mate of GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times on Tuesday, saying the paper falsely accused her of inciting the near-fatal shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for defaming her by publishing a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011,” the lawsuit obtained by TheWrap states. Palin’s lawsuit alleges that the Times June 14 editorial “falsely” reported that she “incited Jared Loughner’s Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage” in Arizona where Loughner shot 19 people, including the severely wounded Democratic congresswoman Giffords. Also Read: Larry Flynt Might Help John Oliver Win Lawsuit Over Foul-Mouthed Squirrel Gag Also Read: Larry Flynt Might Help John Oliver Win Lawsuit Over Foul-Mouthed Squirrel Gag Palin, a Republican, also claims that the Times editorial incorrectly reported that her political action committee circulated “a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” On June 15 and 16, the Times published two different corrections of its editorial, ultimately saying that there was no link between the Palin mailing and the Loughner shooting, and saying that the Palin PAC mailing placed cross-hairs on voting districts, not individual elected officials, according to Palin’s lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims that the Times editorial board ignored news reports by its own reporters as well as staff columnists that stated that there was no link between Loughner and the Palin PAC mailings, and that Loughner acted because he was severely mentally ill.

98,http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/sarah-palin-sues-new-york-times-for-defamation-over-editorial-on-mass/2328701,"Former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times Tuesday, claiming the newspaper falsely linked her to the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that wounded then-congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, says a Times editorial earlier this month ""falsely stated as a matter of fact"" that Palin had incited the attack, in which a gunman shot 19 people, killing six of them. The Times published the editorial on June 14, shortly after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a baseball field in Alexandria, injuring Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and several others. Drawing a parallel to the Arizona shooting, the newspaper's editorial board wrote that both attacks fit a ""sickeningly familiar pattern"" and that the ""link to political incitement was clear."" ""Before the shooting,"" it read, ""Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral district that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."" The description was inaccurate. The map had put cross hairs over targeted electoral districts but not Democratic politicians. Following a wave of backlash on social media, the Times issued an apology and corrected the editorial, saying no connection between political incitement and the Arizona shooting was ever established. The Washington Post's Fact Checker found that the Times had relied on a thoroughly debunked talking point in its description of the map and noted that the Arizona gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, had no clear political views. A Times spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday: ""We have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously."" Palin's lawsuit alleges the Times ""violated the law and its own policies"" in the editorial and criticizes the newspaper for not mentioning Palin by name in its correction. ""Given that the entire premise of the Palin Article was the 'disturbing pattern' of politically incited violence emanating from a non-existent link between Mrs. Palin and Loughner's 2011 crime, which the Times conceded did not exist, the entire Palin Article should have been retracted — not minimally and inadequately corrected — and the Times should have apologized to Mrs. Palin,"" the complaint reads. Palin's lawyers allege the Times knew when it published the editorial that there was no link between Palin's political activities and the mass shooting in Arizona. The complaint lists a series of Times articles indicating that Loughner's attack was not politically motivated, including a January 2011 commentary in which columnist Charles M. Blow argued there was ""no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting."" The Times reported regularly on Loughner's criminal case, which did not turn up any evidence that his actions were politically motivated, the complaint says. There was also nothing to suggest he saw a map of the targeted districts that the editorial mentioned, it says. The lawsuit also says the Times's statements linking Palin to Loughner's crimes ""stood in stark contrast"" to how it covered the motives of James Hodgkinson, the gunman who fired on the lawmakers in Alexandria before being fatally shot by police. ""The Times concluded that there was not a connection between Hodgkinson and his professed penchant for Democratic stances sufficient to warrant implicating Democrats or the Bernie Sanders campaign as inciting factors for Hodgkinson's attack,"" the complaint reads. Palin has drifted out of the limelight since her unsuccessful bid for the White House with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and parted ways with Fox News, where she was a political commentator, in 2015. But she still commands a massive following on social media, particularly among conservatives, and continues to advocate for right-wing causes. As a public figure, she will have to prove among other things that the Times knowingly published false information about her to prevail in her lawsuit.",2017-06-28 07:58:27,Sarah Palin sues New York Times for defamation over editorial on mass shooting,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

100,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/world/middleeast/army-solder-charged-islamic-state.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmiddleeast,"Advertisement Supported by By Noah Weiland WASHINGTON — An Army sergeant stationed in Hawaii was charged with trying to provide equipment, training and classified military information to the Islamic State, after undercover F.B.I. agents documented his offers of support to the militant group in a series of meetings in June and July, according to an indictment. Sgt. First Class Ikaika Erik Kang, 34, was arrested on July 8 and charged in an indictment filed in the United States District Court of Hawaii on Friday. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of four counts against him. According to the indictment, which was announced on Saturday by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., Sergeant Kang tried to offer “material support or resources” in meetings with the agents, whom he believed to be associates of the Islamic State. In one encounter on June 23, Sergeant Kang offered classified military documents, according to the indictment. In another meeting, on July 8, he volunteered equipment to the undercover sources, including a drone camera, a chest “rig” that holds ammunition and other kinds of “military-style clothing.” A news release from the Justice Department said the case was investigated by the F.B.I. and the United States Army’s Criminal Investigation Division. According to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in federal court on July 10 and obtained by The Associated Press, the sergeant, an air traffic controller at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii, described fantasies about killing fellow military members and pledging loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. His commanding officers called in the F.B.I. when they feared he had become radicalized. Sergeant Kang made copies of secret military documents in 2015, hoping to give them to the Islamic State, the affidavit said. When he met with the undercover F.B.I. agents, they made training videos that he thought would be taken to the Middle East to supply the terrorist group. The same day that the training videos were produced, Sergeant Kang and one of the undercover agents went shopping for the drone that he expected to give to the Islamic State. Sergeant Kang’s reported radicalism — which drifted into expressions of support for Hitler and the assailant in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., according to the affidavit — appeared to be a late development for someone who had an established career in the Army. He joined the Army in 2001, served in South Korea in 2002 and 2003, and then in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2010 and 2014. It was not until his later deployments that he began to show signs of extremism. His military clearance was taken away in 2012 after he made comments invoking the Islamic State, and was reinstated when he completed military requirements to renew his clearance, according to the affidavit. Birney Bervar, Sergeant Kang’s lawyer, said by telephone on Sunday that he wished the Army had offered psychiatric resources to the sergeant. “The Army probably should have done some type of medical or mental evaluation before launching an undercover criminal evaluation,” he said. In an interview with a Hawaiian television station, Sergeant Kang’s father, Clifford Kang, said his son’s behavior could be traced to post-traumatic stress disorder.

102,http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/30/nbc-cancels-carmichael-show/,"Network TV is about to get a lot less daring: NBC is saying goodbye to The Carmichael Show. The clever, provocative, issue-conscious family comedy — which stars rising comedian Jerrod Carmichael — has been canceled, EW has learned. The series, which stands as NBC’s longest-running comedy, is currently airing its 13-episode third season, which wraps up in August. On Friday, Carmichael put out a statement, obtained by EW, announcing his exit from the series; goodbyes from the network and producing studio 20th Century Fox quickly followed. “For three seasons (okay 2.5), I got to make a show that I love with my friends. It’s something I’ve wanted to do since I was 13,” he said. “Now, I’m excited to go make other things that I love. Thank you to every person who worked on or watched the Carmichael show.” “We are enormously proud of The Carmichael Show and Jerrod’s talent and vision to do a classic family sitcom that also taps into issues and relevant stories from the real world,” NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt and president Jennifer Salke said in a statement. “We thank and salute the cast, crew, and producers — and especially Jerrod — for three critically-acclaimed seasons.” “The Carmichael Show was such a wonderful show that we choose to focus today not on its loss but on the three incredible seasons we had the pleasure to produce,” 20th Century Fox Television presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman said in a statement. “We are thankful to the brilliant Jerrod Carmichael and his talented cast, and to showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, our fantastic writers and devoted production team. It’s a rarity that a comedy series tackles the social and political issues of the day in such a clever and hilariously funny way. This show was special, and we will miss it.” There was no tough topic or taboo that The Carmichael Show wouldn’t tackle: Each week, family members would unpack and debate such hot-button issues ranging from racism to gun control to sexual assault to transgender acceptance to Bill Cosby to Donald Trump. Wednesday’s episode dealt with the emotional fallout of a mass shooting, an installment whose airing was delayed two weeks after two real-life shootings prompted the network to pull it from its original premiere date. Carmichael publicly disagreed with the network’s decision, calling it “a disservice.” While critics have heaped praise on the multi-camera series — its fans include All in the Family creator Norman Lear, who was a big influence on Carmichael and his show — ratings have been modest. This season’s episodes have averaged 4.3 million viewers, down from season 2’s 4.8 million, and .9 in the 18-to-49-demo Live+3. (Perhaps it also didn’t help that a full year had passed between the airing of the season 2 finale and the season 3 premiere.) Last year, negotiations to bring back the show for a third season came down to the wire, but this year, as the deadline neared to renew contracts for the actors — Carmichael, David Alan Grier, Amber Stevens West, Loretta Devine, Lil Rel Howery, and Tiffany Haddish — signs were already pointing to NBC not picking up the show. In any case, Carmichael stands proud of the series, especially the current season batch. “I’ve never been more excited,” he told EW. “It’s not that I was lying to people for the first two seasons, but this one, I’m so proud of. I’m so happy with every single episode.”",2017-06-30 16:35:05,"NBC cancels The Carmichael Show

103,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/07/jason_dalton_jail_records.html," Gallery: Jason Dalton's evidentiary hearing KALAMAZOO, MI -- Police reports released this week document the bizarre behavior accused mass murderer Jason Dalton has exhibited in his nearly 17 months in the Kalamazoo County Jail, from howling in his cell to talking about killing a deputy. Dalton, 46, an Uber driver, is accused of going on a shooting rampage the night of Feb. 20, 2016 at three locations in Kalamazoo County. Dalton, of Cooper Township, faces six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight felony firearm counts. His lawyer has filed a notice of intent to use an insanity defense. The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office has released more than 50 pages of jail incident reports involving Dalton under the Freedom of Information Act. The most recent report, from June 16, documents a phone call of Dalton's that a deputy listened in on. The recipient of the phone call has been redacted. ""Jason explains how he would like to not shoot the guards that have mistreated him but cut them with a knife,"" Kalamazoo County Det. Sgt. Jim VanZile wrote in the report. ""He describes how he would like to cut their throats and take one of his K-Bars (a military style knife) and shove up through their skulls."" Dalton also mentioned in the phone call wanting to kill a deputy, saying if he couldn't be with his kids the deputy shouldn't be able to, either. ""Jason seems to be blaming Deputy (redacted) for his actions in killing several people,"" VanZile wrote. ""Jason says he hopes when he gets to prison he can get enough power to order a hit"" on the deputy. One of Dalton's cellmates told deputies he thought Dalton's mental state was deteriorating. The cellmate told a deputy Dalton said the sheriff's star represents the devil's cross, and said Dalton thought human sacrifices were being conducted in the basement of the jail. ""Please use caution when moving Mr. Dalton,"" a reporting officer warns in one incident report. Another report indicates Dalton had tried to escape from the security garage at the Kalamazoo County Courthouse May 20, 2016, when he was waiting to be taken into a courtroom for his preliminary examination. ""The call came that Dalton was needed,"" Deputy Troy Miles wrote in the report. ""The van door was opened and Dalton got out of the van, paused, then ran toward the exit. I grabbed Dalton and stopped him."" Dalton disrupted the courtroom and caused a delay in his preliminary exam during the testimony of shooting survivor Tiana Carruthers. While Carruthers was on the stand, Dalton started talking and tried to stand up from his seat at the defense table. The disruption caused Carruthers to break down on the stand and caused deputies to drag Dalton out of the courtroom. The exam continued with Dalton appearing via video from the jail. According to police reports, Dalton had to be carried into the arraignment room at the jail. There, several deputies reported hearing Dalton say, ""yeah, I shot her,"" ""that's the woman I shot,"" and ""I did shoot her,"" when Carruthers was testifying. In May 2016, three days after Dalton disrupted the courtroom at his preliminary examination, he assaulted officers while being escorted back into his cell from the bathroom, according to police reports. Dalton refused deputies' commands to return to his cell after using the bathroom, then tried to get past the deputies and ""aggressively charged"" at two deputies. One deputy was sent to Bronson Methodist Hospital for a hand injury he sustained while Dalton tried to assault the two deputies, according to the police reports. Days before that report, Dalton was seen displaying bizarre behavior. This behavior included Dalton howling inside his cell and Dalton telling a deputy he ""forgot how to blink,"" according to police reports. Dalton also tried to escape that same day when a deputy opened his cell door to give him a meal. The reports indicated sheriff's officials would pursue charges against Dalton for assaulting police officers, but Undersheriff Pali Matyas said Thursday he did not know if a case was submitted to the Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office. In April 2017, a deputy found Dalton had scratched a message in pencil above his cell door: ""I gave you everything. Don't let me down. You let me down (expletive). Now you burn."" An inmate also told deputies Dalton had solicited him to burn down Dalton's house in exchange for all of the flat-screen televisions in Dalton's house. That day, the deputy also found excessive amounts of garbage, 30 bars of soap, several rolls of toilet paper, drink packets, staples and miscellaneous food items left over from meals. The deputy wrote up Dalton for having unauthorized property and material on the walls. In February 2017, Dalton appeared to have gotten in a scuffle with another inmate. Dalton, whose face was red and t-shirt was torn, told deputies another inmate grabbed him while he was walking by. The file also includes a copy of a handwritten lawsuit filed in federal court by a person purporting to be Dalton. It sought $10 million in punitive damages from Uber Technologies, Inc. claiming the company caused Dalton emotional distress and that he had ""psychological damage because of Uber."" Authorities have said the lawsuit is bogus and that Dalton denies filing it. An appellate attorney for Dalton is asking the Michigan Court of Appeals to consider blocking Dalton's statements to police from being admitted at trial. Dalton's trial is on hold until the appellate court decided whether it will hear his appeal. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

A Times editorial incorrectly linked Palin's PAC to a mass shooting — something she alleges the newspaper did deliberately, or with ""reckless disregard for the truth."" By
      
        Claudia Koerner Posted on June 27, 2017, at 9:08 p.m. ET Sarah Palin filed a lawsuit against the New York Times on Tuesday after the newspaper's editorial board incorrectly wrote that her political action committee inspired the 2011 mass shooting that seriously injured US Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others. The Times issued a correction to the June 14 editorial, which was written after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia. In the lawsuit's complaint, Palin said the correction didn't go far enough — and accused the Times of publishing the false information intentionally or recklessly because of the paper's history of hostility toward her. ""Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for falsely stating to millions of people that she, a devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who committed a substantial portion of her adult life to public service, is part of a pattern of “lethal"" politics and responsible for inciting an attack that seriously injured numerous people and killed six, including a nine-year-old girl who, at that time, was the same age as Mrs. Palin’s youngest daughter,"" the complaint reads. A spokesperson for the Times said the news organization had not yet reviewed Palin's claims, but that it would defend itself ""vigorously"" against the suit. In 2011, Palin's PAC circulated an image that put crosshairs on the Arizona congressional district represented by Giffords, as well as several other districts represented by Democrats. There has never been any evidence that the image was seen by gunman Jared Lee Loughner, who opened fire on Giffords and a group of her constituents at a Tucson congressional event. Palin's complaint states that ""speculative and unsubstantiated rumors"" about the image hurt her professional and personal life in the aftermath of the shooting. ""Among other things it led to the end of her position as a Fox News political commentator, influenced her decision not to run for President of the United States, and tainted her personal and professional image,"" the complaint states. ""It took Mrs. Palin years to overcome the detrimental impacts of the false speculation that she caused Loughner to commit murder."" The link between Palin and the shooting has been debunked by various news organizations, including the New York Times. Still, the June 14 piece by the paper's editorial board described the PAC flyer as ""political incitement,"" and a ""clear"" link to the Tucson shooting, and said it was part of a pattern of political rhetoric fueling violence. The Times later issued a correction, and apologized for the error. But Palin's complaint states that the Times' attempts to correct the record did not repair the damage to her reputation, and went against the paper's own ethics standards. We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial.… https://t.co/JBdF5CmKuo Under US law, celebrities or government officials must prove defamatory statements not only hurt their reputation, but were made with ""actual malice."" That requires a publisher or speaker to know the statements are false and publish them anyway — or to act with a reckless disregard for their veracity. Palin's complaint also accuses the Times of deliberately defaming her because of its distaste for her and her politics. The suit cites a Times statement to CNN that defended the premise of the editorial, even as it apologized for the factual error. ""[The Times'] statement demonstrates that, when it comes to Mrs. Palin, The Times is willing to operate with a purposeful avoidance of the truth — marked by a deliberate decision not to acknowledge facts confirming the falsity of its charges against Mrs. Palin,"" the complaint states.

105,http://www.inquisitr.com/4382006/five-years-ago-james-holmes-opened-fire-in-an-aurora-co-movie-theater-victims-remembered/,"It was a horrible crime. James Holmes took the lives of 12 people and injured 70 more when he opened fire on the moviegoers who were there to see The Dark Knight Rises. Complete and total chaos erupted in the theater, as was shown by cell phone videos taken by some of the survivors. The phone calls for help began to flood in as some managed to call 911 on their phones. There were heart-wrenching stories that came out as the victims were identified, including the tragic loss of so many innocent lives and the loved ones left behind to deal with the unthinkable tragedy. What could have possibly made one human being want to do this? It came out in the trial that several mental health professionals had met with James Holmes in the months prior to the mass shooting. Each saw that there was the potential for danger, and all opted to do nothing. One even said she had feared that having him involuntarily committed would have put him over the edge. Today is the five-year anniversary of the mass shooting, and a candlelight vigil was held in honor of those who died, those whose lives were changed forever, and all of the first responders to the tragic scene. They began to gather last night at 11:30 p.m. PST near Aurora City Hall. According to the Denver Post, the memorial service began at 12:15 a.m. PST and a moment of silence held at 12:38 a.m. PST, marking the time the shots began to ring out in the theater. [Image by Theo Stroomer/Stringer/Getty Images] [Image by Kevork Djansezlah/Getty Images] The 7/20 Memorial Foundation has announced they have raised $250,000 to build a permanent memorial for the mass shooting that took place five years ago. Some of the members lost family and friends that day, and they have worked hard on the design and plan to show it off in August, according to KDVR. As for where James Holmes is now, his whereabouts are unknown. He was sentenced to 12 consecutive life sentences plus 3,318 years without the possibility of parole. While being moved by a correction officer, another inmate managed to attack Holmes. For his protection, mass shooter James Holmes was moved out of state. Even his victims and the families of those who died were not notified when the move happened.

Wednesday, 12 July 2017 09:25 PM Apple will open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information transferred from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers there. The data center announced Wednesday will be located in the Guizhou province and run by a company owned by the Chinese government. Apple is teaming up with the company, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data, to comply with a new Chinese law requiring data-storage providers to keep the information of mainland China customers on computers located within the country. The Guizhou data center will store photos, video, documents and other personal information uploaded to iCloud accounts by Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they're traveling outside the country. Backups and other data stored in iCloud accounts by customers outside China will continue to be stored in data centers in the U.S. and eventually Denmark. Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, have already made similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government. But Apple's acquiescence is striking because CEO Tim Cook has made preserving customers' privacy a company cornerstone. The Cupertino, California, company underscored that commitment last year in a high-profile battle with the U.S. government over a legal demand to crack open the iPhone of a suspected killer in a mass shooting. Apple has a strong incentive to toe the line in China because that country already is its third-largest market behind North America and Europe, with all signs pointing to it become an even bigger profit center. China currently accounts for about 20 percent of Apple's revenue. Even though it's working with a government-owned company, Apple sought to reassure customers in China that the arrangement won't compromise their privacy. ""As our customers know, Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems,"" the company said in a statement. What's more, Apple says it will hold to the security keys protecting the data that people routinely back up in iCloud accounts. But experts believe the data center will make it easier for the government to retrieve the information through legal demands or other means. Apple will find it more challenging to resist any order from a Chinese court to give authorities there access to an iCloud account that they want to sift through, predicted Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney specializing in privacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Currently, the Chinese government has to funnel those demands through the U.S. court system, a more difficult process to negotiate. Cardozo recommends that Apple customers in mainland customer turn off the iCloud feature on their iPhones and other devices to protect their information from prying eyes. Data stored on the devices themselves should remain secure as long as they lock them with passwords that only the user knows. Even if the government seizes a device, Apple won't have the keys to unlock data. But with iCloud, Apple does have the keys. The exception is passwords and credit card data synced with iCloud Keychain.

          / AP SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is opening a data center in China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information transferred from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers there. The data center announced Wednesday will be run by a company owned by the Chinese government and located in the Guizhou province. Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with the company, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data, to comply with a new Chinese law requiring data-storage providers to keep the information of mainland China customers on computers located within the country. The Guizhou data center will store photos, video, documents and other personal information uploaded to iCloud accounts by Apple customers in mainland China, even when traveling outside the country. Material stored in iCloud accounts by customers outside China will continue to be stored in data centers in the U.S. and eventually Denmark. Other major technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), have already made similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government. But Apple's acquiescence is striking because CEO Tim Cook has made preserving customers' privacy a company cornerstone. The Cupertino, California, company underscored that commitment last year in a high-profile battle with the U.S. government over a legal demand to crack open the iPhone of a suspected killer in a mass shooting. Apple has a strong financial incentive to toe the line in China because that country already is its third-largest market behind North America and Europe, with all signs pointing to it become an even bigger profit center. China currently accounts for about 20 percent of Apple's revenue. Even though it's working with a government-owned company, Apple sought to reassure customers in China that the arrangement won't compromise their privacy. ""As our customers know, Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems,"" the company said in a statement. What's more, Apple says it will hold to the security keys protecting the data that people routinely back up in iCloud accounts. But experts believe the data center will make it easier for the government to retrieve the information through legal demands or other means. Apple will find it more challenging to resist any order from a Chinese court to give authorities there access to an iCloud account that they want to sift through, predicted Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney specializing in privacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Currently, the Chinese government has to funnel those demands through the U.S. court system, a more difficult process to negotiate. Cardozo recommends that Apple customers in mainland customer turn off the iCloud feature on their iPhones and other devices to protect their information from prying eyes. Data stored on the devices themselves should remain secure as long as they lock them with passwords that only the user knows. Even if the government seizes a device, Apple won't have the keys to unlock data. But with iCloud, Apple does have the keys. Ajay Arora, CEO of data security specialist Vera, also warns that Apple's partnership with a company owned by the Chinese government increases the chances that authorities could secretly pry their way into iCloud accounts.

John McCain were to die tomorrow, his legacy as a patriot, hero and maverick would be secure, but I don't think history is done with him yet. I think his finest hours may lie ahead. Every now and then in Washington something happens that temporarily shakes the body politic out of its cynical torpor: the death of a president; a terrorist attack; the mass shooting of children. And now the terrible news that McCain, R-Ariz., has the same form of aggressive brain cancer that felled Ted Kennedy may have a similar impact. It may awaken our leaders to a new sense of what's important, what's possible, what's required of them. McCain's potential death sentence may have given him new life to write a final chapter in his life. Already beloved by many of his colleagues, revered by the press and respected by the public, McCain's voice can ring louder and clearer than ever. He can summon Congress to work together to pass a bipartisan health care bill and to engage in job-creating tax reform. He could even consider resuming his leadership on immigration reform and global warming that waned in recent years. He would be the center of attention and affection, and he has a rare opportunity to make what could be his last days count. Finally, can one think of a starker contrast to Donald Trump's narcissistic laziness than John McCain's selfless heroism? Just by living, McCain reminds Americans of what a leader can do and be, and that they don't have to settle for the low standards set by our current president. McCain is almost free, free from a life of expectations, the burdens of torture and also much joy. But he will not go quietly. Once again, he will lead by example and show us the way it can be done.

111,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/08/nikki-haley-trump-administration-un-ambassador,"The US’s ambassador to the UN has differed from Trump on Nato and the Kremlin even as she supports some of the president’s contentious ambitions Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.05 GMT Taking her place at the dais in an emergency meeting of the UN security council this week, Nikki Haley aimed a characteristically stinging rebuke at North Korea over its successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile – and raised the threat of military retaliation. It was not the first time Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, has led the rhetorical charge against adversaries of the US.  While Rex Tillerson has taken an unusually low profile as America’s top diplomat and key posts remain unfilled at the the state department, some have even characterized Haley as the de facto secretary of state. As one of Donald Trump’s most high-profile lieutenants, Haley is the international face of an administration that lacks a clear foreign policy doctrine and is often led astray by the whims of a president who prefers Twitter rants to diplomatic channels. The uncertainty has catapulted Haley into the spotlight as a key US negotiator, but also as the protector of her boss’s “America First” platform in a role that at its very core relies on international cooperation. US allies have expressed concern over the Trump administration’s chaotic foreign policy, but last week Haley told the House foreign affairs committee that unpredictability was an advantage. “I deal with 192 [countries] and the overwhelming feeling is that we are unpredictable,” she said. “They don’t know exactly what we are going to do. “It has kept them more on alert, of wanting to be there with us, not wanting to get on the wrong side of us.” The comments were typical of Haley, who since assuming the role of UN ambassador earlier this year has set out to downplay Trump’s erratic statements without teetering into outright defiance. Until his speech in Warsaw this week, Trump had repeatedly refused to commit to article five of the Nato charter – the provision requiring members to defend each other from attack. In contrast, Haley used her Senate confirmation hearing in January to stress the importance of Nato as a bedrock of transatlantic relations. And where Trump has repeatedly lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, Haley has maintained an aggressive posture against the Kremlin and declared in her first UN security council address in February: “We cannot trust Russia. We should never trust Russia.” She has condemned human rights violations, while Trump has praised authoritarian rulers such as the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte and and even said he would be “honored” to meet with Kim Jong-un. It was Haley who held up portraits of children killed by Bashar al-Assad’s April chemical weapons attack; the UN ambassador has insisted that the Syrian president must go, even as Trump and Tillerson appear resigned to him remaining in power. “I think she is doing something that’s very difficult,” said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “That is to never contradict the president, but to speak in more traditional Republican tones about foreign policy.” Abrams, who served under Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, said one of the unusual aspects of Haley’s job was how it has seemingly expanded as Tillerson takes a backseat. “In many ways, she’s the main spokesman for the United States on a lot of foreign policy issues,” Abrams said. “She’s not just handling UN affairs in New York, she’s taking charge of American participation in the entire UN system.” But Haley has also lined up behind some of Trump’s more contentious ambitions. She has declared the president as “putting the UN on notice” and emphatically defended what even some congressional Republicans have described as “devastating” cuts to the UN budget. The US is eying a reduction of its contribution to the peacekeeping budget from 28.5% currently to 25% of total costs. The annual savings amount to roughly $600m, which is less than the $1bn proposed cut to UN peacekeeping costs outlined by Trump in a budget blueprint earlier this year. But UN officials have pushed back, arguing in May that the proposed cuts would “simply make it impossible” to maintain some of the body’s most essential work. Haley cheered the cuts in a tweet last week, writing: “Just 5 months into our time here, we’ve cut over half a billion $$$ from the UN peacekeeping budget & we’re only getting started.” Abrams said Haley was navigating an administration “which has very often deprecated international cooperation”. But skeptics say Haley’s balancing act is precarious. Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman under Barack Obama, said Haley was hampered by a lack of coordination within the administration. UN security council resolutions on North Korea and Iran under the Obama White House, he noted, were not the undertaking of any one administration official. It was not simply the UN ambassador but also the secretary of state pushing for negotiations and the president himself making phone calls to seal the deal. “I don’t think Nikki Haley even has that as an option,” Vietor said, “and Tillerson doesn’t seem to have a seat at the table in any meaningful way, in terms of shaping policy. “They rarely seem to know what Trump is going to do or say at any given moment.” Spending my 4th in meetings all day. #ThanksNorthKorea Haley’s foreign policy experience was questioned this week when she appeared to complain about having to work on the 4 July holiday after the North Korean missile test. “Spending my 4th in meetings all day. #ThanksNorthKorea,” Haley tweeted, prompting a backlash from Twitter users who suggested that a senior administration official should not begrudge working amid a diplomatic crisis. Vietor said Haley, despite lacking the traditional background of a UN ambassador, seemed to understand the importance of building international coalitions. Her real challenge, he said, was being undermined by Trump. “I’m glad she’s speaking up for human rights when she does,” Vietor said, “but it’s gone when [Trump is] cozying up to Duterte, who’s bragged about killing people.” Haley has also come under significant criticism for her handling of the Israel-Palestine issue in UN institutions. Feted by Israel for her strong support, she was in turn criticized this week by a senior Palestinian politician, Hanan Ashrawi, for conducting a “one-woman crusade” against Palestinians. “Through intimidation and threats, Miss Haley’s crusade does not miss an opportunity to put pressure on anyone that seeks to challenge Israeli impunity,” Ashrawi said. Haley has repeatedly accused UN institutions of “bias” against Israel or of “bullying” the country – words that have won her plaudits from the country’s rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its own UN ambassador, Danny Danon. And her words have been matched by her actions. Earlier this year, she delivered a US veto on the nomination of the former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad as UN envoy to Libya – despite the fact that Fayyad was highly regarded by US officials. Explaining her move, Haley said the US did not recognize a Palestinian state “or support the signal” Fayyad’s appointment would have sent. Haley herself expanded her logic later in a speech to the powerful pro-Israel US lobby group Aipac. “We said no and we had him booted out,” she said, as the audience cheered. “That doesn’t mean he wasn’t a nice man. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t good to America. What it means is, until the Palestinian Authority comes to the table, until the UN responds the way they’re supposed to, there are no freebies for the Palestinian Authority anymore.” The move drew a strong response from the former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, who called it “stunningly dumb”. Haley entered the fray again on Friday, asking senior UN officials to oppose a Palestinian effort to get Unesco’s world heritage committee to adopt a resolution declaring Hebron and the Tomb of the Patriarchs as world heritage sites designated as in danger. Haley was overwhelmingly approved by the US Senate, by a 96-4 vote, in a testament to her national profile as a voice of reason within the Republican party. As governor of South Carolina, she was commended for her response to the racially motivated mass shooting at Emanuel AME church in Charleston in June 2015, which included the decision to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol grounds. But diplomacy carried unique challenges for anyone representing the Trump administration on the global stage, Vietor warned. “I think Trump’s word is the only one people are listening to,” he said, “because they know a policy is only as good as his most recent tweet.”",2017-07-08 07:00:06,Nikki Haley: global face of Trump administration strikes delicate balance,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

113,http://theconversation.com/is-life-in-norway-as-happy-as-its-cracked-up-to-be-76516,"Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University Nathan John Albury was recently a research fellow at the Center for Multilingualism in Society across the Lifespan at the University of Oslo. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list For progressives around the world, it has become almost a pastime to romanticise the quasi-socialist Scandinavian countries. Nations such as Norway, Finland and Sweden are – to many – not only examples of wealth and well-being but also bastions of social progress and tolerance. Norway, in particular, consistently leads the world in quality of life and happiness, and the country is responding compassionately to the Syrian refugee crisis, unlike its many critics in Europe. But is life in Norway really so great? I’m not so sure. As an Australian who worked in Oslo for three years, I found that while freedom, tolerance and happiness are indeed important values there, you can expect to enjoy them only if you’re Norwegian. After the the 2011 mass shooting by Anders Breivik, which he carried out in the name of rejecting a “Muslim colonisation” of Europe, Norway emerged determined to defy xenophobia. In 2015, during the height of the European refugee crisis, the country, which has a population of 5.2 million, considered some 31,000 asylum cases, a national record. And in contrast to most European countries, Norway extends full social support and protections to all asylees while they await a ruling. Still, Norway’s far-right Progress Party – to which Breivik belonged in his youth and which holds 29 seats in parliament – has fought to roll back migration and benefits. Since 2015, Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug has pursued aggressive restrictions on immigration, particularly for Muslims. As a result, the country deported a record number of migrants in 2016, including minors between the ages of 16 and 18, as per new restrictions. This fear-mongering taps into a dark strain of Norwegian history. As recently as 1977, the Norwegian government forcibly sterilised members of its Romani minority population. Such policies also echo Norway’s treatment of its indigenous population, which I have been studying. Indeed, it seems forgotten in post-colonial societies that Norwegian history is blighted with atrocities against the native Sámi. Until the second half of the 20th century, the Norwegian government forcibly seized Sámi lands in middle and northern Norway and sought to eradicate Sámi culture.  A policy of Norweginisation, known as fornorsking, meant that Sámi children were sent to Norwegian boarding schools, where they were beaten for speaking their native language. The Sámi were also denied the right to purchase property if they could not speak Norwegian. Today, Sámi people are still suppressed by Norwegian policy and experience ten times more discrimination than ethnic Norwegians. Many Sámi live throughout the country, and though their right to an education in Sámi and to the use of their language for public purposes has now been recognised, these rights are enjoyed only in small municipalities in the rural north that have been designated as Sámi territories. Generally speaking, to participate in Norway’s society and economy, you must forgo being and speaking Sámi. While popular and even academic writing in Norway describes immigrants from the Middle East as speaking “kebab Norwegian”, my 2016 analysis of online comments to Sámi-themed news found a similarly pervasive prejudice. The analysis shows that Norwegians argue that the Sámi threaten the purity of Norwegian ethnicity and way of life. Some say Sámi cannot be seen as Norwegian citizens, do not deserve indigenous status and have invented their historic oppression. In another display of discrimination, when Tromsø, the major town of the far north, considered designating itself a Sámi zone, opposing voices were filled with hate. Opponents even fired bullets at bilingual signs to express displeasure. This racist undercurrent in Norway may derive from an American-style exceptionalism in Norway, whereby Norwegians are told and truly believe that they are world leaders in social policy. But to survive in Norway, those of a non-Norwegian culture are expected to adopt a Norwegian world view. The compulsory language courses given to migrants really brings that message home. Its curriculum celebrates Norway but presents almost hegemonic views on nearly everything else, from alcohol consumption to social values and Norwegian history. The Sámi and Romani are almost entirely absent from the language-course curriculum. To suggest that all is bad in Norway would be false. I, too, have been thankful for Norway’s affordable health care and generous leave entitlements. And the upcoming parliamentary election, to be held in September 2017, presents an opportunity for a broader change, including on immigration. But not all is rosy in the Norwegian utopia. Next time someone extols the virtues of this “perfect” Scandinavian society, remind them that the Norwegian dream is not available to all. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

          / CBS News It was Dec. 14, 2012, and Liza Long headed to work at Carrington College-Boise. It was just another Friday morning until Long, the mother of four children, logged on to Facebook, where news of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was just beginning to emerge. ""I just put my head down on my desk and started to cry,"" Long, 42, told CBS News. But it wasn't that Long knew any of the families that had lost a child. ""I had children about that age too. It's every mom's worst nightmare. But I realized right away it's every mom's worst nightmare on two fronts, not just one."" Her first thought, she later wrote, was ""What if my son does that someday?"" Only a day before Sandy Hook, Long had to forcibly restrain her second oldest son, Michael -- then 13 -- to prevent him from running out into oncoming traffic, and then had him transported to an acute care psychiatric hospital. The incident -- which left Long covered in bites and bruises from her son -- was hardly something new. For close to eight years, Long, then a single mother, and her other children had been coping with Michael's abrupt, violent behavior. (In writing and speaking out about her family's experience, she refers to her son as Michael, though that's not his real name.) These outbursts were so frequent and frightening that Long and her children worked with child protective services and together set up a protocol for how best cope and stay safe whenever Michael spiraled out of control -- when he bit, punched and screamed, or pulled knives and threatened to hurt or kill his mother and siblings.  The first police report  about an incident when Michael threatened them with a knife was written up when he wasn't even 10 years old. Michael never remembered the episodes after they occurred. ""We drilled on it like you might drill on a fire plan,"" said Long, who recently published her memoir, ""The Price of Silence: A Mom's Perspective on Mental Illness."" ""If my son became unpredictable and violent the younger children knew where to go. They'd go to the nearest place where they could lock the door. They'd grab their iPod or their books or something to color, head to the car and lock the door, or head to my room and lock the door, and my older son would call the police because in this country that's what you do."" Life was always unpredictable. Diagnosis after diagnosis and at least a dozen psychiatric drugs brought no relief. ""We had no idea whether a day would be a good day or a go-to-jail day,"" she said. The night of the Sandy Hook shooting, Long returned home and began to write an entry on her blog, ""The Anarchist Soccer Mom."" It was a call to action -- and also a call for help: Long had been telling her story anonymously for years, but this time she made the decision to put her name to the story. ""I live with a son who is mentally ill. I love my son. But he terrifies me,"" she wrote. The blog post went viral, generating more than a million 'likes' on Facebook and 30,000 email replies. While some families were offended and enraged, others contacted Long to share their own stories of coping with a loved one's mental illness. Many wrote to Long about frustrations with what she calls the ""school-to-prison pipeline,"" something she had experienced with her son over and over again. Decades ago, states started closing mental hospitals that warehoused the mentally ill without funding enough treatment alternatives. As a result, as Long wrote, ""It seems like the United States is using prison as the solution of choice for mentally ill people."" ""There are some things that we're doing right in this country but we need to do a better job across the board to provide better access to parents and kids to mental health care that works,"" she told CBS News. As a result of her blog post, an expert on bipolar disorder also reached out to Long. He told her that she had perfectly described an episode of bipolar disorder. Once again, Michael was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and this time diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type 1, which is defined by episodes of severe mood swings from mania to depression. He was put on lithium, which she says has helped greatly. However, Michael still has challenges, including a sensory processing disorder, executive function problems and dysgraphia, a learning disability that interferes with his ability to write, even though ""his I.Q. is off the charts,"" Long says. Long says her son has been stable and nonviolent for a year and a half since he started to receive the right treatment. She believes the mental health care system must move away from a symptom-based approach to treating mental illness often results in a wrong diagnosis or a succession of inadequate treatment efforts. That view is shared by Dr. Tom Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), who explains that ""symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment."" He writes in his blog on the NIMH website that the health care system must get better at diagnosing and treating mental illness based on the latest research into its underlying biological causes. But until medical science advances that understanding further and the mental health care system gets greater support, families like Long's may continue to struggle -- something she says the parents of Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza also endured. ""I wanted people to understand that Nancy Lanza wasn't a monster and that her son -- and I know people don't like to hear this -- that her son was not a monster,"" said Long. ""He was a sick boy who needed help and she was a mom who tried to get him help, a dead mother judged by everyone who paid the ultimate price because of what I view as our broken mental health care system.""

They are veterans of Tampa Bay institutions stepping into new and bigger jobs. They are embarking on major development projects that will start to be noticed soon. They are a trio of executives competing to run one of this area's top corporations at a challenging time. They are looking for ways to resuscitate a downtown that is resisting conventional remedies. At this midyear moment, they are ten key business people to watch for the rest of 2017. *** Defending Hulk, now Palin 1. Ken Turkel, attorney with Bajo Cuva Cohen Turkel law firm in Tampa. Looks like the $31 million settlement delivered by the legal team that included Turkel and fellow attorney Shane Vogt for client Hulk Hogan in the Gawker sex tapes lawsuit has not hurt the Tampa firm's penchant for high-profile cases. Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, just put Tampa natives Turkel and Vogt on her legal team to argue her defamation claims against the New York Times. Filed on June 27, the lawsuit alleges Palin was defamed in an editorial which she said links her to the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., best known for the gunshot wound to the head of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who survived the incident. Previous Coverage: Jury awards Hulk Hogan $115 million in Gawker sex-tape lawsuit Building a TGH-USF partnership 2. John Couris, CEO of Tampa General Hospital: Couris becomes TGH's CEO in September after serving as a hospital executive in Jupiter and a decade of high-level experience in Pinellas and Pasco counties. The timing is noteworthy. TGH is the teaching hospital for USF Health, which encompasses the University of South Florida's medical, nursing and public health schools. And USF Health is relocating from the Tampa campus to downtown Tampa, in the heart of ""Water Street Tampa"" — as the Jeff Vinik-Cascade Investment redevelopment project near Channelside is now named. That puts USF Health and TGH within a stone's throw of each other. Couris clearly will be called on to make that partnership grow and prosper. Big Dig at Gandy and Westshore 3. Beck Daniel, executive vice president of development, BTI Partners. This is not just another Tampa housing project. Daniel spearheads his Fort Lauderdale developer's ambitious $650 million plan to transform a 52-acre, waterfront tract into a community called Westshore Marina District — planned for 1,750 residences, a 200-room hotel, up to 240,000 square feet of retail, office and restaurant space and as many as 240 boat slips. Not a bad comeback in the works for what was once distressed property. Minority woman heads SPC 4. Tonjua Williams, president, St. Petersburg College. When Dr. William arrives on campus in the first week of July, it will be in her new role as SPC president — after 30 years in many jobs at the college. Where to start with her goals? At the top of her list: expand SPC's footprint in Pinellas County by making sure programs meet the needs of a local workforce and lead students to well-paying jobs. ""We're here to change lives,"" she says. ""That's been our mission all along."" Williams seems at home after three decades at SPC. ""I will continue to till the soil, bring my A-game,"" she says, ""and do my best for the college and the community we serve."" Previous Coverage: Editorial: An inspiring choice to lead St. Petersburg College Will Bill emerge as HSN CEO? 5. Bill Brand, president, HSN Inc. Who can fill the stylish shoes of Mindy Grossman, HSN's CEO for many years until she left in May to run Weight Watchers International? Brand is one of three internal candidates (the others are No. 6 and 7 in this list) competing with outside potentials for the coveted but very challenging job of making HSN hum again. The company's stumbled lately so perhaps it is time for fresh blood.  Will Judy emerge as HSN CEO? 6. Judy Schmeling, president of HSN subsidiary Cornerstone Brands and chief operating officer of HSN Inc. Departed HSN CEO Mindy Grossman lavished praise on Schmeling as COO and figured she was as adept as anyone to then turn around HSN's flagging Cornerstone Brands' catalog businesses of clothing and home decor. Is Judy the one? Will Rod emerge as HSN CEO? 7. Rod Little, chief financial officer, HSN Inc. He's the newcomer to HSN to be vying already for departed CEO Mindy Grossman's job. Little arrived in January from past jobs that include CFO for Elizabeth Arden Inc. and various leadership positions with Procter & Gamble. With six months left in 2017, it's an easy bet that a Mindy Grossman successor will be named well before year-end. HSN can't tread water that long waiting for leadership. Branding Water Street Tampa 8. Ali Glisson, marketing/communications vice president at Strategic Property Partners. It took a long time for the Vink-Cascade Investment joint redevelopment project, $3 billion in size and counting, to finally get a name. Now it is up to Glisson and her SPP team to make ""Water Street Tampa"" mean more than a name that could fit comfortably on the sides of upscale condo towers here. Glisson describes Water Street (Old Water Street, an actual street, may be renamed Water Street) as ""a real neighborhood spine, a place with a real residential neighborhood feel"" that will include retail, a park with planned events, a 5-star hotel and a community center. Brand building takes time, of course, but this project will require a decade or more to come together. Where will you be in 2027? If Rick Baker becomes mayor? 9. Bill Edwards, owner of the Edwards Group. Edwards owns the Tampa Bay Rowdies soccer franchise and the SunDial St. Pete shops. He's the successful operator of St. Petersburg's Mahaffey Theater. He's an area philanthropist. Edwards is probably the most influential private citizen in St. Petersburg, using his wealth and legal muscle to make things happen — usually in ways that he wants. His Achilles heel, if he has one? A lingering federal lawsuit lodged by two whistle-blowers accusing Edwards of looting millions from his defunct mortgage company. Now comes former St. Pete Mayor Rick Baker challenging incumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman in this fall's election. Since 2012, Baker happens to have run Edwards' company, making six figures pushing to expand Edwards' business empire. If Baker beats Kriseman, it's doubtful Edwards will need to call ahead to see Mr. Mayor. Then again, Edwards has pretty much had the run of St. Pete for awhile. Can Clearwater be salvaged? 10. Seth Taylor, Community Redevelopment Agency director for the city of Clearwater. He's enjoyed, or perhaps survived, his first year trying to crack the mystery of how to revive downtown Clearwater. Since coming to Clearwater from New York City, Taylor's made a ton of little changes and one big one: He's driving the $55 million Imagine Clearwater waterfront redevelopment. And he's a major player in an aggressive city plan to use cash to lure businesses downtown. ""I think what has prevented anchor tenants from locating here is they don't see the people and the activity so they don't feel confident making the investment in downtown,"" Taylor recently told this newspaper. ""That's why this program is so important because it gives the extra boost they need to come down here."" There's a problem, though. The Church of Scientology (the 800-pound gorilla in Clearwater's room) refuses to work with him. Such is the latest chapter of Clearwater's dilemma.

          / CBS/AP NEW YORK -- Former vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor Sarah Palin is accusing The New York Times of defamation over an editorial that linked one of her political action committee ads to the mass shooting that severely wounded then-Arizona Congressman Gabby Giffords. In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Tuesday, Palin's lawyers say the Times ""violated the law and its own policies"" when it accused her of inciting the 2011 attack that killed six people. The lawsuit refers to a June editorial in the Times on the recent shooting of Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. The editorial was later corrected. Palin is seeking damages to be determined by a jury. A spokeswoman for the Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, says they haven't seen the lawsuit but will defend against any claim vigorously. Fact checkers backed up Palin's claim that the editorial was factually incorrect. ""We're glad to see this fixed in the editorial, but it's not a good sign that the debunked talking point was included as fact in the editorial of a major media outlet,"" the Washington Post Fact Checker wrote earlier this month.

117,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/10/1-853-cybercrime-reports-for-16-in-stat/,"Arkansas was the source of at least 1,853 reports of Internet crime last year, with cyberattacks ranging from personal data breaches to government impersonation to extortion, according to the FBI. The reports account for a small percentage of the nearly 300,000 online crimes the FBI tallied nationwide in 2016, but the agency warns that the attacks in Arkansas, some of which were carried out by hackers overseas, have become increasingly complex. It reflects a global trend in which hackers have used rapidly evolving techniques to infiltrate government, business and personal computer systems. In May, more than 200,000 computers across the world were reportedly infected in a cyberattack that investigators traced to a North Korean hacking group. Late last month, another version of that attack shut down banking and transportation systems across Europe, and stretched as far as the U.S. and Australia, according to reports. FBI Special Agent Sebastian Montes said the scale of cybercrime in Arkansas is much smaller, but many of the methods are the same. ""Doing something like that is not easy,"" he said. ""It takes an individual with a level equivalent to computer scientists. These folks, they're very savvy and they have the luxury of time."" [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] The FBI said more than $1.3 billion was lost in Internet crimes and cyberattacks in the U.S. last year, the highest annual total since the agency began publishing that information in 2000. In its 2016 Internet Crime Report, the FBI noted that ransomware -- malicious software that blocks access to a computer system until money is paid -- has become more common. Hackers collected more than $2.4 million through ransomware attacks in the U.S. last year, according to the agency. Some of that money came from Arkansas, where the FBI received 12 reports of ransomware attacks in 2016. In December, overseas hackers blocked the Carroll County sheriff's office and the ARCare medical group from accessing its computer systems in separate attacks. ARCare reportedly regained access to its files through a backup computer system. The FBI said the sheriff's office, which did not have a backup system, paid hackers $2,400 in the digital currency Bitcoin to recover its files. Montes, who is assigned to the FBI's Little Rock field office, said the agency investigated the attacks but did not have further information. ""The advice that we gave them and we give everybody is we don't advocate paying the ransom,"" he said. ""That'll only encourage them to do it more. However, the reality of the situation is if they don't have backups, they're out of options."" The FBI, through its Internet Crime Complaint Center, fielded at least three complaints of terrorism from Arkansas last year. In one of those complaints, according to Montes, someone in Arkansas reported that a person in another state was planning to leave the country to ""support Islamic extremism."" Montes said another complaint of terrorism that originated in Arkansas involved someone in Indiana who was plotting a mass shooting. Montes said the complaints, which were ultimately handled by FBI offices outside the state, were taken ""very seriously."" The credibility of the third terrorism complaint from Arkansas last year was questionable, according to Montes. The FBI said many complaints the agency receives are difficult to verify, but an even greater number are never reported. The agency estimates that just 15 percent of Internet crimes and cyberattacks are reported to federal authorities. ""There's a lot of cybercrime that happens in the state of Arkansas that we don't even know about,"" Montes said. The 1,853 complaints of Internet crime in Arkansas last year slightly higher than the average over the past decade. The number of annual complaints from the state has been steady. The amount of money stolen in cybercrimes each year has increased, from $1.3 million in 2007 to $7.9 million last year. ""There's no doubt about it that [the crimes] are getting more sophisticated,"" Montes said. The most common Internet crimes reported in Arkansas and across the country last year were nonpayment and nondelivery scams, according to the FBI. That's when someone pays for a product or service online but never receives it, or when someone provides a product or service but is never compensated. The FBI received 519 of those complaints from Arkansas in 2016. The second-most reported online crime in the state last year was the ""419/overpayment"" scam. That's the well-known ""Nigerian prince"" scheme in which a person solicits financial assistance, often through email, to transfer money in exchange for a portion of the money. The ""419"" refers to a section of Nigerian law associated with con artistry and fraud. The FBI received 169 of those complaints from Arkansas last year. People over 60 years old are the most common victims of Internet crime in Arkansas and across the nation, according to the FBI. Other Internet crimes reported in Arkansas last year were not financially motivated. The Islamic State terrorist group hacked the Arkansas Library Association's computer system last year and posted the names, home addresses and phone numbers of about 800 of the association's members online, according to the FBI. The hackers also posted Islamic State propaganda on the association's website. The hack was reported to be among a series of cyberattacks that the Islamic State group carried out against small civilian organizations across the country. Authorities said the hacks were more about arousing fear than stealing data. Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said the agency looked into the hack but left an investigation to federal authorities. ""Once it gets to that point of international intrigue, we're going to lean heavily on the FBI,"" he said. There was one report of ""hacktivism,"" illegal online activity aimed at promoting a social or political cause, that originated in Arkansas last year. Montes said the report involved activity on the ""dark Net,"" referring to back channels of the Internet that are sometimes used to sell and purchase illegal goods and services. He said he did not have further details on the complaint. Montes said the FBI focuses on stopping groups of online criminals who steal large amounts of money from multiple people. He said the agency doesn't have the resources to investigate most individual complaints. Many of those complaints are forwarded to local or state law enforcement agencies. Montes recommended keeping computer software updated and backing up important files to protect against the most common online threats. The FBI partners with InfraGard, a national nonprofit group, to share cyberintelligence with businesses, law enforcement agencies and other groups to protect the country's critical infrastructure against more complex attacks. But even InfraGard has been vulnerable to cybercrime. The group's website was defaced and the personal information of its members was distributed in 2011. A hacker group known as LulzSec claimed responsibility. ""It's extremely difficult to stay ahead of every single threat that's out there,"" Montes said.

Wednesday night’s episode of NBC’s The Carmichael Show, “Shoot-Up-Able,” which revolved around a mass shooting, was predictably anti-gun and anti-police. The episode was supposed to air June 14, but got pulled due to the shootings in Alexandria, Virginia, and San Francisco that day. After Jerrod Carmichael survives a mall shooting that resulted in 4 people getting killed, including the shooter, his family gathers to help him cope. But what starts as a humorous conversation about the identity of the shooter (a “29-year-old woman born and raised in the United States”) turns into a swipe at Republicans and the NRA for “blocking sensible gun legislation time and time again.”  Joe: Jerrod what were you thinking, going to a mall at 2:30 on a Saturday like some damn hero? You know good and well that's ISIS happy hour. Maxine: But Joe, Joe, you don't know who did this. Joe: Oh, come on, Maxine. You know there's only three options for any random mass shooting. ISIS, racist white, Asian pushed to the brink by his tiger mom. Cynthia: That's why I didn't push you boys in school. A ""D"" is still a passing grade. Joe: But, but see, he should've known better. Maxine: Wait, are you really blaming Jerrod for just going to the mall? Joe: Well, who we supposed to blame? The shooter? The NRA? The Republicans for blocking sensible gun legislation time and time again? Maxine: Those all sound like valid places to start placing blame. Interestingly, earlier in the episode, Jerrod described the mall as being “shoot-up-able,” somewhere with a “large crowd and little security” causing nervousness. You’d think the ideal target for a shooter is a place with little security that also happens to be a gun-free zone, so the shooter can be sure there’s no one there to resist him. When the law requires that a place be gun-free, it makes it the perfect “shoot-up-able” target. Joe also makes a comment about how difficult his life would be if his son died, because then he would have to dedicate his life to “anti-gun causes.” Later, a police officer arrives to question Jerrod about the shooting. Joe, Cynthia, and Nekeisha freak out, putting their hands in the air the whole time while Nekeisha films the interaction. They become even more overly cautious when they learn the officer’s last name is “Zimmerman.” When Maxine worries about the police officer, Joe and Cynthia assure her that she’ll be fine, presumably due to her being half-white.  Joe: I know your job is to protect and serve, but it's hard not to feel a little nervous when you in the room. Police Officer: You're not a suspect of any crime, sir. There's no reason to feel nervous. I'm just here to talk to your son. Cynthia: Well, I feel like we should put our hands up. Joe, should we put our hands up? Joe: Honey, that's a good idea. As a safety precaution, Officer, we are now lifting our hands up into the air. No sudden movements now. We got to treat these officers like bears. Nekeisha: I'm taping this, just so you know. If you shoot anyone, you probably will keep your job, but it's gonna be a rough couple of weeks. Police Officer: You're, obviously, free to do what you want, but that is extremely unnecessary. Nekeisha: We are here with Officer G. Zimmerman. Police Officer: I-it's Greg. There's no relation. It's, it's a common last name. Nekeisha: We're here with George Zimmerman's brother, Greg. Maxine: Whoa, what's going on in here? Do we have to have our hands up? Joe: No, you'll be fine, Maxine. Cynthia: Somebody shoot Maxine, they'll close the whole police station. As if this episode wasn’t agenda-driven enough, after the family learns that the shooter was female, Cynthia asks, “Does that count as progress, Maxine?” Nekeisha replies, “After Hillary, I think we should take every win we can get.” While The Carmichael Show seemed somewhat fair and balanced at the beginning of the season, it has definitely taken a hard left turn.

The man and the woman were dressed as the Joker and Harley Quinn. Dale Ewins, 35, was shot in the stomach by police. Authorities said they shot him because he pointed his toy gun at them and they believed it was a real weapon. However, club security said Ewins did not aim the gun at them. Zita Sukys, 37, was shot in the leg. Both were attending the Saints & Sinners Ball, described as a party “for Australian swingers and those who are just curious.” Promotions for the party also said it has “a well-earned reputation as Australia’s, if not the world’s, raunchiest party.” Read: Pulse Nightclub Shooting 1st Anniversary: 10 Quick Facts About Orlando Mass Shooting Ewins was rushed to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with critical injuries, but he was later stabilized.  He was Tasered by police after they shot him, according to The Age Sunday. Sukys, who obtained a less serious injury, was taken to The Alfred Hospital. About 40 armed police officers from the Critical Incident Response Team entered the club at around 3 a.m. Saturday. At the time police entered the nightclub, Ewins and Sukys were in the middle of a sexual act in front of other party attendees, a witness told The Age. “Venue staff have stated the male victim was not holding anything in his hand but rather he was in a compromising position with his female partner, which is a normal activity with the nature of this event,” Martha Tsamis, owner of the Inflation nightclub, said on Facebook. “Participants are generally older adults who come in costume and engage with each other in adult fantasies.” “These events have been held for approximately 20 years at Inflation without any incident.” she added. Tsamis' post echoed part of the event description written on its website, which reads as follows: “Saints & Sinners invites fun couples who agree to the terms and conditions of an adult event, keeping in mind many of our guests are sexually uninhibited. This includes dressing in erotic outfits and accepting what happens on the night as adult fun!” Bar employees said to the Herald Sun that both of the people shot were innocent and emphasized that Ewins had a toy gun, not a real weapon.

120,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/24/republican-mo-brooks-virginia-shooting-gun-rights-campaign-ad,"Alabama representative Mo Brooks’ campaign ad uses clips of him talking to reporters in the aftermath of the shooting and derides the ‘liberal media’ Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST A Republican congressman is using his experience as a survivor of last month’s mass shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, in a campaign ad.  The Louisiana representative Steve Scalise was wounded in the shooting, as were two Capitol police officers and a congressional staffer. Scalise, seriously hurt, dragged himself across the baseball field, leaving a “trail of blood”. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Alabama representative Mo Brooks described crouching on the ground with other politicians and using his belt as a tourniquet to help the congressional staffer. “There’s gunfire within about five, six, seven feet of my head,” Brooks told CNN. “There were some congressmen on phones screaming for reinforcements. Seemed like a long time, and we weren’t even hearing sirens from local police officers, which tells me they probably did not yet know what was going on.” The 30-second campaign ad, released on Monday, is designed to show voters that Brooks has an unflinching commitment to protecting gun rights. It touts his effort to help the wounded, contains audio of shots being fired and refers to the gunman, James “Tom” Hodgkinson, as a “Bernie Sanders supporter” who “fires on Republican congressmen”. The ad uses several clips of Brooks talking to reporters in the aftermath of the Alexandria shooting and derides the “liberal media” for asking the congressman if being the target of a mass shooting had “changed your views on the gun situation in America”. “The second amendment right to bear arms is to help ensure that we always have a republic,” Brooks says. “So no, I’m not changing my position on any of the rights we enjoy as Americans.” Many of the Republican lawmakers on the baseball field were gun rights supporters, and some had A-ratings from the National Rifle Association. Brooks’s swift reiteration of his support was echoed by other survivors, who made clear that even a mass shooting that left the Republican House whip in intensive care would not change the terms of the gun debate. Brooks subsequently introduced legislation that would allow members of Congress “to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in America except the US Capitol or when in the presence of the president or vice-president”. More guns would have helped end the shooting he experienced sooner, he argued. He also noted that the gunman had possessed what he called “a handwritten assassination list” that included Brooks’s name and office number. Republican lawmakers have often posed with guns or shown footage of themselves shooting in campaign ads meant to appeal to their conservative base. Brooks is part of a crowded field of Republicans vying to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now serving Donald Trump’s “beleaguered” attorney general. The special election primary will be held on 15 August.

122,http://hotair.com/archives/2017/06/28/showdown-sarah-palin-vs-new-york-times/,"This should be interesting. The New York Post is reporting that Sarah Palin has filed a defamation lawsuit against their chief competitor, the New York Times, over their ill-conceived and repeatedly “edited” article which seemed to place at least part of the blame for the baseball practice shooting on Palin’s “political rhetoric” from 2011. Yes, folks. The fur is about to fly. Former Governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is suing the New York Times for defamation over a recent editorial tying one of her political action committee ads to a 2011 mass shooting that severely wounded Arizona Democrat Gabby Giffords and killed six people, including a 9-year-old girl​, The Post has learned​. The Manhattan federal court lawsuit, filed Tuesday by lawyers Kenneth Turkel, Shane Vogt and S. Preston Ricardo, accuse​s​ the Gray Lady of having “violated the law and its own policies” when it accused her — in a “fabricated story” — of inciting the 2011 attack by Jared Lee Loughner. Palin, who emerged on ​​the national political scene as running mate to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, is seeking damages in an amount to be determined by a jury at trial. For their part, the Gray Lady is saying that they “haven’t reviewed the claim yet” but will defend themselves vigorously. That process clearly begins with their own coverage of the lawsuit, in which they point out repeatedly that they have owned up to their “mistakes” and apologized. (New York Times) The Times later issued a correction, saying that there was no established link between political statements and the shooting and that the map circulated by Ms. Palin’s PAC had depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath the stylized cross hairs. The NYT Opinion Twitter account also sent out the correction about the lack of a link, apologizing and saying that it appreciated that readers had pointed out the mistake. Yet again, that’s a statement which is sort of, kind of true, but doesn’t really tell the whole story. Yes, they made corrections (plural, which I’ll get to in a moment) and they did issue an apology, but it was never an apology for the obvious implication which essentially accused Palin of inciting murder. They simply apologized for “getting their facts wrong” about the map in question and only partially for the allegation of connections between the map and the shooter. Normally it’s tough to sue a newspaper for defamation over something their board publishes in an editorial (which is an opinion piece by definition as opposed to a news item) but this case may be different. First of all, as already mentioned, it wasn’t a single error. It was multiple errors and multiple corrections. And even then, as John Sexton reported at the time, they may have torpedoed their own defense by sending out James Bennet, their editorial page editor, to insist that the errors didn’t undercut their underlying argument. In a statement provided to CNN by a spokesperson, James Bennet, the Times’ editorial page editor, thanked CNN for calling the error to their attention. Of the larger issue with the editorial, he said, “While it’s always agonizing to get something wrong we appreciate it when our readers call us out like this. We made an error of fact in the editorial, and we’ve corrected it. But that error doesn’t undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.” If the “error of fact” (which is Bennet’s term, not mine) does not “undercut or weaken the argument of the piece” then what would that tell a jury hearing the case? The primary argument they were putting forward was that the climate of rhetorical hate and violence could be plotted in a direct line to both the Giffords and Scalise shootings. And the example they chose to cite was Sarah Palin. When they made their second edit about the link between the map and the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, all they said was that, “no such link was established.” That obviously leaves some wiggle room in the minds of the readers, as if to say, we couldn’t prove there was a link, but we couldn’t disprove it either. In fact, as has been widely reported, Loughner had been fixated on and chasing after Giffords for years before Sarah Palin came on the scene and he made no mention of the map or anything else to do with Palin. That wasn’t made at all clear in the correction or the apology, such as it was. With all that in mind, what do you think? Palin just might have a case here. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

""Dozens of people were wounded by gunfire at a nightclub early Saturday morning in downtown Arkansas,"" the Times wrote on Twitter.  The crime the news outlet was referring to happened early Saturday morning in downtown Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas. According to CNN, 25 people were shot during a shootout at a club in Little Rock early Saturday morning. As of Sunday morning, none of the people who were shot died of their injuries. Police believe the mass shooting is a result of rampant gang violence in the area, not terrorism. The shooting happened during a concert and police believe a dispute started the violence. Police have so far made two arrests in the incident, according to Fox News. Needless to say, many Twitter users mercilessly mocked the Times when they caught the Twitter error:  If @nytimes had copy editors, they would know that Arkansas is a state, not a city. #flyoverCountry https://t.co/VvQmZQQtbF   DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKANSAS DOWNTOWN ARKAN   😂😂 editing with such high standards @ #NYTimes   ""Downtown Arkansas"", . . . near the corner of Oklahoma and Texas!   Arkansas is a state, and therefore doesn't have a downtown. #journalism   ""Downtown Arkansas""? Perhaps you should rethink the plan to eliminate copy editors?   downtown Arkansas lmao   Maybe the Times let a few too many editors go. Someone could have Googled to find that Arkansas is a state, not a city. #journalism   WANTED: Copy Editor. Grasp of U.S. geography not necessary. Must bring own red marker. Job location: downtown USA. #NYTimes #Arkansas   We have more than one city in case you're wondering   Downtown Arkansas?  I'm in downtown Texas  Ironically, the error comes as the Times just laid of dozens of editors who worked as copy editors at the Times. A copy editor's job is to edit copy — whether it's part of a news report or otherwise — for spelling, grammar, style, usage, correct misleading or inaccurate information, check sources and clarify wording. They are also tasked with looking out for libel and help a publication fact check. Often times, they are the last person to edit copy before it heads out for publication and are considered ""safety nets"" in journalism. The Times, in eliminating it's copy desk, will layoff about four dozen journalists. The desk included about 100 copy editors. They have been encouraged to apply for about 50 new available positions, according to the Washington Post. The sudden lay offs led to hundreds of Times employees staging a walk out and protest last week.

124,http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/nc-man-attempts-isis-terror-attack-more-sinister-2016-orlando-shooting-gets,"A North Carolina man who converted to Islam was sentenced to life imprisonment Tuesday for attempting ISIS terrorist attacks, which the sentencing court deemed “more sinister” than the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history – the 2016 terrorist attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Justin Nojan Sullivan, 21, of Morganton, North Carolina, was sentenced after pleading guilty to attempting to commit an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, in support of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). According to the Justice Department’s announcement of the sentencing and the initial indictment, Sullivan: “Sullivan is a convicted terrorist who plotted with now-deceased Syria-based terrorist Junaid Hussain to execute acts of mass violence in the United States in the name of ISIS” said Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana J. Boente in a statement following the sentencing. Boente said Sullivan planned to kill, and inflict “maximum pain” on, as many people as possible: “Sullivan was actively planning the mass killing of innocent people with an attack designed to inflict maximum casualties and maximum pain in the name of ISIS, a sworn enemy of our nation. “Sullivan’s allegiance to ISIS did not stop there. He also planned to film and send a video of his deadly attack to now-deceased Junaid Hussain, a prominent ISIS member based in Syria, and further expressed his wish to create a new branch of the so-called Islamic State in the United States.” According to the indictment, after Sullivan converted to Islam in 2014, he began to watch “violent ISIL acts on the Internet” and destroy his parents’ religious items: “No later than September 2014, SULLIVAN converted to Islam and began watching violent ISIL acts on the Internet, such as beheadings. SULLIVAN openly expressed support for ISIL in his home and destroyed religious items that belonged to SULLIVAN's parents.” Sullivan even tried to bribe an undercover FBI employee (UCE) to kill his parents after they discovered a silencer for one of the guns he planned to use in his attacks: “On or about June 19, 2015, the silencer, which was built according to Sullivan’s instructions, was delivered to him at his home in North Carolina, where Sullivan’s mother opened the package. Sullivan took the silencer from his mother and hid it in a crawl space under his house. When Sullivan’s parents questioned him about the silencer, Sullivan, believing that his parents would interfere with his plans to carry out an attack, offered to compensate the UCE to kill them.” According to the indictment, Sullivan had previously murdered a 74 year old neighbor in 2014: “On or about December 17 and 18, 2014, SULLIVAN was in possession of a stolen .22 caliber Marlin Model 60W rifle (the "".22 Marlin""). SULLIVAN used the stolen firearm that day to murder his neighbor, 74 year old John Bailey Clark (""Mr. Clark""), in Mr. Clark's home, a few houses down from SULLIVAN's residence. SULLIVAN hid the stolen firearm, a black ski mask, muddy clothes and lock pick kit in a crawl space in the home he shared with his parents.” In announcing the sentencing, the Justice Department said that the court deemed Sullivan’s terrorist plot “similar to the Orlando nightclub attack” – but, even “more sinister” in its design: “The Court noted that Sullivan’s plan to murder innocent civilians at a social gathering was similar to the Orlando nightclub attack in 2016. According to the Court, Sullivan’s plan, however, was more sinister because he planned to use stealth – including a mask to hide his identity and a silencer to kill as many as possible, with the hope to escape and kill again. The Court found that Sullivan’s offense was cold and calculating.” The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael E. Savage of the Western District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Gregory R. Gonzalez of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.  Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com.

125,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/29/black-man-takes-mississippi-flag-to-supreme-court/,"(Photo credit: PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP/Getty Images) A black Mississippi man who thinks the state flag symbolizes white supremacy is taking his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the Associated Press. Carlos Moore argues in a claim filed Wednesday that lower courts should not have dismissed his lawsuit that purports the flag to be “state-sanctioned hate speech” and wants to symbol removed. He also claims the flag violates his constitutional right to equal protection. Because the suit failed to show identifiable legal injury, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi Carlton Reeves, also African-American, rejected Moore’s argument without ruling on its merits. Nevertheless, Judge Reeves dedicated nine pages of his decision to explaining how he agreed that the Confederate flag had a connection to efforts by white supremacists in the Deep South to maintain racial segregation in the years leading up to Mississippi’s adoption of the flag, which has a Confederate emblem in the upper left quarter. Mississippi has used its current flag since 1894. Of all 50 states, Mississippi is the only one to still use Confederate symbolism on its flag. Several cities and towns, as well as all eight of the state’s public universities, have stopped flying the flag due to concerns that it is offensive to the state’s black population. Removal of the flag came after the 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, that resulted in the death of nine black worshipers at the hands of a white supremacist. The shooter had previously posted images of him posing with a Confederate flag online. Should the Supreme Court decide to take the lawsuit, a decision in favor of Moore could mean the banning of all official use of Confederate imagery across the country. It will not be until at least October before the Supreme Court addresses the case. Follow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Neither happened. Garrett, 22, of Andrews, Indiana was shot multiple times in a mass shooting at the Colerain Township home of her cousin late Saturday night. Garrett was gunned down just feet from her husband, Bryan, and their two young children. In addition to the Garretts, five other people - including another child - were wounded. Police said the ages of the injured children were 8, 6, 2. Authorities, who announced a $10,000 anonymous reward for information Wednesday, continued to ask the public for tips to help them piece together a motive and determine suspects. ""We are devastated. We are beyond devastated. We just can't believe this happened,"" said David Moyer, Garrett's supervisor at M & S Industrial Metal Fabricators, Inc. in Huntington, Indiana. ""All she ever talked about was her family. Her husband and her two little ones."" Bryan Garrett was shot in the eye and remained hospitalized at University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was expected to undergo additional surgery for his injuries, Moyer said. It remained unclear if their two children were still hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center with the third child who was shot. The family established a GoFundMe page to help with the medical bills, he said. It has raised nearly $3,000 of the $5,000 goal. More: Joe Deters: Colerain Township mass shooting could be a capital murder case ""Going after adults is one thing, but going after kids? It takes a real evil person to go after kids,'' said Moyer who said he was asked to speak on behalf of her family. Two gunmen, both armed with handguns walked into the living room of the house in the 9900 block of Capstan Drive at 11:21 p.m. and opened fire, police have said. Authorities do not have a clear description of the men. Callers to 911 only said they were both wearing hoodie sweatshirts and left the modest, single-story home on foot. It remained unclear if the house or any of its occupants were targeted. Earlier Saturday, friends and family had gathered at the home to celebrate the pregnancy of the homeowner and that she was going to give birth to a baby boy. About a dozen stayed behind, many with their children, to watch a Spider-man movie. They had just turned out the lights and started watching the movie when the shooting broke out. The pregnant woman lost the fetus after the shooting, a family member said. Garrett and the homeowner were cousins, Moyer said. ""She had one of those electric smiles, y'know? The kind of smile everyone looked forward to. That's the way she was here and that's the way she was everywhere,'' Moyer said.  Moyer, who had talked with Bryan Garrett on Thursday about working at the factory as well, said most of the company plans to attend her memorial and funeral services. But he's not sure when that will be. ""I think they are waiting on Bryan,'' he said, adding that he doesn't believe their children know of their mom's death as of yet. ""I think they are waiting for him to tell them in his own way. Until then, her co-workers put up a small memorial near the area she worked. ""You will always be loved,'' the poster says with a picture of her wide smile. ""But never forgotten.""

127,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/3/1649509/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Newtown-and-America-revisited,"LA Times editorial: It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe.” Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck. Like millions of other Americans, we clung to a slim hope that the new president would turn out to be all noise and bluster, or that the people around him in the White House would act as a check on his worst instincts, or that he would be sobered and transformed by the awesome responsibilities of office. Instead, seventy-some days in — and with about 1,400 to go before his term is completed — it is increasingly clear that those hopes were misplaced. We warned you, but you didn’t listen. Leonard Pitts Jr/Miami Harald: Believe it or not, the media owe Trump a debt of gratitude The culprit, of course, is our handling of the unconventional candidate who became president. Among our sins: failure to take him seriously enough early enough; relying too heavily on flawed polling; spending more time covering personality than policy, providing him untold hours of free advertising on certain cable news networks, and not even requiring him to show up in person to collect it. Perhaps most critically, we embraced a false equivalence. We behaved as if Hillary Clinton’s shifting explanations for the use of a private email server — troubling though they were — were somehow as ominous and potentially consequential as Donald Trump’s mendacity, crudeness, incompetence, and overall unfitness. In our defense, though, we had never seen anything like him and had no idea how to cover him. Going on three months into his presidency, we are still figuring it out. But there is reason to be encouraged. Tom Nichols/Daily Beast with an excerpt from his book: America's Cult of Ignorance—And the Death of Expertise In the early ’90s, a small group of “AIDS denialists,” including a University of California professor named Peter Duesberg, argued against virtually the entire medical establishment’s consensus that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the cause of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Science thrives on such counterintuitive challenges, but there was no evidence for Duesberg’s beliefs, which turned out to be baseless. Once researchers found HIV, doctors and public health officials were able to save countless lives through measures aimed at preventing its transmission. The Duesberg business might have ended as just another quirky theory defeated by research. The history of science is littered with such dead ends. In this case, however, a discredited idea nonetheless managed to capture the attention of a national leader, with deadly results. Thabo Mbeki, then the president of South Africa, seized on the idea that AIDS was caused not by a virus but by other factors, such as malnourishment and poor health, and so he rejected offers of drugs and other forms of assistance to combat HIV infection in South Africa. By the mid-2000s, his government relented, but not before Mbeki’s fixation on AIDS denialism ended up costing, by the estimates of doctors at the Harvard School of Public Health, well over three hundred thousand lives and the births of some thirty-five thousand HIV-positive children whose infections could have been avoided. Mbeki, to this day, thinks he was on to something. Many Americans might scoff at this kind of ignorance, but they shouldn’t be too confident in their own abilities.

It started with the Boston marathon bombing, four years ago. University of Washington professor Kate Starbird was sifting through thousands of tweets sent in the aftermath and noticed something strange. Too strange for a university professor to take seriously. Same thing after the mass shooting that killed nine at Umpqua Community College in Oregon: a burst of social-media activity calling the massacre a fake, a stage play by “crisis actors” for political purposes. “After every mass shooting, dozens of them, there would be these strange clusters of activity,” Starbird says. “It was so fringe we kind of laughed at it. “That was a terrible mistake. We should have been studying it.” Starbird is in the field of “crisis informatics,” or how information flows after a disaster. She got into it to see how social media might be used for the public good, such as to aid emergency responders.

On Thursday morning, as Ryan was scoffing at the notion of bipartisanship, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia was casting his first vote in six weeks across the Capitol. Battling Parkinson’s disease and recovering from two back surgeries, he appeared on the Senate floor with the help of a walker and gave Republicans their 50th vote for a measure that would kill an Obama administration rule prohibiting states from blocking federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood. Two GOP senators supportive of Planned Parenthood, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had already voted no on the bill, and Vice President Mike Pence was waiting for Isakson so he could cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of the resolution. It was an unfortunate picture of the Republican congressional majority at the moment—slim and halting, and much shakier than it once seemed.

He isn’t winning many legislative battles—but neither is he losing the battles that count most for him. His tax returns remain secret, and so for the most part do the details of his campaign’s Russian connections. As embarrassing as it is that the health bill collapsed, it would have been far worse for him politically had it passed. It remains always possible for a president to regain the initiative. In Trump’s case, that initiative is found in battles over trade and immigration: the issues that won him the Republican nomination and that his base inside the party cares about most. He doesn’t even need to win. He just needs to be seen to fight.

It concerns the White House’s competence—or lack thereof. Ten weeks ago, when Trump stormed into office attacking the media and promising a blitzkrieg of new policies and initiatives during his first hundred days, the dominant emotion among people who hadn’t voted for him was fear. Many commentators, myself included, warned about the dangers of democratic erosion, and sales of George Orwell’s “1984” soared. Today, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned about Trump and his illiberalism. The White House’s recent decision to dismantle President Obama’s clean-air regulations offers fresh testament to the malevolence of the Trump Administration’s agenda, and next week’s meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s President, will be a reminder of the enormous responsibilities that rest on a President’s shoulders. But, even among ardent Trumpophobes, fear and foreboding have been supplemented by wonderment at the White House’s string of gaffes. These days, instead of Big Brother, it often looks like the Keystone Kops are in charge.  Whites best-off but most pessimistic about the future. https://t.co/gH4KwmALvS  Josh Kraushaar/National Journal: The Re­pub­lic­an Party is now split in­to three fac­tions—prag­mat­ists, Trumpi­an pop­u­lists, and hard-right max­im­al­ists un­will­ing to make the com­prom­ises ne­ces­sary to gov­ern ef­fect­ively. As pres­id­ent, Trump could have been the glue hold­ing the party’s war­ring groups to­geth­er, by em­bra­cing ele­ments of con­ser­vat­ive or­tho­doxy while for­cing con­ces­sions on oth­er is­sues im­port­ant to him. But Trump has little in­terest in the art of gov­ern­ing; he craves per­son­ally-ful­filling polit­ic­al vic­tor­ies. Per­haps if the pres­id­ent had fo­cused more on selling health care re­form or bet­ter un­der­stood the de­tails of the le­gis­la­tion, the con­ser­vat­ive mem­bers would have felt more pres­sure to play team ball. In­stead, they now hold out­sized lever­age after scut­tling a long-stand­ing party pri­or­ity. What’s sur­pris­ing is that Trump pub­licly turned on his one­time al­lies on Twit­ter. “The Free­dom Caucus will hurt the en­tire Re­pub­lic­an agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them… in 2018,” he wrote. Even as many of his sup­port­ers were in­clined to lay blame for the bill’s fail­ure on Ry­an, Trump picked a fight with his base—and he’s los­ing. His threat to ne­go­ti­ate with Demo­crats also fell on deaf ears.

New na­tion­al polls show Trump los­ing a little sup­port from the GOP base, which is a prob­lem giv­en his rock-bot­tom rat­ings with per­suad­able voters. Trump now needs the Free­dom Caucus more than it needs him. This is what hap­pens when a pres­id­ent faces sag­ging ap­prov­al rat­ings, low staff mor­ale, and the shad­ow of scan­dal only two months in­to his ad­min­is­tra­tion.

128,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/police-25-shot-at-little-rock-nightclub,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Police say 25 people were shot after gunfire rang out Saturday at a rap show at a downtown Little Rock nightclub, prompting pleas from top leaders to curb the growing violence in Arkansas’ capital city. Police said the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge was the result of a dispute among clubgoers and not an active shooter or terror-related incident. Little Rock police said Saturday that 25 people were shot and three others suffered unrelated injuries. All were expected to survive, police said. Police early Saturday cordoned off the block as crime-scene technicians gathered evidence from inside and outside the club. Glass from the club’s second story windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters that “some sort of dispute broke out between people inside” the club and that there are “probably multiple shooting suspects.” A video posted online by a club patron, Darryl Rankin, showed a packed house for Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tennessee. About a half-minute into a break in the raucous concert, several bursts of gunfire rang out — more than 24 shots in an 11-second period. Rankin told The Associated Press that he was recording the show on Facebook Live when gunfire erupted and that one of his friends is now at a hospital with a bullet “stuck in his spine.” The shooting follows a week in which there have been about a dozen drive-by shootings in Little Rock, though there’s no indication the events are linked. “Little Rock’s crime problem appears to be intensifying,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “Every few days it seems a high profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning’s event. I have spoken this morning with Mayor Stodola and I have offered both my heart felt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community.” Early Saturday, Raida Bunche waited outside the club after she had heard from a friend that her son had been at the club. Later Saturday morning, she said she found out her son ran out once the shooting began and was unharmed. “I’m sick of all the killing and I’m tired of all the shooting, the kids getting hurt,” Bunche said. The club’s Facebook page promoted Friday night’s show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appears to be a gun at the camera. A call to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes’ booking agent wasn’t immediately returned Saturday. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said on Facebook that more information would be released at a news conference Saturday afternoon. “My heart is broken this morning — my prayers are with the victims of this tragedy,” he wrote. He went on to add, “We are committed to doing everything possible to bring safety to our city. We need everyone to help.” In May, one person was killed and six people were hurt in a mass shooting at a downtown concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Little Rock. In that case, two men were charged with first-degree murder and six counts of first-degree battery. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the nightclub to Power Ultra Lounge instead of Power Lounge and to correct spelling of mother’s name who waited outside club to Raida Bunche.

129,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/6/15/1671990/-Chuck-Todd-scolded-Americans-for-toxicity-he-and-media-responsible-for,"Once again Chuck Todd created a narrative of false equivalence as he not only equally blamed Democrats and Republicans for the toxicity in our politics, he accused the American citizens. Sadly he forgot that the media is the biggest drug pusher that made both the politicians and the citizens addicts. On a day when the ills of this country culminated in many shootings with a common thread, Chuck Todd chose a misplaced lecture. Todd starts his rant in this excerpted video by saying that we have been in a tinderbox of escalating rhetoric. He then explained what happened today. The gunman, a man, purported to be a Bernie Sanders supporter, asked if it was Republicans practicing on the field. He proceeded to shoot up the field. The gunman shot Majority Whip Steve Scalise in the hip. He hit two other staffers as well as two police officers. The gunman, James Hodgkinson, was then shot likely by the Majority Whip's security detail. Todd pointed out that both parties pleaded for unity. He then wondered if it is too little too late. ""Partisans from both sides are trying to make the shooting a referendum on the other party's viciousness,"" Chuck Todd said. ""What does that say about party leadership. Some supporters of Democrats are trying to pin this on President Trump or the Republican Party's stance on gun control rights. And some Republicans are trying to blame it on hostility on the Left. Folks some would want to blame the Left or the Right or us in the media. But here is who it seems too many folks don't want to blame, themselves. We are all to blame. This toxic stew that passes for political discourse seems beyond repair in the current moment. Just look at social media. For too long our collective politics is 'demonize the other side' for caustic behavior while rationalizing that same behavior when it comes to someone who shares their politics. We ought to borrow another phrase that we are all asked to do. When you see something, say something."" Unfortunately, Todd must be living in a different dimension. Democrats must justifiably use the mass shooting of Scalise and others as well as the mass shooting in San Francisco today as a referendum on Republican gun control policy in the aggregate.  The numbers have been out for some time. Our gun culture kills. And the media giving credence to anyone arguing for an armed society like ours without accepting responsibility for massacres as occurred today is a dereliction of duty. Chuck, not once, pointed out that candidate Trump was instrumental in fomenting violence day in and day out. He made the false statement that each side supports those who misbehave on their side. I doubt Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher would agree. As far as demonizing the other side, if Todd were honest, he would realize that the demonization is not balanced. The Right does it a lot better especially with the help of the media. Todd's last statement should irk everyone. ""We ought to borrow another phrase that we are all asked to do. When you see something, say something."" Are you kidding me? Where was that resolve during the Obamacare debate? Where was that action when they gave Trump free airtime to promote the obvious fallacy of birthirism? One could go on and on. Chuck Todd is presumptuous in scolding Americans about their behavior. He and his media ilk like drug pushers allowed the addiction to misinformation to explode as they allowed themselves to be conduits of misinformation and false balances. Chuck, the fingers are all pointing at you. Clean up your act before all is lost.",2017-07-07 08:00:00,Chuck Todd scolded Americans for toxicity he and media responsible for,,115,http://www.dailykos.com
130,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/klltBW-HwWY/the-carmichael-show-the-mass-shooting-episode-everyone-needs-to-see,"SEARCH NBC pulled a ‘Carmichael Show’ episode that would’ve aired the same night a shooter opened fire at a congressional softball practice. Boy, were they wrong. Senior Entertainment Reporter Last week, NBC made the decision to pull an episode of The Carmichael Show, titled “Shoot-Up-Able,” from its schedule. The episode finds its lead character, Jerrod, reeling after surviving a mass shooting. The network felt that airing the episode the same night as a gunman opened fire at a congressional softball practice in Virginia would be insensitive. The network finally aired the episode Wednesday night, and, wow, were they wrong to pull it in the first place. The episode starts with Jerrod, played Seinfeld-style by series co-creator and star Jerrod Carmichael, arriving home after just surviving a mass shooting at a mall. (Proving just how timely the show tends to be, Jerrod’s girlfriend, Maxine, is singing “Waving Through the Window” from Dear Evan Hansen when Jerrod interrupts her to tell her about the mass shooting. The acclaimed Broadway show won the best new musical Tony Award the same week “Shoot-Up-Able” would have aired.) At first, he tries to dismiss the entire experience as something that just happens when you live somewhere that is “shoot-up-able,” and refuses to engage in a serious conversation about it. Family members who heard about the shooting are in histrionics over the thought that he could have been a victim. But Jerrod, wearing an armor of recent trauma, mocks it all as overreaction. Stereotypes about mass shooters and domestic terrorists follow. Jabs at the National Rifle Association, too. Jerrod takes the piss out of people’s tendencies to make others’ near-death experiences all about themselves. “I know being a victim is real sexy right now…” Jerrod gripes, explaining that he doesn’t want his identity defined by this. The show is hysterical, like a modern-day All in the Family. Carmichael and especially Loretta Devine and David Alan Grier as his parents make certain of that. But as the episode evolves and breaks through the wall Jerrod puts up, he grapples with the label “victim” and “survivor,” and the impact of what he witnessed. As Jerrod sobers up to the reality of what just happened, so does the show. It’s incredibly poignant, and, even through the prism of a laugh-tracked multicam sitcom, maybe one of the most important episodes about processing a mass shooting TV has produced. Because of that, Carmichael wasn’t happy that NBC pulled the episode last week, appearing on Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show that night to talk about it. “I thought that tonight’s episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way,” he said. “It really lends itself to conversation. When things like this happen, and someone wants to talk about in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say ‘too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? These things happen constantly.” More, airing it right after the congressional shooting would have gotten the episode the attention it deserved—and, more importantly, that audiences deserved: “We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we possibly could.

It does a disservice to all of us.” The Carmichael Show won critical respect after its quiet NBC debut for how vibrantly and urgently it carries on “the Norman Lear tradition,” stoking cultural debate, provoking us to confront our own biases and judgments, and proving that pop culture can be responsible for sociopolitical change.

In 2015, the hotly anticipated Season One finale of Mr. Robot was moved a week out of respect for victims of the horrifying on-camera shooting of a news reporter and cameraman, as the episode featured a graphic scene similar in nature to the murders.

Sometimes the shootings are dealt with sensitively. Sometimes they’re a ratings-grab. It’s perhaps not hard to imagine why there’s an eagerness to script them into these TV shows.

But as mass shootings become more and more prevalent—there have been over 150 thus far in 2017, according to the Gun Violence Archive—the question shouldn’t be whether airing them too close to an actual tragedy is triggering. Rather, it should be whether the sheer number of fictionalized shootings may be irresponsibly fetishizing gun violence for entertainment.

131,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-carmichael-show-the-mass-shooting-episode-everyone-needs-to-see,"SEARCH NBC pulled a ‘Carmichael Show’ episode that would’ve aired the same night a shooter opened fire at a congressional softball practice. Boy, were they wrong. Senior Entertainment Reporter Last week, NBC made the decision to pull an episode of The Carmichael Show, titled “Shoot-Up-Able,” from its schedule. The episode finds its lead character, Jerrod, reeling after surviving a mass shooting. The network felt that airing the episode the same night as a gunman opened fire at a congressional softball practice in Virginia would be insensitive. The network finally aired the episode Wednesday night, and, wow, were they wrong to pull it in the first place. The episode starts with Jerrod, played Seinfeld-style by series co-creator and star Jerrod Carmichael, arriving home after just surviving a mass shooting at a mall. (Proving just how timely the show tends to be, Jerrod’s girlfriend, Maxine, is singing “Waving Through the Window” from Dear Evan Hansen when Jerrod interrupts her to tell her about the mass shooting. The acclaimed Broadway show won the best new musical Tony Award the same week “Shoot-Up-Able” would have aired.) At first, he tries to dismiss the entire experience as something that just happens when you live somewhere that is “shoot-up-able,” and refuses to engage in a serious conversation about it. Family members who heard about the shooting are in histrionics over the thought that he could have been a victim. But Jerrod, wearing an armor of recent trauma, mocks it all as overreaction. Stereotypes about mass shooters and domestic terrorists follow. Jabs at the National Rifle Association, too. Jerrod takes the piss out of people’s tendencies to make others’ near-death experiences all about themselves. “I know being a victim is real sexy right now…” Jerrod gripes, explaining that he doesn’t want his identity defined by this. The show is hysterical, like a modern-day All in the Family. Carmichael and especially Loretta Devine and David Alan Grier as his parents make certain of that. But as the episode evolves and breaks through the wall Jerrod puts up, he grapples with the label “victim” and “survivor,” and the impact of what he witnessed. As Jerrod sobers up to the reality of what just happened, so does the show. It’s incredibly poignant, and, even through the prism of a laugh-tracked multicam sitcom, maybe one of the most important episodes about processing a mass shooting TV has produced. Because of that, Carmichael wasn’t happy that NBC pulled the episode last week, appearing on Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show that night to talk about it. “I thought that tonight’s episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way,” he said. “It really lends itself to conversation. When things like this happen, and someone wants to talk about in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say ‘too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? These things happen constantly.” More, airing it right after the congressional shooting would have gotten the episode the attention it deserved—and, more importantly, that audiences deserved: “We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we possibly could. But to pull that is criminal. It seems to do a disservice to the viewers. It does a disservice to all of us.” The Carmichael Show won critical respect after its quiet NBC debut for how vibrantly and urgently it carries on “the Norman Lear tradition,” stoking cultural debate, provoking us to confront our own biases and judgments, and proving that pop culture can be responsible for sociopolitical change.

132,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/28/of-caesar-guns-and-trolls-the-evil-that-men-do_partner/,"This piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com. Over in New York’s Central Park, just a short distance from our offices, the curtain came down last week on The Public Theater’s controversial production of Shakespeare’s ""Julius Caesar"". Controversial because the actor playing the assassinated Caesar looked and sounded like Donald Trump, right down to the overlong red necktie and clownish orange-blond nimbus of hair. But the curtain didn’t fall because of the outrage that came tumbling from the right — including protesters heckling at a couple of the performances and death threats directed at the production’s director (not to mention feverish tweets and emails from confused trolls hurled at any theatre company with the word “Shakespeare” in its name). Nor did it occur because two of The Public Theatre’s corporate donors, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines, pulled their sponsorship of the show, a gutless move of appeasement from two businesses, banking and air travel, so well known these days for their dazzling records of customer satisfaction. (Another company, American Express, didn’t yank its cash from The Public but tweeted that its money doesn’t fund Shakespeare in the Park “nor do we condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play.”) No, the fact is, ""Julius Caesar"" always was scheduled to end the night that it did. That was to make way for the summer’s second Shakespeare in the Park production — ""A Midsummer Night’s Dream."" Gentle readers will recall that this is the Shakespeare play in which, among a great many other things, a knavish sprite named Puck turns a man into an ass. Such an act once seemed like magic, but given today’s political climate, the turning of men into asses has become the rule rather than the exception. Witness the aforementioned kneejerk reaction of the right, so quick to accuse the left of behaving like snowflakes but themselves so hypersensitive to even the mildest heat that they melt as fast as Frosty the Snowman — that is, if he was a whiny Fox or talk radio host instead of a jolly happy soul. We’ve established before that this is not a crowd that embraces a thoroughgoing knowledge of history in general, and it’s probably fair to assume a knowledge of theatrical history not at all. Elsewise they might realize that ""Julius Caesar"" is not a play that celebrates political violence but loudly condemns it. In an email, The Public’s artistic director (and director of ""Julius Caesar"") Oskar Eustis wrote: “Those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save. For over 400 years, Shakespeare’s play has told this story and we are proud to be telling it again in Central Park.” Back in the day, Queen Elizabeth I herself recognized that the playwright’s scripts often were thinly veiled depictions of the current political scene in Britain and even of herself. Apparently, she had a thicker skin than the gang at Delta Air Lines or Bank of America — she kept encouraging Shakespeare with money from the royal purse. ""Julius Caesar"" in particular has always been a play lending itself to parallels with contemporary politics. George Washington hosted an amateur production in Philadelphia during the first full year of his presidency. He didn’t seem to take offense. Orson Welles directed and played Brutus in a 1937 staging that drew parallels with the rise of fascism in Europe, even recreating the infamous “Cathedral of Light” at Hitler’s Nuremburg rallies. For the last few years, The Acting Company has been touring the country with a version in which Caesar bears a close resemblance to Barack Obama — no one has protested. And ever since Trump started to dominate the electoral landscape, several productions have used ""Julius Caesar"" as a metaphor for the debilitating illness that pervades our body politic. Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro recently wrote: “As long as politicians resemble Caesar and as long as their opponents seek to justify their overthrow, ‘Julius Caesar’ will continue to matter . . . “It is the mark of a tolerant society that we don’t try to shut down the expression of words or viewpoints that some might find disagreeable, least of all Shakespeare’s, whose works we all share. “We rely on newspapers to learn what is happening in the world. But we turn to productions of Shakespeare to make sense of it.” But none of this stopped the trolls of the right from throwing a major-league hissy about the show, even if very few of them actually attended a performance. Much of the consternation was based on a video of the play’s assassination scene that went viral. Some, Sean Hannity among them, even suggested that the recent wounding of House majority whip Steve Scalise and four others at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, somehow was linked to the production of ""Julius Caesar"". “The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!” screamed one of those who disrupted a performance. And the president’s son, Donald Jr., retweeted conservative commentator Harlan Hill’s comment that the shootings were “EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our president.” This was and is opportunistic sophistry, an attempt to use tragedy to distract by aiming a fallacious attack at “elites” and the left. The production of ""Julius Caesar"" should no more be condemned for its alleged connection to an act of senseless violence than ""The Catcher in the Rye"" should be banned because John Lennon’s assassin Mark David Chapman was obsessed with the book. The attack on Scalise and the others was the act of a deeply disturbed man who had made anti-Trump statements on Facebook and elsewhere. And there’s no denying that it took place in an atmosphere of elevated hate speech from right and left — but face it, mostly from the right — and violence that has only gotten worse since the election, aggravated by the man now president who egged on his supporters at splenetic campaign rallies. But let’s talk about what also really needs discussing. Not just a production of a classic play that offended some, or the unreasoned words and actions of far too many, including men and women in Congress and the White House. Since we’re talking about the freedom to speak out, let’s speak out about guns. For one, given the mental state of the man accused with the Scalise shooting why was he allowed to have weapons? As my colleague Michael Hiltzik at the Los Angeles Times wrote: “In a country with sensible and intelligent firearms laws, there’s no way a person with the history of domestic violence of James Hodgkinson, who has been identified as the shooter, would be permitted anywhere near the weapons he was carrying on June 14 — and which reportedly he obtained legally.” Too soon? Let’s pray for Steve Scalise’s continued recovery but not forget his A+ rating from the National Rifle Association or, say, his opposition to stricter gun laws after 26 died in the Sandy Hook shootings of 2014. Hiltzik noted: “To say Scalise deserves to share blame for this situation is not to say that he deserves the punishment of a grave injury. But nor is this an occasion to ignore the policies he espouses and their relationship to the June 14 event and its aftermath . . . “Among the bills he has cosponsored is the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, a 2011 measure that would have allowed anyone with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry a concealed firearm in any other state that issues concealed firearm permits, regardless of the other states’ standards for issuing those permits. On Jan. 6, 2016, Scalise could be seen on CNN misrepresenting, and then assailing, President Obama’s day-old executive order designed to tighten the rules on background checks of gun buyers.” Counting the Scalise incident, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker, as of June 25, 2017, so far this year there have been 211 mass shootings in the United States. Guns have killed more than 6,800 in America this year; 13,500 have been wounded, according to Chelsea Parsons, vice president of guns and crime policy at the Center for American Progress. In a recent op-ed, Parsons pointed out out the gun fatality rate in this country is 25 times greater than in other high-income countries. And yes, as the argument goes, more people might have died in Alexandria if Scalise had not had armed police protection with him, but they were trained professionals, not the amateurs — including members of Congress — who want to run around with concealed carry permits and handguns wherever they choose. But that’s what the GOP wants. Jonathan Martin reported at The New York Times: “The Republican majorities on Capitol Hill have blocked every attempt to enact significant gun control legislation, most recently after the massacre of 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub last June. Measures to block people on the federal terrorism watch list from buying weapons and to close background-check loopholes failed in the Senate. “And that was before President Trump was elected with far more help from the National Rifle Association than Mitt Romney got in 2012. Mr. Trump received more money from the NRA than any other outside group.” The counterintuitive argument that the answer to guns is more guns is madness. As Marc Antony says in ""Julius Caesar"", during his famous oration at the funeral of the murdered leader, “O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.” Too soon?

Mr. Scalise, a Republican congressman from Louisiana who serves as the majority whip of the House of Representatives, spent the past week in the intensive care unit and underwent surgery for the management of infection, his office said. His condition on Wednesday remained listed as serious. Mr. Scalise, 51, has been hospitalized at MedStar Washington Hospital Center since the shooting on June 14, when a lone gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, 66, opened fire at a practice field in Alexandria, Va. He shot Mr. Scalise and injured three other people, two of them members of Mr. Scalise’s security detail. The congressman has undergone several surgeries since the shooting and spent over a week in the intensive care unit when he was first admitted. He was the most seriously injured of Mr. Hodgkinson’s four victims. He was shot in the hip as he stood at second base and the bullet broke bones, ripped through internal organs and caused major internal bleeding as it moved through his body. Mr. Hodgkinson, who was said to be deeply upset by President Trump’s election, died after a shootout with the police.

134,http://time.com/4965095/mandalay-bay-resort-casino-hotel-las-vegas-shooting/?xid=homepage,"At least 58 people were killed and more than 515 injured after a 64-year-old gunman called Stephen Paddock opened fire from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, across the street from the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip. The death toll makes the assault the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock was found dead in his hotel room when a SWAT team swarmed the room, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday. Police used a controlled explosion to get into the room, where they found at least 10 rifles, authorities said. Audience members at the festival reported seeing flashes of muzzle light coming from the upper floor of the hotel. The hotel released a statement on Twitter Monday morning, in response to the incident. It explained that the Mandalay Bay Resort, along with other hotels in the vicinity, was put on lockdown following orders from the police. Later Monday morning, the hotel tweeted again, this time to let guests know that they could return to their rooms. The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is an iconic 3,211-room hotel which opened in March 1999. It contains more than 135,000 square feet of games, including Poker, Blackjack, Ultimate Texas Hold’em and slot machines. It boasts a wave pool, lazy river and real sand – and a beach club exclusively for guests aged 21 and older. There are also three on-site wedding chapels, as well as a tattoo outlet, a 1,800-seat concert hall (which has seen performances from big names including Billy Idol and Third Eye Blind), a minus five degrees Celsius ice bar, a 38,000-square-foot nightclub and a Michael Jackson-themed visual and audio experience. The hotel is known for its enormous shark reef aquarium, which has more than 2,000 animals on display, including 12 types of shark. The hotel has featured in a number of movies and TV shows, including What Happens in Vegas, Modern Family, The Hangover and Ocean’s Eleven and Thirteen. Janet Jackson is scheduled to perform at the hotel’s events center on Oct. 14 and the Canadian indie rock band, Arcade Fire, is set to perform there on Oct. 22. According to Market Watch, shares in MGM Resorts International — the company which owns the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino — dropped 2.9% in the wake of the shooting.

135,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/furious-gay-rights-advocates-see-trumps-true-colors.html?mcubz=3,"Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — When President Trump was a candidate, he pledged his support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people immediately after the mass shooting last summer at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. “They have been through something that nobody could ever experience,” Mr. Trump said at an event in Manchester, N.H., on June 13, 2016, delivering a hastily drafted speech that was originally intended to be about Hillary Clinton. “Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the L.G.B.T. community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?” he said. “I will tell you who the better friend is, and someday I believe that will be proven out, big-league.” Such proof did not come on Wednesday. But the president’s words were repeated with anger and frustration by a number of gay rights advocates who were angered by Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision to bar transgender people from any military job. “We’re seeing the president’s true colors,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “This is who he is.” The new ban, which Mr. Trump announced on Twitter, startling some of his aides, was at odds with the speech he gave in New Hampshire. The day before, in Orlando, Omar Mateen, a security guard, had killed 49 people and wounded 58 in the name of the Islamic State. That Mr. Mateen was a Muslim and had targeted gay and lesbian clubgoers sent shock waves through two American minority communities that have been marginalized in the United States. “This is a very dark moment in America’s history,” Mr. Trump said that day. “A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.” During his speech at the Republican National Convention the next month, Mr. Trump again recalled the Pulse shooting. He reveled in applause after saying, “I will do everything in my power to protect our L.G.T.B.Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.” “Believe me,” Mr. Trump said during that July 21, 2016, speech. “And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.” On Wednesday, the president’s supporters maintained that his response then spoke to terrorism — a stark contrast from current concerns about military preparedness. Christopher R. Barron, one of the founders of the Republican gay rights group GOProud, which helped give rise to Mr. Trump’s political career by hosting him at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, gave the president the benefit of the doubt. “I defer to the military leaders to determine what policies around the question of trans service best allow them to win the war on radical anti-L.G.B.T. Islamic extremism,” Mr. Barron wrote on Twitter. As a developer in New York, Mr. Trump spent his life in a city with a large gay population. Before his entry to politics, he was open to gay civil unions, and he was known in Palm Beach, Fla., where he owns the Mar-a-Lago resort, as the first private club owner to admit an openly gay couple as members. Since his election, he has remained against gay marriage, the frontier on which the L.G.B.T. fight was waged over the last decade. Mr. Trump’s closest aides say he has never been a social crusader on gay rights issues. But in his first interview as president, Mr. Trump suggested that the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage should remain the law of the land. Early in his presidency, he declined to roll back some of President Barack Obama’s protections for L.G.B.T. people. But Mr. Trump has since ordered that some of those protections be dropped, including through moves that were said to bolster religious liberties but that critics feared would legally foster discrimination against gay Americans. “I think people were hoping against hope that while he was very unpredictable, that he would be a man of his word and that also he would not want to go against the prevailing social norms that we’re used to in New York,” said Richard Socarides, a prominent gay activist and Democrat who used to advise President Bill Clinton. “People thought, this is a guy who knows gay people, who has gay people around him,” said Mr. Socarides, before expressing a broader concern: “If this is allowed to work, he’ll go after gay marriage next.” Mr. Griffin said that hopes that Mr. Trump had a durable connection to the L.G.T.B.Q. community evaporated during the campaign, with his selection of Mike Pence as his running mate.

As the deputy press secretary went off on CNN and the media for what she called a “constant barrage of fake news directed at this president,” Karem interrupted her for a little light reading of the riot act. “Come on!” Karem fumed. “You’re inflaming everybody, right here, right now with those words. This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heavens any one of us are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don’t get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel, or not read us.

Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country.

Steve Scalise was shot by a Bernie Sanders supporter June 14, Democrats came out in droves to repeatedly blame Republicans and President Trump for the “rhetoric” that supposedly caused the attack. That’s right; a left-wing Bernie supporter tried to assassinate a Republican politician and the media’s reaction was to blame the victim. The New York Times took the same approach but also used the opportunity to smear Sarah Palin in an editorial that reminded readers of the Gabby Giffords shooting in 2011. The original New York Times editorial that appeared online the day of the attack and the following morning in the paper’s print edition, had this troubling paragraph: In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. After duly earned backlash, the editorial board offered an apology and correction and retracted the portion from its online version. But the damage was already done. The leading newspaper in the country had resurrected a thoroughly debunked, six-year-old left-wing conspiracy theory that literally blamed Palin for “inciting” an attempted assassination. And apparently she’s not taking the smear lightly. Late Tuesday evening, news broke that Palin was taking on the media giant with a defamation lawsuit. As the Times’ Sydney Ember wrote Wednesday: Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate, filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Company on Tuesday, saying the newspaper had published a statement about her in a recent editorial that it “knew to be false.” In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ms. Palin contends that The Times “violated the law and its own policies” when it linked her in an editorial to a mass shooting in January 2011. As Palin contended, this supposed “connection” was brought up long ago and long ago debunked. The Times had to know this, but attempted to make another dig at Palin with the Scalise shooting and thought they could get away with it. Clearly they were mistaken. This lawsuit comes on the heels of years of blaming Republicans for shootings of any kind. When Giffords was shot by a mentally unstable man in 2011, who if anything had political leanings to the left, the media still blamed Republicans and the Tea Party. After Scalise was shot just two weeks ago, the media again rushed out to blame the right for supposedly “starting it.” On this morning’s broadcasts two of the three networks ignored the lawsuit but CBS This Morning did give a brief to the news.

139,https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/12/apple-to-open-china-data-center-with-government-ties/?source=email,"Trending: By MICHAEL LIEDTKE SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ’ Apple will open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country’s government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information transferred from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers there. The data center announced Wednesday will be located in the Guizhou province and run by a company owned by the Chinese government. Apple is teaming up with the company, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data, to comply with a new Chinese law requiring data-storage providers to keep the information of mainland China customers on computers located within the country. The Guizhou data center will store photos, video, documents and other personal information uploaded to iCloud accounts by Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they’re traveling outside the country. Backups and other data stored in iCloud accounts by customers outside China will continue to be stored in data centers in the U.S. and eventually Denmark. Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, have already made similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country’s Communist government. But Apple’s acquiescence is striking because CEO Tim Cook has made preserving customers’ privacy a company cornerstone. The Cupertino, California, company underscored that commitment last year in a high-profile battle with the U.S. government over a legal demand to crack open the iPhone of a suspected killer in a mass shooting. Apple has a strong incentive to toe the line in China because that country already is its third-largest market behind North America and Europe, with all signs pointing to it become an even bigger profit center. China currently accounts for about 20 percent of Apple’s revenue. Even though it’s working with a government-owned company, Apple sought to reassure customers in China that the arrangement won’t compromise their privacy. “As our customers know, Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems,” the company said in a statement. What’s more, Apple says it will hold to the security keys protecting the data that people routinely back up in iCloud accounts. But experts believe the data center will make it easier for the government to retrieve the information through legal demands or other means. Apple will find it more challenging to resist any order from a Chinese court to give authorities there access to an iCloud account that they want to sift through, predicted Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney specializing in privacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Currently, the Chinese government has to funnel those demands through the U.S. court system, a more difficult process to negotiate. Cardozo recommends that Apple customers in mainland customer turn off the iCloud feature on their iPhones and other devices to protect their information from prying eyes. Data stored on the devices themselves should remain secure as long as they lock them with passwords that only the user knows. Even if the government seizes a device, Apple won’t have the keys to unlock data. But with iCloud, Apple does have the keys. The exception is passwords and credit card data synced with iCloud Keychain. Ajay Arora, CEO of data security specialist Vera, also warns that Apple’s partnership with a company owned by the Chinese government increases the chances that authorities could secretly pry their way into iCloud accounts. “It’s like Apple is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,” Arora said.

More than 58 people were killed and at least 515 people were taken to area hospitals, in the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock was found dead in the hotel room with at least 10 guns, authorities said Monday. Eric Paddock told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he’d never known his brother to have so many guns. “He might have had a gun or two, but he didn’t have a huge stock of guns,” he said. Other family members told the Washington Post that Stephen Paddock, who lived in Mesquite, Nev., spent his retirement traveling to Las Vegas to gamble and attend concerts in area hotels and that nothing in his past would suggest violent behavior. Eric Paddock, who is based in Central Florida, told Reuters that the family was “bewildered” by what happened. “We have no idea. We’re horrified. We’re bewildered and our condolences go out to the victims,” Paddock said. “We have no idea in the world.” Write to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.",2017-07-06 08:00:00,Las Vegas Suspect’s Brother Says Family Is 'Completely Dumbfounded' by Shooting,,4419,http://time.com
142,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/OhFNVEiEZAI/,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Clubgoers screamed and scrambled for cover as dozens of gunshots rang out during a rap concert in downtown Little Rock early Saturday, leaving 28 people injured from an 11-second melee that police quickly said was not related to terrorism. All of the victims were expected to survive the shooting at the Power Ultra Lounge, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the state Capitol building. Police believe the gunfire erupted amid a dispute among clubgoers and that multiple people fired shots. Twenty-five people suffered gunshot wounds, and three others had unrelated injuries. “I just closed my eyes, got down on the ground and put my hands on my head,” Courtney Swanigan, 23, told The Associated Press. The shooting capped a violent week in Arkansas’ largest city. Police had responded to a dozen drive-by shootings over the previous nine days but haven’t said whether any of the incidents are related. “Little Rock’s crime problem appears to be intensifying,” Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “Every few days it seems a high-profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning’s event. I have spoken this morning with Mayor (Mark) Stodola and I have offered both my heart felt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community.” A Facebook video posted from inside the club included audio of at least 24 rounds fired in about 11 seconds. Darryl Rankin, who posted the video, said a friend of his who attended the Finese 2Tymes concert with him had a bullet “stuck in his spine.” Police were summoned about 2:30 a.m. City police said quickly that the agency did not believe the shooting was part of a terrorist attack and that no active shooter remained at the scene. “Some sort of dispute broke out between people inside,” Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters. Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said more information would be released at a news conference Saturday afternoon. The club’s Facebook page promoted Friday night’s show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appears to be a gun at the camera. Calls to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes’ booking agent wasn’t returned Saturday, but a message was posted on the artist’s Facebook page offering thoughts and prayers for those injured: “THE VIOLENCE IS NOT FOR THE CLUB PEOPLE. WE ALL COME WITH 1 MOTIVE AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND THATS TO HAVE FUN.” Police cordoned off the area as technicians collected evidence from the scene, which near a Roman Catholic cathedral and a First United Methodist Church center. A number of worshippers gathered for a funeral at St. Andrew’s while police still worked the scene. Glass from the Power Ultra Lounge’s second story windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. In the parking lot, a silver Toyota had what appeared to be a streak of blood on the front passenger-side door. “I’m sick of all the killing and I’m tired of all the shooting. The kids getting hurt,” said Raida Bunche, who was waiting outside the club after hearing from a friend that her son had been inside. She found out later that he had run from the club when the shooting started and was not hurt. Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials suspended the club’s alcohol license and set a hearing for July 10 on three potential charges: disorderly conduct, allowing possession of weapons on the premises and “failure to be a good neighbor.” The club’s license has been suspended 11 times for failing to pay taxes, and it has been cited seven times for 14 various violations including unknowingly furnishing alcohol to minors and allowing alcohol to leave the premises since 2012, ABC Director of Enforcement Boyce Hamlet said. In May, one person was killed and six people were hurt in a mass shooting at a downtown concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Little Rock. In that case, two men were charged with first-degree murder and six counts of first-degree battery. Arkansas lawmakers earlier this year approved a measure expanding where concealed handguns can be carried, including bars if allowed by owners, for licensees who undergo additional training. The law takes effect in September, but the training likely won’t be available until early next year. Politics . Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

143,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/nYyHZWGShsQ/,"A homicide suspect allegedly filmed himself on Facebook Live during a gun battle with Los Angeles police that left an officer wounded on Thursday. “The gunman, who has yet to be publicly identified, was shouting into the phone that was pointed at him, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation into the shooting,” reported the Los Angeles Times. “KABC-TV showed a clip of what the station said was the video, which it said was posted on Facebook Live. A separate still image shows the man holding a gun to the camera.” “They coming at me,” the Los Angeles Times reports the suspect said in the shootout video. “I’m gonna die today.” Facebook Live, which allows users to live stream video to their friends and followers, has been used increasingly to stream criminal activity over the past year. In May, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he would be hiring 3,000 new employees to filter out violent content on the platform following a spike in video suicides and murders. “We know we need to do better,” said the company in a statement following numerous incidents, which included the revelation that one murder video had been on the platform for hours before removal. In the same month, a man set fire to himself live on Facebook before running into a bar, and police officers managed to save a teenager from a suicide attempt which was being filmed live on the platform. In April, an Alabama man live streamed his suicide on Facebook Live following a breakup, while a Thai father also streamed himself hanging his 11-month-old child before killing himself. In January, four people were arrested in Chicago after they filmed themselves on Facebook Live torturing and beating a tied up disabled man, who was repeatedly forced to say, “f*ck Trump,” and, “f*ck white people.” On Easter Sunday, Facebook user Steve Stephens filmed himself shooting and killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. before he evaded police for days – eventually committing suicide in a standoff. Earlier this month, an unsuspecting Facebook user live streamed from his hotel balcony as a mass shooting developed below in South Carolina. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

ANKARA, Turkey – Turkish police killed five Islamic State group militants in a firefight that erupted during a raid on a house in the central city of Konya, officials said Wednesday. Four police officers were slightly wounded in the operation. Eight other militants were detained in a series of other raids linked to the operation, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The Konya governor's office said police carried out the raid on the house after a routine security check on residents of homes on a route frequently used by military units revealed that it was being rented by a militant wanted by police. The governor's office said a gun, five automatic rifles and a large amount of ammunition were seized in the raid. Turkey has been hit by a series of deadly attacks carried out by IS or Kurdish militants and has stepped up anti-terrorism operations across the country. IS claimed responsibility for a New Year's mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people.

News By Associated Press Submit July 14, 2017 | 1:13am				| Updated July 14, 2017 | 7:19am HONOLULU — A U.S. soldier accused of wanting to commit a mass shooting after pledging loyalty to the Islamic State group believed the moon landing was faked, questioned the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and thought the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an inside job coordinated by the U.S. government, according to a former Army bunkmate. Army Sgt. 1st Class Ikaika Kang was ordered held without bail in federal court in Honolulu Thursday after a brief detention hearing. Kang’s court-appointed attorney Birney Bervar did not contest his client’s detention but said after the hearing that he will ask for a mental health evaluation. A “turning point” for Kang’s mental state seems to be a 2011 deployment, Bervar said: “He’s a decorated American soldier for 10 years, goes to Afghanistan and comes back and things start going off the rails.” Bervar said his client may suffer from service-related mental health issues of which the government was aware but neglected to treat. “It looks like rather than helping him, the government exploited and took advantage of him,” Bervar said. “Kang’s military training, weapons abilities and personal combat skills, coupled with his strong stated desire to kill people in the name of Islamic State, makes him one of the more dangerous criminal defendants to have been charged in this judicial district,” prosecutors wrote in a motion asking that be held without bail. According to court documents, Kang met with undercover agents he thought were from the Islamic State group at a home in Honolulu, where he pledged allegiance to the group and kissed an Islamic State flag. Kang was arrested immediately “to remove the possibility that he would act on his impulse to kill people in the name of Islamic State,” prosecutors wrote. Bervar noted that since Kang never had any contact with real members of the group, the government was “pouring gasoline on the fire of his mental illness.” Kang and Dustin Lyles, a medically retired soldier, bunked together for a month in 2013 during military training. The two were friends for several years before Lyle left the Army and the two lost touch. Lyles told The Associated Press that Kang’s arrest came as a shock and that he never heard Kang express support for the enemy. They shared sleeping quarters, ate together and practiced mixed martial arts. “If I had known that then … I wouldn’t even have talked to him after that,” Lyles said. Lyles said he and Kang debated about conspiracies, including that 9/11 was staged by the U.S. to spark wars in the Middle East. Kang aspired to become a pro MMA fighter, Lyles said. Kang completed a course to become a tactical combat instructor to soldiers, according to an FBI complaint filed in court. With help from a Veterans Administration loan, Kang purchased a condo in May 2016 in a tidy suburban complex about a 20-minute drive to Schofield Barracks, according to property records. Dee Asuncion, the real estate agent who helped him with his condo purchase, told The Associated Press that there was one conversation that seemed strange to her. He talked about having respect for the ideology of Islamic terrorist groups. She also said the two were driving around together looking at properties and began talking about road rage. “(Kang) goes, ‘One time I followed this guy from the east side down to the west side,'” she recalled. “I told him, ‘Don’t do stuff like that. Just let it go.'” Kang’s father, Clifford Kang, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser his son’s promotion to sergeant first class came in the last six months, and told the newspaper he was proud of his son for serving and his position as an air traffic controller. But the father was worried about the stress of the job. “I kept on telling him, ‘Being an air traffic controller (is) too stressful. You can always change … and they will understand.’ And he said, ‘I can handle.'” Read Next Eels from overturned truck slime cars in grossest wreck ev...

146,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/27/north-carolina-wannabe-terrorist-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/,"REUTERS/Stringer. A North Carolina man was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday, being found guilty of attempting to initiate terror attacks in North Carolina and Virginia and start an ISIS branch in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Justin Nojan Sullivan, 21, was preparing to engage in mass shootings on behalf of ISIS before his arrest by the FBI June 19, 2015. Sullivan admitted that he was inspired to slaughter innocent people by infamous and now-dead ISIS-recruiter Junaid Hussain, the DOJ statement said. “Sullivan was actively planning the mass killing of innocent people with an attack designed to inflict maximum casualties and maximum pain in the name of ISIS, a sworn enemy of our nation,” U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rose said. “Sullivan’s allegiance to ISIS did not stop there. He also planned to film and send a video of his deadly attack to now-deceased Junaid Hussain, a prominent ISIS member based in Syria, and further expressed his wish to create a new branch of the so-called Islamic State in the United States.” Court documents say Sullivan was radicalized as early as 2014, seeking out videos of ISIS attacks and beheadings on the internet. Hussain later began corresponding with and attempting to recruit an undercover FBI employee to join him in a mass shooting. Sullivan told the undercover agent that he planned to buy an AR-15 rifle at a gun show, along with hollow-point ammunition. He then asked the agent to help him manufacture a homemade silencer for the weapon, which he would use to kill as many as 1,000 people at a concert near his home. The silencer was delivered to Sullivan’s home June 19, 2015 and was subsequently opened by his mother. Sullivan offered to pay the undercover agent to kill his parents in order to prevent them from interfering with his terror plot, but he was arrested instead.

Army Sgt. 1st Class Ikaika Kang was arrested by an FBI SWAT team on July 8. Kang was ordered held without bail. Kang will be arraigned in federal court on Monday when he had previously been scheduled for a preliminary hearing. Kang’s court-appointed attorney, Birney Bervar, told The Associated Press Friday that the indictment was expected. “We haven’t had a preliminary in federal court here in probably 25 years,” Bervar said. “They don’t like to let us question their witnesses.” Bervar said his client will plead not guilty on Monday when a federal judge will set a trial date. Bervar said he is working on getting Kang a mental health evaluation and that his client may suffer from service-related mental health issues. A “turning point” for Kang’s mental state seems to be a 2011 deployment, Bervar said. “He’s a decorated American soldier for 10 years, goes to Afghanistan and comes back and things start going off the rails.” Elliot Enoki, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Hawaii, and Dana Boente, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced that the indictment in a statement. Kang is charged with four counts of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group based on events that occurred in Hawaii between June 21 and July 8, they said. Federal officials say Kang met with undercover FBI agents he thought were with the terror group and provided classified military documents to the agents. The FBI said in their criminal complaint that Kang wanted to commit a mass shooting after pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group.

But by Sunday morning, they were beginning to think about planning a funeral and mourning the loss of a fetus. A 21-year-old mother-to-be invited friends and relatives to her home in Colerain Township in the 9900 block of Capstan Drive to reveal that she was pregnant and would give birth to a baby boy. The party had ended, but more than a dozen stayed behind. The group had just turned out the lights to watch one of the “Spider-Man” films when two men in hoodies came in the front door. They sprayed the living room with gunfire, said a family member who was at the party and asked not to be identified because she feared for her safety. Autum Garrett, 22, of Huntington, Indiana, was killed and eight others were injured, including three children ages 8, 6 and 2. Two adults remained hospitalized at University of Cincinnati Medical Center Sunday evening. Garrett suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police had not made any arrests by Sunday evening. The children did not suffer life-threatening wounds and were treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney said. He did not know if the children remained hospitalized Sunday evening. ""I want to express our deepest sympathies for the victims and families in last night's tragedy,"" he said. ""This is a significant issue when there is a shooting of three kids."" No one had been arrested Sunday afternoon. Denney said authorities had not yet developed a motive. He declined to name the other victims but said they all are cooperating with police. Police also did not provide any description of the suspects. ""We have interviewed those who were medically able,"" he said, adding that he could not confirm the loss of the fetus but had seen those reports. Take the news with you. Download the Cincinnati.com app on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. A family member said Garrett is a cousin to the pregnant woman who lost her fetus after being shot in the thigh. That woman had been released from the hospital by Sunday morning. Four other relatives, including three more children, attended the party but were not hurt. Denney said police found a gun outside the home but it was not used in the shooting. Two handguns were used in the shooting and there was no return fire, he said. He did not know how many shots were fired. Denney said eight of his officers worked overnight on the case. Cincinnati Police and federal authorities are assisting. ""We are just in the beginning stages of this,"" Denney said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. ""There's a lot more questions I can't answer than I can."" One family member, who was shot at the party and asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation, said relatives are perplexed about a motive. At least four people called 911 to report the 11:21 p.m. shooting. Some were partygoers and were hurt. At times, screaming and children crying drowned out one callers' voice. ""I think a baby's been shot. I think I got hit,"" one caller said. ""There's a whole lot of people here shot. ""They just ran in and started shooting."" Another caller told police she was sitting outside in a car and saw a person in a blue hoodie sweatshirt and another in a green hoodie sweatshirt go into the home. Then, she heard gunfire and saw them run out of the home southwest toward Redskin Drive. The home is just east of Colerain Avenue. Denney said he did not want to alarm residents in the working-class neighborhood, which is just southeast of the Colerain Avenue exit off of Interstate 275. But he said they should remain cautious, keep their doors locked and their lights on. ""This is a sad day for all of our community,"" City Administrator Dan Meloy said. Many residents awoke to the news Sunday morning. Neighbors, some still in robes or walking their dogs, milled about discussing the shooting and the changes the area has experienced in recent years. Several said drug dealing has become more pervasive. Shawn Fee said he thought television crews were at his home to talk to him about recent storm damage. Instead, he learned of the mass shooting just down the block. “There’s a lot of drugs in this neighborhood,"" Fee said. “Everything from prescription to heroin to weed.” Another neighbor said he’s called police several times about drug deals he has witnessed. That man, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said the shooting sounded like firecrackers. By the time he went outside, he saw multiple squad cars and at least three ambulances parked near his home. A woman, who was at the party and told him her daughter was shot to death, was sitting on his driveway when he came out. ""She was crying, crying, crying,'' he said. ""It's one thing to come in and find a relative dead. It's another thing to watch it happen. I feel so bad for her."" He said he also saw paramedics attending to two school-aged children and a smaller child in the back of the ambulance. The children were all wearing pajamas and did not appear to be hurt, he said.  The shooting is the largest in the Tristate since the mass shooting at Cameo nightclub on Kellogg Avenue in Cincinnati. Seventeen people were shot and two died from the March 26 shooting. Last year, eight family members were shot and killed in their home in rural Pike County, about 90 miles from Cincinnati. Denney asked that anyone with information call 513-321-COPS or Crimestoppers at 513-352-3040. Callers can remain anonymous. ""Somebody has information about this,"" he said. ""When three kids get shot, someone has to step forward.""      ",2017-07-09 00:00:00,"9 shot, 1 woman killed at gender reveal party in Colerain Township",,26590,http://cincinnati.com
150,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/furious-gay-rights-advocates-see-trumps-true-colors.html?smid=tw-share,"Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — When President Trump was a candidate, he pledged his support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people immediately after the mass shooting last summer at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. “They have been through something that nobody could ever experience,” Mr. Trump said at an event in Manchester, N.H., on June 13, 2016, delivering a hastily drafted speech that was originally intended to be about Hillary Clinton. “Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the L.G.B.T. community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?” he said. “I will tell you who the better friend is, and someday I believe that will be proven out, big-league.” Such proof did not come on Wednesday. But the president’s words were repeated with anger and frustration by a number of gay rights advocates who were angered by Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision to bar transgender people from any military job. “We’re seeing the president’s true colors,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “This is who he is.” The new ban, which Mr. Trump announced on Twitter, startling some of his aides, was at odds with the speech he gave in New Hampshire. The day before, in Orlando, Omar Mateen, a security guard, had killed 49 people and wounded 58 in the name of the Islamic State. That Mr. Mateen was a Muslim and had targeted gay and lesbian clubgoers sent shock waves through two American minority communities that have been marginalized in the United States. “This is a very dark moment in America’s history,” Mr. Trump said that day. “A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.” During his speech at the Republican National Convention the next month, Mr. Trump again recalled the Pulse shooting. He reveled in applause after saying, “I will do everything in my power to protect our L.G.T.B.Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.” “Believe me,” Mr. Trump said during that July 21, 2016, speech. “And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.” On Wednesday, the president’s supporters maintained that his response then spoke to terrorism — a stark contrast from current concerns about military preparedness. Christopher R. Barron, one of the founders of the Republican gay rights group GOProud, which helped give rise to Mr. Trump’s political career by hosting him at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, gave the president the benefit of the doubt. “I defer to the military leaders to determine what policies around the question of trans service best allow them to win the war on radical anti-L.G.B.T. Islamic extremism,” Mr. Barron wrote on Twitter. As a developer in New York, Mr. Trump spent his life in a city with a large gay population. Before his entry to politics, he was open to gay civil unions, and he was known in Palm Beach, Fla., where he owns the Mar-a-Lago resort, as the first private club owner to admit an openly gay couple as members. Since his election, he has remained against gay marriage, the frontier on which the L.G.B.T. fight was waged over the last decade. Mr. Trump’s closest aides say he has never been a social crusader on gay rights issues. But in his first interview as president, Mr. Trump suggested that the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage should remain the law of the land. Early in his presidency, he declined to roll back some of President Barack Obama’s protections for L.G.B.T. people. But Mr. Trump has since ordered that some of those protections be dropped, including through moves that were said to bolster religious liberties but that critics feared would legally foster discrimination against gay Americans. “I think people were hoping against hope that while he was very unpredictable, that he would be a man of his word and that also he would not want to go against the prevailing social norms that we’re used to in New York,” said Richard Socarides, a prominent gay activist and Democrat who used to advise President Bill Clinton. “People thought, this is a guy who knows gay people, who has gay people around him,” said Mr. Socarides, before expressing a broader concern: “If this is allowed to work, he’ll go after gay marriage next.” Mr. Griffin said that hopes that Mr. Trump had a durable connection to the L.G.T.B.Q. community evaporated during the campaign, with his selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. Mr. Pence is an evangelical conservative who has strongly opposed a number of gay rights initiatives. Mr. Griffin pointed to other transgender protections that had been undone under Mr. Trump. And he wondered aloud about Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who know a number of gay people in their social circles in New York. “Where’s Jared?” Mr. Griffin said. “Where’s Ivanka?” Advertisement",2017-07-26 00:00:00,Furious Gay Rights Advocates See Trump’s ‘True Colors’ - The New York Times,,1,http://nytimes.com

US data scientist Seth Stephens‑Davidowitz analysed anonymous Google search results, uncovering disturbing truths about our desires, beliefs and prejudices Last modified on Wed 21 Mar 2018 23.50 GMT Everybody lies. People lie about how many drinks they had on the way home. They lie about how often they go to the gym, how much those new shoes cost, whether they read that book. They call in sick when they’re not. They say they’ll be in touch when they won’t. They say it’s not about you when it is. They say they love you when they don’t. They say they’re happy while in the dumps. They say they like women when they really like men. People lie to friends. They lie to bosses. They lie to kids. They lie to parents. They lie to doctors. They lie to husbands. They lie to wives. They lie to themselves. And they damn sure lie to surveys. Here’s my brief survey for you: Have you ever cheated in an exam?  Have you ever fantasised about killing someone? Were you tempted to lie? Many people underreport embarrassing behaviours and thoughts on surveys. They want to look good, even though most surveys are anonymous. This is called social desirability bias. An important paper in 1950 provided powerful evidence of how surveys can fall victim to such bias. Researchers collected data, from official sources, on the residents of Denver: what percentage of them voted, gave to charity, and owned a library card. They then surveyed the residents to see if the percentages would match. The results were, at the time, shocking. What the residents reported to the surveys was very different from the data the researchers had gathered. Even though nobody gave their names, people, in large numbers, exaggerated their voter registration status, voting behaviour, and charitable giving. Has anything changed in 65 years? In the age of the internet, not owning a library card is no longer embarrassing. But, while what’s embarrassing or desirable may have changed, people’s tendency to deceive pollsters remains strong. A recent survey asked University of Maryland graduates various questions about their college experience. The answers were compared with official records. People consistently gave wrong information, in ways that made them look good. Fewer than 2% reported that they graduated with lower than a 2.5 GPA (grade point average). In reality, about 11% did. And 44% said they had donated to the university in the past year. In reality, about 28% did. Then there’s that odd habit we sometimes have of lying to ourselves. Lying to oneself may explain why so many people say they are above average. How big is this problem? More than 40% of one company’s engineers said they are in the top 5%. More than 90% of college professors say they do above-average work. One-quarter of high school seniors think they are in the top 1% in their ability to get along with other people. If you are deluding yourself, you can’t be honest in a survey. The more impersonal the conditions, the more honest people will be. For eliciting truthful answers, internet surveys are better than phone surveys, which are better than in-person surveys. People will admit more if they are alone than if others are in the room with them. However, on sensitive topics, every survey method will elicit substantial misreporting. People have no incentive to tell surveys the truth. How, therefore, can we learn what our fellow humans are really thinking and doing? Big data. Certain online sources get people to admit things they would not admit anywhere else. They serve as a digital truth serum. Think of Google searches. Remember the conditions that make people more honest. Online? Check. Alone? Check. No person administering a survey? Check. The power in Google data is that people tell the giant search engine things they might not tell anyone else. Google was invented so that people could learn about the world, not so researchers could learn about people, but it turns out the trails we leave as we seek knowledge on the internet are tremendously revealing. I have spent the past four years analysing anonymous Google data. The revelations have kept coming. Mental illness, human sexuality, abortion, religion, health. Not exactly small topics, and this dataset, which didn’t exist a couple of decades ago, offered surprising new perspectives on all of them. I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important dataset ever collected on the human psyche. How many American men are gay? This is a regular question in sexuality research. Yet it has been among the toughest questions for social scientists to answer. Psychologists no longer believe Alfred Kinsey’s famous estimate – based on surveys that oversampled prisoners and prostitutes – that 10% of American men are gay. Representative surveys now tell us about 2% to 3% are. But sexual preference has long been among the subjects upon which people have tended to lie. I think I can use big data to give a better answer to this question than we have ever had. First, more on that survey data. Surveys tell us there are far more gay men in tolerant states than intolerant states. For example, according to a Gallup survey, the proportion of the population that is gay is almost twice as high in Rhode Island, the state with the highest support for gay marriage, than Mississippi, the state with the lowest support for gay marriage. There are two likely explanations for this. First, gay men born in intolerant states may move to tolerant states. Second, gay men in intolerant states may not divulge that they are gay. Some insight into explanation number one – gay mobility – can be gleaned from another big data source: Facebook, which allows users to list what gender they are interested in. About 2.5% of male Facebook users who list a gender of interest say they are interested in men; that corresponds roughly with what the surveys indicate. And Facebook too shows big differences in the gay population in states with high versus low tolerance: Facebook has the gay population more than twice as high in Rhode Island as in Mississippi. Facebook also can provide information on how people move around. I was able to code the home town of a sample of openly gay Facebook users. This allowed me to directly estimate how many gay men move out of intolerant states into more tolerant parts of the country. The answer? There is clearly some mobility – from Oklahoma City to San Francisco, for example. But I estimate that men moving to someplace more open-minded can explain less than half of the difference in the openly gay population in tolerant versus intolerant states. If mobility cannot fully explain why some states have so many more openly gay men, the closet must be playing a big role. Which brings us back to Google, with which so many people have proved willing to share so much. Countrywide, I estimate – using data from Google searches and Google AdWords – that about 5% of male porn searches are for gay-male porn. Overall, there are more gay porn searches in tolerant states compared with intolerant states. In Mississippi, I estimate that 4.8% of male porn searches are for gay porn, far higher than the numbers suggested by either surveys or Facebook and reasonably close to the 5.2% of pornography searches that are for gay porn in Rhode Island. So how many American men are gay? This measure of pornography searches by men – roughly 5% are same-sex – seems a reasonable estimate of the true size of the gay population in the United States. Five per cent of American men being gay is an estimate, of course. Some men are bisexual; some – especially when young – are not sure what they are. Obviously, you can’t count this as precisely as you might the number of people who vote or attend a movie. But one consequence of my estimate is clear: an awful lot of men in the United States, particularly in intolerant states, are still in the closet. They don’t reveal their sexual preferences on Facebook. They don’t admit it on surveys. And, in many cases, they may even be married to women. It turns out that wives suspect their husbands of being gay rather frequently. They demonstrate that suspicion in the surprisingly common search: “Is my husband gay?” The word “gay” is 10% more likely to complete searches that begin “Is my husband...” than the second-place word, “cheating”. It is eight times more common than “an alcoholic” and 10 times more common than “depressed”. Most tellingly perhaps, searches questioning a husband’s sexuality are far more prevalent in the least tolerant regions. The states with the highest percentage of women asking this question are South Carolina and Louisiana. In fact, in 21 of the 25 states where this question is most frequently asked, support for gay marriage is lower than the national average. Closets are not just repositories of fantasies. When it comes to sex, people keep many secrets – about how much they are having, for example. Americans report using far more condoms than are sold every year. You might therefore think this means they are just saying they use condoms more often during sex than they actually do. The evidence suggests they also exaggerate how frequently they are having sex to begin with. About 11% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 say they are sexually active, not currently pregnant, and not using contraception. Even with relatively conservative assumptions about how many times they are having sex, scientists would expect 10% of them to become pregnant every month. But this would already be more than the total number of pregnancies in the United States (which is one in 113 women of childbearing age). In our sex-obsessed culture it can be hard to admit that you are just not having that much. But if you’re looking for understanding or advice, you have, once again, an incentive to tell Google. On Google, there are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk. There are five-and-a-half times more complaints about an unmarried partner not wanting sex than an unmarried partner refusing to text back. And Google searches suggest a surprising culprit for many of these sexless relationships. There are twice as many complaints that a boyfriend won’t have sex than that a girlfriend won’t have sex. By far, the number one search complaint about a boyfriend is “My boyfriend won’t have sex with me.” (Google searches are not broken down by gender, but since the previous analysis said that 95% of men are straight, we can guess that not many “boyfriend” searches are coming from men.) How should we interpret this? Does this really imply that boyfriends withhold sex more than girlfriends? Not necessarily. As mentioned earlier, Google searches can be biased in favour of stuff people are uptight talking about. Men may feel more comfortable telling their friends about their girlfriend’s lack of sexual interest than women are telling their friends about their boyfriend’s. Still, even if the Google data does not imply that boyfriends are really twice as likely to avoid sex as girlfriends, it does suggest that boyfriends avoiding sex is more common than people let on. Google data also suggests a reason people may be avoiding sex so frequently: enormous anxiety, with much of it misplaced. Start with men’s anxieties. It isn’t news that men worry about how well endowed they are, but the degree of this worry is rather profound. Men Google more questions about their sexual organ than any other body part: more than about their lungs, liver, feet, ears, nose, throat, and brain combined. Men conduct more searches for how to make their penises bigger than how to tune a guitar, make an omelette, or change a tyre. Men’s top Googled concern about steroids isn’t whether they may damage their health but whether taking them might diminish the size of their penis. Men’s top Googled question related to how their body or mind would change as they aged was whether their penis would get smaller. Do women care about penis size? Rarely, according to Google searches. For every search women make about a partner’s phallus, men make roughly 170 searches about their own. True, on the rare occasions women do express concerns about a partner’s penis, it is frequently about its size, but not necessarily that it’s small. More than 40% of complaints about a partner’s penis size say that it’s too big. “Pain” is the most Googled word used in searches with the phrase “___ during sex.” Yet only 1% of men’s searches looking to change their penis size are seeking information on how to make it smaller. Men’s second most common sex question is how to make their sexual encounters longer. Once again, the insecurities of men do not appear to match the concerns of women. There are roughly the same number of searches asking how to make a boyfriend climax more quickly as climax more slowly. In fact, the most common concern women have related to a boyfriend’s orgasm isn’t about when it happened but why it isn’t happening at all. We don’t often talk about body image issues when it comes to men. And while it’s true that overall interest in personal appearance skews female, it’s not as lopsided as stereotypes would suggest. According to my analysis of Google AdWords, which measures the websites people visit, interest in beauty and fitness is 42% male, weight loss is 33% male, and cosmetic surgery is 39% male. Among all searches with “how to” related to breasts, about 20% ask how to get rid of man breasts. Sex and romance are hardly the only topics cloaked in shame and, therefore, not the only topics about which people keep secrets. Many people are, for good reason, inclined to keep their prejudices to themselves. I suppose you could call it progress that many people today feel they will be judged if they admit they judge other people based on their ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. But many Americans still do. You can see this on Google, where users sometimes ask questions such as “Why are black people rude?” or “Why are Jews evil?” A few patterns among these stereotypes stand out. For example, African Americans are the only group that faces a “rude” stereotype. Nearly every group is a victim of a “stupid” stereotype; the only two that are not: Jews and Muslims. The “evil” stereotype is applied to Jews, Muslims, and gay people but not black people, Mexicans, Asians, and Christians. Muslims are the only group stereotyped as terrorists. When a Muslim American plays into this stereotype, the response can be instantaneous and vicious. Google search data can give us a minute-by-minute peek into such eruptions of hate-fuelled rage. Consider what happened shortly after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, on 2 December, 2015. That morning, Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik entered a meeting of Farook’s co-workers armed with semi-automatic pistols and semi-automatic rifles and murdered 14 people. That evening, minutes after the media first reported one of the shooters’ Muslim-sounding names, a disturbing number of Californians decided what they wanted to do with Muslims: kill them. The top Google search in California with the word “Muslims” in it at the time was “kill Muslims”. And overall, Americans searched for the phrase “kill Muslims” with about the same frequency that they searched for “martini recipe” and “migraine symptoms”. In the days following the San Bernardino attack, for every American concerned with “Islamophobia”, another was searching for “kill Muslims”. While hate searches were approximately 20% of all searches about Muslims before the attack, more than half of all search volume about Muslims became hateful in the hours that followed it. And this minute-by-minute search data can tell us how difficult it can be to calm this rage. Four days after the shooting, President Obama gave a prime-time address to the country. He wanted to reassure Americans that the government could both stop terrorism and, perhaps more importantly, quiet this dangerous Islamophobia. Obama appealed to our better angels, speaking of the importance of inclusion and tolerance. The rhetoric was powerful and moving. The Los Angeles Times praised Obama for “[warning] against allowing fear to cloud our judgment”. The New York Times called the speech both “tough” and “calming”. The website ThinkProgress praised it as “a necessary tool of good governance, geared towards saving the lives of Muslim Americans”. Obama’s speech, in other words, was judged a major success. But was it? Google search data suggests otherwise. Together with Evan Soltas, then at Princeton, I examined the data. In his speech, the president said: “It is the responsibility of all Americans – of every faith – to reject discrimination.” But searches calling Muslims “terrorists”, “bad”, “violent”, and “evil” doubled during and shortly after the speech. President Obama also said: “It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country.” But negative searches about Syrian refugees, a mostly Muslim group then desperately looking for a safe haven, rose 60%, while searches asking how to help Syrian refugees dropped 35%. Obama asked Americans to “not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear”. Yet searches for “kill Muslims” tripled during his speech. In fact, just about every negative search we could think to test regarding Muslims shot up during and after Obama’s speech, and just about every positive search we could think to test declined. In other words, Obama seemed to say all the right things. But new data from the internet, offering digital truth serum, suggested that the speech actually backfired in its main goal. Instead of calming the angry mob, as everybody thought he was doing, the internet data tells us that Obama actually inflamed it. Sometimes we need internet data to correct our instinct to pat ourselves on the back. So what should Obama have said to quell this particular form of hatred currently so virulent in America? We’ll circle back to that later. First we’re going to take a look at an age-old vein of prejudice in the United States, the form of hate that in fact stands out above the rest, the one that has been the most destructive and the topic of the research that began this book. In my work with Google search data, the single most telling fact I have found regarding hate on the internet is the popularity of the word “nigger”. Either singular or in its plural form, the word is included in 7m American searches every year. (Again, the word used in rap songs is almost always “nigga”, not “nigger”, so there’s no significant impact from hip-hop lyrics to account for.) Searches for “nigger jokes” are 17 times more common than searches for “kike jokes”, “gook jokes”, “spic jokes”, “chink jokes”, and “fag jokes” combined. When are these searches most common? Whenever African Americans are in the news. Among the periods when such searches were highest was the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when television and newspapers showed images of desperate black people in New Orleans struggling for their survival. They also shot up during Obama’s first election. And searches rose on average about 30% on Martin Luther King Jr Day. The frightening ubiquity of this racial slur throws into doubt some current understandings of racism. Any theory of racism has to explain a big puzzle in America. On the one hand, the overwhelming majority of black Americans think they suffer from prejudice – and they have ample evidence of discrimination in police stops, job interviews, and jury decisions. On the other hand, very few white Americans will admit to being racist. The dominant explanation among political scientists recently has been that this is due, in large part, to widespread implicit prejudice. White Americans may mean well, this theory goes, but they have a subconscious bias, which influences their treatment of black Americans. Academics invented an ingenious way to test for such a bias. It is called the implicit association test. The tests have consistently shown that it takes most people milliseconds longer to associate black faces with positive words, such as “good”, than with negative words, such as “awful”. For white faces, the pattern is reversed. The extra time it takes is evidence of someone’s implicit prejudice – a prejudice the person may not even be aware of. There is, though, an alternative explanation for the discrimination that African Americans feel and whites deny: hidden explicit racism. Suppose there is a reasonably widespread conscious racism of which people are very much aware but to which they won’t confess – certainly not in a survey. That’s what the search data seems to be saying. There is nothing implicit about searching for “nigger jokes”. And it’s hard to imagine that Americans are Googling the word “nigger” with the same frequency as “migraine” and “economist” without explicit racism having a major impact on African Americans. Prior to the Google data, we didn’t have a convincing measure of this virulent animus. Now we do. We are, therefore, in a position to see what it explains. It explains why Obama’s vote totals in 2008 and 2012 were depressed in many regions. It also correlates with the black-white wage gap, as a team of economists recently reported. The areas that I had found make the most racist searches underpay black people. And then there is the phenomenon of Donald Trump’s candidacy. When Nate Silver, the polling guru, looked for the geographic variable that correlated most strongly with support in the 2016 Republican primary for Trump, he found it in the map of racism I had developed. To be provocative and to encourage more research in this area, let me put forth the following conjecture, ready to be tested by scholars across a range of fields. The primary explanation for discrimination against African Americans today is not the fact that the people who agree to participate in lab experiments make subconscious associations between negative words and black people; it is the fact that millions of white Americans continue to do things like search for “nigger jokes”. The discrimination black people regularly experience in the United States appears to be fuelled more widely by explicit, if hidden, hostility. But, for other groups, subconscious prejudice may have a more fundamental impact. For example, I was able to use Google searches to find evidence of implicit prejudice against another segment of the population: young girls. And who, might you ask, would be harbouring bias against girls? Their parents. It’s hardly surprising that parents of young children are often excited by the thought that their kids might be gifted. In fact, of all Google searches starting “Is my two-year-old…,” the most common next word is “gifted”. But this question is not asked equally about boys and girls. Parents are two-and-a-half times more likely to ask “Is my son gifted?” than “Is my daughter gifted?” Parents show a similar bias when using other phrases related to intelligence that they may shy away from saying aloud, like “Is my son a genius?” Are parents picking up on legitimate differences between young girls and boys? Perhaps young boys are more likely than young girls to use big words or show objective signs of giftedness? Nope. If anything, it’s the opposite. At young ages, girls have consistently been shown to have larger vocabularies and use more complex sentences. In American schools, girls are 9% more likely than boys to be in gifted programmes. Despite all this, parents looking around the dinner table appear to see more gifted boys than girls. In fact, on every search term related to intelligence I tested, including those indicating its absence, parents were more likely to be inquiring about their sons rather than their daughters. There are also more searches for “is my son behind” or “stupid” than comparable searches for daughters. But searches with negative words like “behind” and “stupid” are less specifically skewed toward sons than searches with positive words, such as “gifted” or “genius”. What then are parents’ overriding concerns regarding their daughters? Primarily, anything related to appearance. Consider questions about a child’s weight. Parents Google “Is my daughter overweight?” roughly twice as frequently as they Google “Is my son overweight?” Parents are about twice as likely to ask how to get their daughters to lose weight as they are to ask how to get their sons to do the same. Just as with giftedness, this gender bias is not grounded in reality. About 28% of girls are overweight, while 35% of boys are. Even though scales measure more overweight boys than girls, parents see – or worry about – overweight girls much more frequently than overweight boys. Parents are also one-and-a-half times more likely to ask whether their daughter is beautiful than whether their son is handsome. Liberal readers may imagine that these biases are more common in conservative parts of the country, but I didn’t find any evidence of that. In fact, I did not find a significant relationship between any of these biases and the political or cultural makeup of a state. It would seem this bias against girls is more widespread and deeply ingrained than we’d care to believe. I can’t pretend there isn’t a darkness in some of this data. It has revealed the continued existence of millions of closeted gay men; widespread animus against African Americans; and an outbreak of violent Islamophobic rage that only got worse when the president appealed for tolerance. Not exactly cheery stuff. If people consistently tell us what they think we want to hear, we will generally be told things that are more comforting than the truth. Digital truth serum, on average, will show us that the world is worse than we have thought. But there are at least three ways this knowledge can improve our lives. First, there can be comfort in knowing you are not alone in your insecurities and embarrassing behaviour. Google searches can help show you are not alone. When you were young, a teacher may have told you that if you have a question you should raise your hand and ask it, because if you’re confused, others are too. If you were anything like me, you ignored your teacher and sat there silently, afraid to open your mouth. Your questions were too dumb, you thought; everyone else’s were more profound. The anonymous, aggregate Google data can tell us once and for all how right our teachers were. Plenty of basic, sub-profound questions lurk in other minds, too. The second benefit of digital truth serum is that it alerts us to people who are suffering. The Human Rights Campaign has asked me to work with them in helping educate men in certain states about the possibility of coming out of the closet. They are looking to use the anonymous and aggregate Google search data to help them decide where best to target their resources. The final – and, I think, most powerful – value in this data is its ability to lead us from problems to solutions. With more understanding, we might find ways to reduce the world’s supply of nasty attitudes. Let’s return to Obama’s speech about Islamophobia. Recall that every time he argued that people should respect Muslims more, the people he was trying to reach became more enraged. Google searches, however, reveal that there was one line that did trigger the type of response Obama might have wanted. He said: “Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbours, our co-workers, our sports heroes and, yes, they are our men and women in uniform, who are willing to die in defence of our country.” After this line, for the first time in more than a year, the top Googled noun after “Muslim” was not “terrorists”, “extremists”, or “refugees”. It was “athletes”, followed by “soldiers”.” And, in fact, “athletes” kept the top spot for a full day afterwards. When we lecture angry people, the search data implies that their fury can grow. But subtly provoking people’s curiosity, giving new information, and offering new images of the group that is stoking their rage may turn their thoughts in different, more positive directions. Two months after that speech, Obama gave another televised speech on Islamophobia, this time at a mosque. Perhaps someone in the president’s office had read Soltas’s and my Times column, which discussed what had worked and what hadn’t, for the content of this speech was noticeably different. Obama spent little time insisting on the value of tolerance. Instead, he focused overwhelmingly on provoking people’s curiosity and changing their perceptions of Muslim Americans. Many of the slaves from Africa were Muslim, Obama told us; Thomas Jefferson and John Adams had their own copies of the Koran; a Muslim American designed skyscrapers in Chicago. Obama again spoke of Muslim athletes and armed service members, but also talked of Muslim police officers and firefighters, teachers and doctors. And my analysis of the Google searches suggests this speech was more successful than the previous one. Many of the hateful, rageful searches against Muslims dropped in the hours afterwards. There are other potential ways to use search data to learn what causes, or reduces, hate. For example, we might look at how racist searches change after a black quarterback is drafted in a city, or how sexist searches change after a woman is elected to office. Learning of our subconscious prejudices can also be useful. We might all make an extra effort to delight in little girls’ minds and show less concern with their appearance. Google search data and other wellsprings of truth on the internet give us an unprecedented look into the darkest corners of the human psyche. This is at times, I admit, difficult to face. But it can also be empowering. We can use the data to fight the darkness. Collecting rich data on the world’s problems is the first step toward fixing them.

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz will be speaking in London at the Royal Society of Arts on Tuesday and at Second Home on Wednesday What’s your background?I’d describe myself as a data scientist, but my PhD is in economics. When I was doing my PhD, in 2012, I found this tool called Google Trends that tells you what people are searching, and where, and I became obsessed with it. I know that when people first see Google data, they say “Oh this is weird, this isn’t perfect data”, but I knew that perfect data didn’t exist. The traditional data sets left a lot to be desired. What would your search records reveal about you?They could definitely tell I’m a hypochondriac because I’m waking up in the middle of the night doing Google searches about my health. There are definitely things about me that you could figure out. When making claims about a topic, it’s better to do it on aggregate, but I think you can figure out a lot, if not everything, about an individual by what they’re searching on Google. You worked at Google?For about a year and a half. I was on the economics team and also the quantitative marketing team. Some was analysis of advertising, which I got bored of, which is one of the reasons I stopped working there. Did working there give you an understanding that helped this book?Yeah, I think it did. All this data I’m talking about is public. But from meeting the people who know more about this data than anyone in the world, I’m much more confident that it means what I think it means. Does it change your view of human nature? Are we darker and stranger creatures than you realised?Yeah. I think I had a dark view of human nature to begin with, and I think now it’s gotten even darker. I think the degree to which people are self-absorbed is pretty shocking. When Trump became president, all my friends said how anxious they were, they couldn’t sleep because they’re so concerned about immigrants and the Muslim ban. But from the data you can see that in liberal parts of the country there wasn’t a rise in anxiety when Trump was elected. When people were waking up at 3am in a cold sweat, their searches were about their job, their health, their relationship – they’re not concerned about the Muslim ban or global warming. Was the Google search data telling you that Trump was going to win?I did see that Trump was going to win. You saw clearly that African American turnout was going to be way down, because in cities with 95% black people there was a collapse in searches for voting information. That was a big reason Hillary Clinton did so much worse than the polls suggested. What’s next?I want to keep on exploring this, whether in academia, journalism or more books. It’s such an exciting area: what people are really like, how the world really works. I may just research sex for the next few months. One thing I’ve learned from this book, people are more interested in sex than I thought they were.

153,http://time.com/4527408/2016-election-political-correctness/,"During the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 4, as Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence tussled over immigration plans, one of the candidates said the words criminal aliens seven times. The other described immigrants who had come to the U.S. illegally as “people … who are here without documents.” Can you guess who said which? Sure. Political language is packed with code words, sometimes known as dog whistles. “The idea,” says socio­linguist Ben Zimmer, “is it’s speaking to a particular audience that’s supposed to pick up on a frequency that others won’t hear.” Often these terms say not much on the surface, but underneath attempt to speak to the real issue at stake. When Pence hammers on about “criminal aliens,” the immigration debate is about safety. When Kaine avoids uttering “illegal,” the debate is about humanity (aren’t we a welcoming nation of immigrants?). Earlier this year, Republicans quickly called the Orlando attack an act of “Islamic terrorism” (a national-­security issue), while many Democrats called it a “mass shooting” (a gun issue). When Donald Trump emphasizes “law and order,” as Richard Nixon did in 1968, that plays on anxieties about race relations for some voters. Hillary Clinton’s 1996 comment about gangs of kids being “superpredators” has been viewed as a slight to the black community. Earlier this year, a group of economists analyzed congressional records and found that from 1870 to 1990, the odds of correctly identifying a politician’s party by language was 50-50. By 2010, the odds were 83%. The turning point was 1994, says Stanford’s Matthew Gentzkow, which brought the Republicans’ Contract With America and the rise of strategists like Frank Luntz, who set the bar by rebranding estate taxes as death taxes. (You can read Luntz elsewhere in this package.) Changes in technology meant that virtually anything a politician said on the Capitol floor could be recorded, so messaging had to be consistent. Says Gentzkow: “There was this innovation in using language very strategically and very deliberately.” Contact us at letters@time.com.",2017-07-06 08:00:00,http://time.com/4527408/2016-election-political-correctness/,,4419,http://time.com

156,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/nyregion/bronx-hospital-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news,"Advertisement Supported by By Sarah Maslin Nir A disgruntled doctor armed with an AR-15 rifle and wearing a lab coat went on a rampage on Friday in the Bronx hospital where he had worked, killing a doctor and wounding six other people — five of them seriously — before setting himself on fire and shooting himself in the head, the authorities said. The furious attack by the doctor — identified by the police as Henry Bello, 45 — sent workers at the hospital, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, diving behind desks and doors as gunshots and smoke filled the hallways of a place devoted to healing. Witnesses described medical workers ripping a fire hose from the wall to use as a tourniquet on one victim’s leg, while others recalled the horrific sight of the gunman, his torso aflame, running down a hallway. Dr. Bello had a troubled past, having worked at the hospital for about six months before quitting after being accused of sexual harassment, officials said. And years earlier, he was arrested and charged with sexual abuse after assaulting a woman in Manhattan. The attack appeared to be the type of mass shooting by a lone gunman that has struck communities around the United States. “He’s shooting! He’s shooting!” one woman yelled in the frantic initial moments of the afternoon assault, as recounted by a mother in the pediatric emergency room who had cowered with her five children, ages 1 to 10. Some believed that the death toll would have been far higher had the shooting occurred anywhere but where it did — a hospital filled with state-of-the-art medical equipment, and with doctors and nurses who rushed to victims and performed triage where they fell, in staircases and hallways, even as the gunman was still at large. “The situation unfolded in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters outside the hospital, on the Grand Concourse in the Claremont Village neighborhood. The gunman acted alone, Mr. de Blasio said, adding that it appeared to be a workplace dispute that ended when the gunman committed suicide — “but not before having done horrible damage,” the mayor said. The police did not identify the victim, other than as a woman and a doctor. The five seriously injured patients were “fighting for their lives,” said the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill. The sixth had a gunshot wound to the leg. Dr. Bello was armed with a rifle, an AR-15, that investigators believe he sneaked into the hospital under his lab coat, police officials said. While investigators were still trying to determine a motive, one official said, “Most likely it’s a workplace violence on the part of a former disgruntled employee.” Dr. Bello was hired in August 2014, according to Errol C. Schneer, the hospital’s vice president, and left in February 2015, in lieu of being terminated. The police said he resigned after an accusation of workplace sexual harassment. In 2004, Dr. Bello was arrested and charged with sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment after a 23-year-old woman told officers he had grabbed her crotch area outside a building on Bleecker Street in Manhattan and tried to penetrate her through her underwear, a law enforcement official said. The woman told officers that Dr. Bello had lifted her up in the air and dragged her while saying, “You’re coming with me.” Court records indicate that Dr. Bello pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment in the second degree, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to community service. The felony sexual abuse charge was dismissed. Mr. Schneer said on Friday night that the hospital did not know about Dr. Bello’s criminal past when he was hired. “At that time, and as a result of a human resources and security department background check, which includes fingerprinting, there was no record of any conviction for sexual abuse,” he said. Dr. Bello was a graduate of Ross University School of Medicine on the Caribbean island of Dominica, a New York State official said. The state’s Education Department said Dr. Bello had received a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate in order to gain experience so that he could be licensed. The permit was issued on July 1, 2014, and expired on July 1, 2016. He also had an expired pharmacy technician license, issued in California in 2006. The carnage took place around 2:50 p.m. Friday on the 16th and 17th floors of one of the Bronx’s largest hospitals, which has 1.1 million patient visits and over 140,000 emergency room visits a year, according to its website. Witnesses said that on Friday afternoon, Bronx-Lebanon’s rooms and corridors were filled with patients and visitors. As the situation developed, emergency workers were at first prevented from entering the building. At least one of the wounded was being treated by people inside the hospital who had tied an emergency fire hose as a tourniquet, a Fire Department official said. At one point, the police escorted into the building a group of emergency workers wearing armor, as the gunman was still being sought. Dr. Sridhar Chilimuri, the physician in chief at the hospital, said the doctor who was killed had been shot in the chest. Of the five victims in critical condition, one is a family services physician, three are medical students and one is a gastrointestinal specialist. Dr. Chilimuri said he had treated some of the victims, who were friends and colleagues. The situation was “extraordinarily difficult,” he said. Norma Ruiz, a patient-care technician at Bronx-Lebanon, said the shooting took place on a floor where she works, and she recalled seeing a man, now believed to be the gunman, on fire. “He was running down the hall throwing himself on the floor,” she said. “We threw ourselves on the floor, and when everybody was quiet, my co-worker and me, we lift our heads, and the doctors’ station was on fire.” “Everybody just started screaming,” said the mother in the pediatric unit, who asked that her name not be used to protect her children’s medical privacy. The hospital staff frantically tried to quiet everyone, she said, ordering people in the packed waiting room to lie on the floor while the lights were turned off. The woman ran into an exam room with her children and shoved them underneath a hospital bed, while she lay on the floor as a barricade in front of them. When her 1-year-old began to cry, she breast fed him to keep him quiet, she said. “My heart was pounding,” she said. “I was shaking, just shaking.” Miguel Mercado, 61, was lying in a hospital bed on the 10th floor, waiting for an M.R.I. after complications from back surgery earlier in June, when the police burst into the room and ordered patients who could walk to head down the stairs with their hands up. “The cops came and started emptying out the rooms floor by floor — ‘Everybody get out, get out, get out!’” he said about an hour after the shooting, standing in the parking lot outside the hospital, IV tubes dangling from his arm. On his feet he wore only hospital socks. “It’s been happening almost anywhere, but nobody was waiting for this,” Mr. Mercado said, referring to the workplace shooting. “Who would have thought it would happen in a hospital?” Shortly after the shooting, graphic images emerged online that purported to show the suspect lying on the hospital floor, in a button-down shirt worn under a lab coat, the scene covered in blood. As patients and employees drifted from the hospital in the hours after the shooting, Ms. Ruiz, the patient-care technician, stood in her green scrubs, deeply shaken. “I just want to get out of here,” she said, recalling the moment she heard the gunman. “We hear, ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ We thought, ‘A patient, a relative.’ But no, it came from the doctors’ station.” Advertisement",2017-06-30 00:00:00,"Doctor Opens Fire at Bronx Hospital, Killing a Doctor and Wounding 6 - The New York Times",,1,http://nytimes.com

158,http://time.com/114354/elliot-rodger-ucsb-misogyny/,"The recent shooting-stabbing in California follows a familiar pattern: a socially isolated male, with chronic anger and mental-health problems, lashes out against a society he feels has wronged him. Both a video, complete with cliché maniacal laughter, and a 140-page manifesto have been published online which, if confirmed as Elliot Rodger’s, detail a young man consumed with rage over his inability to connect with women. Family members had apparently contacted police in the weeks prior to the violent assault but, unlike in some other cases, attempts to warn authorities did not divert this horrific crime. Initial reports note that Rodger stabbed to death three roommates before beginning his shooting spree, but his anger appears to have been particularly directed at women. This has led some to speculate that cultural misogyny has contributed to this shooting. For instance, Jessica Valenti, writing in the Guardian, states that “Rodger, like most young American men, was taught that he was entitled to sex and female attention.” And Valenti isn’t the only writer to see cultural misogyny at the core of this shooting. Some reports suggest Rodger may have associated with “men’s rights” groups that view women as hostile. Misogyny, in all forms, remains a significant problem for society. Women still don’t enjoy pay equity with men, and are underrepresented in core positions of power in business and politics. Violence toward women has thankfully dropped over the previous two decades, but remains intolerably high. The last election cycle brought us odd comments about “legitimate rape” and fights over women’s rights to contraception medical coverage. It’s not difficult to understand why women would perceive the deck being culturally stacked against them. That misogyny can, and certain does, spill over into violence in the case of (one hopes) a small percentage of men whose anger toward women is beyond control. Linking cultural misogyny to a specific mass shooting is more difficult, however. Although I understand Valenti’s point, I suspect cultural messages on the interaction between men and women are more complex than merely saying that men are taught to feel “entitled” to women’s attention. And although Rodger appears to have been particularly angry at women (and men who were successful with women as he was not), there’s little common thread among mass-homicide perpetrators to target women. Mass-homicide perpetrators often target groups they particularly feel have wronged them, whether their own families, their work colleagues or society as a whole. Marginalized groups are sometimes targeted such as the recent shooting by a 73-year-old man outside a Jewish center. But often mass-homicide perpetrators basically target everyone, every member of a society that the perpetrator thinks has left them high and dry. The very isolation that mass-homicide perpetrators feel makes them unlikely candidates to respond to societal trends. Rodger appears to have indeed been a misogynist, but this misogyny appears to have raged from within, a product of his anger, sexual frustrations and despondency rather than anything “taught” to him by society. Had he not been so focused on his own sexual inadequacies, his focus might simply have moved to mall-goers rather than sorority sisters. We have an unfortunate trend when mass shootings occur to focus on idiosyncratic elements as potential causes. That is to say, we look for something unique about the shooter to explain why they may have done what they did. The January 2011 Tucson shooting by Jared Loughner was initially (and incorrectly) blamed by some on right-wing political demagoguery. A rare 2010 shooting by a woman, college professor Amy Bishop, led some to speculate on the traumatic experience of tenure denial. Video games are conveniently blamed when the shooter is young, then ignored when a shooter is older. All of this serves to distract us from the commonalities between such shooters. With few exceptions, they are angry, resentful, mentally ill individuals. Certainly, we are right to worry about the stigmatization of the mentally ill, the vast majority of whom are nonviolent. But pretending no link exists at all with these crimes, if anything, prevents us from considering an overhaul to our mental-health system that could service all individuals in need, whether at any risk for violence or not. Talking about a little of this as a cause of one crime and blaming a little of that for another prevent us from considering real comprehensive reform for our nearly nonexistent system for addressing chronic mental-health issues. Ferguson is associate professor and department chair of psychology at Stetson University. He has published numerous scientific articles on the topic of video games and mental health and recently served as guest editor for an American Psychological Association’s special journal issue on the topic. Ferguson is also the editor of Violent Crime: Clinical and Social Implications and the author of The Suicide Kings.

""No arrests have been made in the mass shooting,"" Little Rock police tweeted Sunday. The shooting rampage erupted at Power Ultra Lounge around 2:30 a.m. local time Saturday morning, police said. Twenty-five people were shot and three others were injured in the chaotic scramble to flee the club. Kyanna Bogan, who was in the lounge, said she ducked to the floor when the gunshots rang out. “We heard another round of gunshots, and we were tumbling down the stairs to get out the door,"" she said. “Everybody running and screaming and ‘help me’ and ‘I can’t find this person.’ It was sad and scary. I never thought I’d have to go through something like that."" Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said the shooting apparently stemmed from a dispute between two gang-related groups in the crowded nightclub and was not terror-related.

In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, gun control advocates criticized Republican lawmakers for their sponsorship of a bill that would make it easier to buy suppressors, often popularly referred to as silencers. “I don’t know when its going to be scheduled,” Ryan said of the bill. We’re focusing on passing our budget.” On Sunday, 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured in a shooting at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. The shooting drew attention to the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, or SHARE Act, which would make it easier to hunt and fish on federal land as well as reduce regulations on the purchase of suppressors. Despite the “silencer” name, suppressors do not make gunshots silent. Even with a suppressor in place, an AR-15 rifle is roughly as loud as a jackhammer. Supporters say the bill is about protecting recreational gun users from hearing loss. A senior Republican leadership aide disputed that the decision not to hold a vote had anything to do with the shooting. “This package had unresolved issues within our conference prior to this week and was not scheduled for the floor prior to this incident. These Democrat narratives just aren’t true,” said the aide. The debate over this bill was last postponed in June, after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was shot after a gunman opened fire on a Republican practice for the Congressional baseball game in June. Scalise spent weeks in the hospital, and only returned to the Capitol last week. Nash Jenkins contributed to this report.

The lawsuit has to do with an editorial the NYT ran on June 14 that falsely smeared Palin as inciting the 2011 shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords by a mentally ill man. There is no evidence to support the NYT’s implication that Palin played a role in inciting the Giffords shooting. (RELATED: NYT Uses GOP Shooting To Falsely Attack Sarah Palin With Debunked Conspiracy Theory) “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for defaming her by publishing a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011,” Palin’s suit states. “Specifically, on June 14, 2017, The Times Editorial Board, which represents the ‘voice’ of The Times, falsely stated as a matter of fact to millions of people that Mrs. Palin incited Jared Loughner’s January 8, 2011, shooting rampage at a political event in Tucson, Arizona, during which he shot nineteen people, severely wounding United States Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and killing six, including Chief U.S. District Court Judge John Roll and a nine-year-old girl.” The lawsuit states that the paper “published and promoted its Editorial Board’s column despite knowing that the linchpin of its ‘sickening pattern’ of politically-incited shootings was the false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited Loughner to murder six people, among them a child and federal judge, and seriously wound numerous others.” (RELATED: NYT Has Been Pushing Palin-Giffords Falsehood For Years) It goes on to state: “As the public backlash over The Times’ malicious column mounted, it responded by making edits and ‘corrections’ to its fabricated story, along with half-hearted Twitter apologies–none of which sufficiently corrected the falsehoods that the paper published. In fact, none mentioned Mrs. Palin or acknowledged that Mrs. Palin did not incite a deranged man to commit murder.” Palin claims the editorial “exceeded the bounds of legality, decency and civility by publishing the false and defamatory column.” She is seeking a minimum of $75,000 in damages. The full lawsuit can be seen below. Sarah Palin sues the New York Times for defamation by Peter Hasson on Scribd  In the NYT’s editorial, which has since been updated, the editors claimed there was a “clear” link to incitement between Jared Loughner’s attempted assassination of Giffords, and a map Palin had created that placed crosshairs over districts that Republicans needed to flip in the 2012 election. No such link exists. [dcquiz] CNN’s Jake Tapper pointed out in response to the NYT editorial that “even way back in Jan 2011 we knew that Loughlin’s obsession began 3 years before the Palin map.” Tapper made that same exact point back in 2011 when he worked for ABC. After harsh criticism in the media, the NYT finally added a correction that read: “An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established.” The NYT editorial followed the attempted mass assassination of Republican lawmakers by a left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter, who espoused anti-Republican rhetoric on his Facebook page and belonged to several anti-GOP groups on Facebook, including one titled, “Terminate The Republican Party.” The Daily Caller is awaiting comment from the NYT.

Suzanne Hodgkinson became so concerned with her husband’s growing anger that she wrote to his doctor asking for help. Now, the wife of the man who opened fire on a congressional baseball team in June wonders what more she could have done. “I get up every morning feeling guilty because I didn’t stop it,” Ms. Hodgkinson said Wednesday at her home in Belleville, where the blinds are drawn tight and photographs of her husband adorn a living room wall. It was her first sit-down interview with a reporter since her husband, James Thomas Hodgkinson, attacked a Republican congressional baseball team practice in Alexandria, Va., wounding Representative Steve Scalise and three other people before the authorities killed him. (Mr. Scalise remains hospitalized in fair condition.) Ms. Hodgkinson continued, “I wake up with hot sweats, thinking: ‘You should have known. You should have known.’” To be the spouse, or the parent, or the child of someone who commits a mass shooting is to enter a strange club whose members are envied by no one and reviled by many. Rites of passage include hate mail, death threats and the vicious thoughts that haunt them at night. That they should have seen it coming. That they could have done something. That they are alone. And then there is the question of how to mourn. How to dispose of a body that everyone else wants to forget. On Tuesday, Ms. Hodgkinson, 65, received an email at her job at an accountant’s office on Main Street, asking her to identify the body. A formality. When she opened the attachment, her husband’s swollen face stared back at her. “That’s Tom,” she said she had written back, before hitting delete. She would like to deal with Mr. Hodgkinson’s remains as quickly and quietly as possible, she said. He was not a bad man at his core, she believes. They married in 1984. When they met, he was happy, singing in her ear at a grocery store. Later, they took in some 35 foster children and adopted two. But in the late 1990s, after a long illness, he took a turn, she said. His rage came more suddenly. Now she wants it all to go away. She has asked a funeral home run by a friend to cremate Mr. Hodgkinson’s body. After that, she may scatter the ashes at home, or bury them in nearby St. Louis. She won’t be informing the public. There will be no ceremony. “Coldhearted as it may be, I’m done,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “He was not a religious man, and I’m done with this. I want this to get over. I want my granddaughters to be able to go to school in September without this being dredged up.” She paused, then spoke as if Mr. Hodgkinson were sitting on the couch next to her. “You just walked out on me.” The number of mass shootings in the United States has risen sharply in recent years — to an average of 16.4 per year between 2007 and 2013, from 6.4 per year between 2000 and 2006. (These numbers come from the F.B.I. and exclude episodes tied to domestic violence and gangs.) Each of these attacks has left the families of innocent victims awash in pain, with a growing number of Americans roped into the indelible trauma of a sudden, senseless, violent attack. And more and more, communities and individuals are having to wrestle with how to treat the bodies of these perpetrators. Relatives of people who commit mass shootings often choose secret burials in unmarked graves with small or nonexistent ceremonies, designed to keep away critics and vandals. This has not stopped the onslaught of attention and condemnation. Bodies hold symbolic power, said Ann Neumann, a visiting scholar at New York University who studies death, with places of interment often seen as reflections of how society valued a person. Which is why people get so worked up when a major criminal is buried in their backyard. After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, protesters lined up outside a funeral home that had agreed to accept the body of one of the attackers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, holding signs that urged his family to “Bury the Garbage in the Landfill.” After the attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, relatives of the killers, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, interred their bodies in a cemetery far from their California home after a closer graveyard rejected them. Soon, a city near the cemetery passed an ordinance prohibiting the burial of known terrorists in the area. Someone took a saw to the sign marking the American Islamic Institute of Antelope Valley, which maintains the plots, hacking it to pieces. “I had rocks thrown at me. I was spit on. People shot at me with BB guns,” said Peter Stefan, the funeral director who handled the Tsarnaev burial. It took a week to find a cemetery that would take the remains. Eventually, the bomber’s family washed his body according to Muslim tradition and buried him in a Virginia plot under the cover of night. Mr. Stefan said he had helped bury the bomber “to show society that we are really a few steps ahead of people like this guy.” He added, “We did for him what he probably would never have done for anybody else.” In 1999, after Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb, a handful of people went to a ceremony for Mr. Klebold. He lay in a cardboard coffin surrounded by stuffed animals. At the time, the Rev. Don Marxhausen, who spoke at the ceremony, called the Klebolds “the loneliest people on the planet.” A year after the funeral, he was ousted from his church, amid tension over his involvement with the case. He later said he had done it out of a sense of duty and would do it again. “When your phone rings, you go,” he told The Denver Post. Mr. Klebold’s mother, Sue Klebold, said in a recent interview that a colleague had urged her to have the funeral, arguing that it would help with the grieving process. It did. “When you lose a loved one who has hurt other people, one of the struggles you have is the ability to focus on your sorrow, because your grief is so complicated by all these other things,” she said. She gradually came out of hiding and wrote a memoir. Today, when she is out in public and someone mentions that her name is familiar, she can be open. “I think you’re probably thinking of my son Dylan,” she says, “who was one of the shooters in the Columbine tragedy.” Here, Ms. Hodgkinson is wrestling with the legacy of the man she loved. She denies that he ever assaulted any of their children, which was alleged in decade-old court documents. Neighbors have urged her not to mow the lawn, for fear she’ll be attacked in her yard. A friend takes out her trash, dispersing it around town to evade snoops. When she ventured to the Shop ’N Save alone recently, a white-haired woman — a stranger — approached her in the parking lot and slapped her across the face. “That was O.K.,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “Get it out, lady. Just don’t pick up a gun and shoot somebody.” She cried all the way home. It was during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mr. Hodgkinson’s Democratic politics boiled into a rage, she said. He sided with Senator Bernie Sanders. When Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Hodgkinson said, her husband went “bananas.” She urged him to take action locally. He said he wanted to go to the top. In March, he left for Washington, saying that he was going to work on tax reform. She figured he would return, she would retire and they would buy a motorcycle “and just go for days on end.” He emailed the family and expressed frustration with Washington’s intransigence. On June 14, she woke to the sounds of her 2-year-old grandson. As she does every morning, she turned on the television and fed her grandson cookies and milk. The anchors were already talking about the shooting, and it briefly occurred to her that her husband might have done it. He had been so angry. Then the reporters mentioned that the attacker had a rifle. She figured it couldn’t be Tom. He had left for Washington with only his pistol.

164,http://time.com/33444/sandy-hook-shooting-newtown-connecticut-school-design/,"The Connecticut town that endured one of the worst school shootings in American history in 2012 has decided on a design for its new elementary school, which will replace the now-demolished site of the mass shooting with a structure built to be serene, safe and cost-effective. The new building plan in Newtown, Conn., from the architecture firm Svigals + Partners, portrays a building set further back into the woods, away from street traffic, the New York Times reports. The design was nicknamed “Main Street” for its curving façade and main hallway intended to evoke outstretched arms that “reach out and embrace the children as they come in,” firm-founder Barry Svigals said. Corridors extending off the main hallway end in elevated tree-house-like rooms where children can collaborate or take a moment to reflect alone, the Times reports. The design was conceived to ensure views of the surrounding woods and lots of natural light. When the new building finally welcomes schoolchildren back to class in what planners estimate will be two-and-a-half years, one last relic of the old building, where Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012 before taking his own life, will remain: the old Sandy Hook Elementary flag pole. The cost of the new structure—which one member of the building commission said was the most cost-efficient of the three final proposals considered—will be covered by $50 million in bonds raised by the state.

165,http://time.com/5011322/ruger-ar-556-rifle-texas-church-shooting/?xid=homepage,"Devin Patrick Kelley, the man officials have identified as the suspect in a mass shooting at a Texas church that left at least 26 people dead on Sunday, used a Ruger AR-556 rifle during his rampage. Freeman Martin, the regional director of Texas Department of Public Safety, said during a news conference that the Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, at 11.20 a.m. on Sunday. Kelley, who was wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest, then got out of his vehicle, crossed the street to the church, and began his assault. As Kelley left the church, a local resident grabbed his own weapon and engaged him. “The suspect dropped his rifle, which was a Ruger AR assault-type rifle, and fled from the church,” Martin said on Sunday. Kelley was later found dead in his vehicle with what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said during a Monday news conference. Here’s more about the gun Devin Kelley is suspected of using in the Texas church shooting. Kelley bought the Ruger AR-556 rifle in April of 2016 from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, CNN reports, citing a law enforcement official. The AR-556 is a semi-automatic weapon with a suggested retail price of $799, though it appears to be available at lower prices from several retailers. It’s similar to the AR-15, a weapon based on the military M-16 rifle. It’s known for being highly customizable. Unlike the M-16, the AR-556 does not have burst or automatic fire modes. But modifications like a bump stock can allow AR-15-style rifles to fire at rates closer to those of automatic weapons. (Such modifications were reportedly used by the shooter in Las Vegas in October.) Aside from the AR-556, Kelley had two handguns in his vehicle, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the Houston Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Those guns were a Glock 9mm and Ruger 22. All three firearms were purchased by the suspect, Milanowski said during Monday morning’s news conference. Kelley, a former member of the U.S. Air Force, was court-martialed in 2012 after assaulting his spouse and child, the Los Angeles Times reports. Kelley served a year in confinement, had his rank reduced and received a bad conduct discharge. Members of the military who are dishonorably discharged are legally barred from purchasing a gun. But it isn’t clear if the same restriction applies to those who receive a bad conduct discharge. Milanowski said authorities were still gathering information to determine the exact nature of Kelley’s discharge. Until that task is complete, “we will not have a determination on if this individual was prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms,” Milanowski said.

166,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/10/americas-future-is-texas?mbid=synd_digg,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories With right-wing zealots taking over the legislature even as the state’s demographics shift leftward, Texas has become the nation’s bellwether. By Lawrence Wright When Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Texas, in 1853, he became besotted with the majesty of the Texas legislature. “I have seen several similar bodies at the North; the Federal Congress; and the Parliament of Great Britain, in both its branches, on occasions of great moment; but none of them commanded my involuntary respect for their simple manly dignity and trustworthiness for the duties that engaged them, more than the General Assembly of Texas,” he wrote. This passage is possibly unique in the political chronicles of the state. Fairly considered, the Texas legislature is more functional than the United States Congress, and more genteel than the House of Commons. But a recurrent crop of crackpots and ideologues has fed the state’s reputation for aggressive know-nothingism and proudly retrograde politics. I’ve lived in Texas for most of my life, and I’ve come to appreciate what the state symbolizes, both to people who live here and to those who view it from afar. Texans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free. Outsiders see us as the nation’s id, a place where rambunctious and disavowed impulses run wild. Texans, it is thought, mindlessly celebrate individualism, and view government as a kind of kryptonite that weakens the entrepreneurial muscles. We’re reputed to be braggarts; careless with money and our personal lives; a little gullible, but dangerous if crossed; insecure, but obsessed with power and prestige. Texans, however, are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of NPR. It is progressive, blue, reasonable, secular, and smug—almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland. It’s endless bluster and endless ads. Paranoia and piety are the main items on the menu. Texas has been growing at a stupefying rate for decades. The only state with more residents is California, and the number of Texans is projected to double by 2050, to 54.4 million, almost as many people as in California and New York combined. Three Texas cities—Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio—are already among the top ten most populous in the country. The eleventh largest is Austin, the capital, where I live. For the past five years, it has been one of the fastest-growing large cities in America; it now has nearly a million people, dwarfing the college town I fell in love with almost forty years ago. Because Texas represents so much of modern America—the South, the West, the plains, the border, the Latino community, the divide between rural areas and cities—what happens here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation. Illinois and New Jersey may be more corrupt, and Kansas and Louisiana more out of whack, but they don’t bear the responsibility of being the future. I’ve always had a fascination with Texas’s outsized politics. In 2000, I wrote a play that was set in the state’s House of Representatives. The protagonist, Sonny Lamb, was a rancher from West Texas who represented House District 74, which, in real life, stretches across thirty-seven thousand square miles. (That’s larger than Indiana.) While I was doing research for the play, I met in Austin with Pete Laney, a Democrat and a cotton farmer from Hale County, who, at the time, was the speaker of the House. Laney was known as a scrupulously fair and honest leader who inspired a bipartisan spirit among the members. The grateful representatives called him Dicknose. We sat down in the Speaker’s office, at the capitol. I explained that I was having a plot problem: my hero had introduced an ethics-reform bill, which triggered a war with the biggest lobbyist in the state. How could the lobbyist retaliate? Laney rubbed his hands together. “Well, you could put a toxic-waste dump in Sonny’s district,” he observed. “That would mess him up, right and left.” Laney’s suggestion was inspired by an actual law that the Texas House of Representatives had passed in 1991. It allowed sewage sludge from New York City to be shipped, by train, to a little desert town in District 74, Sierra Blanca, which is eighty miles southeast of El Paso. The train became known as the Poo-Poo Choo-Choo. “Another thing,” I said. “I’d like my lobbyist to take some legislators on a hunting trip. What would they likely be hunting?” “Pigs,” Laney said. “Pigs?” “Wild pigs—they’re taking over the whole state!” Laney said. Feral pigs are a remnant of the Spanish colonization, and now we’ve got as many as three million of them, tearing up fences and pastureland and mowing down crops, even eating the seed corn out of the ground before it sprouts. They can run twenty-five miles per hour. “You ever seen one?” Laney went on. “Huge. They got these tusks out to here.” “How do you hunt them?” “Well, I don’t hunt ’em myself, but I got a friend who does.” He punched an intercom button on his phone. “Honey, get Sharp on the line,” he said. In a moment, John Sharp was on the loudspeaker. The former state comptroller of public accounts, he is now the chancellor of the Texas A. & M. system. “Sharp,” Laney said, “I got a young man here wants to know how you hunt pigs.” “Oh!” Sharp cried. “Well, we do it at night, with pistols. Everybody wearing cutoffs and tennis shoes. We’ll set the dogs loose, and when they start baying we come running. Now, the dogs will go after the pig’s nuts, so the pig will back up against a tree to protect himself. So then you just take your pistol and pop him in the eye.” And these were progressive Democrats. More or less. For more than a century, Texas was under Democratic rule. The state was always culturally conservative, religious, and militaristic, but a strain of pragmatism kept it from being fully swept up in racism and right-wing ideology. Economic populism, especially in the rural areas, offered a counterweight to the capitalists in the cities. But in the nineteen-seventies the state began shifting rightward. Bill Miller, a lobbyist in Austin and a longtime student of Texas politics, dates the change to May, 1976, when Ronald Reagan beat Gerald Ford in the Texas Republican primary. “Reagan won every Texas delegate and the popular vote two to one,” Miller told me. “He smoked an incumbent Republican President and his mainstream followers with a heretofore unknown coalition of conservatives. That day lit the conservative fuse. Suddenly, they knew they had the numbers to win.” Ford went on to gain the nomination, but he lost the Presidency to Jimmy Carter—the last Democratic nominee to carry Texas. In 1978, Bill Clements became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. To help him reach constituents, Clements hired a young direct-mail wizard named Karl Rove, who became a central figure in Texas’s transformation from blue to red. Rove attributes the change to the growth of the suburbs and the gradual movement of the rural areas into the Republican column: “They went from being economic populists, who thought the system was rigged against them by Wall Street, to being social and conservative populists, who thought that government was the problem.” Moderate and conservative Democratic politicians followed the voters to the Republican Party. Rick Perry, for one, served three terms in the Texas House as a Democrat, and even campaigned for Al Gore in his 1988 Presidential run, before changing parties, in 1989. In 1994, Texas elected its last statewide Democrat. “It was a complete rout of a political party,” Miller said. While George W. Bush was governor, between 1995 and 2000, a cordial détente between the political parties prevailed. The lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, and Speaker Laney were both Democrats, and, when Bush ran for President, they became exhibits in his argument that he would be a bipartisan leader. Like Lyndon Johnson, Bullock had a huge, battered face and an unbridled love of Texas, which allowed him to see past the barriers of party loyalties. (His legend was only enhanced by his ruinous personal life: alcoholism, cancer, chronic depression, five marriages.) At Bush’s fiftieth-birthday party, at the governor’s mansion, in July, 1996, Bullock offered a toast to the Governor as “the next President of the United States.” As far as I know, that was the first time such a statement had been made about Bush in public, and it was by the highest Democratic official in the state. In January, 2003, the Republicans finally took over the Texas legislature, and Laney lost the speakership to Tom Craddick, an ultraconservative Republican from Midland, the oil capital. More than anyone, Craddick was responsible for securing a Republican majority in the House, through clever fund-raising and indefatigable campaigning. “There were eight other Republicans in the House when I got elected, in 1969, and two in the Senate,” Craddick told me recently. “The first time I tried to introduce a bill, they told me I couldn’t, because I was a Republican.” When he entered the House, he was twenty-five—the youngest member. “Back then, most of the other members were retired, and they ran for office as a civic duty,” he said. Now, at seventy-three, he is the longest-serving legislator in Texas history. Craddick is slight and white-haired, wry and friendly, with a slur in his speech and a shuffle in his step. He’s easy to miss in the crowd of vigorous young legislators, few of whom were in office when Craddick turned the House into a Republican domain. His crusade started in the late eighties, he recalled. Initially, the Party had barely any infrastructure, and so he helped to organize candidates’ campaigns, requiring them to report how many doors they had knocked on and how many mailers they had sent out. Craddick was the first Republican speaker since 1873. With his election to the post, the coup was complete. “But it wasn’t just about winning elections,” he told me. “We had a redistricting plan.” In the 2002 elections, fifty-six per cent of Texans who voted for a U.S. representative chose a Republican, but Democrats nevertheless held more seats in the U.S. House—seventeen seats to the Republicans’ fifteen. Craddick worked with Congressman Tom DeLay, who was then the Majority Whip, to put into motion a sweeping plan to create a permanent Republican majority in the U.S. House. Under Craddick’s leadership, the Texas legislature began carving historical congressional districts into new fiefdoms. Taking care not to violate Supreme Court guidelines on minority representation, lawmakers jigsawed Texas into shapes that would decisively capture the state for the right. In May, 2003, the redistricting plan came up for a vote in the Texas House. Fifty-three Democrats, sensing a lethal threat to their party, fled to Oklahoma, denying Craddick a quorum. He locked the capitol chamber, to prevent any more defections, and called out state troopers to hunt down the missing members, who became known as the Killer Ds. In the midst of this hubbub, Pete Laney, the former speaker, flew his Piper turboprop from the Panhandle to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where he joined his Democratic colleagues at the local Holiday Inn. Someone from DeLay’s office obtained Laney’s flight plan from the Department of Homeland Security by implying that Laney’s plane was overdue to land and might have crashed or been seized by terrorists. Texas troopers and national reporters swarmed into Ardmore. The Democratic faction remained in Oklahoma for four days, until the deadline for considering new legislation had passed. The governor, Rick Perry—by then a stalwart Republican—called a special session for late June, whereupon eleven Democratic state senators decamped to New Mexico. It took two more special sessions to ram the vote through. The redistricting had a revolutionary effect. Today, the Texas delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives includes twenty-five Republicans and eleven Democrats—a far more conservative profile than the political demography of the state. The Austin metropolitan area, the heart of the Texas left, was divvied up into six congressional districts, with city residents a minority in each. All but one of these districts are now held by Republicans. I’m currently represented by Roger Williams, a conservative automobile dealer from Weatherford, two hundred miles north of Austin. Another Republican congressman, Lamar Smith, lives in San Antonio, but his district includes—and neutralizes—the liberal area surrounding the University of Texas at Austin. Smith, a member of the Tea Party Caucus, in Washington, denies that human activity affects global warming. He heads the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which oversees NASA, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Lloyd Doggett is the only Democrat representing the Austin area, and his district runs along I-35, from East Austin to East San Antonio, scooping up as many Democrats as possible in one basket. Texas’s redistricting process has since been replicated in statehouses around the country, creating congressional districts that are practically immune to challenge and giving Republicans an impregnable edge in Washington. “Texas became a model for how to get control,” Craddick told me. In 2005, DeLay was prosecuted for money laundering and conspiracy, in connection with the illegal use of corporate funds. Craddick was also questioned, but he was never indicted. DeLay’s conviction was overturned on appeal, in 2013, but by then he had resigned from Congress and made an unexpected appearance on “Dancing with the Stars.” The show has become a pathway to redemption for disgraced Texas politicos. In 2014, Rick Perry was indicted for abusing gubernatorial power, after he threatened to defund an anti-corruption agency. He was later cleared, and he, too, celebrated his comeback on “Dancing with the Stars.” Now he heads the Department of Energy. I wonder if Ted Cruz can dance. Texas has always had a burlesque side to its politics. The columnist Molly Ivins made a national reputation as a humor writer by lampooning the people we elect to office. One of my favorites in this category was Mike Martin, a state representative from Longview. In 1981, someone shotgunned the trailer he lived in during his months in Austin. Martin was inside, and was slightly injured. He declared that the shooting was in reprisal for an investigation he was pursuing involving a satanic cult. Later, his cousin admitted that he had fired the weapon at Martin’s behest, ostensibly to gain Martin sympathy votes. (Martin was running for reëlection.) Martin fled Austin, but, as Ivins noted, the police “tracked him to earth at his momma’s house, where he was found hiding in the stereo cabinet.” She added, “He always did want to be the Speaker.” Ivins, who died in 2007, would have loved writing about Mary Lou Bruner, a seventy-year-old retired schoolteacher from Mineola, who last year ran as a Republican for an open seat on the Texas State Board of Education—a frequent battleground of the culture wars. Because ten per cent of American public-school students live in Texas, the state exerts a great influence on the textbook-publishing industry. During her campaign, Bruner posted on Facebook that Barack Obama had worked as a male prostitute in his twenties. “That is how he paid for his drugs,” she reasoned. Bruner went on to assert that climate change is a “ridiculous hoax,” and that dinosaurs are extinct because the ones on Noah’s Ark were too young to reproduce. Somehow, she made it to a runoff, which she then lost. In March, 2016, a man named Robert Morrow was elected the Republican Party chairman of Travis County, which contains Austin. Like many reporters in Texas, I received wild e-mails from Morrow for several years. He once claimed that George H. W. Bush was “a seriously addicted homosexual pedophile” who was also involved in a C.I.A. drug-smuggling ring with the Clintons. In 2011, Morrow took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper: HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH RICK PERRY? Are you a stripper, an escort, or just a “young hottie” impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas? Nothing came of the ad, which, Morrow said, was designed to expose Perry as “a Christian-buzzwords-spouting, ‘family values’ hypocrite and fraud.” Morrow, a fifty-three-year-old Princeton graduate with an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, describes himself as an independent investor. In 2015, he wrote a book with Roger Stone, the political operative and occasional adviser to Donald Trump, called “The Clintons’ War on Women.” The Austin American-Statesman noted that it appeared “to be serving as a playbook for Trump” in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. (Upon its publication, Trump tweeted, “The latest book on Hillary—Wow, a really tough one!”) Mainstream Party officials were mortified when Morrow won the Travis County election, with fifty-six per cent of the vote. They promised to “explore every single option that exists” to remove him from office. Morrow responded, “They can go fuck themselves.” In June, he tweeted, “Top priority for Travis GOP: beautiful Big Titty women!!” Texas Republicans were having an unhappy time of it in 2016. Rick Perry, who retired from the governorship the previous year, was K.O.’d early in the Presidential primaries, and Senator Ted Cruz, probably the most unpopular politician in Washington, was eventually overmatched by Trump. Compounding the embarrassment, Morrow announced that he was running for President himself. This turned out to be against the rules for the Travis County chairman. At a meeting held in August, the Party deposed him. Morrow, who was present at the meeting, wearing a floppy motley-fool hat, did not object. That month, Trump campaigned in Austin, and Morrow, who had not endorsed a candidate besides himself, protested his party’s nominee by carrying a giant red sign that said “TRUMP IS A CHILD RAPIST.” Roger Stone, who was present at Trump’s campaign event, claimed that he had the police escort his co-author away from the rally. To add to the insult, Stone tweeted that Morrow was a “Clinton quisling.” The Texas capitol, constructed of red granite, was completed in 1888. The state was destitute then, and paid for the building with three million acres of public land in the Panhandle—about the size of Connecticut. At the time, the capitol was said to be the seventh-largest building in the world, and, as one would expect, it is somewhat taller than its uncle in Washington, D.C. During the summer in Austin, nighthawks swirl around the crowning statue on the dome: the Goddess of Liberty, holding aloft a golden star. The legislature meets every other year for a hundred and forty days, reflecting the state’s native aversion to government. The sessions begin on the second Tuesday in January and end around Memorial Day. The legislature’s only mandated task is to produce a two-year balanced budget. In the 2015 session, the state budget worked out to about a hundred billion dollars per year. This year, a drop in the price of oil and a rise in population augured substantial cutbacks and a struggle to meet the health and safety needs of citizens. When I visited the capitol in January, a group of high-school girls stood on a terrazzo mosaic in the middle of the rotunda. In the center was the seal of the Republic of Texas, a lone star wreathed in branches of olive and live oak. “It’s two hundred and eighteen feet from this star to the one above,” a guide told them, gesturing to its mate, on the ceiling of the dome. “You could fit the Statue of Liberty in here.” On the walls of the rotunda hang portraits of our former governors. When the current governor, the staunchly conservative Greg Abbott, leaves office, his portrait will go where Rick Perry’s is now, and those of all the previous forty-seven governors will take one step to the left. When a portrait arrives at the end of the circle on the ground floor, it moves to the wall of the floor above, and then higher and higher and further into obscurity. The next portrait that will ascend from the lobby is that of W. Lee (Pappy) O’Daniel. In some respects, O’Daniel, a Democrat, was a precursor of Donald Trump. When he successfully ran for governor, in 1938, he was a political naïf who had never cast a ballot, and he wasn’t even eligible to vote in that election, because he hadn’t paid his poll tax. He passed himself off as a rube, but he was a savvy operator. He had become famous as the host of a radio show in which he performed with his band, the Light Crust Doughboys. Radio was his Twitter. His only real platform was to stir things up. When his opponents staged a rally, hundreds would attend, but O’Daniel’s speeches attracted tens of thousands. In his first race, he defeated eleven contenders, without a runoff. As governor, he reneged on promises he had made to abolish the death penalty, block the sales tax, and raise pensions. He was a scaremonger, railing against “Communistic labor-leader racketeers” and politically controlled newspapers. He was terribly ineffectual but such a compelling showman that, in 1941, voters sent him to the U.S. Senate over a young man named Lyndon Johnson—the only election Johnson ever lost. The portrait of O’Daniel in the rotunda shows a handsome, full-faced man with slicked-back hair and a “Who, me?” look in his eye. Next to him is O’Daniel’s calmer successor, Coke Stevenson, and the bon vivant Beauford Jester, who, according to legend, died in the arms of his mistress, on the midnight sleeper to Houston. Of all the governors on the rotunda walls, Ann Richards, who served from 1991 to 1995, was the most memorable, at least in my lifetime. She had stark-white hair that was swept and sprayed into a blinding pompadour—Molly Ivins called it “hard hair”—and a switchblade sense of humor that was honed on the primitive male chauvinism she had grown up with. She became a national figure when, as the state treasurer, she gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. “Poor George,” she said of the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. “He can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.” She wasn’t nice, but she had a wonderful smile, and batted her icy-blue eyes as she stuck the knife in. Her rise to governor, as a recovered alcoholic and a divorced mother of four, was a near-miracle. Her wealthy Republican opponent—the West Texas rancher and oilman Clayton Williams, Jr.—had a double-digit lead in the polls when the general election began. He blew that lead with a series of character-revealing gaffes. He told reporters that inclement weather was like rape: “If it’s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.” He had to fight off persistent rumors that he had invited his ranch hands and clients to join in “honey hunts,” which involved scattering prostitutes on his property like Easter eggs. Then, at a forum in Dallas, he met Richards, who stuck out her hand and said, “Hello, Claytie.” He declined the gesture, violating the cowboy code that is deeply ingrained in every Texan. In that instant, he lost the election. Richards wore designer suits but picked her teeth, and she cleaned her fingernails with a Swiss Army knife. She always seemed a little surprised to find herself in the seat of power, but she cherished the comedy of the play she was cast in. Ivins once told me that, after the A.C.L.U. filed suit against a manger scene in the capitol, she called Governor Richards and asked, “Annie, is it really necessary to remove the crèche?” “I’m afraid so,” Richards replied. “And it’s a shame, because it’s about the only time we ever had three wise men in the capitol.” Richards had the most amazing drawl—devastatingly comic, but with a cut-the-crap edge to it. She was a flirt, and she loved dirty jokes and risqué stories. Once, we both took part in a fund-raiser at the Four Seasons in Austin, and the writer Kinky Friedman—who is also the lead singer of Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys—seized the opportunity to tell a story about going to the beach with a family friend, who wore a swimsuit that was so tight it squeezed one of his balls into view. It’s not that funny when I tell it, but Governor Richards laughed so hard that she could barely stay in her chair. Texas has a reputation for being super-religious, but there has always been a tolerance for the sexual misdemeanors of elected officials. Charlie Wilson, the U.S. representative from the Second District, in East Texas, one of the most conservative parts of the state, was a drunk, a drug user, and the most energetic playboy on Capitol Hill, who enjoyed lounging in hot tubs with showgirls and cocaine. He was elected to twelve terms. Texans’ tolerance for sexual liberty didn’t extend to Richards, however. She surrounded herself with a coterie of very powerful women, which led to countless innuendos about her sexual orientation. She complained to a lobbyist I know, “I could be fucking Charlie Wilson on Sam Houston’s bed, and they’d still call me a lesbian.” After one term, Richards was defeated by George W. Bush, marking the end of the Democratic Party as a force of any consequence in the state. Texans are notorious for loving guns, but when I was young it was illegal for residents to carry weapons outside their home or vehicle. In 1991, George Hennard, a thirty-five-year-old unemployed man, drove his Ford pickup through the plate-glass window of the Luby’s cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, where some eighty people were having lunch. At first, everyone thought that it was a freakish accident. Then Hennard shot a customer. “Is it worth it, Texas?” he cried. “This is payback day.” Suzanna Hupp, a chiropractor, was having lunch with her parents. “My father and I got down on the floor and put the table up in front of us,” she later testified before Congress. She reached for her purse, where she kept her revolver, then realized that she had left her gun in her car, fearing that she might lose her chiropractor’s license if she were caught carrying a concealed weapon. Her father confronted the shooter, but he was shot. Hupp told her mother that they needed to make a break for it, then climbed out a rear window. When she looked back, she realized that her mother had gone to comfort her dying husband. Hennard put a bullet in her mother’s head. He shot fifty people, killing twenty-three of them before killing himself. It’s the fourth-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “I’m not really mad at the guy who did this,” Hupp told lawmakers in Washington. “That’s like being mad at a rabid dog.” She continued, “I’m mad at my legislators for legislating me out of the right to protect myself and my family.” In 1996, Hupp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, and she subsequently passed a law that allowed concealed weapons to be carried. Since then, it’s also become legal to carry guns openly. I’ve yet to see anyone in public strapping a sidearm, but the law is tremendously popular. Especially among Texas politicians, there’s a locker-room lust for weaponry that belies noble-sounding proclamations about self-protection and Second Amendment rights. In 2010, Governor Perry boasted of killing with a single shot a coyote that was menacing his daughter’s Labrador. Perry was jogging at the time, but naturally he was packing heat: a .380 Ruger. The gun’s manufacturer promptly issued a Coyote Special edition of the gun, which comes in a box labelled “FOR SALE TO TEXANS ONLY.” An eccentric feature of Texas’s new gun laws is that people entering the state capitol can skip the long lines of tourists waiting to pass through metal detectors if they show guards a license-to-carry permit. In other words, the people most likely to bring weapons into the building aren’t scanned at all. Many of the people who breeze through are lawmakers and staffers who tote concealed weapons into offices or onto the floor of the legislature. But some lobbyists and reporters have also obtained gun licenses, just to skirt the lines. I recently got one myself. One winter day at the capitol, early in the 2017 session, I was bypassing the metal detectors when Governor Abbott rushed by in his wheelchair. At fifty-nine, he is an energetic man; his aides were racing across the rotunda to keep up with him. Abbott was a track star in high school—he is said to have never lost a race—but in 1984 a tree fell on him while he was jogging through the wealthy enclave of River Oaks, in Houston, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He had just graduated from law school and had no health insurance. Fortunately, he won a nine-million-dollar judgment against the homeowner whose tree had fallen and the company that had inspected the tree and failed to recommend its removal. Later, Abbott, as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and then as attorney general, supported measures that capped pain-and-suffering damages in medical-malpractice cases at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Abbott’s overarching issue is fending off the malevolent influence of California, which is widely seen as Texas’s political antithesis: it is more regulated and highly taxed, whereas Texas is relatively unfettered, with one of the lowest tax burdens in the country. Every statewide officeholder in California is a Democrat; in Texas, none are. Nevertheless, in 2015, Abbott declared, “Texas is being California-ized, and you may not even be noticing it.” He went on, “This is being done at the city level, with bag bans, fracking bans, tree-cutting bans. We’re forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.” He warned that the “Texas miracle” could become a “California nightmare.” The obsession with California puzzles me. I play the keyboards in a blues band, and our drummer has a sticker on his kit saying “Stop Californication of Texas Music.” The mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, is a Democrat, but he recently warned that, if our city stays on its current path, “we’ll end up like San Francisco,” with out-of-control housing costs. The newspapers often feature gloating stories about the number of Californians fleeing to Texas (eight per day to Austin alone), as an indication of the vast superiority of the Texas way of life. Although Abbott has a lower national profile than his predecessors Rick Perry and George W. Bush, he clearly has similar ambitions. In January, when the legislative session began, he latched on to a proposal, already adopted by ten other states, to call a constitutional convention aimed at reining in the power of the federal government. Abbott rebranded it as the Texas Plan. It would require the federal government to balance its budget, as Texas does, and would prohibit federal agencies—such as the E.P.A. and the Department of Labor—from issuing regulations that override state laws. As Texas’s attorney general, from 2002 to 2015, Abbott was on the losing end of many lawsuits that he filed on behalf of the state against the U.S. government—he objected to the Affordable Care Act, and to many federal environmental controls. Under the Texas Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court would need a supermajority of seven Justices to strike down a state law. Abbott designated the Texas Plan an emergency item, and it quickly passed the legislature and was signed into law, worrying mainstream Republican lawmakers in Washington, who fear that, in the current political climate, such efforts could lead to a runaway assault on federal authority. Another emergency item on the Governor’s list for the 2017 session was ethics reform, but many legislators saw the move as hypocritical. Lyle Larson, a centrist Republican state representative from San Antonio, told me, “Some of the most egregious violations are in the governor’s office. It’s well known that pay-for-play has been going on in that office for years. For you to be on the Parks and Wildlife board, for instance, or to be a regent at the university, you have to make significant contributions”—to Abbott’s campaign fund. “That’s not in the Governor’s bill.” (Abbott’s press secretary, John Wittman, said, “Governor Abbott selects and appoints individuals he believes are the most qualified and capable of bringing excellence to the organizations in which they serve. Any suggestion to the contrary is absurd.”) Little came of Abbott’s ethics-reform attempt. For all of Abbott’s initiatives, the legislature’s agenda is dominated by Dan Patrick, an evangelical Christian and a former radio talk-show host from Houston, who has been the lieutenant governor since 2014. In Texas, the lieutenant governor is also the president of the Senate, and, because the Senate currently has a Republican majority, Patrick has total control over it. He appoints bills to specific committees, and no legislation comes onto the floor without his say-so. He is unquestionably the most important political figure in the state. During his radio days, Patrick developed a knack for self-promotion; he once got a vasectomy on the air. (He now owns a radio station in Houston.) Clever and relentless, Patrick brought with him to Austin the AM Texas platform of anti-abortion absolutism and hostility to same-sex marriage and undocumented immigrants. He was first elected to the Senate in 2006, running as an outsider. “It was as if Rush Limbaugh were running,” Bill Miller, the lobbyist, told me. Patrick crushed three well-known candidates in the Republican primary, and won the general election with nearly seventy per cent of the vote. Since Patrick became lieutenant governor, one of his signature accomplishments has been the passage of the open-carry gun law; he also successfully pushed to legalize the carrying of concealed weapons on public-college campuses. During the 2016 Presidential race, he deftly pivoted from supporting Ted Cruz to becoming Donald Trump’s campaign chair in Texas. Evan Smith, the co-founder of the Texas Tribune, an online journal dedicated to state politics, told me, “Dan Patrick is the most conservative person ever elected to statewide office in the history of Texas.” (Patrick himself declined to speak to The New Yorker.) Patrick has driven his chamber in a far more radical direction. Even Democratic senators are loath to cross him. In this year’s session, Patrick worked on lowering property taxes and addressing some obscure matters, such as hailstorm-lawsuit reform. But the heart of his agenda was legislation that spoke to the religious right, such as a bill that would provide vouchers for homeschooling and private-school tuition, and a “sermon safeguard” bill, which would prevent state and local officials from issuing subpoenas to members of the clergy or compelling them to testify. He also worked to toughen the state’s voter-I.D. law. Patrick’s legislative agenda, if passed in its entirety, would bend Texas farther in the direction of the affluent and, above all, would fortify the political strength of white evangelicals who feel threatened by the increasing number of minorities and by changing social mores. Patrick’s extremism is often countered by Joe Straus, the speaker of the House, a centrist, business-oriented conservative from San Antonio. Whereas the lieutenant governor is elected by the voters of the state, the speaker is chosen by the members. That makes a crucial difference in the way that Patrick and Straus govern. “Dan Patrick rules by fear,” Representative Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, told me. “Joe Straus rules by consensus.” The 2017 session in Austin proved to be a bruising example of raw politics waged by two talented people, Straus and Patrick, who fervently believe in their causes. The story in Texas both reflects and influences the national scene. At a time when Democratic voices have been sidelined—“We’re lost in the wilderness,” Wu told me—the key struggle is within the increasingly conservative Republican Party, between those who primarily align with business interests and those who are preoccupied with abortion, gay marriage, immigration, religion, and gun rights. Politicians seldom pay a price for the damage that their legislation may do in the name of popular causes, such as declaring war or slashing taxes at the expense of vital social programs. In 2011, Governor Perry vetoed a bill that would have banned texting while driving, saying that it was “a government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults.” Texas is always above the national average in the number of highway fatalities. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, more than four hundred Texans are killed every year in crashes related to distracted driving, often because they are texting. To my surprise, the sponsor of the bill that Perry vetoed was Tom Craddick, the ultraconservative former speaker. This year, he put the measure forward again, for the fourth time. He compares it to Texas’s seat-belt law, which, he notes, “is very unpopular” in his district. “But they say that ninety-five per cent of the people obey the law.” On March 29, 2017, in the middle of the legislative session, a welder named Jody Kuchler called the sheriff’s offices in Uvalde County and Real County to say that a white truck was driving recklessly down a two-lane highway, swerving all over the road. Kuchler, who was following the truck, told the cops, “He’s going to hit somebody head on or he’s going to kill his own damn self.” He then watched helplessly as the truck rammed into a bus carrying members of the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels. Thirteen people were killed. The driver of the truck was twenty-year-old Jack Dillon Young, who was largely unhurt. “He said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was texting,’ ” Kuchler told reporters. “I said, ‘Son, do you know what you just did?’ ” (Young also had Ambien and other medications in his system.) The accident was one of many that might have been prevented had Governor Perry signed the 2011 texting bill into law. That year, the Republican state legislature turned its attention instead to defunding women’s-health programs. “This is a war on birth control and abortions,” Representative Wayne Christian, a Tea Party stalwart from East Texas, admitted. “That’s what family planning is supposed to be about.” The long-term goal of cultural conservatives is to cut off access to abortion in Texas, to end state subsidies for birth control, and to gut state funding for Planned Parenthood—which, in 2011, served sixty per cent of the health needs of low-income women in the state. The legislators slashed the family-planning budget from $111.5 million to $37.9 million. Eighty-two family-planning clinics subsequently shut down. Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the nation, and, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, about seventeen per cent of Texan women and girls live in poverty. After the family-planning budget was cut, there was a disproportionate rise in births covered by Medicaid, because so many women no longer had access to birth control. By defunding Planned Parenthood, the legislature also blocked many women from getting scans for breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In May, 2011, Governor Perry, who was gearing up for his first Presidential race, signed a bill requiring all women seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least twenty-four hours before the procedure. Carol Alvarado, a Democratic state representative from Houston, pointed out on the House floor that, for a woman who is eight to ten weeks pregnant, such a law would necessitate a “transvaginal sonogram.” She then displayed the required instrument to the discomfited lawmakers: a white plastic wand resembling an elongated pistol, which would be inserted into the woman’s vagina. “Government intrusion at its best,” she observed. Nonetheless, the bill passed in the House, 107–42. When the Senate approved the bill, Dan Patrick, then a state senator, declared, “This is a great day for Texas. This is a great day for women’s health.” Between 2010 and 2014, the proportion of women who died in childbirth in Texas doubled, from 18.6 per hundred thousand live births to 35.8—the worst in the nation and higher than the rate in many developing countries. These figures represent six hundred dead women. Researchers say that it’s not entirely understood what accounts for the rise in maternal mortality in Texas, because the rate was already rising before the 2011 laws went into effect. Obesity, heart disease, drug overdoses, and a lack of health insurance—all serious problems in the state—play a role. Nevertheless, a report in the September, 2016, issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted, “In the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a two year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely.” The mystery might be cleared up if Governor Abbott released records about how these women died. In 2011, when he was attorney general, he issued an opinion stating that information about the deceased would be withheld, supposedly to prevent fraud. Dan Patrick, Rick Perry, and other Texas lawmakers who have called their bills a victory for women’s health have shown no compassion for the women who have suffered, and perhaps died, because of them. Their legislation has been equally heartless toward children. A fifth of the uninsured children in the U.S. are in Texas. In 2004, the Texas Education Agency lowered the percentage of children who can be enrolled in special-education classes from thirteen per cent (about the national average) to eight and a half per cent (the lowest in the country). According to the Houston Chronicle, tens of thousands of children have been denied the education they need because of this arbitrary limit. In 2015, a federal judge, Janis Graham Jack, ruled that, in Texas, foster children “almost uniformly leave State custody more damaged than when they entered.” The state, she said, was violating the children’s constitutional rights by exposing them to an unreasonable risk of harm. Judge Jack declared that state oversight agencies had adopted an attitude of “deliberate indifference” toward the plight of the children in their care, even in the face of repeated abuse and, sometimes, homicide. “Rape, abuse, psychotropic medication, and instability are the norm,” she added. Governor Abbott promised to overhaul the child-welfare system, but things have only worsened. In the 2016 fiscal year, at least two hundred children in Texas died of maltreatment, compared with a hundred and seventy-three the previous year, and those figures don’t include more than a hundred other deaths that are still being investigated. Child Protective Services, the state unit charged with investigating cases of abuse, is in chaos. Nevertheless, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, appealed Judge Jack’s decision to appoint a special master to oversee the state’s foster-care system, claiming that it would amount to a “federal takeover.” Nearly a year after the judge’s ruling, Child Protective Services acknowledged that caseworkers had not even visited more than forty-seven hundred children at high risk of abuse or severe neglect. Hundreds of children have been sleeping in hotels or emergency shelters, or on air mattresses in government offices, because the state has nowhere else to put them. Hundreds of caseworkers have quit, complaining that they were overworked, demoralized, poorly paid, and often placed in dangerous situations. Union leaders have said that higher pay would help attract more applicants to the job, which offers a starting salary of thirty-seven thousand dollars, but state officials countered with a plan to lower the educational requirements for caseworkers. During the 2017 legislative session, while bills addressing the child-welfare crisis were being considered, a teen-age girl who was being housed in a state office building fled in the middle of the night. She was hit by a van and killed. Fed up with the callous treatment of women and children, Jessica Farrar, a liberal state representative from Houston, filed House Bill 4260, the Man’s Right to Know Act. It satirically employed the kind of patronizing, “we’re doing this for your own good” language that characterizes the many bills directed at abortion and women’s health—for instance, requiring a sonogram and a rectal exam before prescribing Viagra. Then, there was this: Sec. 173.010. FINES RELATED TO MASTURBATORY EMISSIONS. Masturbatory emissions created in health or medical facilities will be stored for the purposes of conception for a current or future wife. (a) Emissions outside of a woman’s vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life. The bill never made it to the House floor. Lobbyists got their name because they stand in the lobby. When I returned to the capitol on February 7th, about fifty of them, almost all dark-suited men, stood outside the Senate chamber, forming a mosh pit for any legislator who might appear. Although they seem like supplicants, lobbyists actually write much of the legislation and corral the votes. Bill Miller has been working in the lobby for three decades. When he first arrived, he noticed that all the political leaders had animal heads mounted on their walls. Miller had a papier-mâché sea-lion head made up for his office. “Wow, you killed a sea lion?” an impressed legislator asked. “Yeah,” Miller said. “With a surfboard.” Inside the chamber, a crucial debate was under way about Senate Bill 4, known as the sanctuary-cities bill. One of Governor Abbott’s priorities, it essentially required Texas officials to join the Trump Administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. There are about a million such immigrants in Dallas and Houston alone. A few days earlier, four hundred and fifty people had lined up to testify before the State Affairs Committee in protest of S.B. 4, which they saw as a discriminatory measure. The line snaked around the rotunda floor and up to the second level. The hearing lasted more than sixteen hours, and broke up well after midnight. The police chiefs of Austin and San Antonio testified that S.B. 4 would harm their ability to work with immigrant communities. A young woman spoke about attempting suicide after her father was deported. In the end, the bill passed out of committee, 7–2, on partisan lines. In 2016, Sally Hernandez, a political novice of Anglo descent, was elected sheriff of Travis County, having promoted Austin as a “sanctuary city.” Federal immigration authorities often ask local law-enforcement officials to put a “detainer” on people in their custody—that is, to hold off on releasing them until their citizenship status can be verified—but Hernandez declared that she would honor such requests only in cases in which individuals were charged with a violent crime. Otherwise, people who posted bond would be released. It was as if Hernandez had opened the door to a ravenous mob of flesh-eating zombies. Perhaps she didn’t fully appreciate how suspiciously Travis County is viewed by the Republican establishment—which, increasingly, is the Tea Party establishment. Governor Abbott abruptly cut off $1.5 million in state grants to the county. He went on Bill O’Reilly’s show and said of S.B. 4, “Today, we introduced legislation that will put the hammer down on Travis County as well as any sanctuary-city policy in the state of Texas.” O’Reilly said of Sheriff Hernandez, “I don’t understand her motivation.” “She is doing it to pander to the ideology of the left, just like what you see in California,” Abbott responded. S.B. 4 was loaded up with punitive amendments, all of which were endorsed by the entirely white Republican majority. (Of the thirty-one members of the Texas Senate, only eleven are Democrats; seven are Latino.) Under one amendment, Sheriff Hernandez—whom Abbott began calling Sanctuary Sally—could be jailed for up to a year if she refused to grant a detainer. On the Senate floor, Brian Birdwell, a Republican from Granbury, southwest of Fort Worth, rose to speak in favor of the bill. Birdwell is a retired Army colonel who was badly burned in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. He has undergone thirty-nine operations and numerous skin grafts. He said that he was worried about “a culture of insubordination” emerging in Texas, adding that the next step would be outright insurrection. “What you tolerate today you’ll endorse tomorrow, and subsidize the day after.” Juan (Chuy) Hinojosa, a Democratic senator from the fertile South Texas region known as the Valley, spoke against the bill. “I agree one hundred per cent that we as a nation have the right to define our borders,” he said. But the bill, he warned, could become an excuse for the wholesale expulsion of undocumented immigrants who had committed no crimes. “I was deported when I was five,” he said. He and his father were American citizens, but his mother was undocumented. She was picking tomatoes in Hidalgo County, which abuts Mexico, when the Border Patrol arrived. “They put us in a paddy wagon, and we didn’t even have time to notify my father,” he later told me. “We lived in Mexico for a year while my father was looking for us.” Hinojosa tried to find a middle ground during the debate. “Our biggest problem, when we talk about border security, it is politicized right away,” he said. He called Sheriff Hernandez naïve and inexperienced. “She talked about honoring detainers only in cases of violent crime, but suppose you’ve got somebody who smuggled in a hundred kilos of cocaine? If you got caught committing a burglary—hell, yeah, you ought to be detained.” Hernandez defended herself in an op-ed: “Tasking our community police forces with the job of federal immigration agents creates a strain, which is why the detainer policy on nonviolent criminals is optional.” Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began a national dragnet that ostensibly targeted undocumented criminals and violent offenders. Undocumented bystanders were also picked up. Fifty-one people were seized in Austin, fewer than half of whom were criminals—a lower proportion than in any other city in the country—leading residents to believe that the city had been singled out. In an open letter, Mayor Adler said, “These raids are sowing distrust, not just with ICE but even with local law enforcement, and that makes our community less safe.” Many Mexican-Americans in Texas support stricter enforcement of immigration laws. “As long as there is no profiling of Hispanics, we understand the process,” Hinojosa told me. “Since 9/11, the whole culture has changed.” Under current practice, however, undocumented migrants crossing from Mexico often simply surrender to the Border Patrol; they are then given a court date, a year or two in the future. Hinojosa said that it makes no sense to allow undocumented people into the country, let them go wherever they want, and then conduct raids to root them out. “It’s a real broken system,” he said. In session after session, the Texas legislature has sought to impose strict rules on voter identification, with the putative goal of preventing election fraud. A 2011 law required voters to present a U.S. passport, a military identification card, a state driver’s license, a concealed-weapon permit, or a Texas election identification certificate. The same law excluded federal and state government I.D.s, as well as student I.D.s, from being used at polling stations. In 2014, a federal judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, in the Southern District of Texas, struck down the law, calling it “an unconstitutional poll tax.” Texas appealed, but the appeal was rejected, in part because there was no actual evidence of voter fraud. (The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.) The appeals court sent the case back to Judge Ramos, asking her to determine if the law was intentionally discriminatory. If Ramos said yes, it could trigger federal monitoring of the state’s election laws under the Voting Rights Act. The question of voter fraud became a national issue after the 2016 Presidential election. Gregg Phillips, a former official of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, gave Trump the false idea that he would have won the popular vote if illegal votes were discounted. Phillips, the founder of a group called VoteStand, tweeted that three million unqualified voters had cast ballots in the election. He refused to provide proof, though he told CNN that he had developed “algorithms” that could determine citizenship status. Trump soon demanded a widespread investigation into voter fraud. In February, 2017, while Judge Ramos was still considering the Texas voter-I.D. law, a resident of a Fort Worth suburb was found to have voted illegally: Rosa Maria Ortega, a thirty-seven-year-old mother of four with a seventh-grade education. She had lived in the U.S. since she was an infant, and was a legal resident, entitled to serve in the military and required to pay taxes. She assumed that she could also vote, and had done so previously, in 2012 and 2014. The local prosecutor decided to make an example of her, and she was sentenced to eight years in prison. When she gets out, she may be deported to Mexico. I suppose it’s an irony that she is a Republican, and voted for Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who has made voter fraud a signature issue. In April, Judge Ramos issued her opinion: the Texas voter-I.D. law was intentionally designed to discriminate against minorities. Almost simultaneously, a panel of federal judges in San Antonio ruled that three of the state’s thirty-six U.S. congressional districts were illegally drawn in order to disempower minorities. Evan Smith, of the Texas Tribune, has closely followed thirteen legislative sessions. He noted that, even as Dan Patrick and his Republican allies slashed government services, they allocated eight hundred million dollars for border security. “White people are scared of change, believing that what they have is being taken away from them by people they consider unworthy,” he told me. “But all they’re doing is poking a bear with a stick. In 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. The last majority-Anglo high-school class in Texas graduated in 2014. There will never be another. The reality is, it’s all over for the Anglos.” Texas leads the nation in Latino population growth. Latinos account for more than half the 2.7 million new Texans since 2010. Every Democrat in Texas believes that, if Latinos voted at the same rate in Texas as they do in California, the state would already be blue. “The difference between Texas and California is the labor movement,” Garnet Coleman, a Houston member of the Texas House, told me. In the nineteen-sixties, Cesar Chavez began organizing the California farmworkers into a union; that kind of movement didn’t happen in Texas, a right-to-work state. “Labor unions create a culture of voting and political participation,” Coleman observed. In Texas politics, he says, “everything is about race—it’s veiled as public policy, but it encourages people to believe that their tax dollars are going to support lazy black and brown people.” Political views have become more entrenched because of redistricting, and yet the demographic majority in Texas is far more progressive than its representatives. Coleman predicts a showdown: “This is a battle about the future of the country, based on a new majority, and we have to have this out.” The most contentious item on Dan Patrick’s list of priorities for the 2017 session was the “bathroom bill,” S.B. 6, which would bar transgender people in public schools and government buildings from using rest-room or locker-room facilities that did not correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. It would also overturn any local antidiscrimination ordinances that permit transgender citizens to choose which bathroom to use. In 2016, a similar bill was signed into law in North Carolina. In response, musicians such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam cancelled concerts in the state, and sporting associations, including the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A., dropped plans to hold events there. Governor Pat McCrory, who supported the law, lost his bid for reëlection, in part because of the national outcry. Dan Patrick contends that his bill will have no economic effect on the state of Texas, and that the only people opposed to it are journalists and “the secular left.” At a prayer rally on the capitol steps, in February, he declared, “They don’t want prayer in public schools, they’re not pro-life, they see nothing wrong with boys and girls showering together in the tenth grade, or a man being in a women’s bathroom.” Attorney General Paxton, who was also present, added, “This is a spiritual war.” The bathroom bill was drafted after the superintendent of schools in Fort Worth announced, in April, 2016, that transgender students could henceforth use the rest room or the locker room that corresponded to their gender identity. This was in accordance with federal guidelines. The superintendent additionally instructed teachers and administrators to refer to students as “scholars,” rather than as “boys and girls.” At the rally, Patrick called for his resignation, suggesting that this sort of policy would represent “the end of public education” and ignite a mass revolt by parents. “I believe it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public school,” he concluded. The business community in Texas fiercely opposed S.B. 6, and produced a report suggesting that its passage could cost the state up to eight and a half billion dollars. (PolitiFact determined that this figure was hyperbolic.) A month after the Texas legislature began the 2017 session, the Super Bowl was held in Houston, and the National Football League intimated that, were S.B. 6 to pass, the championship might not be held in Texas again. Governor Abbott, who had been keeping his head down as the legislature debated the issue, told the N.F.L. to mind its own business. Bathrooms have been an issue in Texas before. At my first Willie Nelson concert, in Austin, in the nineteen-eighties, I was in the men’s room when a dozen women barged in and laid siege to the stalls. It was actually a rather jolly moment. There were similar episodes at other Texas events, and, in 1993, Governor Ann Richards signed a “potty parity” bill, which mandated that, in new sports and entertainment facilities, there be two toilets in women’s rest rooms for every one in the men’s. The debate over S.B. 6 was a much grimmer matter. Although a dozen other states have similar bills pending, Patrick’s legislation embodied the meanness and the intolerance that many Americans associate with Texas. In Austin, the bill was being sold as a way to protect women against sexual predators who might pose as transgender—a problem that scarcely exists. Laws already on the books protect women from being accosted or spied on. The sponsors of the bill claimed that S.B. 6 was not meant to discriminate against transgender Texans, although the law would do just that. The only remedy for trans people would be to change their birth certificates, a costly and time-consuming process. The bill proposed fining schools and state agencies up to ten thousand five hundred dollars per day for violations. Even in the Texas Senate, there were doubts about the need for such a bill. “How are they going to enforce it?” Chuy Hinojosa asked me. “Would a woman have to raise her dress?” As S.B. 6 made its way through the legislature, I noticed a new sign outside a bathroom in the Austin airport. It said “ALL GENDERS.” On March 2nd, I returned to the capitol to have lunch with the speaker of the House, Joe Straus. It was the hundred-and-eighty-first anniversary of the day that Texas became independent of Mexico, and the beginning of the “high holy days” among Texas historians. The climax comes on March 6th, the anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, where, in 1836, some two hundred and fifty “Texians” gathered to block the advance of the Mexican forces. The capitol rotunda was filled with schoolchildren wearing frontier bonnets and Davy Crockett coonskin hats, getting ready to perform Marty Robbins’s song “Ballad of the Alamo.” Kids from the Texas School for the Deaf would sign as the other children sang. Four retirees representing Buffalo Soldiers—the black cavalrymen who made their mark in the Indian Wars—had come to present the state colors. A tall man wearing a top hat paced about, preparing to recite the letter that William Barret Travis, the lawyer who led the Texian forces at the Alamo, wrote during the battle. (“I shall never surrender or retreat,” he declared, in one of the most famous passages in Texas history. “Victory or death.”) On the House floor, resolutions were offered to honor the “sacrifice of the heroes of the Alamo” and to commend notable citizens. A member proposed that the breakfast taco become the official state breakfast item. I met Straus in his office. He switched on a closed-circuit TV to watch a press conference by a new group of a dozen cultural conservatives, the Texas Freedom Caucus, which is led by Matt Schaefer, a state representative from Tyler, in East Texas. The group, which models itself on the similarly named body of far-right House Republicans in Washington, had formed, in part, because the term “Tea Party” had lost its meaning—in Texas, at least—as nearly every Republican in the legislature claimed to be unimpeachably conservative. What distinguished this group was that the members were all vociferously anti-Straus. The declared mission of the group is to “amplify the voice of liberty-minded grassroots Texans who want bold action to protect life, strengthen families, defend the Bill of Rights, restrain government, and revitalize personal and economic freedoms in Texas.” As he watched the conference, Straus shot me a weary look. We moved to the dining room, which had Audubon bird prints on the wall. “The thing that concerns me is the near-total loss of influence of the business community, which allows really bad ideas like the bathroom bill to fill the void,” Straus said, as we sat down to plates of delicious crab cakes. “C.E.O.s have stopped coming to the capitol to engage directly,” he continued. “They now work only through lobbyists.” Straus comes from a longtime Republican family in San Antonio. One of his ancestors founded the L. Frank Saddlery Company, which made saddles, harnesses, and whips. Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders stopped in San Antonio in 1898 to equip themselves with L. Frank gear on their way to fight in the Spanish-American War. The company’s slogan was “The horse—next to woman, God’s greatest gift to man.” When Joe Straus is not in Austin, he is an executive in the insurance and investment business. He entered that industry after a spell in Washington, where his wife, Julie Brink, worked in the Reagan White House and on George H. W. Bush’s 1988 Presidential campaign. During that period, Straus served in the Commerce Department. He is trim and dapper, like an account executive on “Mad Men,” and is the most prominent Jewish politician in Texas history. In campaigns, his opponents have mentioned his religion, to little effect. This is his fifth term as speaker, which ties the record. It’s a surprise to many observers that the laconic and even-tempered Straus has persevered. Evan Smith told me, “All the things they said about him—‘He’d show up at a gunfight with a butter knife,’ ‘He can’t make a fist’—they were all wrong. Joe Straus is so much tougher than he appears.” His speakership has focussed on providing the workforce and the infrastructure that Texas businesses need, by protecting public education, building roads, establishing more top-tier universities, and expanding job training. Perhaps his biggest victory was in 2013: in the middle of a devastating drought, he ushered through a two-billion-dollar revolving loan fund for state water projects. With each session, Straus has watched the Republican Party drift farther away from the “compassionate conservatism” of the Governor Bush era and become increasingly dominated by Christian ideologues, such as Patrick, for whom economic issues are secondary. Although Democrats and non-Tea Party Republicans alike see Straus as a brake on the controversial cultural agenda being pushed by Abbott and Patrick, he worries that his supporters have unreasonable expectations. “I can only do so much to keep the focus on fiscal issues and away from the divisive stuff,” he told me. “A few loud and fanatical people occasionally unsettle the majority of Republicans, who are really mainstream.” Unlike Patrick, who decides which bills come to the floor in the Senate, Straus has to exercise influence by artfully appointing committee members, who can dull the fangs of fearsome bills (or let them languish until there’s no time to consider them). Sometimes he thinks that his moderation, along with the relative centrism of the Texas House, is being used as a foil for the Senate radicals. “The confidence that people seem to have in the House to serve as a stopper only enables the Senate to run hotter than it ever has before,” he said. Straus believed that most Republicans in the House didn’t want to vote for the bathroom bill, but, like their conservative colleagues in Washington, they worried about being challenged from the right in primaries. “If it gets to the floor, it could be a close vote,” Straus observed. “I can’t imagine anyone really wanting to follow North Carolina’s example, but I can’t guarantee that’s not going to happen.” Meanwhile, he was pressing his own legislative agenda, which included securing additional funds for public schools, improving Child Protective Services, and devoting more resources to mental health—even though the state budget had been hit because of the fall in oil and gas revenues. Before the session began, Straus spoke out against the bathroom bill. “I’ve become more blunt than ever,” he told me. He frequently urges business leaders to remain firm in their opposition to such legislation. “I try to be diplomatic but clear—that if you give in on the bathroom bill to preserve a tax break, there’s another equally awful idea right behind it.” As the bathroom bill was moving through the Texas legislature, Mack Beggs, a seventeen-year-old transgender high-school student from Euless, Texas, won the girls’ state wrestling championship, in the hundred-and-ten-pound weight class. He had been taking testosterone supplements as he transitioned to male, and he had won fifty-six matches in a row. Although he wants to wrestle boys—“because I’m a guy,” he told ESPN—the University Interscholastic League, which oversees the athletic programs in Texas public schools, recently adopted a rule that requires wrestling opponents to have the same sex listed on their birth certificates. In February, the Trump Administration withdrew the protections that President Obama had instituted for transgender students in public schools. On March 6th, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case of a transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, who had sued to be allowed to use the boys’ bathroom at school. That left the issue up to individual states, at least for now. Dan Patrick said that the Texas bill would be a model for the rest of the nation. On March 7th, the bill had its first public hearing before the State Affairs Committee. Transgender Texans, along with their families, came to the capitol to speak, as did preachers, business leaders, and moral crusaders of all types. More than four hundred people signed up to testify at the hearing. The bill’s author, Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham, said that it was designed to “find the balance of privacy, decency, respect, and dignity, to protect women, children, and all people.” Dana Hodges, the state director of a right-wing Christian organization called Concerned Women for America, was the first to testify in favor of the bill. She cast the issue as a matter of women’s safety. “I myself was the victim of being videotaped by a hidden camera placed in a women’s bathroom stall by a man,” she said, her voice trembling. She held up a plastic coat hook that, she said, was embedded with the kind of miniature camera that had been used to spy on her. Under questioning, she acknowledged that a non-transgender man had hidden the camera inside her stall, and that he had been punished under existing laws. Kolkhorst also conceded that she knew of no crimes committed in Texas bathrooms which had been attributed to transgender people. But her intent, she said, was to prevent nefarious people from taking advantage of inclusive bathroom policies. (Crimes against transgender people, meanwhile, are routine; according to Texas Monthly, a quarter of all transgender Texans have been physically assaulted.) Dan Forest, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina and a strong advocate of that state’s bathroom bill, came to Austin to testify that no businesses had actually left his state because of the bill, and that its economy had been hurt by “less than one tenth of one per cent of North Carolina’s annual G.D.P.” (The Associated Press, after examining public records and interviewing business leaders who said that they had cancelled projects because of the bill, estimated that North Carolina would lose nearly four billion dollars over a dozen years.) On March 30th, the North Carolina legislators, assailed on many fronts, partially repealed their bill. In Austin, the vast majority of witnesses spoke against the bathroom bill. One of them was Colt Keo-Meier, a transgender psychologist, who is currently enrolled in medical school at the University of Texas at Galveston. He wore a white lab coat, and a stethoscope around his neck. He said, “If you pass this bill, my gender identity will be further invalidated, as I will not be able to continue attending medical school in the state of Texas. I would not be able to enter the men’s rooms legally.” Keo-Meier, who has a full beard, added, “Look at me—I would not be able to enter the women’s rest rooms safely.” Concerns about voyeurism, he argued, were misplaced: “I used the women’s rest room for twenty-three years, and I used the men’s rest room for ten years. I have not once seen any genitalia.” A woman in a short-sleeved black dress identified herself as Jess Herbst, the mayor of New Hope, a tiny town north of Dallas, in a firmly Republican section of the state. A few weeks earlier, Mayor Herbst had written to her constituents to tell them that she was taking hormone-replacement therapy and transitioning to female. She had received overwhelming support, she told the committee. “I just want to be able to use the women’s room and not have someone ask me at the door for my papers,” she said. The testimony continued until nearly five in the morning. The committee voted to support the bill, 8–1. On the evening of April 6th, I went to the capitol to watch the legislature struggle to fulfill its mandatory duty to pass a budget. House members had been at it all day, and, yet again, the discussion would go on until the early morning. The air-conditioning was merciless; one of the members showed me the long johns poking out from under his shirt cuffs. I saw 5-Hour Energy shots arrayed on some desks. Desperation suffuses the chamber on Budget Night—the last stand for bills that have not been funded. The trick is that, in order to get the money for your legislation, you have to take it from somewhere else. The members were on guard, lest their own bills be raided. More than four hundred amendments to the budget were awaiting their turn. One baffling amendment—offered by Valoree Swanson, a freshman Freedom Caucus member from a suburb of Houston—would prevent state funds from being used to renovate bathrooms in order to “allow or enable a man to enter a women’s restroom facility.” There are some extraordinary people in the House. Senfronia Thompson is a seventy-eight-year-old former teacher from Houston. Known as Ms. T., she is in her twentieth term, and is one of the few Democrats with real power: she chairs the Local and Consent Calendars Committee, one of the gateways many bills must pass through in order to reach the floor. Unlike a lot of other state legislatures, the Texas legislature still follows a tradition of awarding important posts to members of the minority party. This is true even in Dan Patrick’s Senate. Thompson once told me that, when she was a girl, African-Americans were not welcome in the capitol. Now she is the longest-serving woman and black person in Texas legislative history. Among her many accomplishments is a hate-crimes act, passed in 2001, that includes protections for homosexuals. She has also fought against racial profiling and passed measures to help low-income Texans pay their utility bills. Armando Martinez, a forty-one-year-old Democratic member from the Valley, is a firefighter and a paramedic. He showed up on the first day of the session with a bandage on his head; on New Year’s Eve, he’d been hit by a stray celebratory bullet. Martinez filed a bill to prohibit the “reckless discharge of a firearm.” Dr. John Zerwas, a Republican anesthesiologist from Richmond, Texas, is the chair of the Appropriations Committee. A business conservative in the Straus mold, he is deeply respected in the legislature, and Straus selected him to craft the House version of the budget. The main difference between the House’s budget and the Senate’s was that Zerwas proposed dipping into the Rainy Day Fund. The fund, which is amassed largely from oil and gas taxes, is designated for emergencies. It is projected to grow to twelve billion dollars by 2019, which is more than the annual budget of a dozen other states. Patrick maintains that the fund should not be used for “ongoing expenses,” but Zerwas wanted to take two and a half billion dollars out of the pot, in part to finance health care and public schools—Joe Straus priorities. An incident in the afternoon had suggested how the budget fight would play out. A freshman member, Briscoe Cain, presented an amendment to shut down an advisory panel on palliative care. Normally, freshmen keep quiet, but Cain is an assertive member of the insurgent Freedom Caucus. Thirty-two years old, he is proudly bratty, like Matthew Broderick in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” “This amendment seeks to get rid of what I’ve kind of nicknamed the ‘advisory death panel,’ ” Cain said, using a term for end-of-life counselling that is popular among the far right. Soon afterward, Zerwas came to the microphone and stood there, giving Cain what Jonathan Tilove, in his blog for the Austin American-Statesman, jokingly called the morem pellis hispidus distentione nervorum: the hairy eyeball. It’s fascinating to watch the choreography of the members when deep political chords are struck. The Freedom Caucus members gathered with Cain at a microphone in the front of the chamber; the traditional Republicans, along with some Democrats, stood beside Zerwas at a microphone in the rear. It was the Texas version of the Montagues versus the Capulets. “Would you please describe for me what a death panel is?” the mighty chairman of appropriations demanded. “A death panel is whereby a group of individuals unrelated to the person in the hospital decide whether or not that person should live or die,” Cain replied. “Have you ever understood, really, what palliative care is?” Zerwas asked. “Mr. Zerwas, being in your profession, I am sure you could inform this body better than I could,” Cain replied. The old warhorses in the House knew, if Cain did not, that Zerwas had lost his first wife to brain cancer. He wore a ring on his right hand in her memory. Zerwas said, “You could probably ask fifty, sixty, seventy, a hundred members in this House who have had somebody with a serious illness who has dealt with this particular issue.” Zerwas forced Cain, several times, to admit having made false or uninformed statements. “You know about this, and I don’t,” Cain finally said. “My apologies.” The amendment was withdrawn. Cain later saved face when he offered an amendment that would block the Texas Department of Criminal Justice from paying for a “sex reassignment or gender transitioning” operation—something that has never actually happened. Cain’s battle cry: “Don’t California my Texas!” I caught the eye of Pat Fallon, a Republican member from Frisco, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He lives in a wealthy, intensely conservative bedroom community that was all cow pasture when I was growing up nearby. Many young legislators, like Fallon, are not originally from Texas. I asked him how he came to live in the state. He said that, after playing football for Notre Dame, he joined the Air Force, and was stationed in Texas. “They asked me my state of residence, and I said, ‘Massachusetts.’ The payroll officer informed me that Massachusetts has a 5.6-per-cent income tax, but there’s no income tax in Texas. So I said, ‘I’m a Texan!’ ” This term was his third. So far, he’s best known for co-authoring a bill, in 2013, that reasserted the right of students and employees at public schools to say “Merry Christmas” rather than “Happy Holidays.” “Have you got an amendment?” I asked Fallon. “Yeah, it’s No. 152, in which we defund the portion of the Travis County Public Integrity Unit’s investigation of insurance fraud and motor-vehicle tax fraud.” The unit has been under attack for years, because it also addresses crimes committed by state officials. Of course, anything attacking Austin—a spore of the California fungus that is destroying America—is popular. “Who would do the investigating, then?” I asked. “The attorney general,” Fallon responded. Ken Paxton, I reminded Fallon, was under indictment for securities fraud. (He has pleaded not guilty.) “I would prefer it not be that way,” Fallon said. “But he hasn’t been convicted.” Fallon ranks high on the conservative “report cards,” compiled by watchdog groups, by which modern right-wing legislators live and die. One of the most feared is the Fiscal Responsibility Index, a powerful weapon against less than ultra-radical Republicans. It is produced by Empower Texans, a group led by Michael Quinn Sullivan, who is known by his initials, M.Q.S. Some members pronounce it “Mucus.” Sullivan is tall and friendly. He likes to talk about the Boy Scouts (he was an Eagle Scout), the Aggies (he was in the A. & M. Corps of Cadets), and his three children. A right-wing zealot, he is sometimes described as the most powerful non-elected political figure in Texas. Several years ago, Sullivan and I had lunch, and he told me, “I’m not there to get a seat at the table. I’m there to get rid of the table.” In other words, he wants to destroy the government. Empower Texans is funded largely by a reclusive Midland oilman named Tim Dunn, an evangelical Christian who hopes to create in Texas an example of small government that could be replicated by other states and countries. Even people who hate Dunn’s politics consider him the most effective moneyman in the state. He has steadily pushed Republican lawmakers farther right, eliminating the kind of middle-ground figures who support Joe Straus. Dunn has made it a mission to bring down the Speaker. While Fallon and I were talking, Jonathan Stickland approached the front microphone. Stickland, a member of the Freedom Caucus, is generously supported by Empower Texans. He is a former pest-control technician from Bedford, near Arlington, who now calls himself an oil and gas consultant. Stickland is plump, with an imposing beard, narrow-set brown eyes, and an occasional broad smile revealing beautiful teeth. He made news in the 2015 session by posting a sign outside his office: Representative Jonathan Stickland FORMER FETUS District 92 Stickland’s amendment was to defund the state’s feral-hog-abatement program, which kills thousands of the rampaging beasts each year. Stickland called the program ridiculous and a waste of money. “It has not worked, and it never will work!” he declared, infuriating rural lawmakers, who consider wild pigs a nearly existential menace. They converged on Stickland from all sides. Everything came to a dead stop. A brass rail circumscribes the chamber; only members, pages, and clerks can go inside. I was hovering around the rail, and Speaker Straus came over to say hello. He seemed totally at ease: smiling, hands in his pockets. He said, “I guess all the hogs are going to move to Arlington”—which is partly in Stickland’s district. Straus was in no hurry to impose order. He looked at the scrum of lawmakers around Stickland. “Just think,” he said. “These are the people responsible for spending two hundred and eighteen billion dollars.” At the rear microphone stood Drew Springer, a Republican from North Texas, whose district—twice the size of Maryland—is copiously supplied with wild pigs. He proposed attaching an amendment to Stickland’s amendment. It would cut nine hundred thousand dollars in funds for roads and highways—the same amount as the hog-abatement program—but only in Stickland’s home town. The measure passed, with undisguised enthusiasm. Stickland pulled his amendment down, but then charged toward Springer. They met in the middle of the chamber, nose to nose. Stickland is known to carry a concealed weapon, so I was a little worried. But other members separated the men, and Straus reluctantly gavelled the House to order. I left before the budget was passed, long after my bedtime. By dawn, it was clear that Dan Patrick and the Tea Party had suffered one defeat after another in Joe Straus’s House. Earlier in the session, Patrick had demanded an up-or-down vote on subsidizing tuition for private schools, and it was crushed, 103–44. A proposal to “zero out” money for the Texas Commission on the Arts was brushed aside. Governor Abbott’s “enterprise fund,” which he used to lure businesses to the state, would be emptied, and its budget of forty-three million dollars would be dispersed between Child Protective Services and therapy for disabled children. Paxton, the attorney general, would lose more than twenty million dollars from his budget for lawsuits; that money would be redirected to foster-care programs. None of these changes had become law yet—they had to be ratified by the Senate first. The exhausted Democrats and Republicans made a deal: the Democrats agreed to provide only nominal opposition to the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which was going to happen in any case; in return, the bathroom amendment was pulled from consideration. Other controversial amendments were placed in Article 11 of the budget, a kind of wish list of things to be debated in the future. Legislators call Article 11 “the graveyard.” But in the Texas legislature the dead have been known to walk. The relationship between the capitol and the city of Austin is antagonistic. The city has long been known as a blue dot in a red state. It sees itself as standing apart from the vulgar political culture of the rest of Texas, like Rome surrounded by the Goths. Republican politicians bridle at the disdain. “It’s great to be out of the People’s Republic of Austin,” Governor Abbott declared recently, at a Republican dinner in Bell County. “Once you cross the Travis County line, it starts smelling different. And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom. It’s the smell of freedom that does not exist in Austin, Texas.” This tirade was apparently triggered by a local ordinance that requires a permit to cut down a “heritage tree”—one whose trunk diameter exceeds nineteen inches. When Abbott was attorney general and living in Austin, he was infuriated when he had to compensate the city before cutting down a pecan tree that stood in the way of his future swimming pool. Many residents of Austin don’t mind its image as a lonely liberal outpost. I’m part of a group that puts up statues in Austin, and our most recent work was a bronze replica of Willie Nelson. At Nelson’s request, it was unveiled, in 2012, on April 20th—National Marijuana Day. He stood in front of his giant likeness and sang “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.” On the Sunday after Trump was elected President, about a hundred and fifty people gathered on the capitol steps and marched down Congress Avenue. A small group of Trump supporters was staging a counter-protest. According to news reports, one man was especially conspicuous: Joseph Weidknecht, a laid-off sheet-metal worker, who is six feet six and weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. He was wearing a “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” cap and carried a sign that said “PROUD TO BE DEPLORABLE”—a reference to Hillary Clinton’s derogatory remark about Trump supporters. A number of the anti-Trump marchers, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, ripped the sign out of his hands, grabbed his hat, and tried to set his shirt on fire. “I can handle myself in a brawl,” Weidknecht later told the Austin American-Statesman. “But when they brought out the lighters I was genuinely scared for my life.” A small woman wearing a hijab forced herself between Weidknecht and the people assaulting him. She was Amina Amdeen, a nineteen-year-old student at the university, who had immigrated to the U.S. from Iraq when she was ten. “She stood there like a mountain, trying to stop the violence,” Weidknecht said. The police arrested six of the protesters. “I do not stand for what he stands for,” Amdeen remarked. “But I know his fears and concerns are valid. I love this country so much, and I don’t like what I see coming.” In February, two weeks after the Trump Administration began its attempts to block Muslims from entering the U.S., anti-immigrant posters started appearing outside buildings at the University of Texas at Austin. “IMAGINE A MUSLIM-FREE AMERICA,” one said. Around this time, a mosque was firebombed in Victoria, two hours southeast of Austin. Sid Miller, the state’s agricultural commissioner, told the BBC that he worried about America becoming a Muslim country. (Muslims account for about one per cent of the U.S. population.) He previously advocated dropping nuclear bombs on the Muslim world. My wife, Roberta, has a close friend, a writer, who is married to a professor. They are Jewish, and they have a “BLACK LIVES MATTER” sign in their yard. As the sanctuary-cities bill, S.B. 4, was being debated in the capitol, an unsigned letter was left at their front door. It threatened the lives of their children, by name. “Is this Austin?” Roberta cried. In April, S.B. 4 progressed to the House. Among Republicans who vote in Texas primaries, the hottest issue is immigration. Many state legislators who otherwise might not support the bill seemed intimidated by the political environment, and it was apparent that Straus and his team had no battle plan. Meanwhile, Patrick’s counterparts, frustrated by their losses in the budget battles, began adding amendments to make S.B. 4 even tougher. Matt Schaefer, of the Freedom Caucus, amended the bill to allow police officers to question a suspect’s immigration status—a “show me your papers” provision. Law-enforcement authorities in Texas’s major cities had loudly opposed such an idea, saying that it would make immigrants less likely to report crimes. Art Acevedo, Houston’s police chief, said that the number of Hispanics reporting rape in his city was already down forty-three per cent—apparently a result of Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Schaefer’s amendment was similar to a 2010 Arizona law that had been partly struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. “This is something that Texans in our district have been asking for,” Schaefer said. “This is good policy.” Gene Wu, the Democratic House member from Houston, who was born in China, spoke against the bill, tearfully comparing it to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the country’s first major anti-immigration law. “This topic is painful for me, because I’m an immigrant,” he said. “My parents are immigrants. I represent a district filled with immigrants.” As he spoke, supportive Democrats surrounded him. “Some are here as refugees. Some are here as citizens. Some are here without papers. But they are all my people.” For Wu, the sanctuary-cities bill was the natural culmination of the “bigoted, racist mentality” that has emerged in Texas, which he calls the epicenter of the Tea Party. “Trump is simply the most visible manifestation of that mentality,” he told me. “It’s been percolating up in the Republican Party for the past decade.” Another Democratic lawmaker, Ana Hernandez, of Houston, recalled coming to this country as a child: “I remember the constant fear my family lived with each day, the fear my parents experienced each day, as their two little girls went to school, not knowing if there would be an immigration raid that day.” Behind the scenes, the Republican and Democratic caucuses met for hours, trying to find a way to dodge Schaefer’s amendment. “The Republicans came to us and said, ‘Some of us are going to have a hard time voting against it,’ ” Wu told me. Knowing that the law would inevitably be challenged in court, Republicans offered to shelve the amendment if the Democrats made some minor concessions. But the Democrats took too long to agree on terms, and the Republicans withdrew the offer. After sixteen hours of emotional debate, the House passed S.B. 4 with the “show me your papers” amendment. A week later, Governor Abbott signed it into law, on Facebook Live. “Citizens expect law-enforcement officers to enforce the law,” he said. “Citizens deserve lawbreakers to face legal consequences.” As usual, the Texas legislature passed anti-abortion bills. One bans the safest and most common procedure for second-trimester abortions: dilation and evacuation. Supporters of the legislation call this a “dismemberment abortion.” The law also requires health-care facilities to bury or cremate aborted fetuses. In addition, the legislature passed several bills to reform the agencies overseeing abused and endangered children—one of Governor Abbott’s priorities. In the first seven months of the state’s fiscal year, the number of foster children spending two or more consecutive nights in hotels or government office buildings had risen to three hundred and fourteen. The new legislation gave raises to the underpaid caseworkers, but in some ways it was yet another anti-government measure. The bill partially stripped the state of responsibility for its wards, handing them off to contractors. Abbott said that Janis Graham Jack, the federal judge who had ruled that Texas’s foster-care system violated children’s rights, should dismiss the case before her, because the new legislation “completely transforms the system in ways that will make it better.” Child-welfare advocates have criticized the new legislation, saying that private groups may not have the expertise to take over case-management duties, particularly when dealing with troubled children. “I expect the Texas Child Protective Services and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to strive for, achieve, and to accomplish No. 1 ranking status in the United States of America,” Abbott said, as he signed the legislation. On April 6th, the hog-abatement funds were approved, despite Jonathan Stickland’s attempts at sabotage. And a new law allowed the hunting of wild pigs from hot-air balloons. “We’ve got a problem here, and we are willing to fix it,” Mark Keough, a Republican from the Woodlands, told the Texas Observer. “We have that Western, swashbuckling, cowboying type of way to deal with things.” Texans already could legally shoot pigs from helicopters—even with machine guns—but who knew that it was ever against the law to shoot pigs from balloons? Speaker Straus continued to sideline the bathroom bill. He remained certain that most Republicans in the House didn’t really favor the measure, though they also didn’t want to be seen as opposing it. He asked Governor Abbott to stand with him against the measure. Abbott is better known as a business conservative, like Straus, than as a cultural conservative, like Patrick, but he showed little interest in choosing a side, because he was bound to create enemies in either case. Finally, Abbott blandly stated that he favored a bill “to protect privacy in bathrooms.” He signalled that a bill then headed for a committee hearing in the House, H.B. 2899, was a “thoughtful proposal.” Although it would not mandate bathroom use based on biological sex, H.B. 2899 would impede the enforcement of local nondiscrimination ordinances, and it would not stop businesses or lawmakers from imposing bathroom bans in the future. On May 21st, the House began debating the measure. Once again, hours of anguished testimony ensued. Half a dozen female members wandered into the men’s bathroom just off the House floor. “We’re feeling like making trouble today,” one of the women, Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat from Austin, told reporters. “It’s that kind of mood.” Shortly before dawn, the House committee members retired without a vote, effectively killing the measure. At the last minute, several lawmakers had asserted their conservative bona fides by signing on as co-sponsors of the doomed legislation. It was the most desirable outcome imaginable. There were still eight days left in the session. One of the major forces behind the bathroom bill, and a big supporter of Dan Patrick, was Steve Hotze, a Houston physician and a longtime ultraconservative kingmaker. Starting in the mid-nineties, he made a fortune from alternative hormone-replacement therapies and the sale of controversial supplements, such as colloidal silver, which he recommends for treating colds and the flu, and for promoting pet health. Colloidal silver can cause argyria, in which a patient’s skin permanently turns the color of a blue jay. In 1986, Hotze signed the manifesto of an evangelical Christian group called the Coalition on Revival, which endorses the idea that “the ultimate cause of all disease, deformity, disability, and death is the sin of Adam and Eve.” As for government: “We deny that any final authority outside the Bible (e.g., reason, experience, majority opinion, elite opinion, nature, etc.) ought to be accepted as the standard of government for any individual, group, or jurisdiction.” In the aughts, Hotze hosted a show on the talk-radio station that Patrick now owns in Houston. He recently released a couple of songs—perhaps they should be called lamentations—such as “God Fearing Texans Stop Obamacare”: What would Sam Houston do? What would Davy Crockett do? I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight Obamacare, I’m going to defeat Obamacare. Hotze’s main cause is attacking homosexuals, or “homofascists,” as he calls them. “The homosexual political movement will force churches, schools, businesses, and individuals to accept, to affirm, and even celebrate those who participate in anal sex,” he has said. Sodomy, he went on, “will be mandated to be taught to the children in the schools at an early age, starting in kindergarten.” It goes without saying that homosexuals “want to make Texas a clone of California.” In 2014, Dan Patrick ran for lieutenant governor, and Hotze became one of his chief fund-raisers. In a video endorsement, he stood next to Patrick and said, “Dan Patrick’s leadership will keep Texas the most conservative state in the country.” Patrick added, “The Democrats understand that, if they can take Texas, we will never have a Republican in the White House again. They will control the country. There’s not another Texas to move to, folks. This is it.” Patrick was referring to the fact that, as Texas’s liberal cities have burgeoned, the state has grown markedly less red. All of its major urban areas except Fort Worth are Democratic and have been for decades. Dallas went for Obama in both elections. In Houston, America’s most diverse city, the country’s first openly lesbian big-city mayor was succeeded by the city’s second black mayor. (Harris County, however, which encompasses Houston, has Republican judges in the courthouse.) San Antonio has always been a progressive stronghold, though it often votes Republican in statewide races. In the 2016 election, Trump garnered fifty-two per cent of the vote in Texas, compared with sixty-five per cent in neighboring Oklahoma. Texas is more purple than many Americans realize, and that’s what keeps conservatives in the state on edge. Hotze runs a political-action committee called Conservative Republicans of Texas. He also maintains the group’s Web site, and on May 16th he wrote of the bathroom bill, “There are Texas legislators . . . who would allow perverted men and boys, who sexually fantasize that they are women, to enter women’s and girls’ bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.” He implored his readers to pray with him: In the Name of Jesus, I prophesy and declare: May all the individuals serving in the state legislature, and their staff, who support, promote and practice sodomy and other perverted, sexually deviant lifestyles, who support the killing of unborn babies, and who hate God’s Law and God’s Word, receive just retribution from God for their evil actions. . . . May they be consumed, collapse, rot and be blown away as dust from their current positions because of their wicked works, thoughts and deeds. In an e-mail, Patrick’s office described Hotze as a “longtime supporter,” but added, “The Lieutenant Governor does not agree with everything that any of his supporters say or do.” Straus told me, “Steve Hotze exists on the fringes. Mainstream Republicans don’t take him seriously.” Hotze, meanwhile, has been campaigning to have Straus removed as speaker. On May 20th, Tom Mechler, the chairman of the state Republican Party, resigned, citing personal reasons. He issued a letter pleading for party unity. “A party that is fractured by anger and backbiting is a party that will not succeed,” he said. He also warned that the Republican Party had failed to attract voters outside the white demographic, and was therefore destined for electoral oblivion. “If we do not continue to make efforts to engage in the diverse communities across Texas, our state will turn blue,” he warned. He urged the next chairman to reshape the Party in the image of modern Texas. Soon after Mechler’s resignation, Rob Morrow—the former Travis County Republican Party chairman with the motley-fool hat—announced his candidacy for the statewide position. His priorities had not changed since he had been drummed out of office. In a statement for the press, he declared, “I like big titties. I am a proponent of boobyliciousness. In the past several years I have shared on social media the pics of over 500 extremely hot, busty women.” He concluded by saying, “I am for having bikini contests at the Alamo every 4th of July. Case closed.” The twelve members of the Texas Freedom Caucus were furious at Straus and his allies for impeding their legislation, which included yet more bills targeting abortion, and measures that would further loosen gun laws and roll back property taxes. They decided to get revenge, with what became known as the Mother’s Day Massacre. Bills that are not considered controversial are often placed before the House for a pro-forma vote. In May, a hundred and twenty-one such proposals, known as consent bills, were awaiting approval. However, if five or more members object to a consent bill, it must go through the normal legislative process, and be scheduled for discussion on the House floor. This year, the clock for such discussions ran out at midnight on May 11th—the Thursday before Mother’s Day weekend. Hours before midnight, the Freedom Caucus objected to the entire slate of consent bills, making it impossible for them to be heard this session. The doomed consent bills included two that addressed the sharp rise in maternal mortality in Texas. Shawn Thierry, a Democrat from Houston, begged Freedom Caucus members to spare her bill, which would have commissioned a study that focussed on low-income black mothers. She argued that the bill was pro-life, because mothers who died in childbirth had carried their babies to term. Although the Freedom Caucus members agreed with her on this point, they refused her request, adding that it wasn’t personal. “It was like a drive-by shooting,” Thierry later said. Next the Freedom Caucus chewed up time in leisurely debate, proposing amendments and making objections to bills already under consideration. The House was brought to a standstill. An hour passed as they debated inconsequential amendments to a bill on industrial-workforce training. (The minority Democrats had perfected such tactics in the past.) Time was running out to consider any of the other scheduled legislation. Drew Springer, the representative from North Texas who killed Stickland’s anti-hog-abatement amendment, pleaded for H.B. 810, which would fund experimental stem-cell treatments. He spoke on behalf of his wife, who is in a wheelchair. Such treatments “might give somebody like my wife a chance to walk,” he said, between sobs. “I’d trade every one of my bills I’ve passed, every single one, to get the chance to hear H.B. 810.” The Freedom Caucus gave in on this one, and it passed. Also among the slain consent bills was H.B. 3302, a sunset safety-net bill. It had been crafted to preserve important state agencies that would otherwise be phased out under an automatic review policy, which takes place every twelve years. One of the agencies up for review was the state medical board. If the medical board expired, there would be no agency to license doctors in Texas. It wasn’t clear if Freedom Caucus members had realized the far-reaching consequences of killing H.B. 3302. Dan Patrick, however, recognized that an important lever had been handed to him. The only way to avoid the consequences of H.B. 3302’s failing to pass was for a similar bill to be passed in the Senate—which had a later deadline—and then sent back to the House. On the Monday after Mother’s Day, Speaker Straus wrote a letter to Patrick, urging the Senate to pass such a bill—along with the budget—so that the legislature could avoid a special session. In response, Patrick privately sent him specific terms for a deal. The House had to pass the bathroom bill and another item on Patrick’s agenda—a bill that capped local property taxes. In return, the Senate would agree to pass its own version of the sunset safety-net bill, as well as the budget and several other items, including one championed by Straus, which dealt with school-finance reform. Public schools in Texas are financed through property taxes, along with federal and state funds. Over the years, the state’s contribution per student has diminished, with property taxes making up the difference. To restore the balance, Straus wanted to allocate one and a half billion state dollars to the public schools. The Senate had added an amendment to the school-finance-reform bill, however, which amounted to what Straus called a “poison pill”: a provision for vouchers for private schools. The House had already rejected this idea, but Patrick felt that Texas schools had enough money. In an op-ed published in early June, he noted that total education spending, including universities, was already the largest item in the budget—“about fifty-two per cent of all state dollars.” He added, “It is disingenuous to suggest that we are, somehow, holding back funding that we could spend on schools.” (Education spending, as a percentage of the Texas budget, is lower than it has been in at least twenty years.) By now, the ill will between the two men had spilled over into the chambers they led. Lyle Larson, the San Antonio Republican, who is close to Straus, accused the Senate of “taking hostages” when it promised to pass certain House bills only if the House voted for Patrick’s priorities. “I’ve got six,” Larson cried. “How many other bills were held hostage by the Texas Senate?” A roar went up in the House, which only grew when Harold Dutton, a Houston Democrat, took to the front microphone. “When the Senate won’t respect us, they need to expect us,” he said. “I don’t know if they can see us. But would you have them open the door so they can hear us?” The House doors were flung open, as the frustrated representatives bayed like wolves at the Senate chamber, across the capitol. Governor Abbott had warned Speaker Straus that he would demand action on the bathroom bill—even if he had to call a special session. With Straus’s blessing, a compromise was crafted by Chris Paddie, a Republican representative from Marshall, in northeast Texas. It was styled as an amendment to a bill on school safety, and would affect grade schools and high schools but not universities or government buildings. It affirmed the right of all students to use the bathroom with “privacy, dignity, and safety”—language that strongly echoed Patrick’s scaremongering about potential transgender predators. But it did not explicitly bar students from using particular bathrooms. Across Texas, school districts and chambers of commerce seemed resigned to accept the amendment. In Straus’s opinion, it codified a reasonable practice that many schools had already adopted. Still, there was fierce opposition in the House from Democrats who saw it as appeasement. Representative Rafael Anchia, of Dallas, reminded the other members that, since they had begun debating the bathroom issue, in January, ten transgender people had been violently killed in the U.S. He read their names aloud. The amendment passed the House, but Patrick wasn’t satisfied. He said that it didn’t “appear to do much.” Time was running out. Straus declared that Patrick could take Paddie’s amendment or leave it. “For many of us—and especially for me—this was a compromise,” Straus told reporters. “As far as I’m concerned, it was enough. We will go no further. This is the right thing to do in order to protect our economy from billions of dollars in losses and more importantly to protect the safety of some very vulnerable young Texans.” It was “absurd,” he said, that passing a bathroom bill had taken on more urgency than fixing the school-finance system. Patrick did not relent. He said of Straus, “Instead of siding with the people of Texas—and, as a Republican, siding with Republicans of Texas—he has decided to support the policies of Barack Obama, who said, ‘I want boys and girls in every shower in every school in the country.’ ” (Obama never said this.) Patrick then added a remark aimed directly at Abbott: “Tonight, I’m making it very clear, Governor. I want you to call us back on your own time.” The two chambers succeeded in passing a budget, but a special session seemed inevitable. Abbott clearly hated the position he had been thrust into. A special session devoted almost entirely to the bathroom bill, he knew, would focus even more unwanted national attention on Texas. Only the governor can call a special session, and though he can nominally set the agenda, special sessions can get out of hand. There was no guarantee that Abbott would get the outcome he hoped for. On May 27th, the C.E.O.s of fourteen companies with a significant presence in Texas, including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and I.B.M., sent Abbott a letter. “We are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas’ reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families,” it said. The bill would harm the companies’ ability to recruit talent to the state, they asserted, adding, “Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas.” Around this time, reporters caught up with Abbott at a gun range, where he signed a law lowering the cost of gun licenses. He then shot a few rounds at a target sheet, which he proudly displayed to the reporters. (The Texas press has generally been very kind to him.) This was the day after Montana elected a U.S. representative, in a special election, who had body-slammed a reporter, sending him to the hospital. This was the same season in which Trump had declared the press the enemy. Abbott held up his bullet-riddled target and said, “I’m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.” On the Friday before the end of the session, Straus told me, Patrick sent two emissaries from the Senate to visit him at his office. (Patrick’s spokeswoman says that this is “not accurate.”) One of the senators carried an envelope that apparently contained the language of a bathroom bill that Patrick would accept. The senator, whose name Straus would not disclose, was a lawyer, and told Straus that the language had been carefully crafted to insure that the bill would override any local antidiscrimination ordinances. The senator started to open the envelope, but Straus said not to bother. “I’m not a lawyer, but I am a Texan,” he said. “I’m disgusted by all this. Tell the lieutenant governor I don’t want the suicide of a single Texan on my hands.” During the regular legislative session, more than sixty-six hundred bills were filed, and more than twelve hundred were passed into law. The session was widely seen as being dictated by Dan Patrick, but many of the signature items that he had supported—school vouchers, property-tax rollbacks, and the bathroom bill—failed to pass. The major cities in Texas recently joined in a lawsuit against S.B. 4—the sanctuary-cities bill—saying that it will lead to racial profiling, and that regulating immigration is a power reserved for the federal government. The U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the Justice Department would help defend S.B. 4. “President Trump has made a commitment to keep America safe,” he said. “Texas has admirably followed his lead by mandating statewide coöperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal aliens who have committed crimes.” One of the bills that Governor Abbott signed into law allows faith-based adoption groups to reject applicants whose sexual orientation is counter to their beliefs. In response to the law, California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, banned state employees from travelling to Texas at taxpayers’ expense. Dan Patrick jumped at the chance to taunt California. “Of course, California does have a reason to be angry at Texas,” he said. “Thousands of folks fled California’s high taxes and liberal attitudes to come to Texas in 2015.” The session concluded this year on Memorial Day, and so fallen soldiers were honored. Legislators said goodbye to colleagues with whom they had endured a hundred and forty of the most intense days of their lives. Meanwhile, buses began arriving at the capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some from distant states, burst through the doors, filling all four levels of the rotunda and spilling into the House gallery. They unfurled banners (“SEE YOU IN COURT!”) and chanted, “S.B. 4 has got to go!” One of the protest organizers, Stephanie Gharakhanian, explained to reporters, “We wanted to make sure we gave them the sendoff they deserve.” A few of the Democrats in the chamber looked up at the chanting protesters and began to applaud. State troopers cleared the gallery and broke up the protest, but by that time some of the Republicans on the floor had taken offense. Matt Rinaldi, a member of the Freedom Caucus from Dallas County, who is sometimes rated the most conservative member of the House, later told Fox Business Network that he noticed several banners bearing the message “I AM UNDOCUMENTED AND HERE TO STAY.” He called ICE, and then bragged to his Hispanic colleagues about it. A shoving match broke out on the House floor. Curses flew. Afterward, Rinaldi posted on Facebook that Poncho Nevárez, a Democrat from the border town of Eagle Pass, had threatened his life. “Poncho told me he would ‘get me on the way to my car,’ ” Rinaldi wrote, adding that he made it clear that “I would shoot him in self-defense.” The next day, the capitol was subdued. In the House chamber, docents were again leading school tours. In the rotunda, a high-school orchestra was playing a piece for woodwinds. I went up to the second floor, where the acoustics were better. The orchestra was from Kountze, a little East Texas town that had the distinction, in 1991, of electing America’s first Muslim mayor. The musicians were arrayed in the center of the rotunda, atop the seals of the republic and the five nations of which Texas had once been part: Spain, France, Mexico, the United States, and the Confederacy. I was moved by the thought that the long and bloody history of Texas had arrived at this moment, with small-town kids bringing the many voices of the state into harmony. Speaker Straus was waiting in his chambers, seated on the couch in his shirtsleeves, under a painting of Hereford cattle. He looked far more relaxed than I thought was warranted, given that Governor Abbott was poised to call a special session that would likely focus on Patrick’s must-pass bills. But Straus seemed satisfied. He boasted that the priorities of the House—his priorities—had mostly been accomplished. “We did the Child Protective Services reforms, adding fourteen hundred new caseworkers,” he said. “We made tremendous progress on mental-health reforms and funding.” Texas’s decrepit hospitals were going to be upgraded. A health-care plan for retired teachers had been saved. Enormous cuts to higher education had been averted. “These were issues a little bit under the radar, because they’re not sensational, but they’re issues that are going to make a big difference in Texas lives,” Straus said. “What we didn’t achieve was to begin fixing the school-finance system, which everybody knows is a disaster.” Straus said that some schools in districts that had been strongly affected by the downturn in the oil and gas economy might have to be closed. “We had a plan to bridge that,” he noted. “Unfortunately, the Senate had other priorities.” He attributed the failure to Patrick’s “fixation on vouchers.” I asked Straus about the clash between business and cultural conservatives. He quoted William H. Seward, Lincoln’s Secretary of State, who described the forthcoming Civil War as “an irrepressible conflict.” The prejudices unleashed by the election of Donald Trump had poured kerosene on the already volatile world of Texas politics. Straus, referring to the bathroom bill, said, “We came very close this session to passing a sweepingly discriminatory policy. It would have sent a very negative message around the country.” “That’s still possible, right?” I asked. Couldn’t Abbott put forward his own bill in the special session and threaten to veto any amendments? Straus agreed, but noted, “The legislature is not obligated to act upon his agenda items within the thirty-day period. And the Governor would have the option to call as many thirty-day sessions as he would like.” “So the bill could stay in committee and not get voted out?” Straus smiled. The session was the most fractious in memory, and the bad feelings stirred up in the capitol will linger long after the lawmakers return home. Immigrant communities are fearful, lawmakers are vengeful, and hatemongers feel entitled to spread their message. And the bitter battle among Texas Republicans isn’t over. Governor Abbott called a special session, to reconvene on July 18th, and set forth a list of twenty items that he said required action. Most of them could have been passed in the regular session; none of them were a priority for him before the session began. In addition to the bathroom bill, his list of demands included education vouchers, caps on state and local spending, and new abortion restrictions. He also asked for a thousand-dollar raise for public-school teachers, which the local school boards—not the state—would likely have to pay for. “I expect legislators to return with a calm demeanor, and with a firm commitment to make Texas even better,” he said. Straus was not intimidated. He told me, “We’re under no obligation to pass anything.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

          / CBS/AP LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A bodyguard was charged Tuesday with illegally providing a firearm to the rapper who was performing when gunfire broke out at an Arkansas nightclub this month, and federal officials say one of the guard's guns matched a shell casing found at the scene. No one has been charged in the July 1 shooting at Little Rock's Power Ultra Lounge, which left 28 people injured. City officials say gang violence may have played a role, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson has announced the creation of a task force to address an increasing amount of violence in Arkansas' capital city. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent accused Kentrell Gwynn of providing a firearm to Ricky Hampton, a Memphis, Tennessee, rapper and convicted felon who performs asc Agent Warren Newman also alleged that Gwynn provided armed security to a convicted felon. Hampton and Gwynn were arrested in Alabama less than 24 hours after the shooting. It left 25 people between the ages of 16 and 35 with gunshot wounds, Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said. Three others were hurt, perhaps while fleeing, Buckner said. A statement from the U.S. attorney's office said the two were seen on surveillance video at a Memphis pawnshop picking out a Glock 23 hours after the shooting. Gwynn had purchased a Century Arms AK-style pistol at the pawnshop in May, and investigators say multiple Facebook posts show Hampton with such a gun afterward. According to prosecutors, Gwynn had those guns and a Springfield XD pistol with him when arrested. Federal officials say Gwynn's Springfield pistol matched a shell casing found in the Little Rock club, but they still must be examined. In Newman's affidavit, filed ahead of Gwynn's Tuesday appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Little Rock, Gwynn acknowledged being armed at the Power Ultra Lounge but said he did not shoot at anyone, did not know anyone who fired a shot and did not know whether Hampton had a gun that night. Gwynn also said he was Hampton's bodyguard and was guarding him the night of the shooting, reports CBS Little Rock affiliate KTHV-TV, adding that the affidavit also said Gwynn possessed a Tennessee concealed pistol permit and claimed to be a bounty hunter. Hampton appeared in federal court Tuesday on charges unrelated to the shooting. He's accused of being a felon in possession of a weapon after a separate incident in eastern Arkansas. Prosecutors say he shot at a woman believing she wasn't moving her car fast enough when he was ready to leave a nightclub in Forrest City about a week before the Little Rock shooting. ""She saw Hampton fire the AK-style pistol at her as she was driving away, shattering the glass in her car and injuring her neck,"" Newman wrote. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Kearney appointed a public defender for Hampton even though the rapper claimed to make nearly half a million dollars a year. The public defender, Nicole Lybrand, told the judge the $40,000 a month that Hampton cited was ""a projection of what he would make"" with a successful career. Hampton and Gwynn remained jailed. Lybrand said she would work with state officials in an attempt to have Hampton released pending trial, or at least held in Little Rock rather than in Forrest City, 90 miles to the east.

169,http://time.com/4966877/las-vegas-shooting-gun-control-republicans/?iid=sr-link4,"Republicans in Congress have already made clear that they do not consider the Las Vegas shooting to be a reason for changing existing gun laws. In a number of interviews on Monday, just one day after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, GOP lawmakers accused Democrats calling for more gun control of “politicizing” the tragedy and said existing laws should be more strongly enforced. “The fact that a psychopathic killer murdered innocents is cause for grief. It’s cause for more vigorous law enforcement — for stopping madmen and killers,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told TIME. “But it is not an excuse for Democrats to try and strip away Second Amendment rights from law-abiding citizens.” On Sunday, 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured in a shooting at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Officials say the shooter modified a semiautomatic weapon with a “bump stock” that allows it to fire more like an automatic weapon. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said the shooting was no reason to restrict gun sales. “When an Islamic terrorist blows up a school with kids in it, we are told not to judge all Muslims by the acts of a few,” he said. “And I agree with that. So why do we want to judge all 80 million gun owners in America because of the acts of one perverted idiot? I don’t know what else to call him. I don’t think our problem in America is gun laws. I think criminals obey gun laws like politicians keep promises. And I just hate to see this issue politicized. I don’t know why bad things happen to good people, but they do in this world, and what happened in Las Vegas was terrible. But we can’t legislate away every problem in the world.” Gun control advocates have criticized Republican lawmakers for sponsoring a bill to make it easier to buy silencers, but Speaker Paul Ryan refused to rule out holding a vote on the bill in the future. The bill is a broad piece of legislation designed to increase hunters’ access to federal lands, but tucked into it is the silencer provision that is the brainchild of Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina. Duncan, an avid hunter himself, said Monday that the concerns about the risks of suppressors were “not based on facts.” He also said the events in Las Vegas did not make him reconsider his legislation. “No, not really, because I understand the facts. If Hillary Clinton were standing right here, I’d tell her that a silencer is not a silencer,” he said, referring to the former presidential candidate’s Monday morning tweets suggesting that silencers would make mass shootings more lethal. “It’s a suppresser. It suppresses the sound to the level of a jackhammer — no one would say a jackhammer is silent. We need to make decisions based on facts.” Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a longtime critic of “bump stocks,” recalled past shootings which did not lead to any legislative actions to restrict gun sales. “This is so extraordinary, so extreme, and so heartbreaking,” she told reporters on Monday afternoon. “The power of the weapons he used, how he did it, and the anonymity of it — it’s just horrific. I thought Sandy Hook would [change things]. I thought Columbine would. I thought 101 California Street would. None of that did.” But Republicans argued that it was Democrats like Feinstein who were politicizing the shooting. “This is a tragedy, and if you’re trying to politicize it, or if anyone is trying to politicize it, then shame on them,” Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado told TIME. Contact us at letters@time.com.",2017-07-06 08:00:00,Republicans Are Already Rejecting New Gun Control Laws,,4419,http://time.com

ANKARA, Turkey – Turkish police detained 29 suspected Islamic State group militants in raids in Istanbul on Friday, the country's state-run news agency reported. Anadolu Agency said 22 of the militants detained are foreign nationals, but the report didn't provide details on their nationalities. Seven of them are Turkish citizens. The suspects were detained in a police swoop targeting 20 different addresses around Istanbul, the agency reported. Police seized IS documents, digital material and one firearm during the raids. It said the suspects are believed to have fought with IS in Syria and were making plans to return to the conflict-torn country. Turkey has been hit by a series of deadly attacks carried out by IS or Kurdish militants and has stepped up anti-terrorism operations across the country.

Saturday, 22 July 2017 07:56 AM President Donald Trump on Saturday took to Twitter to address the reports about his potential issuance of pardons in the Russia investigation, saying there is no need for him to exercise that power. While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS Trump's tweet comes in the aftermath of a Washington Post story Thursday that reported Trump and his staff were exploring ways to thwart special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump's team and Russia. One of those avenues was the use of Trump's pardoning authority, the Post reported. Trump then tweeted that Mueller ought to be looking in a different direction for actual crimes - old foe Hillary Clinton. So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted? ...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc. My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails! © 2021 Newsmax.

174,http://time.com/4965896/las-vegas-shooting-victims-names/?xid=homepage,"Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather, were listening to Jason Aldean sing country tunes at a Las Vegas music festival Sunday night when a noise rang out — the sounds of gunfire. Melton, a 29-year-old nurse in Nashville, sprang into action, shielding Heather from the barrage of bullets that rained down on the crowd of more than 22,000 people. Heather was one of the lucky survivors. Melton was not. “At this point, I’m in complete disbelief and despair. I don’t know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his,” she said in a statement to NBC affiliate WCYB. Melton is one of at least 58 people who were killed in the shooting, which is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. More than 500 concertgoers, hailing from different cities all over the country and world, were injured in the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. One victim was a middle school special education teacher from southern California. Another victim was a beloved secretary in New Mexico. Information about the victims of the Las Vegas massacre slowly emerged Monday as families and friends learned the devastating news. Authorities are still investigating how the attack unfolded, but police identified 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as the lone gunman behind the rampage. Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 concert from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where he had been staying for days. When a SWAT team swarmed his room, they found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities said they later seized at least 17 guns from the room. The Clark County Coroner’s office on Thursday released the official list of the 58 people who were killed in Sunday night’s mass shooting in Las Vegas. Here are their names. Hannah Ahlers, a mother of three from Murrieta, Calif., is remembered as part of a skydiving community who enjoyed both outdoor thrills and simple pleasures, reports the Los Angeles Times. “She never came across with the diva mentality she easily could have had. She was a devoted mother and wife,” friend Sunni Almond told the Times. Brian Ahlers, her husband of 17 years, told CNN that she was “shot in the head while dancing” with him at the Route 91 Festival. “She was a full-time house wife and mommy and she was amazing at it,” he said. “Very active in moms groups and our daughter’s volleyball team. She wasn’t too good for anybody. Beautiful inside and out.” Heather Alvarado, 35, of Utah, was the happiest when she was with her family, especially her three children, according to her husband, Albert. “She would do ANYTHING for them,” Albert said in a statement issued through his employer, the Cedar City Fire Department. “She always saw the good in others. She spent her whole life serving others in her family and community.” Albert said his wife also loved traveling with her family, even if they were just day trips. Dorene Anderson, of Alaska, was the “most amazing wife, mother and person this world ever had,” her family said in a statement. “Due to this horrific and terrible situation, our family is dealing with a great loss,” the statement said. “We are so grateful and lucky for the time that we did have with her.” Anderson was devoted to her family. She also loved hockey, according to Marie English, secretary of a local nonprofit hockey organization. “She was friendly to everybody. She had a heart of gold. She was just an all-around, wonderful Alaskan,” English told the Alaska Dispatch News. Anderson’s longtime friend D.J. Fauske told the newspaper that Anderson was a “saint of a person.” “I’ve watched her daughters grow up to become amazing women and I know they will continue their mom’s lasting legacy,” Fauske said. Disney employee Carrie Barnette was among those killed in Sunday’s mass shooting, Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Robert Iger confirmed in a statement Monday evening. “Carrie Barnette had been a member of the Disney California Adventure culinary team for ten years and was beloved by her friends and colleagues,” Iger wrote. “Our thoughts are with her family, along with our support, during this incredibly difficult time.” Jessica Milam, another Disney employee, was seriously injured in Las Vegas, Iger said. In a separate Twitter post, he described the shooting as a “senseless, horrific, act, and a terrible loss for so many.” When bullets starting raining down from above, Jack Beaton leaned his body over his wife, Laurie, and wrapped his arms around her in full protection. “He told me, ‘Get down, get down, get down.’ He told me, ‘I love you, Laurie’ and his arms were around me and his body just went heavy on me,” Laurie told the Associated Press. The two had traveled from Bakersfield, Calif., to Las Vegas to celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary at the Route 91 country music festival. The last thing Beaton ever did was save his wife’s life. “I screamed his name and he wasn’t answering me. There was a lot of blood,” Laurie said. Beaton, a 54-year-old construction worker, had been shot and later died. He leaves behind a 20-year-old son and an 18-year-old daughter. “I knew every day that he would protect me and take care of me and love me unconditionally, and what he did is no surprise to me, and he is my hero,” Laurie said. Steven Berger, of Minnesota, was celebrating his 44th birthday with friends at the Las Vegas music festival when he was shot and killed. The financial advisor, who loved country music, leaves behind his three children and his devastated parents. “He’s our only son,” Steven’s father, Richard Berger, told the Associated Press. “It’s terrible.” After spending more than 24 hours uncertain of his son’s fate, Richard Berger said the coroner’s office in Las Vegas delivered the news Tuesday afternoon. “At least now we know,” Richard Berger said. “Now we got busy things to do with three grandchildren.” Candice Bowers was a single mother of three, who had recently grown her family by adopting a 2-year-old, relatives told the Orange County Register. Bowers, 40, was a hardworking restaurant waitress who always managed to take care of her entire family on her own, Bowers’ grandmother, Patricia Zacker, told the newspaper. “She never had any support, except herself,” Zacker said. Bowers’ family had encouraged her to have some fun and go with a friend to the musical festival in Las Vegas. But she never made it out of the venue alive. Zacker remembered her granddaughter for her smile and big heart. “She was a generous girl,” she said. Denise Burditus of Martinsburg, W.Va., was a grandmother who attended the festival with her husband, Tony. “It saddens me to say that I lost my wife of 32 years, a mother of two, soon to be grandmother of five this evening in the Las Vegas shooting,” Tony wrote on his Facebook page, according to MetroNews, a radio station in West Virginia. “Denise passed in my arms. I LOVE YOU BABE.” Tony posted a picture of the two of them kissing on his Facebook page on Monday. A special education teacher at Manhattan Beach Middle School in southern California, Sandy Casey had a demonstrable impact on her students, their families and the school community, Manhattan Beach Unified School District Superintendent Mike Matthews said in a statement. Casey worked at the middle school for almost a decade. “She is loved by students and colleagues alike and will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way,” Matthews said. “We lost a spectacular teacher who devoted her life to helping some of our most needy students.” Andrea Castilla was celebrating her 28th birthday in Las Vegas with family when terror struck. She was holding hands with her sisters watching the show when gunshots and yells of “Duck!” broke out, reports the Associated Press, citing the family’s GoFundMe page. “Sadly, Andrea was shot in the head.” wrote her aunt Marina Parker. Castilla was carried by family members to a nearby highway, where a truck drove them to a hospital. She died after arriving at the hospital. The family said that due to a mix up with another patient, they were told of her death hours later. “Our entire family is heartbroken,” Parker wrote on Facebook. Denise Cohen was supposed to return to California High School in Ramon, Calif., where she graduated in 1977, for a reunion in mid-October. The school’s alumni association confirmed her death Tuesday on its Facebook page. “She was an amazing, vibrant, positive classmate and friend,” wrote her friend and fellow graduate Tina Lippis-Mancebo. Cohen died with her boyfriend, 56-year-old Derrick “Bo” Taylor, the AP reports. Her son, Jeff Rees, recalls her laughter, as well as how she made people around her feel their best. “When she would take me to the movies as a kid, I was just waiting to hear her laugh because it would just crack me up,” Rees told AP. “I feel sorry for all of the people in the world who never got a chance to meet her.” In Riverside, Calif., loved ones of 29-year-old Austin Davis were anxiously waiting for Davis to turn up somehow after he attended the musical festival in Las Vegas and went missing after the shooting. They eventually learned he never made it out alive. “I can’t believe this happened. You didn’t deserve this,” his girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, wrote on Facebook. Thomas Day Jr.’s four adult children loved being with him. All four, who had joined him for the music festival, are now left grieving after the 54-year-old California home builder was gunned down, their grandfather told the Los Angeles Times. “He was the best dad. That’s why the kids were with him,” Thomas Day Sr. said. “His kids are with me right now. They’re crushed.” Christiana Duarte had recently graduated from the University of Arizona with a business marketing degree, according to the Los Angeles Times. The 21-year-old was working for the Los Angeles Kings hockey team when she was gunned down during the Route 91 music festival, family members told NBC Los Angeles. She was among those declared missing after the massacre. Stacee Rodrigues Etcheber was enjoying the Las Vegas music festival with her husband of 13 years, Vinnie Etcheber, a San Francisco police officer. When bullets rang out, Vinnie instructed his wife to run for safety while he sprang into action, helping victims, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The two got separated, and Stacee was later shot and killed, family members said, according to the Chronicle. Stacee Rodrigues Etcheber, 50, was a longtime hair stylist back home in California. Her brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook that Stacee leaves behind two children. Almost 24 hours earlier, Al Etcheber had posted a plea for people to help find Stacee, who was missing at the time. Brian Fraser was his stepson’s “rock” and “mentor” before a gunman ended his life. Nick Arellano, 25, told the Orange County Register how his father loved seeking thrills and adventures. Fraser, 39, enjoyed hunting, deep-sea fishing and snowboarding. He recently started learning how to fly airplanes, Arellano said. Fraser, of La Palma, Calif., leaves behind his wife and four children. “He helped anyone who asked. That’s why people loved and adored him,” Arellano said. Keri Galvan was fatally shot in the head, leaving behind her husband and their three children, who are between 2 and 10 years old, according to the Ventura County Star. Galvan, 31, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., was a cocktail server and a popular staple at a local steakhouse, where she had worked for almost a decade, the newspaper said. “She’s always being there for everybody,” her sister, Lindsey Poole, told the Star. “She never forgets anybody’s special occasion. She’s just constantly making sure everybody’s OK.” Dana Gardner, who had worked for San Bernardino County, Calif. for 26 years, died Monday after sustaining two gunshot wounds, the San Bernardino County Assessor/Recorder’s office said. “I am so very sorry to report that one of the Assessor/Recorder employees in attendance at the event was shot twice and, tragically, passed away this morning,” San Bernardino County Interim CEO Dena Smith said in an email to the Board of Supervisors, according to local media reports. Angie Gomez was a 2015 graduate from Riverside Polytechnic High School in Riverside, Calif., the school’s PTSA confirmed in a Facebook post. “She will always be loved and endeared by our Poly Family,” the post said. The off-duty Las Vegas police officer who was killed during the shooting, Charleston Hartfield was a youth football coach, husband and father, according friends of his who spoke to the Las Vegas Review-Journal and other media outlets. “Coach Hartfield touched many lives both on and off the field,” his youth football team, called the Henderson Cowboys, wrote in a Facebook post. “He was a great man who we all lost way to early.” Hartfield was also a published author, who wrote a memoir detailing his time working in law enforcement in Las Vegas, titled Memoirs of a Public Servant. It was published in July. Chris Hazencomb died shielding his best friend’s wife from a hail of bullets at the music festival in Las Vegas, according to his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb. She took her son off life support Monday morning after he was shot in the head, she told the Ventura County Star. “You don’t expect your kid to go before you go,” Maryanne Hazencomb said. Chris Hazencomb worked at the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Camarillo, Calif. He and his mother were very close. In the duffel bag he took to Las Vegas, there was a Route 91 T-shirt with a pink flamingo, according to the Star. It was a gift for his mother that he was never able to give her. Jennifer Irvine, a San Diego attorney, died in the shooting spree, her law firm, Fair Cadora, confirmed in an email to TIME on Tuesday. Irvine reportedly spent her final moments singing, dancing and holding hands with her girlfriends. Kyle Krasta, the Sports Director for CBS News and longtime friend of Irvine’s, described her as “a shining light that will not be extinguished by a gutless coward with a gun,” in a Facebook post Monday. “You bought so much joy to others, including me,” he wrote. “You left this world singing & dancing, but far too soon.” According to Irvine’s profile in a directory of legal professionals, her interests included snowboarding and hot yoga. She had earned a black belt in the Korean martial art Taekwon-do. Teresa “Nicol” Kimura was killed when the gunman opened fire for the second time. The thirty-eight-year-old from Placentia, Calif., was in Las Vegas with six friends, who all survived the shooting rampage, reports the Orange County Register. “Her spirit was beautiful, her laugh was infectious, and she just had a way of making every time we gathered an awesome one,” said her friend Ryan Miller, a pastor who attended the music festival with Kimura. Kimura worked in the Irvine office of California’s Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The press office of Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged her death Thursday, tweeting: “Sad to learn @CDTFA employee Teresa Nicol Kimura was a victim of the Las Vegas shooting. We send sincere condolences to family & coworkers.” Jessica Klymchuk, a Canadian resident, mother and wife, was also killed in the shooting. She was an educational assistant, bus driver and librarian at the St. Stephen’s School in Valleyview, Alberta, according to CBC. “Our hearts go out to the loved ones of the Albertan who was killed in the Las Vegas attack,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notely wrote on Twitter. “We are so sorry for your loss.” Carly Kreibaum, 33, of northwestern Iowa, was killed in Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, her sister-in-law Sarah Rohwer told the Des Moines Register. Kreibaum had attended the music festival with two friends, who escaped unharmed after seeing Kreibaum get shot, according to the Sioux City Journal. Grieving family members told the Boston Globe that Rhonda LeRocque from Tewksbury, Mass., was killed while attending Sunday’s open-air concert with her husband and young daughter. “All I know is someone started shooting and people are running and she got shot in the head,” said Carol Marquis, LeRocque’s grandmother. “And we lost a dear, close, good person — one of the nicest people you will ever meet in your life.” LeRoque worked for a design firm in Cambridge, Mass., and was active in her church, the Globe reports. Family members said her husband and daughter were unharmed. Loved ones remembered Victor Link as a music lover who held his family together. “He was the best of us,” Link’s sister, Lisa Hiestand, told the Washington Post. “He always had the time, no matter what, for family and friends.” Link — of Shafter, Calif. — loved music festivals and often traveled around the state with his fiancée to attend them, according to the Post. Jordan McIldoon was a mechanic apprentice from Maple Ridge, British Columbia in Canada. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said all government buildings in Victoria and Maple Ridge would fly their flags half mast in McIldoon’s honor. McIldoon’s last moments were spent with Heather Gooze, a Las Vegas bartender who was helping injured concertgoers. When a group of men came carrying McIldoon, Gooze stayed with him, she told CBC Radio. She “felt his fingers, like, tighten and then loosen,” she said, discovering that he had died. She then stayed with him, answering calls from his loved ones on his cell phone, and messaging his family members on Facebook. “I would never want myself or one of my family members to be left alone,” Gooze told CBC Radio. “I needed to make sure that they could identify him, that they knew who he was, that they knew he has a girlfriend who was here.” McIldoon’s girlfriend, Amber, was unharmed. Kelsey Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School District in 2007 and served as a substitute teacher there since 2012, according to district superintendent Blanca Cavazos. “Kelsey was smart, compassionate and kind. She had a sweet spirit and a love for children,” said Mary Alice Finn, principal of Taft Union High School. “Words cannot adequately capture the sorrow felt by her students, colleagues and friends in learning of her passing.” Meadows graduated in 2011 with a B.A. in History from Fresno State University. History professor Lori Clune remembers her as “a gifted teacher who demonstrated a skill and passion for her chosen profession.” The university announced Tuesday that its flags will fly at half-staff on the day of her services, which has yet to be announced. Calla Medig, who worked as a waitress in Edmonton, Canada, took time off her job to attend the Route 91 festival, reports CBC News. It was her third time attending the country music event in Las Vegas, according to her employer. She was “super mature, light heartened, grounded, down to earth,” Scott Collingwood, general manager of Moxie’s restaurant, told CNN. “She left a big hole in our hearts here.” Medig, who was in her 20s, was described as kind and warm-hearted by friends on social media. “Calla was among the kindest and warm-hearted, beautiful souls I have ever had the pleasure to know,” wrote former colleague Bailey Huebner on Facebook. “Her smile made such a positive impact on my life.” Sonny Melton, a certified nurse from Tennessee, saved his wife’s life during the shooting. His wife, Dr. Heather Gulish Melton, remembered him a heartbreaking Facebook post. “Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his,” she wrote. Sixty-seven-year-old Patricia Mestas died in last Sunday’s shooting, the Clark County Coroner confirmed. Mestas was a country music enthusiast, reports Reuters. One of her favorite musicians was Jason Aldean, who was performing when the shooter opened fire. “She went to almost every country show in driving distance,” a friend Isa Bahu told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Mestas lived in Menifee, Calif. The Clark County Coroner confirmed that Austin Meyer died in the shooting. Meyer was in Las Vegas with his fiancée, who survived the shooting, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. They got tickets to the Route 91 Festival to celebrate his birthday and their anniversary. The 24-year-old from Monterey County, Calif. had recently moved to Reno to study Transportation Technology in Truckee Meadows Community College. “He had dreams of opening his own auto repair shop after graduation. He was excited to get married and start a family,” his sister Veronica told KSBW-TV. Adrian Murfitt, 35, was a fisherman from Anchorage, Alaska, with a lifelong interest in hockey, his sister told the Associated Press.

California-based kindergarten teacher Jenny Parks was in Las Vegas with her husband Bobby Parks for Sunday’s concert. The parents of two were high school sweethearts, AP reports. Jenny had been planning to throw a 40th birthday party for her husband next week. While Bobby, who was shot in the arm, made it out of the concert alive, Jenny did not. “It breaks my heart,” their friend Jessica Maddin said. “People go to concerts to have a good time, connect with others and escape the tragedies of this world.” Carrie Parsons lost her life in Las Vegas, two nights after seeing one of her favorite country singers, Eric Church, perform at the Route 91 music festival, according to the Washington Post. The 31-year-old Seattle recruiter had recently gotten engaged, her longtime friend, Laura Cooper, told KOMO News. “She was a one-in-a-million friend,” Cooper said. “She would always say ‘live, laugh, love’ and she did that.” Robert Patterson was wondering early Tuesday how he would return home to Los Angeles and tell his 8-year-old daughter that her mother, Lisa, had died in the mass shooting in Las Vegas. “I don’t know how I’m going to tell her. I have no idea. She loved her mommy so much. It’s going to be devastating,” Patterson told Fox 5 Las Vegas in an interview posted Tuesday morning. “I don’t know how she’s going to handle it. Even my older kids are just basket cases right now, just like me.” Patterson said he had not slept since the shooting. He and his wife had been together for more than 30 years and had three children together. “I’m lost right now,” he said. “I can’t believe she’s gone.” Patterson said his wife loved being in Las Vegas and gambling. When the two had vacation time, they would often spend it in Vegas. Speaking at a small vigil for victims that had formed outside the Bellagio, Patterson told Fox 5 he would remember his wife for her smile and how warm and caring she was to everyone. “There was nobody that cared more about people and life more than my wife,” he said. John Phippen died knowing his son did everything he could to try to save him. After Phippen was shot in the back, his son, Travis Phippen, attempted to stop the bleeding by plugging his father’s bullet wound with one of his fingers as he dragged him to safety, according to the Los Angeles Times. But Travis Phippen’s efforts ultimately weren’t enough to save his dad. “He was my best friend,” the younger Phippen, an off-duty emergency medical technician, told the Times. “He never did anything wrong to anybody. He was always kind and gentle. He was the biggest teddy bear I knew.” Travis Phippen had also been shot in the arm. Both had traveled from Santa Clarita, Calif. to attend the concert. The death of Melissa Ramirez, who worked as a member specialist for an auto insurer, was confirmed Tuesday by California State University, Bakersfield, where she graduated in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. “We are terribly saddened to learn that we lost a member of our CSUB family in this senseless act of violence,” president Horace Mitchell said in a statement. “Our entire CSUB campus community is heartbroken, and we send our deepest sympathies to Melissa Ramirez’s family and friends.” After learning about the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, her parents and siblings rushed to Las Vegas from Littlerock, Calif, AP reports.

I know she was really into music, period,” her cousin Fabiola Farnetti told AP. “Her smile would just brighten up everyone’s day.” Jordyn Rivera was in her fourth year at California State University, San Bernardino, according to Tomás Morales, the school’s president. Rivera was studying health care management and was also a member of the school’s chapter of Eta Sigma Gamma, the national health education honor society. “I personally got a chance to know her when we spent time together last summer in London during the summer abroad program,” Morales said in a statement. “We will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy, and kindness.” Quinton Robbins was at the concert, on a date with his girlfriend, when he was shot and killed, according to the Washington Post. Family members remembered the 20-year-old University of Nevada at Las Vegas student as “the most kind and loving soul” who had a “contagious laugh and smile.” “Everyone who met him, loved him,” his aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote on Facebook. “He was truly an amazing person.” Robbins’s grandmother, Gaynor Wells, told the Post her grandson was “just a jewel.” Robbins, who was thinking about attending dental school, was a recreational assistant with the city of Henderson in Nevada, according to the newspaper. His girlfriend was unharmed. Cameron Robinson was fatally shot at the Route 91 music festival, which he had attended with his boyfriend, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Six weeks ago, Rocio Guillen Rocha gave birth to a baby boy — her fourth child. On Sunday, she was killed in Las Vegas, during one of the worst mass shootings in modern U.S. history, according to her fiance’s sister, Nikki Stowers. Stowers told NPR that Rocha had died shortly after arriving at a hospital. Besides the infant, Rocha leaves behind an 18-month-old daughter, a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old son, according to NPR. “I don’t even know what to say,” Stowers said. “She was such a great mom. It’s so unfair that she’s had her life taken away.” Tara Roe, a 34-year-old educational assistant in Canada, died in the musical festival shooting, according to her relatives and school district. Roe, of Alberta, leaves behind two sons, CTV News reported. “It is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,” Foothills Superintendent of Schools said in a statement. A beloved secretary at Miyamura High School in Gallup, N.M., Lisa Romero was an “incredible, loving and sincere friend, mentor and advocate for our students,” Mike Hyatt, interim superintendent of Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools, said at a press conference Monday. Christopher Roybal, a U.S. Navy veteran who survived two shootouts while serving in Afghanistan, died in the hail of gunfire at the concert, his mother told the New York Daily News on Monday. “I got confirmation today,” said Roybal’s mom, Debby Allen. “The coroner told me. It sounds like he got shot pretty quickly. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare, I want to wake up so badly.” Roybal was about to turn 29. He and his mother were in Vegas celebrating his upcoming birthday. Allen told the News she was supposed to meet her son at the concert after a nap. But when she got there, gunfire had erupted. A concert-goer pulled her away to safety, but Allen fought to run towards danger to find her son. “I desperately wanted to go back in to find him. Nobody would let me go back in. They were pulling me away. I kept screaming, ‘My son! My son!’ But they said, ‘You can’t go back into the gunfire,'” Allen said. “It was horrible. I couldn’t keep my feet underneath me. I kept collapsing.” Allen said her son served seven years in the Navy, from 2005 to 2012. This year, Roybal moved from California to Colorado to help open other Crunch Fitness gyms, his boss, David Harman, told the Associated Press. “He is a guy that could always put a smile on your face … after all the stuff he had been through,” Harman said. In a Facebook post in July, Roybal described the trauma and fear that comes with getting shot at during battle. “What’s it like to be shot at? It’s a nightmare no amount of drugs, no amount of therapy and no amount of drunk talks with your war veteran buddies will ever be able to escape,” he wrote. Brett Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver from Bullhead City, Ariz., was in Las Vegas attending the Route 91 festival with his fiancée, CNN reports. The father of three and grandfather of five was shot in the back of the head and leg, and succumbed to his injuries Tuesday in hospital, according to ABC15. Relatives remember Schwanbeck as a kind, loving man who treasured family time. “He would drive 500 miles to help you if you needed it. He loved his family dearly and cherished lake trips, family gatherings, hunting, camping and spending time with his kids and grandkids,” reads the family’s GoFundMe page. “He liked to be where no one else was at. He liked to get lost out in the middle of the woods,” Shawn, his youngest son, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Infinity Communications and Consulting, where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, released a statement Monday confirming her death in Las Vegas. Company CEO Fred Brakeman described her as “the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day.” “If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed,” Brakeman wrote. Schweitzer grew up in Bakersfield, Calif., where her father Scott Schweitzer owns the Bakersfield Speedway car racing track, according to local media reports. Laura Shipp was a single mother who moved from California to Las Vegas to be closer to her only child — her 23-year-old son who is a Marine, relatives told the Ventura County Star. “He just lost the most important person in his life,” said Shipp’s brother, Steve. “She was his world and he was hers.” Erick Silva, a Las Vegas native, was a security guard at the music festival. According to the coroner’s office, Silva was shot in head, his uncle Rob Morgan told the Washington Post. Morgan remembers Silva as someone whose life goal was to help others. He recalls him buying burgers for homeless people, treating relatives to dinner, and helping his mother pay her bills by working long shifts and holding yard sales in his free time. “He said he would never leave his mom, she would never have to worry,” Morgan told the Post. “I know that he was doing all that he could do to keep [people safe] before his life was taken,” event manager James Garrett wrote on Facebook. Silva had started working with him a few weeks prior to the shooting rampage. Susan Smith was the office manager at Vista Fundamental Elementary School in Simi Valley, Calif. The school’s PTA described her as “a wonderful woman, an advocate for our children, and a friend,” in a post on Facebook, where parents and co-workers shared their condolences and memories of her positive, upbeat attitude and sense of humor. Brennan Stewart, an aspiring musician working in his family’s construction firm, was attending the Route 91 Harvest festival with his girlfriend Gia Iantuono when the gunman struck. “I will remember Brennan as a light that came into my life when I needed one. In all aspects he was just wonderful,” Iantuono told the Washington Post in a Facebook message. He played the guitar and, prior to the shooting, had finished recording the last song for his EP, she told the Post. Iantuono said that during the concert she fell on the ground after being hit in the knee by something, looked back and saw Stewart also on the ground. She started screaming when she saw blood. A man told her she had to run, Iantuono recalled, but she could not as her knee was dislocated. The same man then carried her first to a hiding place, and later to some bleachers. She later learnt that her boyfriend had died. Derrick Taylor, who worked for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for nearly three decades, was killed in Sunday’s shooting at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, his employer said. The 56-year-old, who was known as “Bo,” was a commander at the Ventura Conservation Camp, a prison that houses up to 110 male inmates. Taylor began his career with the department in 1988 and earned the rank of a lieutenant. “There are no words to express the feeling of loss and sadness regarding Bo’s passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. We truly are a family here at SCC and Bo’s loss will be felt throughout the prison, conservation camps, and Department,” Warden Joel Martinez wrote in a memo to staff, according to the department’s online newsletter. Taylor had been dating 58-year-old Denise Cohen for several years, according to the AP. They both died at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas when the gunman opened fire.

The 32-year-old had come to Las Vegas from California, where she worked in the insurance industry. The LAX Coastal Chamber of Commerce confirmed her death in a statement. Vo’s close friend, Casey Lubin, told BuzzFeed News that Vo was the “most vibrant, passionate, brave and kind person I have ever met.” Kurt von Tillow, a truck driver who lived in Cameron Park, Calif., died of his injuries from the shooting, reports CNN. He was at the Route 91 festival with a number of relatives, according to Sacramento’s KCRA news channel. Von Tillow’s sister and niece were injured in the shooting, while his wife, daughter and son-in-law were unharmed, KCRA reports. A longtime friend remembers the 55-year-old as a “fun, fun guy and a really friendly man” who loved golf and beer, reports the Sacramento Bee. “He was a big beer drinker,” said Iain Marshall, who went on golfing trips with the von Tillows to Scotland and Ireland. “We stopped at every pub in England and Ireland, where there’s a pub on every corner.” Bill Wolfe Jr. and his wife Robyn were at the music festival, celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary, according to ABC 27.

The editorial was published online on June 14, the day a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where Republican lawmakers were practicing for an annual charity game. The editorial said there was a link between political incitement and the mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded Representative Gabby Giffords and said that Ms. Palin’s “political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” The Times later issued a correction, saying that there was no established link between political statements and the shooting and that the map circulated by Ms. Palin’s PAC had depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath the stylized cross hairs. The NYT Opinion Twitter account also sent out the correction about the lack of a link, apologizing and saying that it appreciated that readers had pointed out the mistake. Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit that The Times’s response “did not approach the degree of the retraction and apology necessary and warranted by The Times’s false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited murder.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times said, “We have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously.” Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, was critically injured in the June 14 shooting.

(FOX 19) One woman was killed and eight other people, including three children, were injured late Saturday after two men wearing all black opened fire at a gender reveal party in Ohio, officials said. One of those injured was the pregnant woman who was giving the party. A gender reveal party is where friends and family gather to announce the sex of the baby. The unidentified woman told Fox 19 that she lost her child, a boy, after being shot in the leg. Officers responded to the home in Colerain Township, outside Cincinnati around 11:30 p.m., said police spokesman Jim Love. He told Fox 19 that five adults and three children were all watching television in the living room when the men began shooting handguns. ""They were all there for a very positive reason when somebody opened fire,"" Love told FOX 19. At a news conference Sunday, Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney said that none of the eight people wounded appeared to have life-threatening injuries, including the children, who are ages 8, 6 and 2. The 22-year-old has been identified as Autum Garrett, of Huntington, Ind. Denney said the two gunmen who fled on foot haven't been identified or arrested. He wouldn't discuss details of the investigation into the shootings. There were no indications of a forced entry by the gunmen, who entered the house through the front door, Denney said. He said it's unclear why the victims were shot. ""We don't know if they were targeted, or this was intended for someone else,"" Denney said. Colerain Township called in the Cincinnati Police Department to process the crime scene, which included a search of the home after police obtained a warrant.

TUNKHANNOCK, Pa. – Extensive repairs and a thorough cleaning have removed the physical traces of a mass shooting inside a Pennsylvania supermarket, but it'll take more than a makeover to erase shoppers' memories of what happened in the aisles. The Weis Markets Inc. store in rural Tunkhannock, about 135 miles northwest of Philadelphia, is scheduled to reopen this week, more than a month after it was turned into a triple-murder scene by a 24-year-old gunman who had expressed violent and suicidal thoughts online. The regional supermarket chain is planning a low-key 6 a.m. Thursday reopening of the store, with no public ceremony, though there will be a private event for employees. But people in this small town are still talking about it, and opinions are divided over whether the store should have been torn down. The family of at least one victim wants it gone, saying the building holds too many painful memories. Judy Nulton, of Tunkhannock, who was shopping at a Walmart down the street, said she'd avoid Weis because of the shooting. ""You just won't feel the same when you walk in there. I would feel bad going through there,"" she said. ""Whatever they do, that's going to be on your mind. It's not going to go away."" The store was closed to customers when gunman Randy Stair, 24, of Dallas, Pennsylvania, took two pistol-grip shotguns to work, blocked the exits and began shooting shortly before 1 a.m. on June 8. He killed three co-workers — firing a total of 59 rounds that also wrecked merchandise, counters and other parts of the interior — before turning the gun on himself. State regulators walking through the supermarket hours after the shooting noted ""damage to the entire facility"" and ordered Weis to toss all food and other products that might have been contaminated. The food retailer hired a restoration company to clean and sanitize the store, and then did an extensive remodel that included new paint and decor, a renovated employee break room and restrooms, and some new cases and shelving. Every item of merchandise in the store was replaced. Less than three weeks after the shooting, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture cleared it to reopen. But should it? The family of shooting victim Terry Sterling, 63, of South Montrose, says no. ""We don't like it because of what happened,"" said Laura Elliott, the longtime companion of Sterling's son, with whom she has two children. ""It brings back too many memories. It should be torn down and moved."" Weis spokesman Dennis Curtin said the last month ""has understandably been an extremely difficult time for the victims' families, our associates, and the community, as we all dealt with this senseless act of violence."" But he said ""closing our doors on this location was never an option."" The Sunbury-based company, which has more than 200 stores in seven states, has operated a supermarket in Tunkhannock for a quarter-century. ""The people of Tunkhannock have offered overwhelming support for the reopening of our store, and we are truly grateful,"" Curtin said. Weis said it is discussing ways to honor the memories of Sterling and the other two slain employees, Victoria Brong, 26, of Factoryville; and Brian Hayes, 47, of Springville. Other mass shootings have resulted in different fates for the buildings where they took place. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, as well as an Amish schoolhouse in Pennsylvania, were torn town after massacres of schoolchildren. A movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, reopened six months after a gunman killed 12 and injured dozens, leading to protests from some survivors. The owner of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, plans a memorial at the site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. In Tunkhannock, the buzz and whine of saws came from the supermarket's interior a week ahead of its planned reopening. A large sign hung across the front windows that said, ""To our valued customers, we are working hard to reopen your Tunkhannock Weis."" The store's 88 employees have been paid as usual during the cleanup and renovations, and most if not all are expected back once the store reopens, according to Curtin. Some people said the region could scarcely afford to lose an employer. ""You need business. It was a terrible situation, but people need work to make it around here,"" said Summer Frantz, 19, of Harveys Lake. Wyoming County Commissioner Judy Mead said a Weis worker told her she is eager to get back to work. ""She thinks of it as her market, and her customers,"" Mead said.

HONOLULU – In a story July 11 about a U.S. Army soldier arrested on terrorism charges, The Associated Press erroneously described the soldier as ""pleading"" allegiance to the Islamic State group. He is accused of ""pledging"" allegiance to the group. A corrected version of the story is below: Events that led to arrest of Army soldier on terror charges A look at a timeline of events that took a U.S. Army soldier from his home in Hawaii to wars in the Middle East and eventually on to a federal detention center facing terrorism charges. By CALEB JONES Associated Press HONOLULU (AP) — After years of red flags and reprimands by the U.S. Army, the FBI took an active-duty soldier into custody on terrorism charges over the weekend. The yearlong federal investigation that led to his arrest involved multiple undercover agents and confidential informants. Sgt. 1st Class Ikaika Kang made an initial appearance Monday in federal court. Here's a look at a timeline of events that took Kang from his home in Hawaii to wars in the Middle East and eventually on to a federal detention center facing terrorism charges, accused of pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group and wanting to commit a mass shooting: ___ 2001 Kang enlisted in the Army just months after the Sept. 11 attacks. ___ 2002-2003 Kang served in South Korea. ___ 2010 Kang deployed to Iraq in March. ___ 2011 Kang returns from Iraq in February. Over the course of the year, Kang was repeatedly reprimanded for threatening to kill other service members and making pro-Islamic State group arguments while on duty. ___ 2012 Kang's security clearance was revoked because of concerns about the death threats and Islamic State comments. ___ 2013 After completing requirements set forth by the military in response to Kang's actions, his security clearance was reinstated. According to the FBI, a CD with classified documents that was later found in Kang's possession was created in June. In July, Kang was deployed to Afghanistan and returned in April 2014. ___ 2016 AUGUST Kang appeared to start becoming radicalized, and the Army contacted the FBI to begin an investigation. SEPTEMBER A confidential FBI informant reported that Kang was talking about radical Islam more frequently. He was heard talking about religion, the Islamic State group and expressing anti-government views. The confidential informant also reported that Kang was listening to a Muslim leader who was killed in 2000 recite the Quran. OCTOBER Kang went to the Air Traffic Control Operator Senior Leadership Course at Ft. Rucker in Alabama. NOVEMBER The FBI searched his belongings while at the training program in Alabama and took data from his laptop and an external hard drive that contained classified military documents. They also found videos and files referring to terrorist groups and violence. An undercover FBI agent posed as a guest lecturer at the training program and was introduced to Kang. The two spent several days interacting, including going to a mosque to pray together. Kang then told the FBI agent that he wanted to travel to Turkey to visit an Islamic State group consulate, but that he was afraid he would be arrested if did so. The undercover agent told Kang that he thought the Islamic State could use his skills, and Kang said that he wanted to provide training to their fighters. The FBI agent told Kang that he knew a militant who would be travelling to Hawaii, and could arrange a meeting. DECEMBER Kang returned to Hawaii. Around the middle of the month, the FBI searched his home in Waipahu and found a CD marked secret that they say contained the same classified documents they found on his hard drives. ___ 2017 JANUARY - FEBRUARY Kang reportedly continued making pro-Islamic State statements to other soldiers, including that he would not shoot at fighters if he was deployed to Iraq. He also said he thought the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job conducted by the United States. Kang received ""negative counselling statements"" from the Army and was told to stop making such remarks. MARCH Kang told an FBI informant that he had been researching online videos about the most effective and painful torture techniques because he was angry that a civilian had taken away his air traffic control license. The FBI document says that Kang wanted to ""tie him down and pour Drano in his eyes."" Kang also said the Pulse Nightclub shooter in Orlando ""did what he had to do"" and that ""America is the only terrorist organization in the world."" He also said that ""Hitler was right"" and supported the mass killings of Jews. MAY The FBI's undercover investigation continued, and they made arrangements for Kang to possibly take part in a training course on the mainland that could help the Islamic State group. JUNE Kang met with undercover agents in a hotel room and transferred military documents, including classified documents originally obtained in 2013, to the agents, who Kang believed would pass them along to the Islamic State. The agents offered Kang the opportunity to take payment for his help, but Kang declined. The agent also told Kang that he could arrange a meeting with an actual Islamic State member, and Kang responded, ""Hell yeah."" JULY On July 7, Kang met with the undercover agents at a house in Honolulu, where they introduced him to a man Kang believed to be a member of the Islamic State group. Kang told the men that he would provide training and help them with acquiring drone technology that could help the terrorist group fight U.S. forces. He brought firearms, knives and tactical gear to the house. The agents told Kang that he could come back to the house the next day. On July 8, Kang was introduced to a man he was told was an Islamic State leader. The men discussed and then purchased a drone that Kang told them they could use to escape battles involving U.S. tanks. Kang then swore a pledge of loyalty to the Islamic State and received a folded Islamic State flag as a gift. He then told the undercover agents that he wanted to kill ""a bunch of people,"" but was urged to wait until the drone was out of the country and they could make a better plan. The men then made training videos for about two hours and watched them together. Kang was then arrested by an FBI SWAT team without incident. According to court documents, Kang waived his Miranda rights and admitted to his role in the crimes.

180,http://time.com/4964666/mandalay-bay-las-vegas-shooting/,"At least 59 people were killed and 527 were injured after a man opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday in what appears to be the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Police say Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old man from Mesquite, Nev., opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Concertgoers reported seeing flashes of muzzle light coming from the upper floors of the hotel and hearing bursts of gunfire over a period of nine minutes. A SWAT team later found Paddock dead in a hotel room, which was filled with 23 firearms. Here’s what to know about the shooting: The dozens of those killed during the massacre Sunday evening included an off-duty police officer who coached youth football, a middle school special-education teacher, an Alaskan fisherman celebrating a successful season and a young woman who had graduated from high school just two years ago, among many others. Another victim has been identified by his wife as 29-year-old Sonny Melton, a Nashville nurse. The couple was at the music festival together and Heather Gulish Melton said her husband died saving her life. “At this point, I’m in complete disbelief and despair,” she told NBC affiliate WCYB. “I don’t know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his.” As families, friends and colleagues learn more details of their fallen loved ones, many others injured from the shooting were hospitalized in Las Vegas as thousands of people spent hours in line to donate blood. The suspect, identified as Stephen Paddock, was a 64-year-old man from Mesquite, Nev. A SWAT team found him dead in a hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino across the street from the Route 91 festival, authorities said. Police used a controlled explosion to get into the room, where they found 23 guns, some with scopes, which Paddock had carried into the hotel using “an excess of 10 suitcases,” Lombardo said. He said police also found 19 additional firearms, explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition at Paddock’s house in Mesquite. Authorities also discovered two gun stocks, which could have allowed him to modify weapons to make them fully automatic, AP reports, citing police sources who requested anonymity because the investigation was still ongoing. Eric Paddock, the suspect’s brother, told reporters on Monday that Stephen was a retired accountant who frequently made trips to Las Vegas to gamble. The brother appeared shocked by the incident, and said he believes his brother had no affiliation with any kind of extremist organization. Authorities have described the shooting as a “lone wolf” attack, and police said that social media rumors of multiple shooters at multiple resorts were false. Police have also located a woman named Marilou Danley, who they believe to be Paddock’s roommate and girlfriend. Though authorities ruled her out as a person of interest before, police said on Monday that Danley is still a person of interest. Police said she is currently in the Philippines. Police are still investigating the motive of the shooting, but said on Tuesday that the attack as premeditated. Paddock, they said, set up cameras inside and outside of his hotel room, and Lombardo said he believes that was done to monitor police coming to take him into custody. “I can’t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,” Lombardo said, when asked about the motive behind the attack on Monday, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that besides his gun cache, Paddock also had an interest in high-limit video poker and real estate deals. Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI hostage negotiator and supervisor in the bureau’s behavioral science unit told AP that Paddock’s profile did not match that of a typical mass murderer: he was much older than is usually the case and was not known to be suffering from mental illness. “My challenge is, I don’t see any of the classic indicators, so far, that would suggest, ‘OK, he’s on the road either to suicide or homicide or both,” Van Zandt said. But Paddock’s weapon horde and his actions did suggest the mass shooting had been planned at least days in advance, Van Zandt said. “He knew what he wanted to do. He knew how he was going to do it, and it doesn’t seem like he had any kind of escape plan at all,” he added. ISIS claimed responsibility for the atrocity and said that Paddock had converted to Islam months ago, according to the AP. But ISIS, which has falsely claimed responsibility for attacks previously, did not provide any evidence for its claim. The FBI later said it has no immediate evidence linking the shooting to an international terror organization. Paddock’s family members expressed shock and confusion when they learned that he was responsible for the attack. “We are completely dumbfounded,” his brother, Eric Paddock, said in an interview with the Orlando Sentinel. “We can’t understand what happened.” In remarks Monday morning, President Trump called for national unity and described the shooting as “an act of pure evil.” Trump praised first responders for their quick reaction and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. “We are praying for you and we are here for you, and we ask God to help see you through this very dark period,” Trump said. The White House issued a proclamation that all flags be flown at half staff through Oct. 6 in remembrance of the victims. Lombardo wrote on Twitter that he had received a call from the President, who said he will travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday. https://twitter.com/Sheriff_LVMPD/status/914871804216221697 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that he had also spoken with Lombardo and offered him full support from the FBI, Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Sessions also said he met with FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday morning. Country singer Jason Aldean, who was partway through his set at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when gunshots rang out, called the incident “beyond horrific” and said he and his crew members were safe. “Tonight has been beyond horrific,” Aldean wrote in an Instagram post early Monday morning. “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.” Ariana Grande — whose concert in Manchester, England was rocked by a deadly suicide bombing attack in May — spoke out Monday. “We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism,” she wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, world leaders sent condolences, and some Democratic lawmakers demanded action on gun control in the wake of the violence. “To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school took place. “None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.” This is a developing story.

181,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/world/middleeast/army-solder-charged-islamic-state.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Noah Weiland WASHINGTON — An Army sergeant stationed in Hawaii was charged with trying to provide equipment, training and classified military information to the Islamic State, after undercover F.B.I. agents documented his offers of support to the militant group in a series of meetings in June and July, according to an indictment. Sgt. First Class Ikaika Erik Kang, 34, was arrested on July 8 and charged in an indictment filed in the United States District Court of Hawaii on Friday. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of four counts against him. According to the indictment, which was announced on Saturday by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., Sergeant Kang tried to offer “material support or resources” in meetings with the agents, whom he believed to be associates of the Islamic State. In one encounter on June 23, Sergeant Kang offered classified military documents, according to the indictment. In another meeting, on July 8, he volunteered equipment to the undercover sources, including a drone camera, a chest “rig” that holds ammunition and other kinds of “military-style clothing.” A news release from the Justice Department said the case was investigated by the F.B.I. and the United States Army’s Criminal Investigation Division. According to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in federal court on July 10 and obtained by The Associated Press, the sergeant, an air traffic controller at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii, described fantasies about killing fellow military members and pledging loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. His commanding officers called in the F.B.I. when they feared he had become radicalized. Sergeant Kang made copies of secret military documents in 2015, hoping to give them to the Islamic State, the affidavit said. When he met with the undercover F.B.I. agents, they made training videos that he thought would be taken to the Middle East to supply the terrorist group. The same day that the training videos were produced, Sergeant Kang and one of the undercover agents went shopping for the drone that he expected to give to the Islamic State. Sergeant Kang’s reported radicalism — which drifted into expressions of support for Hitler and the assailant in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., according to the affidavit — appeared to be a late development for someone who had an established career in the Army. He joined the Army in 2001, served in South Korea in 2002 and 2003, and then in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2010 and 2014. It was not until his later deployments that he began to show signs of extremism. His military clearance was taken away in 2012 after he made comments invoking the Islamic State, and was reinstated when he completed military requirements to renew his clearance, according to the affidavit. Birney Bervar, Sergeant Kang’s lawyer, said by telephone on Sunday that he wished the Army had offered psychiatric resources to the sergeant. “The Army probably should have done some type of medical or mental evaluation before launching an undercover criminal evaluation,” he said. In an interview with a Hawaiian television station, Sergeant Kang’s father, Clifford Kang, said his son’s behavior could be traced to post-traumatic stress disorder.

182,https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/07/california-proposition-63-federal-judge-roger-t-benitez-high-capacity-magazines-second-amendment/,"Follow Us National Review The Biden Ministry of Truth Religious Liberty, Exceptions, and Targeting Why It’s Important to Pass State Critical Race Theory Bills Now Beto O’Rourke: This Voting Reform Bill Could Mean the End of Democracy in Texas Cuba’s Hunger for Freedom In 2000, California banned the sale of firearm magazines that can hold more than ten rounds. Residents who already possessed such magazines were “grandfathered” in. Or at least that was the promise. Recently, Californians approved Proposition 63, which would have required all grandfathered owners to surrender those magazines by July 1, 2017, or face up to a year in prison. Civil-rights groups challenged the confiscation in federal courts. With less than a day to spare, Judge Roger T. Benitez of the Southern District of California blocked the measure from going into effect. In his thoughtful opinion, he meticulously deconstructs every strawman erected by gun-control advocates, who can show no evidence that limiting magazine sizes will improve public safety. No doubt this decision will be appealed, but the higher courts should take note: Judge Benitez provided a clinic on how to scrutinize laws that restrict Second Amendments rights. In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. That right is not limited to guns; it extends also to the ammunition and magazines that make the gun operable. California’s law directly infringes on that right, by prohibiting law-abiding firearm owners from using their magazine of choice for self-defense. Following Heller, lower courts have held that the government can ban certain types of arms only if it demonstrates that doing so will reasonably protect public safety. Unfortunately, in the past, most judges simply rubber-stamp whatever evidence the state provides to justify gun-control measures, whether or not it fits with public safety. Not Judge Benitez. He refused to defer to the attorney general’s “incomplete studies from unreliable sources” about a “homogenous mass of horrible crimes in jurisdictions near and far for which large capacity magazines were not the cause.” With the precision of a scalpel, the court systemically sliced apart the government’s unpersuasive efforts to justify the ban. For example, the attorney general had relied on a survey of shootings published by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine. Judge Benitez dismissed the publication, which “has rarely been mentioned by any court as reliable evidence.” Moreover, he added, “it is fair to say that the magazine survey lacks some of the earmarks of a scientifically designed and unbiased collection of data.” What about the government’s citation of a survey issued by the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns? Judge Benitez noted that this group, founded by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, “is apparently not a pro-gun rights organization.” That is an understatement. More significantly, the court concluded, the survey of 92 mass shootings — 82 of which were outside California — “does not demonstrate that the ban on possession of magazines holding any more than 10 rounds” would reasonably help the state to achieve its public-safety goals. Of the ten shootings in California, eight were not known to involve high-capacity magazines, and two involved magazines that were probably illegal. For example, the Santa Monica shooter used high-capacity magazines that were likely shipped from outside California. “Criminalizing possession of magazines holding any more than 10 rounds,” the court reasoned, “likely would not have provided additional protection from gun violence for citizens or police officers or prevented the crime.” More important, even though millions of high-capacity magazine are owned nationwide, the mayors’ survey could identify only six mass-shooting incidents between 2009 and 2013 that employed them. The government’s expert witnesses fared no better. The court dismissed their evidence as little more than “anecdotal accounts, collected by biased entities, on which educated surmises and tautological observations are framed.” One professor said the ban on high-capacity magazines “seems prudent,” based only on what Judge Benitez labelled “a complete absence of reliable studies done on formal data sets.” Another professor justified the ban on large magazines by citing the need to force “mass shooters to pause and reload ammunition.” That argument, supported by zero data, is belied by common experience. The court noted that during mass shootings in Alexandria, Va., and Fort Hood, Texas, mass shooters were able to reload several times without difficulty; they were stopped only when confronted by another shooter. In any event, why stop at ten rounds? For example, New York sought to limit magazine sizes to seven rounds, because the average defensive gun use involves on average two rounds. Judge Benitez asked, somewhat rhetorically, why not then limit magazines to three rounds? The Supreme Court has recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. That right extends to the ammunition and magazines that make guns operable. In other contexts, courts are perfectly comfortable second-guessing the government’s need to promote public safety — even concerning the rights of aliens outside the United States and in delicate matters of foreign affairs. For example, in recent litigation over the travel ban, federal courts have dismissed the executive branch’s goal of protecting national security as a fraud. But with the Second Amendment, courts have regrettably treated the right to keep and bear arms as a second-class right and consistently accepted the government’s interests as articles of blind faith.  Not so in Judge Benitez’s courtroom. He explained that “the phrase ‘gun violence’ may not be invoked as a talismanic incantation to justify any exercise of state power.” In any case, the measures in question would not deter crime. “Criminals intent on violence would then equip themselves with multiple weapons,” Benitez observed. Or, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted last year in an opinion striking down Texas’s abortion laws, “determined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing statutes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations.” (Of course, the right to keep and bear arms is framed in the Constitution; a right to privacy is not.) Criminals bent on breaking the law will break the law. Confiscation measures like Proposition 63 punish law-abiding citizens, limit their ability to defend themselves, and have at best a negligible impact on public safety. On the same day that Judge Benitez issued his important decision, another federal judge in Sacramento reached the opposite result, allowing the confiscation measure to go into effect. The California attorney general will no doubt seek an emergency stay from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to nullify Judge Benitez’s decision. Second Amendment rights, alas, have not fared well in that court. Because of the urgency of this case, sooner or later an emergency petition may wind up on the desk of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who supervises appeals from California. Justice Kennedy joined the Heller decision in 2008 and two years later joined the follow-up case of McDonald v. City of Chicago. But since 2010, the Court has not heard arguments in any Second Amendment case. Regrettably, last week the Supreme Court turned away another case from California that concerned the right to carry outside the home. Only Justice Clarence Thomas and his newest colleague, Justice Neil Gorsuch, disagreed: “The Court’s decision to deny certiorari in this case reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right,” Thomas wrote. Over the last seven years, the justices have hesitated to expand gun rights beyond allowing law-abiding citizens to keep a firearm in the home. Proposition 63 is radically different from previous appeals: It attempts to take away what law-abiding citizens already have. Perhaps now that the fear of confiscation has come to fruition, five justices will intervene and ensure that Americans are not punished for exercising their constitutional rights.

183,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/opinion/sunday/save-free-speech-from-trolls.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Lindy West The first thousand times I was accused of being a politically correct, anti-free-speech censor, it seemed silly. The charge was always in response to some relatively innocuous bit of cultural criticism — like, say, that racism is bad and artists should try not to make racist art if they don’t want to be called racists. Or that if comedians want to joke about rape, they should write their jokes very carefully because rape is very horrible. I saw it happen to other women, too, women who had asked for better representation in media, or had even gone and said the words “video games.” I always laughed at the anti-free-speech charge. I was not the government. I literally could not censor anyone. I cannot go around handcuffing comedians and dragging them off to joke jail. (Anyway, I am a prison abolitionist. That goes for open-mic-based offenses, too.) Criticism is not censorship, and no matter how insistent Twitter’s free speech brigade might be, I felt safe knowing that we could always go back to the text. The Constitution was on my side. But that was when I thought facts had power, when what we think of as the truth was based more on observable reality and less on the incantations of paranoid uncles who would rather die of preventable diseases than let America’s first black president leave an intact legacy. When the “free speech” canard started nibbling away at me, around 2012 or so, it seemed as goofy as the idea of Donald Trump becoming president. Oops. Since then, the anti-free-speech charge, applied broadly to cultural criticism and especially to feminist discourse, has proliferated. It is nurtured largely by men on the internet who used to nurse their grievances alone, in disparate, insular communities around the web — men’s rights forums, video game blogs. Gradually, these communities have drifted together into one great aggrieved, misogynist gyre and bonded over a common interest: pretending to care about freedom of speech so they can feel self-righteous while harassing marginalized people for having opinions. At the online video conference VidCon a couple of weeks ago, the feminist cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian took the stage for a panel on women’s experiences online, only to find the first two rows of seats stacked with her online harassers, leering up at her, filming her on their phones. Ms. Sarkeesian has been relentlessly stalked, abused and threatened since 2012, when she started a Kickstarter campaign to fund a series of YouTube videos critiquing the representation of women in video games. In retaliation, men have threatened to rape and murder her, dug up and disseminated her personal contact information, called in mass shooting threats to her public events and turned their obsession with shutting her up into a competitive sport. All of this, they insist, is in defense of freedom of speech, to which Ms. Sarkeesian, with her precise, rigorously argued opinions about the relative loincloth sizes of male and female video game avatars, somehow poses a threat. It is not an enviable position to be in. “There are women who have said to me, or to people in my circles, that they don’t want to be me,” Ms. Sarkeesian told me. “They don’t want what happened to me to happen to them, and so they keep their head down and they stay quiet.” Absence is invisible. We don’t even know who has been lost — how many were scared away before they even started. What about their speech? Refusing to quit, as Ms. Sarkeesian has, yields often invisible professional consequences as well. “Our videos on YouTube don’t get promoted and supported in their algorithms the same way that hate videos about us do, because we can’t have comments open,” she said. “That punishes us.” You can find disingenuous rhetoric about protecting free speech in the engine room of pretty much every digital-age culture war. The refrain has become so ubiquitous that it’s earned its own sarcastic homophone in progressive circles: “freeze peach!” Nothing is more important than the First Amendment, the internet men say, provided you interpret the First Amendment exactly the same way they do: as a magic spell that means no one you don’t like is allowed to criticize you. The law does not share that interpretation. “The First Amendment only regulates the government,” explained Rebecca Tushnet, a professor of First Amendment law at Harvard. Does she think there is any merit in telling a person that her critique of your art is infringing on your free speech? “No.” It’s been a surprisingly effective rhetorical strategy nonetheless. Americans are fiercely proud of our culture of (nearly) unfettered expression, though often not so clear on the actual parameters of the First Amendment. To defend speech is to plant a flag on the right side of history; to defend unpopular speech is to be a real rogue, a sophisticate, the kind of guy who gets it. “Freedom of speech is such a buzzword that people can rally around,” Ms. Sarkeesian said, “and that works really well in their favor. They’re weaponizing free speech to maintain their cultural dominance.” The goal of Ms. Sarkeesian’s detractors was never really to protect the First Amendment. If it were, more than 8,000 of them wouldn’t have signed an online petition to have her and the GamerGate target Zoe Quinn arrested — that is, detained by the state in retaliation for speech — for addressing the United Nations about online harassment. But they did. (Ms. Sarkeesian and Ms. Quinn’s crime, according to someone who is definitely a lawyer: “pushing for a U.N. intervention (Foreign Agents) with the intent to limit internet free speech which violates the First Amendment of the U.S.”) If their goal was really to protect the First Amendment, they would have at least blinked when the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, confirmed that President Trump is considering amending libel laws, presumably so he can prosecute journalists who hurt his feelings. If the goal was really to destroy political correctness, as Mr. Trump promised was his top priority, they would have rallied behind Kathy Griffin and Stephen Colbert and Johnny Depp instead of — by their own definition — “censoring” them with at least as much fury as they generated on behalf of Milo Yiannopoulos and his suspended Twitter account (which was perfectly legal, as per the Twitter corporation’s speech rights). If their goal was really to foster free public discourse, we would have seen deafening bipartisan support for Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, the Princeton African-American studies assistant professor and author of “From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation,” who canceled two speaking engagements in late May after Fox News aired video of her calling President Trump a “racist and sexist megalomaniac.” Professor Taylor received more than 50 “hate-filled and threatening emails,” many racially charged, some containing “specific threats of violence, including murder,” she wrote in a statement. Where were the brave knights of free speech when Professor Taylor was being intimidated into silence? They were nowhere, of course (except, perhaps, on the other end of some of those emails), because their true goal has always been to ensure that if anyone is determining the ways that we collectively choose to restrict our own speech in the name of values, they are the ones setting the limits. They want to perform a factory reset to a time when people of color and women didn’t tell white men what to do. And only one 2016 presidential candidate promised such a reset.  The election of Donald Trump and crying “free speech” to end any discussion of cultural sensitivity are not unrelated. Casting the dissent of marginalized groups as a First Amendment violation is the kind of pseudo-intellectual argument that seems reasonable to people who don’t have enough skin in the game to bother paying attention. “Discourse” is good! Sunlight is the best disinfectant! The more airtime we give to irrational bigots on high-profile platforms — the more assiduously we hear both sides, stay “fair and balanced” — the sooner they’ll be rejected by the public at large! Unfortunately, as any scientist can tell you (for as long as we still have those), more often than not, sunlight makes things grow. Conflating criticism with censorship fosters a system in which all positions deserve equal consideration, no bad ideas can ever be put to rest, and lies are just as valid as the truth. It’s not hard to draw a straight line from internet culture warriors’ misappropriation of free speech to our current mass delusions over climate change, the Hyde Amendment, abstinence-only education, health care as a luxury and class as a meritocracy. “Free speech” rhetoric begot “fake news,” which begot “alternative facts.” The right cannot lay claim to the First Amendment when its own president is actively hostile to it. Sometimes disinfectant is the best disinfectant. Advertisement",2017-07-01 14:41:24,Save Free Speech from Trolls,,1,http://nytimes.com

SYDNEY – Half a world from where an Australian woman was shot dead by a Minneapolis police officer, a front-page headline in her hometown Sydney newspaper summarized Australia's reaction in blunt terms: ""AMERICAN NIGHTMARE."" In Justine Damond's native country, news of the meditation teacher's baffling death has dominated the airwaves, newspapers and websites for days, feeding into Australians' long-held fears about America's notorious culture of gun violence. ""The country is infested with possibly more guns than people,"" said Philip Alpers, a gun policy analyst with the University of Sydney who has studied the stark differences in gun laws between the nations. ""We see America as a very risky place in terms of gun violence — and so does the rest of the world."" While police officers carry guns in Australia, deadly shootings by police are exceedingly rare; there are only a handful reported each year, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. And though the U.S. doesn't keep a national database of deadly police-involved shootings, even incomplete statistics show there are hundreds every year. America's reluctance to strengthen its gun regulations and its seemingly endless stream of shooting deaths have long been a source of confusion and concern in Australia, which instituted tough gun ownership laws in 1996 following a deadly mass shooting. At the time, then-Prime Minister John Howard — a conservative — warned Australians against following America's lead on gun control, saying: ""We have an opportunity in this country not to go down the American path."" The Australian government's official travel advice to those heading to the U.S. specifically warns tourists to be on guard for gun crime, and urges Australians living in the U.S. to be familiar with ""active shooter"" training drills. Australian media coverage of America's frequent mass shootings is often tinged with disbelief — ""another day, another shooting in America"" is a common refrain on newscasts. The death of Damond, a 40-year-old meditation teacher who was reportedly dressed in her pajamas when she was shot by a police officer late Saturday, has sparked a similarly stunned reaction. The story has led network newscasts and was splashed across newspapers' front pages. Sydney's Daily Telegraph ran an editorial headlined ""A senseless and tragic death."" The shooting occurred after Damond called police to report what she believed to be an active sexual assault in an alley near her home. ""We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,"" Damond's father, John Ruszczyk, told reporters on Tuesday. ""Justine was a beacon to all of us. We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death."" On Wednesday, the family and nearly 300 friends of Damond gathered on a Sydney beach for a silent vigil. Dozens carried candles in the early morning light on Freshwater Beach and each mourner tossed a single pink blossom into the Pacific Ocean, in honor of Damond's favorite color. ""We're here to come together as a community around our beautiful Justine to honor her life, share our love and mourn her death,"" the family said in a statement. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday demanded answers in Damond's death, saying something ""clearly went tragically wrong."" ""How can a woman out in the street in her pajamas seeking assistance from police be shot like that? It is a shocking killing,"" Turnbull said in an interview with Australia's ""Today Show."" ''We are demanding answers on behalf of her family. And our hearts go out to her family and all of her friends and loved ones. It's a truly tragic, tragic killing there in Minneapolis.""

          / CBS News Following reports of a shooting at an Alexandria, Virginia YMCA baseball field being used for practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. The shooting took place in the dugout at a field used for baseball practice shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday morning.  The injured include House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, at least two Capitol Hill police officers, the gunman, and at least one congressional staffer. His wounds were not believed to be life-threatening. A suspect is also reportedly in custody. A source said Democratic lawmakers were practicing at their own field miles away when they heard about the shooting. They immediately stopped and prayed together. The annual charity game is scheduled for Thursday, and Republican members were set to play against their Democratic colleagues at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Reaction from both sides of the political aisle have been pouring in after the shooting. Here is some of the reaction. ""The Vice President and I are aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely. We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected."" The president also tweeted about Scalise. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. Thank you to the first responders who rushed in to help protect those who were hurt in Alexandria, VA. My thoughts & prayers to everyone! Speaking at a workforce development roundtable event at the White House, the senior adviser and eldest Trump daughter said she was ""offering our thoughts and prayers to Congressman Scalise and all of the victims in today's tragic events."" She added, ""We are grateful for their service and their dedication to this country. And thank you everyone for traveling here to be with us today. My father said this morning it is times like these we must all work together for our country, and we appreciate you doing just that."" Williams , who was at the scene of the shooting, has been the head coach for the Republican team since he first joined Congress in 2013. A Williams staffer was reportedly shot during the incident. Please keep the member of my staff and all members of the congressional baseball team in your thoughts and prayers pic.twitter.com/wH4b6wXQhs In a statement following the shooting, McAullife thanked the US Capitol Police and local first responders for their swift action in stopping the gunman and treating the Congressmen. Below is the Governor's statement on this morning's shooting in Alexandria: pic.twitter.com/GqRB6Pxl6f ""The world changed a little bit for us as members"" Duncan told reporters, recalling his interaction with a person who had reportedly asked Duncan, who was leaving practice at the time, if there were Republicans or Democrats practicing on the field Wednesday morning. MORE: “I did have an interaction with someone...who asked me if the team practicing was Democrat or Republican team,” Sen. Duncan says pic.twitter.com/7i4cM14XKk Speaking on the Senate floor, McConnell said the Senate will embrace the spirit of the bipartisan congressional baseball game ""as we come together in expressing both our concern and our gratitude."" We're concerned for all those injured in #Alexandria. We'll keep them in our prayers & continue to send them every wish for quick a recovery pic.twitter.com/9lWTIedFvR Paul was present during the shooting, saying he is now ""shaken but unharmed.""  He added, ""Many people likely would have died this morning if not for the bravery of the Capitol Police. My thanks to them are inadequate but heartfelt. They never hesitated to put their lives on the line to save everyone. Please pray for those who were injured."" Our prayers go out for a full recovery of Rep. Scalise, the congressional aides and police who were injured. We’ve got to stop the violence. We are all pulling for you @SteveScalise. My heart is with you, the Capitol Police, and everyone who was on the scene. This is a tragic moment for their families, loved ones, and the entire community on Capitol Hill. ""I was on the field, but I'm okay. This was a senseless act of evil. Please pray for those who were shot and their families."" Rooney, a member who had just left to drop off his children at school , offered words of support to Scalise on CBS News Wednesday morning, saying, ""I love you man. I'm sorry I wasn't there with you."" This morning the hearts of the whole House are with @SteveScalise, the brave Capitol police, staff, and all those who were in harm's way. Karen & I are praying for @SteveScalise, the Capitol Police, & all hurt for a speedy recovery. Our hearts are with them & their loved ones. Unspeakable evil. Pray that Rep Scalise, police officers and everyone else will be ok. Saddened by news of the shooting in VA this am. Thoughts & prayers for Rep @SteveScalise & others injured & hope for a speedy recovery. I am monitoring reports of the situation in Virginia. Thinking of my friend, @SteveScalise, and his staff. ""This morning, the U.S. Congress suffered a despicable and cowardly attack.  My thoughts and prayers are with Whip Steve Scalise and the others wounded, Capitol Police and staff, and their families. We are profoundly grateful for the heroism of the Capitol Police, whose bravery under fire undoubtedly saved countless lives.  On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our hopes and prayers for the wounded."" At the top of his opening remarks at a budget hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tillerson said, ""We were all stunned news of the events that effected one of your colleagues. Scalise is a friend of mine and represents many of my friends in Louisiana. My prayers and those at state are with the injured and law enforcement that responded to the attack."" pic.twitter.com/Dy7JkOCvzf My prayers to @SteveScalise, staff, and @CapitolPolice.  🇺🇸 We are aware of the situation in Alexandria, VA. Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected and the first responders. Giffords, who, while she was in Congress, was wounded in a mass shooting in 2011 that ended with the deaths of six people. Twelve others were injured. She was the last active member of Congress to be shot before Scalise. My heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police- public servants and heroes today and every day. Jill and I are praying for the victims and their families. Grateful for courage of my former colleagues, first responders & Capitol Police. Horrific. Thoughts & prayers with Rep. @SteveScalise, Capitol police, and staff. I am safe. Please pray for @SteveScalise, my colleagues, their staff, and @CapitolPolice involved in this horrific shooting. This is unspeakable. I am praying for my friend and colleague @SteveScalise and his family. Thinking of my friend @SteveScalise this morning. Praying for him, Capitol Police and the others injured as this horrific news comes in. We are all Americans first, regardless of party. We are all on the same team. And we’re praying for those injured in this heinous attack. CBS News' Len Tepper contributed to this report. First published on June 14, 2017 / 9:28 AM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

186,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/us/congressional-baseball-shooting-death-grief.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Julie Turkewitz BELLEVILLE, Ill. — He flung dishes at his wife, roared at the television, erupted during an outing at a local brewery. Suzanne Hodgkinson became so concerned with her husband’s growing anger that she wrote to his doctor asking for help. Now, the wife of the man who opened fire on a congressional baseball team in June wonders what more she could have done. “I get up every morning feeling guilty because I didn’t stop it,” Ms. Hodgkinson said Wednesday at her home in Belleville, where the blinds are drawn tight and photographs of her husband adorn a living room wall. It was her first sit-down interview with a reporter since her husband, James Thomas Hodgkinson, attacked a Republican congressional baseball team practice in Alexandria, Va., wounding Representative Steve Scalise and three other people before the authorities killed him. (Mr. Scalise remains hospitalized in fair condition.) Ms. Hodgkinson continued, “I wake up with hot sweats, thinking: ‘You should have known. You should have known.’” To be the spouse, or the parent, or the child of someone who commits a mass shooting is to enter a strange club whose members are envied by no one and reviled by many. Rites of passage include hate mail, death threats and the vicious thoughts that haunt them at night. That they should have seen it coming. That they could have done something. That they are alone. And then there is the question of how to mourn. How to dispose of a body that everyone else wants to forget. On Tuesday, Ms. Hodgkinson, 65, received an email at her job at an accountant’s office on Main Street, asking her to identify the body. A formality. When she opened the attachment, her husband’s swollen face stared back at her. “That’s Tom,” she said she had written back, before hitting delete. She would like to deal with Mr. Hodgkinson’s remains as quickly and quietly as possible, she said. He was not a bad man at his core, she believes. They married in 1984. When they met, he was happy, singing in her ear at a grocery store. Later, they took in some 35 foster children and adopted two. But in the late 1990s, after a long illness, he took a turn, she said. His rage came more suddenly. Now she wants it all to go away. She has asked a funeral home run by a friend to cremate Mr. Hodgkinson’s body. After that, she may scatter the ashes at home, or bury them in nearby St. Louis. She won’t be informing the public. There will be no ceremony. “Coldhearted as it may be, I’m done,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “He was not a religious man, and I’m done with this. I want this to get over. I want my granddaughters to be able to go to school in September without this being dredged up.” She paused, then spoke as if Mr. Hodgkinson were sitting on the couch next to her. “You just walked out on me.” The number of mass shootings in the United States has risen sharply in recent years — to an average of 16.4 per year between 2007 and 2013, from 6.4 per year between 2000 and 2006. (These numbers come from the F.B.I. and exclude episodes tied to domestic violence and gangs.) Each of these attacks has left the families of innocent victims awash in pain, with a growing number of Americans roped into the indelible trauma of a sudden, senseless, violent attack. And more and more, communities and individuals are having to wrestle with how to treat the bodies of these perpetrators. Relatives of people who commit mass shootings often choose secret burials in unmarked graves with small or nonexistent ceremonies, designed to keep away critics and vandals. This has not stopped the onslaught of attention and condemnation. Bodies hold symbolic power, said Ann Neumann, a visiting scholar at New York University who studies death, with places of interment often seen as reflections of how society valued a person. Which is why people get so worked up when a major criminal is buried in their backyard. After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, protesters lined up outside a funeral home that had agreed to accept the body of one of the attackers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, holding signs that urged his family to “Bury the Garbage in the Landfill.” After the attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, relatives of the killers, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, interred their bodies in a cemetery far from their California home after a closer graveyard rejected them. Soon, a city near the cemetery passed an ordinance prohibiting the burial of known terrorists in the area. Someone took a saw to the sign marking the American Islamic Institute of Antelope Valley, which maintains the plots, hacking it to pieces. “I had rocks thrown at me. I was spit on. People shot at me with BB guns,” said Peter Stefan, the funeral director who handled the Tsarnaev burial. It took a week to find a cemetery that would take the remains. Eventually, the bomber’s family washed his body according to Muslim tradition and buried him in a Virginia plot under the cover of night. Mr. Stefan said he had helped bury the bomber “to show society that we are really a few steps ahead of people like this guy.” He added, “We did for him what he probably would never have done for anybody else.” In 1999, after Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb, a handful of people went to a ceremony for Mr. Klebold. He lay in a cardboard coffin surrounded by stuffed animals. At the time, the Rev. Don Marxhausen, who spoke at the ceremony, called the Klebolds “the loneliest people on the planet.” A year after the funeral, he was ousted from his church, amid tension over his involvement with the case. He later said he had done it out of a sense of duty and would do it again. “When your phone rings, you go,” he told The Denver Post. Mr. Klebold’s mother, Sue Klebold, said in a recent interview that a colleague had urged her to have the funeral, arguing that it would help with the grieving process. It did. “When you lose a loved one who has hurt other people, one of the struggles you have is the ability to focus on your sorrow, because your grief is so complicated by all these other things,” she said. She gradually came out of hiding and wrote a memoir. Today, when she is out in public and someone mentions that her name is familiar, she can be open. “I think you’re probably thinking of my son Dylan,” she says, “who was one of the shooters in the Columbine tragedy.” Here, Ms. Hodgkinson is wrestling with the legacy of the man she loved. She denies that he ever assaulted any of their children, which was alleged in decade-old court documents. Neighbors have urged her not to mow the lawn, for fear she’ll be attacked in her yard. A friend takes out her trash, dispersing it around town to evade snoops. When she ventured to the Shop ’N Save alone recently, a white-haired woman — a stranger — approached her in the parking lot and slapped her across the face. “That was O.K.,” Ms. Hodgkinson said. “Get it out, lady. Just don’t pick up a gun and shoot somebody.” She cried all the way home. It was during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mr. Hodgkinson’s Democratic politics boiled into a rage, she said. He sided with Senator Bernie Sanders. When Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Hodgkinson said, her husband went “bananas.” She urged him to take action locally. He said he wanted to go to the top. In March, he left for Washington, saying that he was going to work on tax reform. She figured he would return, she would retire and they would buy a motorcycle “and just go for days on end.” He emailed the family and expressed frustration with Washington’s intransigence. On June 14, she woke to the sounds of her 2-year-old grandson. As she does every morning, she turned on the television and fed her grandson cookies and milk. The anchors were already talking about the shooting, and it briefly occurred to her that her husband might have done it. He had been so angry. Then the reporters mentioned that the attacker had a rifle. She figured it couldn’t be Tom. He had left for Washington with only his pistol.

Media By Julia Marsh and Kaja Whitehouse Submit June 27, 2017 | 6:36pm				| Updated June 27, 2017 | 7:31pm Former Governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is suing the New York Times for defamation over a recent editorial tying one of her political action committee ads to a 2011 mass shooting that severely wounded Arizona Democrat Gabby Giffords and killed six people, including a 9-year-old girl​, The Post has learned​. The Manhattan federal court lawsuit, filed Tuesday by lawyers Kenneth Turkel, Shane Vogt and S. Preston Ricardo, accuse​s​ the Gray Lady of having “violated the law and its own policies” when it accused her — in a “fabricated story” — of inciting the 2011 attack by Jared Lee Loughner. Palin, who emerged on ​​the national political scene as running mate to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, is seeking damages in an amount to be determined by a jury at trial. The lawsuit is in direct response to The Times’ controversial June 14th editorial about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise paper, which accused Palin of “political incitement” ahead of the 2011 shooting. The paper said Palin incited th​​e shooting, which left ​congresswoman ​G​abby Gifford​s​ with a severe brain injury, through an ad from her PAC that put “Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” In fact, the ad never put Giffords or any other individual in the cross hairs — forcing the newspaper of record to issue an embarrassing correction. The correction, posted on June 16th, admitted that The Times “incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting.” The map “depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs,” the correction said. see also

The Gray Lady’s correction also admitted that the editorial “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.” “In fact, no such link was established,” the paper conceded. “We have not seen the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously,” a spokeswoman for The Times told The Post. It’s unclear whether the shooter ever saw or knew of Palin’s map. Investigators later said Loughner, who is serving a 140-year sentence for the mass murder, became fixated on the lawmaker well before Palin entered the picture. He expressed frustration with Gifford as early as 2007 when he met her at a constituent event and felt she gave an unsatisfactory answer to a question he asked, according to reports. “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for falsely stating to millions of people that she, a devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who committed a substantial portion of her adult life to public service, is part of a pattern of ​’​lethal​’​ politics and responsible for inciting an attack that seriously injured numerous people and killed six, including a nine-year-old girl who, at that time, was the same age as Mrs. Palin’s youngest daughter,” the lawsuit ​reads. Palin’s lawsuit also blasted The Times for not having “acknowledged that Mrs. Palin did not incite a deranged man to commit murder.” “The Times should have apologized to Mrs. Palin,” she added.

188,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/14/nucla-colorado-mandatory-gun-law-mining-telluride,"Nucla, Colorado, was founded by socialists before becoming a mining town. Now, as wealthy liberals with different values encroach, the town is fighting for its economic survival Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST There’s an empty stretch of field off highway 141 in Colorado that used to be the perfect American town. Small houses with white picket fences boasted big flower gardens. Kids played kick the can in the streets, rode their bikes, splashed in swimming pools. On Sundays, they might have watched an Elvis movie on TV. The rent was cheap, the fathers all worked, the mothers stayed at home. Uravan was placid, friendly and, in most of the ways people usually measure it, safe. For many years, a former resident recalled, there was no law enforcement in the mining company town. Nobody needed it. The kids were good kids, because if they weren’t, the company bosses would kick their whole families out.  The town, named after the minerals extracted and processed there, had secretly supplied uranium to the Manhattan Project during the war. Afterward, the cold war uranium boom made the town prosper. Things changed in 1986 when Uravan was declared a Superfund site contaminated by hazardous waste. The mine closed, residents moved out. The entire town – the trees, the houses, the post office, the Coke glasses from the drug store – was shredded and buried in a concrete-lined hole. The only thing left behind was the town’s metal flagpole, which was moved to the abandoned baseball field. “When they bury your whole town, they bury your history. There’s a little bit of shame to that,” said Jane Thompson, who grew up in Uravan. Her parents were the second to last family to move out. Thompson drove me through Uravan early one Sunday morning, pointing to the dip in the ground where the gas station had been, the block of houses where she had grown up. There was nothing left except scrub, battered earth and fences with signs warning, “Caution ☢️ Radioactive Materials.” Thomas and her family now live just down the road in Nucla, a shrinking rural town still dependent on the mining industry. Nucla became nationally famous when it passed an ordinance requiring every household to own a gun five years ago – a move that is still wildly popular among residents. But past Nucla’s one minute of fame, locals worry about their beloved home becoming a ghost town. In September, in the wake of a lawsuit from an environmental group, Nucla’s major employer, the local coal-fired power plant, announced that it would be shutting down in 2022. The coal mine that supplied the plant would be shutting down as well. In total, about 80 jobs were at risk – a huge number in a town whose population boasted, according to the 2010 census, only 711 people. For locals, this decision was a death knell brought on by liberals who live in big cities. Nucla residents bristle at the warnings about the risk of exposure to radiation, and roll their eyes at A-listers like Darryl Hannah, the Hollywood actress known for Splash and Kill Bill, who joined the activism against the local uranium industry. Liberals fighting against the mining industry are good at telling them no, residents say, but don’t present them with any alternatives – not ones that come with real salaries. Richard Craig, a former Nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: “Well, I don’t see why they don’t want to go live in the city.” “It’s almost like – I hate using this word, it’s being used so often – it’s almost like a conspiracy: ‘We need to move everybody out of rural areas and go live in the cities and suburbs,’” Craig said. Nucla made national headlines in 2013. That year, in the wake of the Sandy Hook mass shooting that left 20 first-graders dead, Colorado passed new gun control laws, banning the sale of new ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds and requiring that private citizens perform criminal background checks before selling guns to each other. The laws were hailed by gun control advocates nationwide as a sign of progress despite the gun debate stalemate in Washington. Nucla moved in precisely the opposite direction: it passed an ordinance mandating that every head of household had to own a gun. Kennesaw, Georgia, had passed a similar ordinance in 1982. After Craig heard about it, he proposed the idea in a town board meeting. “It was kind of a joke to start with,” he said, sunk deep into the blue plush chair in his cluttered living room. But the reaction from other town board members was immediately positive. Nucla locals, who had been fighting with liberals for years over uranium and coal, loved the idea. “They said, ‘That sounds cool,’” he says. “I went, ‘Uh-oh.’” Craig received congratulatory phone calls from gun rights groups across the country, and the town took the national media attention in stride. Locals still talk fondly of the controversy over the town’s prairie dog shooting contest in 1990, which attracted dozens of animal rights activists and made the pages of People magazine. (During the shoot, the Los Angeles Times reported, picketers chanted “What are you gonna shoot when the prairie dogs are gone?” and a local woman called out: “Protesters!”) Craig himself saw the ordinance as responding to yet another irrational liberal attack on rural jobs. After Colorado passed its law on magazine limits, Magpul, a company that manufactures firearms accessories, left the state of Colorado in protest for Wyoming, where it reportedly expanded its workforce and secured a lucrative contract to provide ammunition magazines to the US marine corps. But he was dismissive of Barack Obama’s controversial analysis during his 2008 campaign that small-town residents “get bitter” and “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them” as a way to channel their frustration. “The jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing’s replaced them,” Obama had said. “And each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.” Craig maintains that Nucla’s love of guns is not rooted in bitterness. Even before the new rule was approved, most people in Nucla were already gun owners. The ordinance itself contains broad exceptions, not only for felons and those with a mental illness, but also for people who cannot afford a gun or simply wish to be “conscientious objectors”. This makes it more or less unenforceable. Still, Nucla’s commitment to gun ownership is no joke. There’s a tiny pink sign decorated with pistols at the local sheriff’s department – it reads: “We don’t call 911.” The town has no bars, no liquor stores, no movie theaters or malls, but it does have its own public gun range, free for use by all. The few local Democrats are no exception, including Craig himself and the local pharmacist, who was a prize-winning competitive shooter in college. Nucla’s historian, Marie Templeton, keeps a beloved gun her husband gave her as an anniversary gift. “I’m sure that the people who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means to a person in a small town like this. What do you use a gun for? Well, you kill rattlesnakes, for one thing!” she said. She got up from her kitchen table to fetch a stack of photographs of mountain lions and bears that had been spotted in her neighbor’s yard. The ordinance didn’t even faze Shirley Miller, an Englishwoman who moved from Essex to be with her American husband. She said her adjustment was easy for the most part. Coming from a small village to the east of London, Great Wakering, she finds small-town England and small-town America mostly alike, except for Nucla’s blazing, dusty summers and, of course, its bounteous guns. That aside, Nucla’s culture is not so different from small English villages, Miller said: the lack of diversity; the mix of open-mindedness and old prejudice among the residents. There have been small adjustments. She imports her Tesco and Yorkshire tea by mail, along with the occasional package of sultanas and Marmite, and each year she lets a friend’s sheep graze in the empty pasture by her house, adding a nice pastoral touch to the property. She refuses to say a word against the gun ordinance. “Although I come from a culture where there are no guns, and it’s different here, I don’t see the problem here in Nucla,” she said diplomatically. “If I were living in the city [these gun laws] would worry me. Here it doesn’t,” she said before adding wryly: “There is no crossfire here.” Even the town’s emergency medical technician – the major healthcare provider in the area during the night, when the local clinic is closed – said he carried a gun, as did the ambulance driver. The EMT, Jeff Stephens, said the ambulance had been held up twice. Last November, officials said, a heavily armed man with a history of anger at law enforcement opened fire on a sheriff’s deputy while he was driving in a remote area not far from Nucla. The officer returned fire, killing the man. A local prosecutor found the officer’s actions justified. But that shooting was an anomaly for the area. “Prior to that, the last violent shooting was in 1986 or so,” Stephens said, when a man tried to break up a fight between a man and his wife outside a bar in Naturita, the town next door, and was shot to death. Stephens said he does see occasional firearm accidents. There were two in recent memory: one a man shooting himself in the leg, another a young man shooting his partner in the knee. Both shootings involved alcohol, he said. Word travels quickly in a town of a few hundred people. I had given Craig, the architect of the gun ordinance, a call in advance of my trip to Nucla, and shortly after I arrived in town he tried to reach me on my cellphone. I didn’t immediately pick up, so Craig called the front desk of the hotel one town over, and a hotel employee dashed downstairs as I was starting to eat lunch. She handed me a fluorescent post-it note: it had Craig’s name and home number on it. By my third day in town, a woman stopped me outside of Nucla’s one restaurant, the Fifth Avenue Grill, to recommend someone for an interview. Had we met the day before? I wondered, confused. We had not. But she had heard all about me already. Later that day, a stranger in the burger joint one town over, a 1950s-style diner run by Seventh Day Adventists, broke into my note-taking to warn me that I had better be writing a nice story. I pulled up a chair to his family’s table. His son was just hoping the jobs would hang on long enough for his daughter to graduate from high school. Many of the residents were no strangers to the boom-bust cycle of the mining industry. It’s always been boom and bust, they told me, for the past hundred years. Sharon Johannsen, Jane Thompson’s sister, had been forced to leave town during a mining slump. Her family had only been able to return many years later, but her husband was now working at the coal mine that was slated to be closed. Many end up moving away for good, but the ones who stay or return are fiercely committed to the landscape and the isolation, the need for self-reliance. The nearest Walmart is more than two hours away. On the mile marker partway down the winding 100-mile road that leads to the closest hospital, locals have tied a pink ribbon to commemorate the place where a healthy little girl had recently been born. Grand Junction, that nearest larger town, has a population of just over 60,000. Several Nucla residents told me, with disgust, that they could not imagine living in a town that big, and some said they tried to visit as little as possible. Multiple men confided woefully that Nucla had a hard time attracting managers for certain jobs because their wives could not bear to live so far away from a shopping centre. Today, western Colorado is perceived as a conservative region. At a Blues in the Park night in Naturita, a stranger visiting the town, red-faced and somewhat inebriated, cornered me and began ranting about freeloading immigrants and American values. “This country wasn’t built by socialists!” he told me. “Actually,” I said politely, “this area, right here, this was built by socialists.” In 1893, a financial crisis devastated thousands of companies and caused the unemployment rate to spike above 10% for several years. Workers lost their homes and families went hungry. According to one history of the town, a group of Denver families who had become homeless and who were “united in their wish to escape tyrannical landlords” provided the impetus. In 1894, a group of 10 idealists in Denver formed the Colorado Co-Operative Company, with the goal of moving into the wilderness to create a new community – a place “where equality and service rather than greed and competition should be the basis”. The utopians spent nearly10 years digging an 18-mile irrigation canal through the arid landscape to bring water from the San Miguel river to the dry hill where they planned to build their colony. Money was tight, food scarce and the workers labored for shares in the eventual water rights in the canal they were digging by hand. To outsiders, the whole plan seemed like madness: how could anyone build a major irrigation canal without any capital? To expand their group of workers and supporters, the cooperative society established a newspaper, the Altrurian, to share news about their progress nationwide. It covered the day-to-day debates, including updates on the type of cabbages and lettuces that had been planted to feed the workers, as well as features on vegetarianism, marriage and violent labor strikes in other states. The paper advertised in-person cooperative club meetings across the country, including in Brooklyn, and was not too proud to beg for subscription pennies. “If you have received one cent’s worth of information from this week’s Altrurian, and are not already a subscriber, can you not afford to be a subscriber?” it prompted. When the ditch was finished, the utopians named their town Nucla after the word nucleus, a strange premonition of the town’s nuclear future. Socialism broke down only a few years later. In 1914, Nucla voted down its “single tax” system, in which the cooperative company owned all the land in town and paid one tax on it to the government, in favor of private ownership. Today, Thompson argues, it’s the labels on the town’s politics that have changed, more than the values themselves. The old-school cooperative mindset “really maybe has more to do with conservatism than we think: independent, not needing the government, not needing a landlord, not needing a boss or a big corporation”. The ditch is still owned and managed collectively by the Colorado Co-operative Company, which the utopians founded in 1894. It has about 170 shareholders, and in the summer, group meetings have to be held late in the evening to make it easier for local ranchers to attend after work. Monte and his son Dean Naslund have a strong connection to the ditch: five generations of their family have worked rebuilding and maintaining it over the years. I drove out with Dean late one morning, after the day’s first real work had been done. The ditch was unlined, just a channel dug in the dirt, 16-20ft wide at the top, carefully designed to flow downhill all the way from the San Miguel river to Nucla. Naslund stopped periodically to use a pitchfork to clear branches out of ditch gratings. The back of the pickup was filled with tools, mixed with old chunks of red-and-black rock – fossilized dinosaur bone, Naslund said. Golf balls sit near the front seat. He finds them “floating down the ditch – from Telluride, I suspect”. Golf balls aren’t the only trace of the liberal resort town that end up downstream in Nucla’s water. “There’s been a few people who say they found some other things from Telluride,” Naslund said, and paused. “Sexual endeavor things,” he added, delicately. Telluride, just an hour away, is Nucla’s polar opposite. The town, which hosts a film festival, is cosmopolitan and populated by the elite, a favored site for second or even third homes. Oprah Winfrey reportedly bought 60 acres of land there in 2014 and spent $14m on one of the town’s most lavish mansions (it has a wine cellar designed to look like a historic mine). To make ends meet, Nucla residents clean Telluride’s rental condos and help construct its elaborate mansions, with their enormous chandeliers and granite toilet seats and computerized bidets. One Nucla resident recalled walking into a bathroom in Telluride and feeling startled as “the toilet opened by itself”. The class tensions between the two towns are exacerbated by stereotypes. Telluride people think the small towners’ exposure to radiation means they “can’t think properly”, said Kyle Webb, a 28-year-old who had moved from Denver to Nucla, in part because of its gun ordinance. Meanwhile, the avowed environmentalists are building giant mansions with heated driveways to melt the snow. Telluride is “so wasteful – and it’s kind of hypocritical”, said Aimee Tooker, Thompson’s niece and the the president of the West End Economic Development Corporation, which was founded to help build new economic models in the area. “It’s the saddest thing. You know, we turn off our lights. And as long as we have a place to plug in our phone and our TV, we’re happy. Those people that are up there – they have rain sensors in their windows and sun sensors in their shades so that the shades will close automatically. “They’re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that, you know, we can’t have our uranium, we can’t have this and that down here.” The two communities especially clashed during the push to reopen a uranium mill near Telluride, a raging fight that started around 2009. Hilary Cooper, a Telluride resident who was then the head of the Sheep Mountain Alliance, a Telluride environmental group, was one of the leaders who geared up to fight the uranium mill. “I kind of jumped into those communities thinking, oh, we can talk some sense into these people: all the medical research and how bad this stuff was for them and how bad it was for the environment,” Cooper said. She knew the environmental arguments might not be as powerful, even if she stuck to the simple talking points of clean air and clean water. “I could not have been more wrong in my approach,” she said. Her activism sparked outrage, and she said she received threats on her life. The children and grandchildren of Uravan miners had seen some of them die of lung cancer, but they never missed an opportunity to explain that they had been smokers too. The direct links they saw between exposure to uranium and cancer did not persuade them that uranium mining was a bad industry, especially with what the saw as more recent advances in safety. Thompson’s grandfather, who used to smoke and mine at the same time, had died of lung cancer. The local history museum has a photo of him smoking insouciantly while wheeling a cart of ore out of the mine. “If you had told my grandpa that he was going to die when he was 70 a horrible, painful death, he would have continued to mine,” Thompson said. “That’s how he supported his family and he was able to keep his family farm.” As an alternative to uranium, Telluride residents repeatedly suggested that Nucla and Naturita capitalize on the organic local food movement and return to their farming roots to provide Telluride and surrounding areas with produce, Cooper said. This suggestion was met with eye-rolling and frustration. “I’ll be the first person in line to pick your tomatoes for $45,000 to $75,000 a year,” one local reportedly said in 2009, contrasting agricultural wages with mining income. Years later, Thompson still scoffs at the mention of organic produce. Her grandmother grew her own food and canned it, and never used pesticides. “This is our way of life,” she said. After several years of angry public hearings, lawsuits and debates, the uranium project has been put on hold for economic reasons. In Nucla, where the spot price of uranium is printed on the front page of the newspaper, locals say it needs to reach $50 for the mill to be financially viable. The price listed on the paper in late June was $19.85. “Telluride says a lot of dumb things,” said Paul Major, the president of the Telluride Foundation, a community philanthropy. “You know, it’s easier to sit in Telluride and yodel about going green, and a community like Nucla is going, ‘What are you talking about?’ We’re just trying to put food on our table and a roof over our heads.”” It was not easy for people working in information industries, or in tourism and real estate, to understand what it was like to be dependent on extraction industries, he said. Thompson said that during a tour of Urvan for Telluride schoolchildren, their teacher asked her: “So how do you kind of live with yourself, knowing that the town where you grew up in is where the bomb came from that killed all those people in Japan?” Thompson said: “And I just looked at him, like, are you just stupid or are you just rude? What kind of question is that? “My grandfather was a farmer, he was a kind and gentle man that wouldn’t hurt a fly ... He had no idea what he was doing. None of them knew what they were doing. “I had a hard time with that man even asking me that question.” Cooper, who was recently elected as a county commissioner in a neighboring county, representing Telluride, said she has learned the limits of the town’s helpful suggestions. “Telluride is very well meaning in a patriarchal kind of way. We’ve got all kinds of ideas about what would be good for the West End. Unless it comes from within the West End, our ideas are not going to fly there,” she said. She thought some of the criticisms of the resort town have merit. “I, too, am frustrated with Telluride’s energy use and with the 19-bedroom second homes that are still consuming energy when nobody is in the house year round. That said, don’t let that stop a good idea from happening. Don’t use that as an excuse not to move forward with something that would help your community.” Lacey Steele, a Nucla native, has been commuting to work in Telluride since she was 15 and now works at a Starbucks there. At 21, she’s starting a family and getting ready to have a baby. “Everybody there looks down on it – young marriage and young families,” she said. She’s one of the only people at work who’s preparing to have children at all. She sees an imbalance of power even in the way the residents of the two towns think of each other. “I don’t believe that a lot of people in Telluride know what goes on around here. A lot of them don’t even know where we are.” And some of the work its millionaire tourist economy offers has real drawbacks: it’s seasonal, which means Steele is laid off twice a year in the spring and fall and then re-hired. Laura Denney, a Nucla resident who does private housekeeping in Telluride, said there is an “amazing difference” in lifestyles between the two towns. At the same time, she said, the families she worked for were “really down-to-earth people” who she saw give back to the broader community. She pushed back against the negative views of Telluride residents in Nucla. “A lot of people still have that feeling: ‘They’re just a bunch of hippies up there, just a bunch of rich people.’ You know what? It was the hippies that made Telluride rich ... If it wasn’t for the people in Telluride, a lot of us here in Nucla, Naturita and Norwood wouldn’t have jobs.” Residents of Nucla “do have this really strong attachment to their culture and their history”, Cooper said. Over the years, she’s come to believe that attachment is mixed with shame. The history of Nucla “is not taught in schools, it’s not shared ... There’s a conflict of being both ashamed and being proud of it – and I think in some ways that is what has really kept that community from discovering what’s next for them if it’s not uranium.” Jeremy Nichols, the climate energy program director at WildEarth Guardians, the not-for-profit whose lawsuit led to the closure of Nucla’s power plant, is unabashed about his goals. “We want to shut down all coal-fired power plants. We want to keep all coal in the ground. We have a moral imperative to confront the climate crisis, and we can’t afford to say, ‘It’s OK for this power plant to run and not the others.’” The scheduled shutdown is “an uncomfortable situation for sure for them”, he said. But the timeline, and the deadline, also have benefits, he argued. They provide certainty about something that was already going to happen, and cut through the rhetoric that might suggest, inaccurately, “that coal is great and it’s going to go on forever and if anybody says otherwise, they’re lying”. The town has to take responsibility for planning its own future, and for the lack of planning in the past. “It’s a beautiful landscape, but it’s stuck in an old economy, and the old economy is going belly-up, and Nucla hasn’t planned for that,” he said. One autumn 16 years ago, Monte Naslund, whose family has worked on the irrigation ditch for decades, was at cow camp, where cattle graze in the summer in the mountains near Nucla. It was always quiet up there, but on that day he noticed something different. The rumble of airplanes overhead, a constant background buzz even on a mountaintop, had stopped. He was listening to a depth of silence he had not heard since he was a boy. Only much later, when he came down off the mountain, would Naslund learn why it was so silent. Terrorists had flown airplanes into both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and civilian flights had been grounded nationwide. More than 2,000 miles from the stunned New Yorkers who had watched the towers fall, Naslund had been able to hear the nation coming to a halt. Around Nucla these days, there’s a sense that many of the residents are listening intensely – that the seismic shift they are experiencing, as urban and rural priorities clash across the world, is audible to them. Some in town are optimistic that they will find a way forward: expand the Nucla airport for commercial flights, turn the old elementary school building into a hemp manufacturing center, finally mobilize tourism to Nucla’s canyons, rivers and bike trails. Others are doubtful that hemp will make much difference, and question whether Nucla’s natural landscape – beautiful, but without the show-stopping monuments of Moab or Zion – could ever become a true tourist destination. The town lies off the highway; it is not on the way to anywhere. Miller, who runs an Airbnb in her house, said the guests she gets stay for just one night, stopping over on their way somewhere else. Thompson, who is also the president of the local historical society, is doing what she can to celebrate the town’s more positive history. There is a Uravan reunion picnic every year to bring together old residents of the town. In 2012, the event had attracted an estimated 1,000 people. They served yellow cake in tribute to yellowcake (milled uranium oxide). In the fall, she’s planning to host an all-terrain-vehicle tour of the entire length of the socialist ditch. But progress on building a larger museum is slow and after years of effort, Thompson said that Nucla and Naturita still feel like an afterthought to the broader world, their culture and history less of a priority. “We really are a lower class people. I don’t know how to say that in a nice way,” she said. For Cooper, the Telluride commissioner, Nucla was founded with a pioneering spirit, and its residents still have it. “If they could tap into that and take advantage of it,” she said, “I think the sky’s the limit.” This article was co-published with Topic, a new storytelling studio.

189,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/us/politics/trump-russia-election-meeting.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter Baker WASHINGTON — At 6:14 p.m. on June 7, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. clicked the send button on an email to confirm a meeting with a woman described as a “Russian government attorney” who would give him “information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.” Three hours later, his father, Donald J. Trump, claimed victory in the final primary races propelling him to the Republican presidential nomination and a general election contest against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump promised to deliver a major address detailing Mrs. Clinton’s “corrupt dealings” to give “favorable treatment” to foreign governments, including “the Russians.” The White House said the timing was a coincidence. The younger Mr. Trump said this week that he never told his father about the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the president said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until a few days ago. But the time frame raised questions that investigators will presumably examine as they try to piece together who knew what, and when, last year during what American intelligence agencies have called a Russian effort to influence the presidential election. transcript “How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. So important. Russia is a ruse.” “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians.” “I didn’t take any money from Russia. If that’s what you’re asking me.” “Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?” “Well, of course not.” “Was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had?” “Of course not. Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?” “We have no relationship. This is an absurd attempt by the Clinton campaign to try to get the focus off of what the real issue is.” “So to be clear, Mr. Trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs?” “That’s what he said. That’s what I said. That’s obviously what our position is.” “We hear experts, you know, his house cat at home once said that this is what’s happening with the Russians. It’s disgusting. It’s so phony.” “Can you say that nobody from the Trump campaign had any involvement with the Russians before, during or after the campaign?” “Yes, I can.” “Did anyone involved in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election?” “Absolutely not.” “Can he say definitively that nobody in his campaign, nobody that he’s been associated with had any contacts with any Russian agents?” “No, first of all, the answer is no. And we don’t know of any, any contacts with Russian agents.” The meeting with the Russian lawyer came at a crucial stage in the elder Mr. Trump’s against-the-odds campaign as he pivoted toward taking on Mrs. Clinton, who was widely seen as the front-runner for the presidency. With Mr. Trump’s party still divided, his team was eager for information that could be used against his Democratic opponent, just as any nominee would be at that stage. The difference was that the Kremlin, according to intelligence reports, was eager to play a role in the campaign, and was in the midst of unleashing an operation to damage Mrs. Clinton. The younger Mr. Trump said the meeting with the Russian lawyer yielded no useful information about Mrs. Clinton, and instead turned into a discussion about a Russian-American diplomatic dispute. By happenstance or not, in the days and weeks after the meeting with the Russian lawyer, emails purloined from Democratic computers were made public, which investigators tied to Russian hacking. As a candidate, the elder Mr. Trump, who had expressed admiration of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, took positions that summer that caused head scratching. He expressed openness to lifting sanctions on Russia that were imposed after its annexation of Crimea, and suggested he might not defend NATO allies that did not spend enough money on their own security. The Republican platform at the party convention in July 2016 was crafted to keep out a call to provide arms to Ukraine to fight pro-Russian separatists. The president’s legal team declined to comment about the close timing of some of these events. A White House official said the president’s threat to air allegations about Mrs. Clinton on June 7 was part of a long-planned speech and was not related to his son’s decision to meet with the Russian lawyer. At a briefing on Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed the latest articles about the emails and meeting as “much ado about nothing.” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was not aware of the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer at the time. “No, that I didn’t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this,” he told Reuters. He did not fault his son for sitting down with the lawyer. “I think many people would have held that meeting,” Mr. Trump said. Democrats said the timing of Donald Trump Jr.’s emails and his meeting with the lawyer showed an intent to collude. “Going back now, a lot of things seem to be falling into place,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign communications director. She dismissed the president’s assertion that he had known nothing about the meeting. “It’s not plausible to me, understanding how much control Donald Trump exerts over whatever organization he’s in charge of. How many times did he tell us, ‘I’m in charge, I’m the only one who matters, I’m my own strategist’?” Lawyers with experience in political inquiries said the timetable would certainly interest investigators, but did not necessarily mean they would find a connection. “You have two pieces of the puzzle, and they’re important,” said Cliff Sloan, who was an associate independent counsel during the Iran-contra investigation. “But you have to see how all the pieces fit together before you can draw final conclusions.” In a speech in San Diego, Mrs. Clinton castigated Mr. Trump for his affinity for Mr. Putin, saying the Republican candidate had an “affection for tyrants” that would make him a poor commander in chief. “If you don’t know exactly who you’re dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch,” she said. Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid reporter who knew the Trumps and spent a lot of time in Russia in recent years. Citing a Russian contact, Mr. Goldstone offered to help provide “very high level and sensitive information” that would “incriminate Hillary” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Mr. Trump replied with interest 17 minutes later. “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” he wrote. After several more emails, Mr. Trump and Mr. Goldstone agreed to a meeting at Trump Tower on the afternoon of June 9 with what Mr. Goldstone described as a “Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.” Mr. Trump said he would probably be joined by Paul J. Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, his brother-in-law, who would later become a White House senior adviser. That evening, the Republican primary season wrapped up with contests in five states. Mr. Trump, the presidential candidate, took the stage in New York and focused on Mrs. Clinton. “I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,” he said. “Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund — the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese — all gave money to Bill and Hillary, and got favorable treatment in return.” Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who, contrary to Mr. Goldstone’s email, did not openly work for the state but was a former prosecutor with deep connections to the Russian government and a history of arguing for Russian interests. In an initial statement to The New York Times, the younger Mr. Trump said Ms. Veselnitskaya primarily discussed a ban on American families seeking to adopt Russian children imposed by Mr. Putin as retaliation for American sanctions on Russians suspected of human rights abuses. Donald Trump Jr. later acknowledged that he had agreed to the meeting because he believed Ms. Veselnitskaya would provide the campaign with incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton. Only after an inquiry by The Times prompted him to release his emails did it become clear that he had been told that the information was coming from the Russian government. Ms. Veselnitskaya, for her part, has maintained that nothing about the campaign was discussed, and she said she provided no incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton. In an interview on Fox News on Tuesday night, the younger Mr. Trump said that Ms. Veselnitskaya’s discussion was “sort of nonsensical, inane and garbled,” and that he had concluded the original email “was probably some bait and switch” to get him to take the meeting. He said Mr. Kushner left the meeting within 10 minutes, while Mr. Manafort spent most of the time looking at his phone. Mr. Trump said he did not mention the meeting to his father. “There was nothing to tell,” he said. “It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.” At 4:40 p.m. that day, or roughly right after the meeting, if it began at 4 p.m. as scheduled, the elder Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter jabbing Mrs. Clinton about email messages that had been deleted from her private server on the grounds that they were personal and not about government business. Mr. Trump, the candidate, ended up not giving the “major speech” about Mrs. Clinton’s dealings with Russia and other countries, despite his promise. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign spent the day waiting for the attack. “We were very concerned about it,” Ms. Palmieri said. “We put a team together.” The campaign figured the attack would be a reprise of some of the allegations raised a year earlier in a book called “Clinton Cash” by Peter Schweizer, so Mrs. Clinton’s advisers drafted responses and recruited surrogates to go on television to defend her. “Then the day came, and I was in the room with Hillary, and we’re monitoring what he said, and he didn’t do anything,” Ms. Palmieri said. On Wednesday, the White House said Mr. Trump had switched speeches because of the mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla., nightclub the day before. A hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 posted opposition research and donor documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee. A cybersecurity firm that investigated the breach concluded that Russia was behind it. “Too bad the D.N.C. doesn’t hack Crooked Hillary’s 33,000 missing emails,” Mr. Trump, the candidate, said in a statement. The activist group WikiLeaks posted nearly 20,000 emails from senior Democratic National Committee officials. Intelligence officials have said that the emails were taken from the party’s computer system by Russian hackers. The same day, Mr. Trump delivered the speech denouncing Mrs. Clinton’s ethics that he had promised earlier, relying mainly on “Clinton Cash” and other known controversies linked to her. In an interview on CNN, Donald Trump Jr. dismissed Democratic suggestions that the Russians were trying to hurt Mrs. Clinton and help his father. “It’s disgusting,” he said. “It’s so phony.” He added: “I can’t think of bigger lies. But that exactly goes to show you what the D.N.C. and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.” The elder Mr. Trump publicly dared Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Advisers later said he was only joking. transcript I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she’s been probably hacked, when so much of her information — the director of the F.B.I. said it was essentially negligent. But it would be interesting to see. I will tell you this: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that — I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama. But who doesn’t know that? Because it’s under audit. I’ll release them [tax returns] when the audit’s completed. Nobody would release what it’s under — I’ve had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. Under audit — when the audit is complete I’ll release them. But zero — I mean, I will tell you right now, zero — I’ve nothing to do with Russia.

Eight people, including children, were injured.
Advertisement Autum Garrett of Huntington, Ind., was found dead at the scene, according to police. Three children, ages 8, 6 and 2, also were injured and were treated at a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to a GoFundMe page created for Garrett, two of her children and her husband also were injured during the shooting. An expectant mother at the party was shot in her leg and her family told WLWT that the injury caused her baby to die. Police said two gunmen entered the front door of the Colerain Township, Ohio, home at approximately 11:20 p.m. Saturday night and opened fire on the baby shower party. The shooting lasted ""maybe a minute or two"" before the shooters fled the scene, according to Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney, A woman sitting in her car saw the two men go into the home and heard gunshots. ""Two guys just came in and shot people in the house,"" she told the dispatcher. ""There was little kids hurt and everything. I was sitting in my car. They just ran in and started shooting. There's a pregnant girl here."" Police have not made an arrest and were searching for a motive. ""We're not sure if they were allowed in or they forced entry at this point,"" Denney told reporters. ""We don't know who the suspects are and why they did this.""",2017-07-09 20:18:43,Mother killed in mass shooting at baby shower,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

Benoit Rousseau If you had told 18 year-old me that I would have had a blast at Montreal Jazz Fest, I would have given you a bewildered stare. While I have always been aware of jazz, it has taken me until mid-adulthood to fully appreciate its virtues and charms. As a teenage metalhead, I was fixated on loud, aggressive music, but I also greatly respected people who could tear it up on their chosen instruments. So it makes sense that the superior chops I loved in some heavy rock would be more than echoed in the highly proficient skill and emotiveness of jazz players.
I didn’t acquire my first jazz release until I picked up Billy Cobham’s 1973 debut album Spectrum the summer before college. I had spent over four years immersed in the world of metal. I figured it was time for a change, and I recalled that my drum teacher had introduced me to Cobham’s music a year earlier. Spectrum was the perfect segueway into jazz given Cobham’s ferocious drumming, Jan Hammer’s hyper kinetic keyboard work, Lee Sklar’s grooving bass, and Tommy Bolin’s snarling six-string work. It was a great combination of sonic bombast and highly nuanced playing—Cobham could make super fast and quiet tom work sound like the pitter patter of rain. I later learned that the double bass drum work so common to thrash metal had its roots in ’40s and ’50s jazz.
My musical tastes soon expanded into myriad directions such as ambient, goth, world, and experimental music. (I’ve also remained a loyal headbanger.) Although I delved sparingly into jazz over the next few years, my writing for certain jazz and education focused publications in recent times has encouraged me to delve more into the genre, from the ebullient trumpet work of Arturo Sandoval to the vibrant violin playing of Regina Carter. To mainstream ears, jazz gets lumped into one broad group. Yet just like how within metal and rock numerous variants and subgenres flourish, the lines are further blurred when you’re dealing with improvisational music.
This leads me to this year’s Festival International de Jazz de Montréal (aka Montreal Jazz Fest), the largest festival of its kind in the world, spanning 11 days, hundreds of acts, and a plethora of musical styles. Two million people show up annually. I was encouraged to attend and decided that it was time again for me to delve into a new musical realm. The Festival invited me up, travel arrangements were made, and my girlfriend Susan and I ventured north on Friday, June 30th, the third day of the event.
Jazz Fest absorbs much of downtown Montreal, with streets closed off and numerous stages dotting its urban grid with an endless stream of sights and sounds. One of the big stages, the TD Stage, was located right outside of our hotel, and the equally close Rio Tinto stage was perpendicular to it on an intersecting street. The public stages and select indoor venues provide free entertainment for all to enjoy, along with plenty of ticketed shows as well.
For co-founder André Ménard, his favorite part of the 38 year-old festival is “creating a story between an artist and the Montreal audience,” he told me. “We have tons of examples of that—those unknown acts that we put on free outdoor stages that the crowd discover and starts to love or those main international acts who are more successful here than anywhere else. But my favorite part of the festival is the idea of a democratic event where absolutely everyone can enjoy free quality music. Even homeless people.”
NOT JUST JAZZ 
What is interesting to note is the number of blues, rock, pop, and other acts included within Montreal Jazz Fest. As Maurin Auxéméry, Director of Programming for Montreal Jazz Fest, recalls, Ray Charles played the very first Jazz Fest. While he was not jazz, he was influenced by it. The same could be said of much of this year’s current line-up, which includes diverse artists like Joss Stone, Charlotte Cardin, The O’Jays, and Bob Dylan.
“Today, we keep at least 50 percent of jazz in the programming,” states Auxéméry, who coordinates with Laurent Saulnier, vice-president of programming. “You could not physically see all the jazz shows we program over a day. We respect jazz, we love it, and we keep a giant place for it. We are doing entertainment. The Jazz Fest is beyond a genre of music. It’s a celebration, a happening in downtown Montreal open to everyone. No other festivals brings as many people as that in Canada. Should we offer them only pure jazz? When Jazz represents less than 3 percent of the market, how do you want us to bring music lovers to our festival?”
Auxéméry says that as “jazz music has always been very inclusive with other genres”—such as salsa, Brazilian music, funk, hip hop, electro—“why should we not showcase those musics as well? For us, it’s all related. Good music is good music.” While their mission is to help jazz evolve, he believes it will never be mainstream music anymore. “We need to bring cool aspects to it, and we are working on that. Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat, Snarky Puppy, and BadBadNotGood are the guys that help the music to evolve.”
A NEW WORLD
Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. I didn’t acquire my first jazz release until I picked up Billy Cobham’s 1973 debut album Spectrum the summer before college. I had spent over four years immersed in the world of metal. I figured it was time for a change, and I recalled that my drum teacher had introduced me to Cobham’s music a year earlier.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. My musical tastes soon expanded into myriad directions such as ambient, goth, world, and experimental music. (I’ve also remained a loyal headbanger.) Although I delved sparingly into jazz over the next few years, my writing for certain jazz and education focused publications in recent times has encouraged me to delve more into the genre, from the ebullient trumpet work of Arturo Sandoval to the vibrant violin playing of Regina Carter. To mainstream ears, jazz gets lumped into one broad group. Yet just like how within metal and rock numerous variants and subgenres flourish, the lines are further blurred when you’re dealing with improvisational music.
This leads me to this year’s Festival International de Jazz de Montréal (aka Montreal Jazz Fest), the largest festival of its kind in the world, spanning 11 days, hundreds of acts, and a plethora of musical styles. Two million people show up annually. I was encouraged to attend and decided that it was time again for me to delve into a new musical realm. The Festival invited me up, travel arrangements were made, and my girlfriend Susan and I ventured north on Friday, June 30th, the third day of the event.
Jazz Fest absorbs much of downtown Montreal, with streets closed off and numerous stages dotting its urban grid with an endless stream of sights and sounds. One of the big stages, the TD Stage, was located right outside of our hotel, and the equally close Rio Tinto stage was perpendicular to it on an intersecting street. The public stages and select indoor venues provide free entertainment for all to enjoy, along with plenty of ticketed shows as well.
For co-founder André Ménard, his favorite part of the 38 year-old festival is “creating a story between an artist and the Montreal audience,” he told me. “We have tons of examples of that—those unknown acts that we put on free outdoor stages that the crowd discover and starts to love or those main international acts who are more successful here than anywhere else. But my favorite part of the festival is the idea of a democratic event where absolutely everyone can enjoy free quality music. Even homeless people.”
NOT JUST JAZZ 
What is interesting to note is the number of blues, rock, pop, and other acts included within Montreal Jazz Fest. As Maurin Auxéméry, Director of Programming for Montreal Jazz Fest, recalls, Ray Charles played the very first Jazz Fest. While he was not jazz, he was influenced by it. The same could be said of much of this year’s current line-up, which includes diverse artists like Joss Stone, Charlotte Cardin, The O’Jays, and Bob Dylan.
“Today, we keep at least 50 percent of jazz in the programming,” states Auxéméry, who coordinates with Laurent Saulnier, vice-president of programming. “You could not physically see all the jazz shows we program over a day. We respect jazz, we love it, and we keep a giant place for it. We are doing entertainment. The Jazz Fest is beyond a genre of music. It’s a celebration, a happening in downtown Montreal open to everyone. No other festivals brings as many people as that in Canada. Should we offer them only pure jazz? When Jazz represents less than 3 percent of the market, how do you want us to bring music lovers to our festival?”
Auxéméry says that as “jazz music has always been very inclusive with other genres”—such as salsa, Brazilian music, funk, hip hop, electro—“why should we not showcase those musics as well? For us, it’s all related. Good music is good music.” While their mission is to help jazz evolve, he believes it will never be mainstream music anymore. “We need to bring cool aspects to it, and we are working on that. Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat, Snarky Puppy, and BadBadNotGood are the guys that help the music to evolve.”
A NEW WORLD
Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.

He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig.

Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience.

Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. Jazz Fest absorbs much of downtown Montreal, with streets closed off and numerous stages dotting its urban grid with an endless stream of sights and sounds. One of the big stages, the TD Stage, was located right outside of our hotel, and the equally close Rio Tinto stage was perpendicular to it on an intersecting street. The public stages and select indoor venues provide free entertainment for all to enjoy, along with plenty of ticketed shows as well.
For co-founder André Ménard, his favorite part of the 38 year-old festival is “creating a story between an artist and the Montreal audience,” he told me. “We have tons of examples of that—those unknown acts that we put on free outdoor stages that the crowd discover and starts to love or those main international acts who are more successful here than anywhere else. But my favorite part of the festival is the idea of a democratic event where absolutely everyone can enjoy free quality music. Even homeless people.”
NOT JUST JAZZ 
What is interesting to note is the number of blues, rock, pop, and other acts included within Montreal Jazz Fest. As Maurin Auxéméry, Director of Programming for Montreal Jazz Fest, recalls, Ray Charles played the very first Jazz Fest. While he was not jazz, he was influenced by it. The same could be said of much of this year’s current line-up, which includes diverse artists like Joss Stone, Charlotte Cardin, The O’Jays, and Bob Dylan.
“Today, we keep at least 50 percent of jazz in the programming,” states Auxéméry, who coordinates with Laurent Saulnier, vice-president of programming. “You could not physically see all the jazz shows we program over a day. We respect jazz, we love it, and we keep a giant place for it. We are doing entertainment. The Jazz Fest is beyond a genre of music. It’s a celebration, a happening in downtown Montreal open to everyone. No other festivals brings as many people as that in Canada. Should we offer them only pure jazz? When Jazz represents less than 3 percent of the market, how do you want us to bring music lovers to our festival?”
Auxéméry says that as “jazz music has always been very inclusive with other genres”—such as salsa, Brazilian music, funk, hip hop, electro—“why should we not showcase those musics as well? For us, it’s all related. Good music is good music.” While their mission is to help jazz evolve, he believes it will never be mainstream music anymore. “We need to bring cool aspects to it, and we are working on that. Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat, Snarky Puppy, and BadBadNotGood are the guys that help the music to evolve.”
A NEW WORLD
Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.

What is interesting to note is the number of blues, rock, pop, and other acts included within Montreal Jazz Fest. As Maurin Auxéméry, Director of Programming for Montreal Jazz Fest, recalls, Ray Charles played the very first Jazz Fest. While he was not jazz, he was influenced by it. The same could be said of much of this year’s current line-up, which includes diverse artists like Joss Stone, Charlotte Cardin, The O’Jays, and Bob Dylan.
“Today, we keep at least 50 percent of jazz in the programming,” states Auxéméry, who coordinates with Laurent Saulnier, vice-president of programming. “You could not physically see all the jazz shows we program over a day. We respect jazz, we love it, and we keep a giant place for it. We are doing entertainment. The Jazz Fest is beyond a genre of music. It’s a celebration, a happening in downtown Montreal open to everyone. No other festivals brings as many people as that in Canada. Should we offer them only pure jazz? When Jazz represents less than 3 percent of the market, how do you want us to bring music lovers to our festival?”
Auxéméry says that as “jazz music has always been very inclusive with other genres”—such as salsa, Brazilian music, funk, hip hop, electro—“why should we not showcase those musics as well? For us, it’s all related. Good music is good music.” While their mission is to help jazz evolve, he believes it will never be mainstream music anymore. “We need to bring cool aspects to it, and we are working on that. Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat, Snarky Puppy, and BadBadNotGood are the guys that help the music to evolve.”
A NEW WORLD
Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. “Today, we keep at least 50 percent of jazz in the programming,” states Auxéméry, who coordinates with Laurent Saulnier, vice-president of programming. “You could not physically see all the jazz shows we program over a day. We respect jazz, we love it, and we keep a giant place for it. We are doing entertainment. The Jazz Fest is beyond a genre of music. It’s a celebration, a happening in downtown Montreal open to everyone. No other festivals brings as many people as that in Canada. Should we offer them only pure jazz? When Jazz represents less than 3 percent of the market, how do you want us to bring music lovers to our festival?”
Auxéméry says that as “jazz music has always been very inclusive with other genres”—such as salsa, Brazilian music, funk, hip hop, electro—“why should we not showcase those musics as well? For us, it’s all related. Good music is good music.” While their mission is to help jazz evolve, he believes it will never be mainstream music anymore. “We need to bring cool aspects to it, and we are working on that. Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat, Snarky Puppy, and BadBadNotGood are the guys that help the music to evolve.”
A NEW WORLD
Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.

Having been to Quebec when I was a kid, I anticipated that Montreal (which is celebrating its 375th anniversary) would have more of the medieval vibe of the Old Quebec lodged in my memory banks. In fact, it’s a fairly modern looking city with glass-lined skyscrapers abutting early 20th century architecture. Old Montreal provided some of the Old World charm I was looking for. The city is certainly a haven for artists, from rent stabilized loft spaces to the dozens of amazing murals we saw on a tour of the Mile End district, which shuns corporate chains and is home to cool bars, chic and shabby chic couture, thrift shops, and music and book emporiums. (I adored the old school Moog keyboard store.)
The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. The murals change frequently with the coming of the annual MURAL Festival in June which highlights and promotes such colorful street art. The new, nine-story tall Leonard Cohen by Kevin Ledo is an impressively lifelike portrait of the revered Canadian singer-songwriter, and other murals range from an ‘80s video game collage to outright psychedelia. Equally impressive is the fact that these works of art are not defaced or tagged on. They probably would not last more than a few days in New York City before someone would leave their own mark on them.
This support for the arts extends from a local level to a provincial and national one, thus the reason that a massive event like the Montreal Jazz Fest has grown to such a mammoth scale. Having the good fortune to be centrally stationed at the Hyatt Regency, which has a sixth floor terrace looking out over rue Sainte-Catherine, a major point of music convergence, we were immersed in the daily flow of foot traffic, various live shows, and spontaneous street performances by blues and rock guitarists and even a Dixieland band.
I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. I don’t tend to be a fan of large crowds, but the massive throng in Montreal was pretty well behaved. The few instances of rudeness we encountered tended to come from fellow Americans (even the bilingual ones), although not always. By the same token, watching the CBC’s coverage of the 150th anniversary of Canada (July 1st was Canada Day), our neighbors up north also deal with similar social and political: the heated debate over illegal immigrants, the genocide of our native peoples, and racial violence. Overall, though, people up there seem less aggressive and angry than down here.
They also love music, and Jazz Fest was the place to be.
THE FIRST NIGHT
We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. We kicked things off on Friday night at Monument-National. Pianist Hiromi Uehara and harpist Edmar Castaneda, who met at last year’s festival, reunited for a live concert in which they played each other’s material and had separate solo spots. They make a powerful pair. Hiromi has brought a certain funkiness and energy to her fusion infused playing that is mirrored by Castaneda’s use of the harp as both an elegant and percussive instrument. He rocks those strings, using his left hand to play bass on top of whatever melodic lines he plays. They delighted the crowd, even covering a tune that Hiromi has wanted to play live since she was a kid: the “Cantina Theme” from the original Star Wars film. It turns out they were recording a live album (that will be one hell of a release), which came to light when Hiromi explained why Castaneda was so fastidious about keeping his harp in tune every couple of songs. “My mom always told me to play the flute,” he quipped.

After their two-hour set, I raced over to Le Gesù, a live venue inside the Church of the Gesù, to catch Donny McCaslin’s quartet rock the house. Three members of this roster recorded with David Bowie on his final album Blackstar, and that collaboration has elevated McCaslin and his group’s status higher in mainstream consciousness. Their seven song, 90-minute set showcased a musical language where free jazz, rock, electronic music, and psychedelia intersected, at least for me. He played two new originals without titles as well as two Bowie covers (instrumental renditions of “Lazarus” from Blackstar and “Look Back In Anger” from Lodger) and “Coelacanth 1” by Deadmau5. The latter appeared on his recent album Beyond Now.
Now a headliner playing to a devout audience, McCaslin first played at Jazz Fest three decades ago as part of the Gary Burton Quintet with special guest Pat Metheny, and it was an “amazing” experience for the then burgeoning sax player. “It was something I’ll never forget,” he told when me I chatted him up after the show (and after he spoke to and signed CDs for loyal fans).
Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums. They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

They played at a couple of clubs including the now defunct L’Air du Temp and met many Montreal musicians. The sax player “spent hours and hours in this city playing creative music” and exploring the town. “I love the culture and the aesthetic of the art scene and just feel like I’ve benefited from being a part of it for many years,” he explained.

THE SECOND NIGHT
On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. Like the festival itself, McCaslin’s music has grown and embraced many different genres of music, and he concurred that such open-mindedness helps make jazz more accessible for a wider audience. “I do think that it opens up the possibility of a broader audience, and I’ve certainly experienced that as a result of working with David,” he said. “I had the honor and pleasure of meeting a lot of his fans over the last year and a half who have come out to the shows.” (One Montreal attendee told him he had not listened to Bowie before McCaslin worked with him, then he went out and bought five Bowie albums.) “I’ve heard various people tell me, ‘I’m not a jazz fan, but I like what you do,’” continued McCaslin. “That to me is affirming the direction I’m taking, and I feel like there’s a broad demographic that comes [including] more younger people that are not jazz fans per se.”
This particular show was recorded for a French TV channel. Hopefully we’ll see it in North America sometime as well. Hours after their Montreal appearance (at 4 am), McCaslin and his bandmates were off to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival followed by the Iowa City Jazz Festival and a three-week European tour.
McCaslin certainly loves Montreal. He came up many times in the past with David Binney, a good friend who has produced many of his albums.

Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.

On Saturday night, we took a 12-minute cab ride away from our hotel to check out the Denis Chang Quintet at Diese Onze, a cozy jazz bar. Susan had specifically wanted to see him. We only had thirty minutes because we had the Gipsy Kings concert at 8, but for that half hour, from five feet away, we watched Chang and his stringed bandmates (guitar, violin and bass) play a sprightly set of charming gypsy jazz that was very apropos for this French bistro. On his website, Chang describes himself as a “gypsy jazz guitar player specializing in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,” and the packed audience certainly dug the vibe.
There was a striking contrast between the intimate setting of Diese Onze (approximately 100 patrons) and the 1,450-seat Théâtre Maisonneuve, not to mention the elegant style of Chang and the boisterous rumba flamenca of the Gipsy Kings. From the moment they took the stage, the 12-piece ensemble, which features two original members, frontman/guitarist Nicolas Reyes and lead guitarist Tonino Baliardo, enchanted the packed house with rockers and ballads (and points in between) the way a hard rock band would. (And surprisingly at a similar volume.) They veered from the electro-acoustic stomp of “Baila Me” and “Bamboleo” to the gentler romantic strains of “Inspiration” and their cover of “Hotel California,” a song I am loathe to hear ever again but which they spiced up credibly. Some might debate whether this is still the true Gipsy Kings, but their audience cherished them and were joyously dancing and clapping throughout their two-hour show.

Later at around 10 pm from our hotel’s sixth floor terrace, we heard and partially saw Canadian popsters Men Without Hats do a half hour set that climaxed with an extended version of their big ’80s “Safety Dance.” Props to Ivan Doroshuck, the 59 year-old frontman who performed with three younger musicians in this resurrected line-up and exuded plenty of energy to onstage and embraced his big hit. (Although they had one more big song in Canada, “Pop Goes The World” in 1987.)
There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied. Hey, it was a Canadian birthday bash, even though French-speaking Quebec province has its own culture distinct from the country’s other provinces.
It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.

It’s worth nothing that the loud strains of music lasted downtown until 1:30 am each night. So if you’re an early to bed type of person, don’t stay in that area. But if you love an endless flow of people and music, you could do worse.
THE THIRD NIGHT
Sunday was our third and final night there, and it started off bizarrely when we showed up to the House Of Jazz to see Taurey Butler at 5 pm as advertised on their website. I even put my name and cell number in to reserve a spot. (Of course, my phone was having reception issues.) The club was closed until 5:30 pm, which threw off our schedule, and no mention on their site was made of a time change. I felt like the Blues Brothers statues dancing atop their sign were mocking us. Oh well.
After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.
Upstairs originally wanted Iyer’s trio, but “because it was such a constrained situation budget wise and schedule wise, so the only it would work was solo,” he informed me prior to his gig. He plays solo gigs several time a year on top of his already packed schedule, and he has been to Montreal seven or eight times in the past. Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. There was a reason for this pop slant. “Building the Canada 150 show [for July 1], which was based on showcasing the biggest Canadian hits from the last decades, it was obvious that the Men Without Hats had to be on the show,” says Auxéméry. “As they were coming for that show, we offered them to play their full show the next day.”
After Men Without Hats, pow-wow drum group Buffalo Hat Singers hit the TD Stage for a few minutes, followed by a large cover band for the Canada 150 spectacle. It featured a rotating roster of male and female singers covering everything Canadian from Corey Hart’s ’80s hit “Sunglasses At Night” to Carly Rae Jepsen’s summertime smash “Call Me Maybe.” It wasn’t jazz, but the crowd was very satisfied.

Iyer feels that Montreal Jazz Fest is so diverse in part because of its size, which indicates that audiences are prepared to experience a wide range of music.
I asked him about his own diversity, which opens up new sonic possibilities as well as a potential receptiveness to jazz among non-genre listeners. But he does not consciously try to fit himself into a mold. “I’ve never tried, and I’ve never had a problem reaching people,” he said. “It’s not about whether the music is accessible to them. It’s not really an issue. If you present the music in a way that takes care of the audience—considers the listener and the experience of the listener—then you can actually stretch things pretty far. It’s just being kind. It’s not about what style it is or even what the content is.”
Iyer has been quite busy recently. “I just composed a violin concerto that premiered two weeks at the Ojai Music Festival,” the quietly intense pianist told me. “It’s called ‘Trouble’ and was performed by [violinist] Jennifer Koh. That was a major endeavor for me.” It took him several months to compose. “We also just made a sextet album [with] myself, Stephan Crump, Tyshawn Sorey, Steve Lehman, Graham Haynes, and Mark Shim.” Recorded a few weeks ago, the album (Far From Over) will be out around late August.
When I bring up Donny McCaslin, who seems like a kindred spirit, Iyer mentions that he is heading up to a summer workshop at the BANFF Centre in Alberta, which he is looking forward to. It turns out McCaslin’s drummer Mark Guiliana will be attending that week-long event as well. “We will spend a week together at BANFF so I’ll get to know him [better],” says the pianist. (One can hope for a fruitful summit between those two. Giuliana is a stellar drummer.)
The last performance I caught at Jazz Fest was part of the set from sultry British singer Polly Gibbons on the Rio Tinto stage later that night before we wandered out to further investigate Montreal. Susan and I ventured to the hard rocking Piranha Bar, a watering hole with lots of video slot machines and an agreeable bartender named Tony. Because, well, metal. Heavy bands do well up there; the local headbangers are devout musical disciples. See? It all came back around.
THE WRAP UP
Three days and nights of exploring Montreal and Jazz Fest did not seem like enough, but it was a great virgin experience. There were plenty of post-shows trip that would have been fun to witness: King Crimson, the Django Reinhardt Allstars, Arturo Sandoval, and this coming Saturday night, bluesy rocker and former metal queen Lee Aaron (who I profiled last year for the Observer). As a word of advice, the best way to enjoy Jazz Fest is to have a good sense of what you want to see and make a plan prior to each day so you know where you want to go and who you want to see. It can be overwhelming otherwise.
Waiting for my delayed flight in the Montreal airport, I saw American television reports about crazy presidential tweeting, another mass shooting, and a health care bill that can barely get cobbled together. I reflected on how much calmer and more civilized Montreal seemed, even with the energy infusion from Jazz Fest. (Although my hyperactive New York brain still does not quite comprehend the laid back nature of our northern neighbors, even though it’s refreshing.) Canada has its share of troubles too, but they generally seem to take better care of their citizens and respect the culture they have created. They also believe in the value and power of the arts. It is not simply about commerce.
Coming back to the New York City area, which has become increasingly gentrified and less cultured—and in the case of Manhattan, a playground for the rich—I thought how nice it would be if we could bring some of Montreal here. We could use it right about now. Montreal, I will return.
Bryan Reesman is the author of Bon Jovi: The Story. After a delicious dinner, I rushed off to see Vijay Iyer perform a nearly 90-minute solo piano set at Upstairs Jazz Club, an intimate venue with stone walls located at basement/bottom level floor. (Hence why their club logo is upside down on their sign.) The Grammy-nominated pianist and composer performed a six-song set, and the first half included “I’m All Smiles,” a Michael Leonard tune recorded by one of his major influences, Geri Allen, the acclaimed jazz pianist who passed away the week before. He felt the first three tunes he performed were a tribute to her.
Iyer seemed to enter a trance as he performed, each piece ripe with melodic and rhythmic twists and turns, including his own originals “Spellbound and Sacrosanct, Cowrie Shells and the Shimmering Sea” and “Accumulated Gestures.” He was very strongly focused on a performance that varied in emotional tone, and the audience stayed reverently silent throughout, bursting into applause once he finished each song. You could hear a pin drop. Or more accurately, a fork or knife from the kitchen near the back. When it came for an encore, he joked that it was too hard to go through the club (which was a tight squeeze) and come back, so we could pretend he did. Then he launched into his encore. He had another show to perform an hour later at 9:45 pm.

Jeff Sessions claims that the Justice Department has taken down “the largest dark net marketplace in history.” Where you could buy the devil’s weed! We won’t be having any problems with those drugs any more. I suppose we should wait for sentencing before firing up the woodchippers. Hello. We’re gonna need a bigger woodchipper. I feel safer already. Of course. People shouldn’t be buying their drugs discreetly on the Internet, they should be purchasing them in bad neighborhoods from dangerous guys with names like T-Bone or Skeez! “TEH DARK NET IS STEALING JOBS FROM MA AND PA DRUG DEALERS!!!” WTF is this dark net bullshit? I keep hearing all of these ads for credit agencies “monitoring” them. If they’re so easy to be monitored, how are they “dark”? There always has to be some sinister “other” to keep people afraid of. Dark Net is any website not crawled by search engines. That’s the definition. So every time you log into your bank account you’re on the dark net. Criminal. And if you use that bank account to buy anime porn, it’s the Deep Weeb. I fired up my WinXP virtual machine a couple weeks age with the TOR Browser and looked around. AlphaBay has been on the government radar for some time now and is not 4-star darknet market. One of the popular suggestions for those who want to browse the darknet is to a use a VPN is addition to TOR. This strikes me as stupid. TOR distributes your browsing activity all the fuck over the place. A VPN concentrates it at one (or a likewise set of one) router. Yeah that’s the ticket! says some some government employee in a Dalhgren, Virginia basement. some government employee in a Dalhgren, Virginia basement. John? “You’re under arrest, halfwit.” “You’re the dumbest criminal i have ever scene. I’m sorry but it’s ture.” “Why don’t you take you’re foot out of you’re mouth befor you embarass yourself any further.” *sincere applause* Where did he go anyway? Was he part of the Exodus? We gave him to a farm. Man, I hope it’s the same farm we sent my dog to. They’d be fast friends! You sound like someone who has no idea what they’re doing and your advice is very, very, very bad. Which advice is that? All of it. Thanks for clearing that up. You’ve been very helpful. I’m not going to discuss how to circumvent anything on a open forum. Not that I know how anyway. The idea that I would, or would want to, especially in a forum that is known to be monitored, strikes me as colossal stupid. *colossally OK, you’ve shown that you don’t know what you’re talking about. 1. This forum hasn’t ‘been shown to be monitored’ unless you consider random lefties reporting things that aren’t crimes to be monitoring. 2. Why wouldn’t you discuss circumventing anything in an open forum. Its not illegal you know. Or are you going to go the ‘you’re helping out the terrorists/government enemies!!!111!!1’ by talking about it? Open-source – that’s how that works and that’s how working exploits are distributed faster than they can be patched out. “1. This forum hasn’t ‘been shown to be monitored’ unless you consider random lefties reporting things that aren’t crimes to be monitoring.” I’m just gonna leave this here for everyone to see it forever in case they ever take you seriously again. I’m counseling caution and prudence. Yeah, wjathe fuck do I know, guy who thinks Reason isn’t still monitored. Is that you, Dunphy? “Is that you, Dunphy?” Don’t be so hard on Agammamon, he’s naive, not stupid. Don’t be so hard on Agammamon, he’s naive, not stupid. Wasn’t directed to Ag, was directed to you. Stupid T’Reason threading. “Its not illegal you know” Neither was the behavior the subpoenas were issued for. How can you be this naive? lol Sorry if that was too subtle. I don’t think that widget was making any suggestions, that’s all. The U.S. ban on using laptops during flights from Middle Eastern countries has been lifted. If only they’d ban using laptops during dinner, am I right moms and dads? Haha, that is good humor for us fellow parents. “Sometimes you have to arrest people to get them help,” says Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police chief… Talk about being a one trick pony. Sometimes, you have to destroy the village in order to save it. You have to destroy a life in order to get them to reboot. Sometimes you have to just beat the ever living fuck out of this bent nail with a hammer. Just smash the hell out of it until its beat flat. Its the only thing you can do with a nail. “Sometimes you have to arrest people to get them help,” says Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police chief, defending the department’s simultaneous policies of considering all sex workers to be “human trafficking victims” and also throwing said “victims” in jail. “Because i don’t understand what ‘victim’ or ‘justice’ even mean, that’s why.” Judge Smails: I’ve sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn’t want to do it. I felt I owed it to them. Exxon Mobil is suing the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control over a $2 million fine for allegedly violating sanctions on doing business with Russia. Big Oil gets to sue the government? Why can’t I sue the government over my parking tickets? Another lefty dipshit scumbagetta in the JournoList wrote a cockamamie tweet blaming her friend dying of cancer on John McCain, got slagged by her bosses, and was forced to make an insincere apology retraction. Basically, she’s the Elizabeth Nolan Brown of the L.A. Times. Except unlike Reason, to their credit they apparently still have a small modicum of expected standards of honesty and decency. Holy mackerel! Reason’s fuddy-duddy his flapping his lips and spewing bupkis! Crimeny! That ragamuffin gives me the heebie jeebies! He sure scares the tar outta me, by gum. I bet you a sawbuck that ethel’s hopped up. ENB makes me want to become a libertarian journalist, so I can have deranged stalkers too. “Reason’s fuddy-duddy” What does any of this have to do with Sevo? Sevo also thinks you’re a fuddy-duddy. I think he’s right. Another cockamamie comment from Simple Mikey. Yell at that cloud, fella. That’s a spot-on impression of a deranged Trump tweet, Bootlicker. So you think it’s appropriate and perfectly normal to blame a person’s cancer on a politician. You’re as much of a psychopath and a loser as these idiot liberals in the media. Yep, if you make fun of Simple Mikey that means you love all of the things he hates. It’s a package deal, you JournoList scumbagetta cuckaschmuck! We can all only hope to be as civilized and intellectual as Mikey, a borderline racist who calls people with different politics from his “scum” and wishes for their violent extermination. Man, a glue-huffing retard like Mikey is calling me names, I really ought to go home and rethink my life. I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue. Basically, she’s the Elizabeth Nolan Brown of the L.A. Times. Is “of the L.A. Times” another way of saying “but waaaay less hot”? That dame’s no hot dish. I’d fuck ENB if I picked her up at a bar, but hot? Stop it. I saw Matisyahu perform in Texas in 100 degree weather. Dude was in full Hasidic garb and spraying sweat like a broken fire hydrant. He would stop and moan “man, it’s hot” after each song, and it was clear he was not all there mentally. Kinda like you now. “Kinda like you now.” Cry more bitch. Meanwhile “hot” doesn’t mean “attractive.” >>>Meanwhile “hot” doesn’t mean “attractive.” it did yesterday, is this new? No, it didn’t meant it yesterday either. They’re not synonyms everyone and I have been totally misusing “hot” since about 1985…awesome. So, everyone who is attractive to you is also hot? There’s no difference? Then yes, you and the people in the group You think comprises “everyone has been misusing it. Glad I could help. we’re not really fighting, dude…square/rhombus rhombus/square… No guy, they aren’t interchangeable I think we have found our “Stupidest Argument Of The Year So Far” award winner. Congrats, person who is almost certainly trolling – you did it. And crusty shows up because he wasn’t getting enough attention *wonders: pride, or ducking? It was both. You were too proud to admit I was right that they are different, so you ducked my question. Why are you wondering about your own motivations? I guarantee you Crusty that this will get topped before the year is over. Also, what am I doing commenting in the AM links in the afternoon. Crazy sauce. +1 Participation Award To be clear, I only meant that I find her hot in the sense that I am a heterosexual male. I can see why people outside this group would have a different opinion. That, and the fact that she’s just attractive, not hot. But the casual homophobia was classy. So, you found some homophobia in there, huh? Neat. Probably some fascism, too, if you look hard enough. If we didn’t have all this casual homophobia on reason how would we diffuse all of the constant homosexual tension between us all? Sword fights? The two most attractive qualities in a woman is their mind and a constant defense of the rights of prostitutes. ENB is a gem. A GEM. I’m sure you don’t listen to such a cuckshow, but on last week’s Fifth Column, Eli Lake introduces himself by asking for a one-hitter (aka the sticky icky). Thought you’d like to know. Of course I don’t listen to it, but I hope Welch at least had the basic decency to privately apologize to Lake on the mentally disturbed Elizabeth Nolan Brown’s behalf. Simple Mikey is proud of the fact that the poorly-sketched caricatures inhabiting his head receive no input whatsoever from reality. Sad! Yes, campus “justice” needs to be fixed, writes Cathy Young in The New York Times Still giving props to the Russian spy hack JournoList, eh Treason? Jeff Sessions claims that the Justice Department has taken down “the largest dark net marketplace in history.” Phew, that’s a relief. I’m sure all potential online drug dealers have learned their lesson now and no one will ever be able to buy drugs online again. “Sometimes you have to arrest people to get them help,” Nah. Next on the agenda: beheading rape victims (to help them). Denmark is pledging $14 million to send birth control to several countries in Africa as “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressures on Europe,” according to Ulla T?rn?s, Denmark’s minister for development cooperation. I was about to claim a sinister, racist population control scheme is what this is really about, but the stated explanation doesn’t read any better. It’s totally not like that. Even if it is, it’s OK if they have good intentions and something something punching up. It’s funny, because a much easier way to reduce migratory pressure would be to stop giving migrants government money and deport illegal immigrants. But instead they go to birth control, with all the connotations you note. I don’t get Europeans. >>>a much easier way to reduce migratory pressure moat. big moat. Yes, campus “justice” needs to be fixed, writes Cathy Young in The New York Times. Cathy Young, noted gender traitor. Cathy Young, Russiaed Russia Russian. You misspelled “Yekaterina Yung,” comrade! I think you meant: Vy oshiblis’ “Yekaterina Yung”, tovarishch! Fuckin’ T’Reason wont take Cyrillic. Obviously. You know who else won’t take Cyrillic? Lana, anymore… Oh, you said Cryil-LIC. Nevermind. You know who else won’t take Cyrillic? Croatians? It won’t take even ‘tomorrow’ in Spanish which contains just one non-ANSI character. Jeff Sessions Evil? Or evil and stupid? Perfect hybrid. What I imagined a Hillary Presidency would be like. Both. And ugly too. Fair but firm. Grinchy. Hugh Freeze brought down by hubris, vengeance and sex The man had been caught calling an escort service. That had triggered an investigation into other phone calls. Don’t call an escort service from your university-owned phone, stupid. He deserves to be fired for not knowing how to properly flaunt all laws and NCAA rules, like a good college sports coach. Burner phones and cut-outs, dummy. As a Hog fan who hated/hates/will always hate Nutt, and participated in his downfall at Arkansas, this is pretty much the best thing that ever happened in sports, ever, at any time ever. The dipshit used the exact same method we used to get rid of him, to burn down one of our rivals. Faaaaaan-fucking-tastic. Didn’t Nutt use his university phone to send many – hundreds, thousands, something like that – text messages to women who weren’t his wife? Do you know who doesn’t use his university phone for funny business? Nick Saban. That man knows how to run a criminal enterprise. Didn’t Nutt use his university phone to send many – hundreds, thousands, something like that – text messages to women who weren’t his wife? Yessir – this really is GroundHog Decade. In 2006, we FOI’d Nutt’s university phone records. The first thing we found was thousands of text messages to Donna Bragg, a local news anchor, including one just minutes before we went out and shit down our legs in the Cap One Bowl. The sexual angle got other people interested, and a deep look at his records showed a number of recruiting and moral improprieties, which eventually led to his resignation in 2007. Fast forward a decade, and it’s basically the exact same story, except now Nutt is us, and Freeze is Nutt. We get to watch Freeze, Nutt AND Ole Miss burn, all together. THIS is the Libertarian moment! Hugh Freeze what? The Minnesota cop muderer’s lawyer: Noor’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, also gave a statement Thursday, saying that Noor has no plans to talk with investigators. Plunkett also wants a coroner’s report with an outside lab, saying “it would be nice to know if there were some Ambien in [Damond’s] system.” On that, he didn’t elaborate. These shooting victims need a union. This is outrageous. Usually the cop himself doesn’t have to go after the deceased for drugs in the system. The blue wall is really dropping the ball. Also, did anyone ever stop the back alley rape she had originally called in? Nope. Still going on to this very day. This is outrageous. Usually the cop himself doesn’t have to go after the deceased for drugs in the system. The blue wall is really dropping the ball. Well, after the Baltimore police video, perhaps he planted Ambien in her system. …sad that this is not as paranoid a concern as it should be, “it would be nice to know if there were some Ambien in [Damond’s] system.” Yes, because if you’re sleepy you should DEFINITELY be murdered by an agent of the state. She was Australian. Drugs have the opposite effect on people from down under. She’d grabbed the door of the cop car and was starting to rip it right off its hinges, man. The 911 dispatcher recognized her Aussie accent and probably warned Officers Friendly that she was out walking her pet Dropbear. They were justifiably IN FEAR. And they’re fast man. Like really fast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK0Tvz2YqbQ You can’t let people like that within arms reach. To be clear, we are talking about koalas, right? Educate yourself, girl. They should also check to see if she was menstruating. You know, mood swings and such. Don’t be hysterical. Don’t be hysterical. That would be my Rule of Thumb. He probably wants to try to claim that she was sleepwalking and that that means that she might have been behaving strangely. “it would be nice to know if there were some Ambien in [Damond’s] system.” Yes, because if you’re sleepy you should DEFINITELY be murdered by an agent of the state. If it’s not Quaaludes, then you’re really not that tired, fucking drug addicts. “She was probably on Ambien. Broke ever bone in her hand and wouldn’t feel it for hours. There was this guy once, see this scar?” I met that actor (Lance Henriksen) once at DragonCon. Pretty cool guy. These shooting victims need a union. They have one. It is just not on this Mortal Coil. Alright, contestants, is this lawyer an Asshole, a Jackoff, or a Scumbag? To PC for the verbal tirade I want to spew like bile in his general direction. The only reason this could be relevant is that Ambien is known for causing sleepwalking and strange behavior, but considering that she talked to 911 and was lucid then, it seems like this just a Hail Mary pass by the cop’s lawyer. (I know someone who a bad experience with it once and “woke up” lost and driving on some New Jersey highway in the middle of night, not fun even when you’re wide awake.) Unlike liberals, who emerged from the 1960s prioritizing the political freedoms associated with individual rights, the socialist left has posited that most people ? the working class ? remain effectively powerless if capitalists control work, wages and welfare. In their view, the left’s mission ? the reason for its existence ? ought to be expanding the idea of political freedom to include economic freedom. This historical distinction between liberalism and socialism has resurfaced with the millennial left. At least they share the common denominator of wanting someone else to pay for their predilections. In their view, the left’s mission ? the reason for its existence ? ought to be expanding the idea of political freedom to include economic freedom. Expanding freedoms by drastically limiting them! SOCIALISM! Freeing people from responsibility for the consequences of their actions is where liberty passes into license. the working class ? remain effectively powerless if capitalists control work, wages and welfare Even if that’s true, how do people figure that government controlling those things will change their situation for the better? Even if that’s true, how do people figure that government controlling those things will change their situation for the better? That’s always the stumbling block. I have a father-in-law who both wants single payer and whines that the VA has terrible medical service. I once asked him “Why do you think a much larger VA would be better than the one we have now?” We don’t discuss political stuff any more. Yes, give more power to the people who already displayed their incompetence. Progressive governance is the ultimate example of ‘failing up’. You know, for all this talk about how bad capitalism is, I ask these people why they don’t just go and start their own business and they tell me its impossible. Because nobody has millions of dollars to build a factory and manage compliance with regulation. And when you point out that you did that with roughly $3k of initial capital they tell you that you don’t make enough to justify having done it. You point out that there are lot’s of business types that thrive on the worker-owned model – most professional partnerships for example – where the people involved make lot’s of money and they dismiss them as outliers. You point out that there are investment markets where you can find other people in the same situation where you can pool resources and they tell you that you’re crazy. You point out that a capitalist enterprise is, *by definition*, collectively-owned (by the shareholders) and they say it doesn’t count unless the collective encompasses everyone. “economic freedom” Which of course means the opposite of what they think it means. They probably think ‘political freedom’ includes mandatory voting. “Economic freedom? You mean freedom from hunger and material want?” I like to ask them to explain wealth, in addition to poverty. It usually never strikes them that poverty is our natural state and wealth has to be created Socialists tend not to understand wealth at all, from what i’ve seen. They don’t know how to create it or hang onto it (if they happen to fall into it by some accident), so they tend to assume that anyone who has made money has cheated somehow. Look at Bernie Sanders, for example, who never had a job until he was elected mayor of Burlington at the age of 40. Look at Karl Marx, whose sole means of support was donations from his friend Fred Engels (who “borrowed” petty cash from his dad’s business to give to Marx), which he was far more likely to spend on books or writing supplies than on rent or food for his kids. Look at our own american socialist, who couldn’t figure out that, if you take out a mortgage to pay for your home, you have to pay it back. Hipster socialism is having a moment. To be fair, the libertarian moment has run its course, it’s time to try something new. If libertarians are just conservatives who want to smoke pot, then maybe socialists are just progressives who want to systematically murder millions of people. I learned today that leftists like “racial diversity”. Great scoop, WaPo! But only the right kind of racial diversity. Dark-skinned folks who don’t agree with Progressivism aren’t REALLY people… It’s just frustrating because this has potential to be the libertarian moment, since most millennials agree that the government is often corrupt and government assistance programs are failing the people they’re intended to help. It’s really hard to have a conversation go deeper than the superficial “socialism = caring, libertarianism = selfish” spiel though. Ultimately, we all agree that the food is horrible, but Millennials have the additional complaint that the portions are too small. It’s really hard to have a conversation go deeper than the superficial “socialism = caring, libertarianism = selfish” spiel though. LIBERTARIANS ARE SELFISH now give me your money so I can buy the things I want H/T Libertarian Party of Florida I think determining whether or not they’re open to libertarianism depends on figuring out whether they have a constrained or unconstrained vision of humanity, per Thomas Sowell. Kids these days are almost all unconstrained, because they think we can eliminate racism and greed with government policy. They just think we need the right policies and people in charge, and after that they can continue their quest to bend people toward their vision of moral perfection. I don’t know how to reach people with that degree of delusion. It starts young and it’s hard to unlearn Yes, that’s the fundemental differences I think. The difference between libertarians and others isn’t that we think the system is corrupt and they don’t. The difference we think that it is an inherent flaw in government as a concept, while they think it’s because those in power don’t care enough. Denmark is pledging $14 million to send birth control to several countries in Africa as “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressures on Europe” If it takes a village to raise a child, I don’t see why the village shouldn’t have a say in whether or not a child’s produced. That’s obviously part of the solution. Next step, we start deciding who gets retroactively aborted. We can call that the final solution. Denmark is pledging $14 million to send birth control to several countries in Africa as “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressures on Europe” Zombie Margaret Sanger The most important part is making sure the schools, media, and everybody else constantly brainwash any kids we have to think the system makes sense. It takes a village to raise an idiot. Inside the Secret Plan to Stop Vladimir Putin’s U.S. Election Plot In the months following the California primaries, the feds discovered that Russian hackers had broken into more than 20 state and local election systems and attempted to alter voter registration in several of them. Looking back at the events in Riverside County, cybersecurity officials at the White House wondered whether it had been a test run by the Russians. “It looked like a cyberattacker testing what kind of chaos they could unleash on Election Day,” says one former federal cybersecurity official who looked into the case. “There was no forensic evidence, so we may never know for sure, but the intelligence told us the Russians were bragging about doing just that.” “There was no forensic evidence, so we may never know for sure, but the intelligence told us the Russians were bragging about doing just that.” So, that’s why the DNC wouldn’t let the FBI examine their server after it was hacked. Oh, wait … Hasn’t the DHS been found to have tried and hack multiple states election systems? For example, instead of advocating for single-payer health care, Democrats passed Obamacare, a largely ineffective market-based solution. There’s a lot wrong with this sentence. It’s true that Democrats believed it was a market-based solution, and there is a kind of market at work with Obamacare, with predictable results. “Denmark is pledging $14 million to send birth control to several countries in Africa as “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressures on Europe,” according to Ulla T?rn?s, Denmark’s minister for development cooperation.” More of that white paternalism. Next on Scandinavians do the darnedest things! You know, one could be a dickhead and ask, “What migratory pressures on Europe?” Or really get technical. ‘What’s the psi? It’s the 23rd letter of the Greek alphabet. Everyone knows that. /throws deflated football at Spark. Korean Singer/dancer/music producer? First or Second Chebyshev function? [adjusts spectacles] Hipster socialism is having a moment. Do you know who else had a moment? The Beat Generation? Kenny Loggins? I’m sickened that you responded to your own joke that many times. You aren’t actually better than us all. Denmark is pledging $14 million to send birth control to several countries in Africa as “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressures on Europe,” according to Ulla T?rn?s I wonder if Bernie Sanders wants to adopt THIS aspect of Danish government policy as well as all the rest. The Whig Party? Alexander L?pe? The Third Reich? Whitney Houston? Seniors everywhere? What,no ‘you know who else?’ on the Dutch story? I’ll go first ,Margret Sanger. Damn your quick fingers. Jeff Sessions claims that the Justice Department has taken down “the largest dark net marketplace in history.” Guess what happened next! Two of the largest online black-market sites have been shuttered in a law enforcement crackdown, but drug dealers have moved in a hurry to a third “dark net” emporium, where listings of fentanyl and heroin have already spiked, according to analysts. The newfound popularity of DreamMarket highlights the whack-a-mole challenges of policing drugs sold online even as government officials touted the the death of the other two sites, AlphaBay and Hansa. You know what the actual worst thing about America is? It’s the fact that every sandwich by default comes with lettuce and tomato. And if you ask for them to be left off, or take them off yourself, everyone looks at you like you’re some kind of vegetable-hating caveman. And what’s the deal with airline peanuts? And how about that seat recline? My seat only goes back one inch, but the guy’s head in front of me is in my lap. I mean what’s the deal with that? And what the hell does it mean to “deplane”? I just want to get the fuck off. And how about that seat belt demo? I mean….. Always go with asking for the tomato to be left off, even if it makes you look like someone who’d be more comfortable ordering off of the children’s menu. If you wait to take it off yourself, the sandwich is always weirdly soggy. I just feel like bread should never be juicy. I like tomato, even if it’s redundant with ketchup for some people. But requesting no lettuce always throws people off. I’m getting a fast food sandwich/burger here. I am not making a healthy decision. Let’s leave out the 2 calories of pointless crunch You burn more calories digesting lettuce than you obtain from it, so technically it’s more like gaining 2 calories. Yes tomato. No ketchup. It’s for kids. That crunch is meaningful in of itself. Gives texture to the sandwich. $park? doesn’t care for textures. Also, his favorite color is beige. When I want texture, I put Doritos in my sandwich. That’s why I always ask for pickles to be left off. If you take them off yourself you still have to eat pickle flavored bread. Thanks, now i’m hungry for Chic-Fil-A. Once I found out that they make their batter with pickle juice I vowed to never go there. My thoughts and prayers are with your incredibly stunted palate. You know what else sucks? CVT, that’s what. I went from an older car with manual transmission to a newer car with CVT and it’s like having to learn to drive all over again. Really, is it that bad? I was in the market for a Murano a few years back and I kinda liked the way it drove. Ended up getting an Acura MDX ‘cos the wifey like it better. I thought it was a little too “trucky”. Prolly ‘cos I was used to driving a Legend. I don’t like it because you can feel it constantly up and down shifting. Even more so than you could with standard automatic transmission. And according to the mechanic, it’s SOP for it to sometimes sit at 1500 RPM when you’re trying to accelerate and sometimes gun to 4500 RPM. Sounds like you got your tranny out of an old Subaru Justy. Dude, the preferred nomenclature is “transgendered person.” It’s a newish Subaru Impreza. Maybe it’s just a Subaru thing. Wouldn’t know, myself. Ask your local Lesbian for Subaru reviews. What’s the difficulty? Isn’t it like driving a really fast golf cart? i like shifting. “Sometimes you have to arrest shoot people to get them help,” says Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police chief, defending the department’s simultaneous policies of considering all sex workers to be “human trafficking victims” and also throwing said “victims” in jail. FTFY Sometimes you have to shoot their dogs too. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the laptop ban was a “pause,” a stopgap measure until airports could make other security improvements “find out what the hell is going on”. FTFY Agent of the State shoots unarmed woman. CBS blames ‘gun culture’ If the peasants are disarmed, then the King’s Men would not have to kill so many of the peasants. Nauseating smug on all sides. This is fucking amazing. I’m not sure i’ve ever seen a point so massively missed. America’s reluctance to strengthen its gun regulations and its seemingly endless stream of shooting deaths have long been a source of confusion and concern in Australia, which instituted tough gun ownership laws in 1996 following a deadly mass shooting. At the time, then-Prime Minister John Howard — a conservative — warned Australians against following America’s lead on gun control, saying: “We have an opportunity in this country not to go down the American path.” Excellent. Not only are we not solving the problem, we’re running in the opposite direction, waving our arms in the air! “seemingly endless stream of shooting deaths” Most of the USA is pretty safe to live in. Your odds of being murdered are pretty damn slim. But that doesn’t fit the narrative. I guess we should ban cars because of the “seemingly endless stream of automobile accident deaths” too. I feel like a masochist today who’s only here to inflict pain on myself. I guess it’s just like they blame JFK getting shot by a far-left Commie on “an atmosphere of right-wing extremism” too. Without government agencies protecting us, why, we’d all be sick: ” Yet More Stomach Trouble for Chipotle Virginia store temporarily closed after reports of illnesses ” http://www.newser.com/story/24…..potle.html The gang that can’t wash a tomatoe. The problem for them is one person getting the sniffles in their parking lot is going to be national news. We never hear any “reports of illnesses” from restaurants not named “Chipotle”. We never hear any “reports of illnesses” from restaurants not named “Chipotle”. It’s a stock-market strategy: Why not crowd-source customer complaints at U.S. restaurant chains, not just for health, but for stock-market profits? Enter iwaspoisoned.com, which Morgan Stanley’s former global head of interest-rates trading-market structure founded in 2009. This week his site compiled complaints from a single Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. restaurant that promptly sent the burrito chain’s stock price into a tailspin. Wow, that’s “PharmaBro” levels of asshole. PS. That website is EXTREMELY annoying. takes world-class stupidity to still eat @chipotle. They cannot quite grasp that “organic” means “covered in shit”.

Do you smell like Axe body spray, desperation, and cream cheese? Join the alt-right today! That last sentence actually made me laugh out loud. Truth does tend to resonate. Around here it’s more like: order your Latino maid to take the trash out, go to Whole Foods, take turns playing “pitcher and catcher” with your gay lover, take command of your D.C. condominium, and pretend to be a libertarian while voting for liberal democrats! What a load of phooey! Mike, it’s a shame you’re so jealous. He sure seems to have fun, arguing with the cartoons in his head. Sounds like a good weekend. Join shift-down, and you won’t have to do anything. >>>”the largest dark net marketplace in history.” totally forgets the Macedonians had a badass dark net. OT: Clinton supporters still delusional But when the Groper in Chief does disappear, who should fill the void? Below I make the eminently defensible case that it should not be Vice-President Mike Pence, as the Constitution would suggest, but rather the woman from whom the election was stolen in the first place, Hillary Clinton. 1) Enough about Bill Clinton 2) These words don’t mean what this person thinks. 3) Things in the Constitution are not “suggestions”. They’re the law, bitch. 4) The election was not stolen. Your terrible candidate ran a terrible campaign and lost to a billionaire, real-estate mogul, celebrity, blowhard. Wheel and deal. Here is a 14-point justification for swearing in the most qualified presidential candidate in history: Again, words, meaning, etc. It’s as dumb as you think. I like it when Team Blue hacks tell us a pervy sexual harasser is beneath the dignity of the Oval Office. If the Groper-in-Chief disappears, wouldn’t that mean that Biden would take Bill Clinton’s place? “…but rather the woman from whom the election was stolen in the first place, Hillary Clinton.” She did win the popular vote, and then she also won the “Most Likely to End Up In Jail” vote in her junior year, so that should be added to the total, too, right? She won the national popular vote by a smaller margin than she won the California popular vote, so how about she gets to be governor of California? It shouldn’t be possible to do a worse job at it than Jerry Brown. Winning the popular vote might matter if we elected presidents by popular vote. We don’t, so it doesn’t. That’s not a parody article? If not, they are now beyond parody… I’ve been trying to figure out if it is, in fact, parody. But I have seen other examples as of late that suggest these people are way beyond parody already. Hard to say. But the same author also wrote this: http://extranewsfeed.com/after…..9c2982c01c I love the lack of self-awareness saying that Trump thinks himself above the law is an argument for Clinton and installing her as President contrary to the succession law as it stands. Meanwhile in Trump World, the President has apparently started asking his lawyers if he’s allowed to pardon himself. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? I lol’d. Newscom Jeff Sessions claims that the Justice Department has taken down “the largest dark net marketplace in history.” I’m sure glad we elected Trump– the best libertarian President EVAH! Yes, campus “justice” needs to be fired. Fixed. “Sometimes you have to arrest people to get them help,” says Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police chief, defending the department’s simultaneous policies of considering all sex workers to be “human trafficking victims” and also throwing said “victims” in jail.

The Carmichael Show is a critic-friendly family comedy that delves into topics such as gun control and sexual assault, and this episode focuses on the emotional fallout of a deadly mall shooting that Jerrod (Jerrod Carmichael) witnessed. “The family tries to get Jerrod to talk about his feelings about it,” Carmichael told EW last month. It did not depict the actual shooting. Carmichael expressed his dissatisfaction about NBC’s decision to yank the episode to Chelsea Handler on her Netflix talk show, saying, “A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say, ‘Too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately, these things happen constantly and it’s a thing that breaks all of our hearts. … I understand a corporation making that decision, but really, to me, what it says is you don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims. We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we could. To pull that is just criminal. It does a disservice to the viewer, it does a disservice to you, it does a disservice to all of us.” A few days later, he explained to IndieWire that he was appreciative of the dialogue that he had with NBC Entertainment chairmen Bob Greenblatt about the episode. “Ultimately, the network’s largest fears won out and they decided not to air it,” Carmichael said. “But it was a great moment for me and Bob Greenblatt talking about this. He was very thoughtful about it and he had a lot of real things to say, a lot of real concerns, and I think we handled it. It was a very great collaborative moment. It, unfortunately, did not produce the result that I think we wanted.” Viewers will finally get to see the results of Carmichael’s efforts Wednesday night at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.",2017-06-27 14:01:36,Carmichael Show mass shooting episode will now air June 28,,72605,http://www.ew.com
196,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/01/little-rock-nightclub-shooting-police,"First published on Sat 1 Jul 2017 12.42 BST Police said 25 people were shot early on Saturday at a rap show at a nightclub in downtown Little Rock, prompting pleas from community leaders to curb the growing violence in Arkansas’ capital city. Police said the shooting at Power Ultra Lounge was the result of a dispute among club-goers and not an active shooter or terror-related incident. Little Rock police said later on Saturday that 25 people were shot and three others suffered unrelated injuries. All were expected to survive, police said.  Police cordoned off the block as crime-scene technicians gathered evidence from inside and outside the club. Glass from the club’s second-storey windows littered the ground, along with empty drink cups. Little Rock police chief Kenton Buckner told reporters “some sort of dispute broke out between people inside” the club and that there were “probably multiple shooting suspects”. A video posted online by a club patron, Darryl Rankin, showed a packed house for Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tennessee. About half a minute into a break in the raucous concert, several bursts of gunfire rang out. More than 24 shots were fired in an 11-second period. Rankin said he was recording the show on Facebook Live when gunfire erupted and that one of his friends was now at a hospital with a bullet “stuck in his spine”. Courtney Swanigan said she was near the front of the club with her sister when gunfire erupted. They were not injured. Swanigan did not know what led to the shooting, but said she saw someone onstage with a handgun. “I just closed my eyes, got down on the ground and put my hands on my head,” she said. The shooting follows a week in which there have been about a dozen drive-by shootings in Little Rock, though there is no indication the events are linked. “Little Rock’s crime problem appears to be intensifying,” governor Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “Every few days it seems a high-profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning’s event. “I have spoken this morning with Mayor Stodola and I have offered both my heartfelt concern over this senseless violent tragedy and state assets as needed to address the continued threat of violence in our community.” Early Saturday, Raida Bunche waited outside the club after she heard from a friend that her son had been there. Later, she said she had found out her son was unharmed. “I’m sick of all the killing and I’m tired of all the shooting, the kids getting hurt,” Bunche said. The club’s Facebook page promoted Friday night’s show with a poster depicting a man pointing what appeared to be a gun at the camera. A call to a number listed for Finese 2Tymes’ booking agent was not immediately returned. Little Rock mayor Mark Stodola said on Facebook: “My heart is broken this morning my prayers are with the victims of this tragedy … We are committed to doing everything possible to bring safety to our city. We need everyone to help.” In May, one person was killed and six people were hurt in a mass shooting at a downtown concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 115 miles north-east of Little Rock. In that case, two men were charged with first-degree murder and six counts of first-degree battery.",2017-07-01 13:09:24,Little Rock shooting of 25 at rap show prompts call to curb growing violence,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
197,http://abcnews.go.com/US/back-aurora-colorado-movie-theater-shooting-years/story?id=48730066,"Shooter James Holmes is serving life in prison without parole. Vigil commemorates those killed and injured in Aurora, Colorado, movie-theater shooting 5 years ago — -- It was a cool summer night on July 20, 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, as Batman fans took their seats at the Century 16 movie theater for a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The highly anticipated third installment of the Batman trilogy opened to packed auditoriums at midnight showings across the country, but little did the moviegoers in Aurora know that their attendance to see the summer blockbuster would come to a terrible conclusion in real life. Five years later, here is a look back at the devastating shooting that shocked a nation. In the 60 days leading up to the shooting, Holmes had purchased four guns from local shops and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, police said at the time. All of the weapons and ammunition were purchased legally, police said. Holmes had bought a ticket to the movie before slipping out and propping an emergency exit open, federal law enforcement sources told ABC News. About 30 minutes into the movie, Holmes had gathered his weapons and re-entered the movie auditorium through the emergency exit wearing a ballistics helmet, bulletproof vest, bulletproof leggings, a gas mask and gloves. Holmes then detonated multiple smoke bombs before he unloaded four weapons' full of ammunition into the unsuspecting crowd of hundreds of attendees, police said. Ten victims died at the scene, while another two died at local hospitals. Among the dead was a 6-year-old girl. Seventy people were injured in the ordeal, police said. Most were injured by gunfire, but a ""handful"" were injured during the chaos that ensued. One injured victim was hit by gunfire in an adjacent theater. A 3-month-old was among those taken to the University of Colorado Hospital, but he or she was quickly discharged, Dr. Comilla Sasson told ABC News at the time. Twenty-two victims were taken to University of Colorado Hospital that night. Witnesses said they thought the smoke and gunshots were part of the movie until they saw Holmes standing in front of the screen. ""You just smelled smoke and you just kept hearing it, you just heard bam bam bam, non-stop,"" one witness told ABC News in 2012. ""The gunman never had to reload. Shots just kept going, kept going, kept going."" Moviegoer Christopher Ramos told ABC News in 2012 that ""people were running everywhere,"" including on top of him, and called the shooting a ""real-life nightmare."" ""I froze up. I was scared,"" Ramos said. ""I honestly thought I was going to die."" Some lied on the ground to protect themselves. ""I'm with coworkers and we're on the floor praying to God we don't get shot, and the gunshots continue on and on, and when the sound finally stopped, we started to get up and people were just bleeding,"" another theatergoer said at the time. At one point, Holmes exited the theater, only to wait outside and shot patrons as they attempted to flee, witness Jennifer Seeger said on ""Good Morning America"" after the shooting. Police apprehended Holmes in his car behind the theater within minutes of the shooting. He was found in full riot gear and carrying three weapons, including an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40 caliber Glock handgun. A fourth handgun was also found inside the vehicle. Holmes told arresting officers that he was ""The Joker,"" referring to the villain in the second installment of the ""Batman"" movie trilogy, ""The Dark Knight."" When Holmes was arrested he warned police that he had booby-trapped his apartment. The next day, police, bomb squads and agents from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found a large number of explosives devices and trip wires at Holmes' apartment. At first, Hazmat teams had to proceed searching Holmes' apartment with caution, since the materials could have blown up Holmes' apartment building and the ones near it, police said. Video from a bomb squad robot showed gun powder, gasoline and motor oil scattered across Holmes' apartment floor. The video also revealed dozens of black spheres with fuses all connected to them and pickle jars filled with liquid and bullets inside of them. The first booby trap was a trip-wire made of fishing line with one end connected to the door jam and the other connected to a thermos, said Richard Orman, senior deputy district attorney for the 18th Judicial District of Colorado. The thermos had a bottle of nearly pure glycerin perched precariously on a frying pan that contained the chemical potassium permanganate. If the glycerin had fallen in, it would have ignited an explosion big enough to blow up the entire apartment, Orman said in 2015 following the release of an FBI report. More than 20 bombs and incendiaries were found in the apartment. On Aug. 7, 2015, more than three years after the shooting, Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Holmes avoided the death penalty because the jury could not come to a unanimous decision. In July 2015, Holmes was found guilty of all charges against him, included two counts of first-degree murder for each of the deceased victims and two counts of attempted murder for reach of the 70 others who were injured but survived. Holmes had admitted to the killings but argued that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorneys pushed for him to be committed to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. State prosecutors sought the death penalty. Holmes was originally from Riverside, California and attended the University of California branch there, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said after the shooting. Neighbors had reported that Holmes lived alone and kept to himself, Oates said. Prior to the massacre, Holmes was an honors students and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado medical center, authorities said. He had a clear arrest record. An acquaintance of Holmes said he did not show any anger or anti-social tendencies in the days before the shooting. ""He seemed kind of geeky,"" said Jackie Mitchell, who lived a block away from Holmes in Aurora. ""We just talked about football ... that kind of thing."" Another neighbor, Kaitlyn Fonzi, who lived directly below Holmes, said she heard loud techno music coming from his apartment the night of the shooting. Psychology experts at the time told ABC News that while it's hard to know what Holmes' state of mind was before the rampage, certain details, such has him referring to himself as ""the Joker,"" suggest that he was a deeply disturbed individual. After the shooting, Holmes' mother and her husband released a statement saying their ""hearts go out to those involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Aurora was the deadliest shooting in the U.S. since Columbine.

Ann Wagner announced on Monday that she would not run against vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill next year, depriving the GOP of a big-name challenger who'd (mostly) given every indication that she wanted to go for it. But Wagner's greatest strength was also one of her greatest flaws: As a former state party chair and RNC committeewoman, Wagner had a proven ability to raise tons of money. That, however, also marked her as consummate insider—and in a GOP primary, that can be a deadly albatross. ​Indeed, we've been flagging that very problem for Wagner ever since November, and since then, it's metastasized from purely theoretical to genuinely threatening as a potential campaign from state Attorney General Josh Hawley began to gather steam. Hawley, a rigid conservative, hasn't ruled out a bid, and he has some influential supporters backing his play. We also know he's ambitious: He's just 37 and was only elected to his current post last fall. He also lacks something else dogging Wagner: a voting record in Congress, which the Washington Examiner's David Drucker reports ""some Republicans"" say has made Hawley ""the preferred recruit"" of the NRSC. But in Republican politics, preferred recruits seldom have a clear path to their party's nomination, and Hawley might discover just that if he runs. That's because Wagner's exit opens the door for all sorts of politicians, not just Hawley. And that door’s already ajar: Shortly after the news broke, Rep. Vicky Hartzler, an anti-gay extremist who represents a big swath of rural west-central Missouri, issued a statement saying that she ""has not ruled [] out"" a bid of her own. Plenty of other Republicans have been mentioned over the course of the year, too, and more may yet surface. Drucker suggests that Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, whose name hadn't previously come up, ""could seed a campaign with a couple of million dollars,"" and indeed, he probably could—his estimated net worth skyrocketed in 2014 (the most recent year disclosures are available) to almost $16 million. It's still eminently possible that Hawley would coast in the primary, but as Drucker notes, he has issues of his own. Hawley ran ads during his race for attorney general attacking ""career politicians just climbing the ladder, using one office to get another,"" something hypothetical opponents could easily flip against him. And as an unnamed GOP strategist observes to Drucker, Hawley's ""never had to prove himself"" but rather has ""this golden-boy glow from afar."" Almost every Missouri Republican seeking statewide office last year won easily, Hawley among them. A more difficult race, whether an intra-party face-off or a general election against the hard-working McCaskill, would test him in a way he's never been tested before. ● VA-Sen: Tim Kaine (D-inc): $2.6 million raised, $7.3 million cash-on-hand ● CA-10: Josh Harder (D): $400,000 raised (since May 5), $370,000 cash-on-hand ● CA-39: Phil Janowicz (D): $180,000 raised (in two months) ● FL-23: Tim Canova (D): $32,000 raised (in two weeks) ● WI-01: Randy Bryce (D): $430,000 raised (in two weeks) ● AZ-Sen: Democratic state Rep. Randy Friese has previously said he was considering challenging Republican Sen. Jeff Flake next year, and he recently told a local NBC affiliate that he would decide by the end of the summer. Although he's just one of many state representatives, Friese was a trauma a surgeon who helped save former Rep. Gabby Giffords' life after the 2011 Tucson mass shooting, so he has an interesting background that could help him stand out. He later ousted a GOP incumbent to win a light-blue state House seat in 2014, so he at least has experience running a contested general election. Although Flake is one of the very few Republican senators facing re-election in 2018 who appears to be vulnerable, Friese is so far the only prominent Democrat who is publicly considering the race. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has long been coy about her intentions despite rampant media speculation about her interest, but she has previously only refused to rule out running. ● ND-Sen: The GOP field to face Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is still taking shape, but another Republican may be eyeing this seat. The local blog Say Anything reports that the state Republican Party is trying to recruit Kathy Neset, an appointed member of the State Board of Higher Education. Neset also runs Neset Consulting Services, which serves the oil industry. Neset told Say Anything that the reports she could run were ""interesting"" but she said nothing else, so she's not ruling anything out. ● CA-Gov: Republicans are reportedly deeply worried about the prospect of an all Democratic gubernatorial top-two general election depressing turnout and wreaking havoc for their party downballot, which is why they had pinned their hopes on San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer running for governor next year. Faulconer has long been vague about his 2018 plans, but he recently stated that he intended to serve out his second term as mayor through the end of 2020, depriving the GOP of their top candidate. The Los Angeles Times recently relayed that Faulconer decided not to run because he didn't think he could win, according to an unnamed state party official. However, Republicans did land a new candidate recently when former Assemblyman David Hadley officially launched his campaign after having previously been in the exploratory phase. Hadley served one term in the Assembly by narrowly defeating a Democratic incumbent in 2014, but he lost their hard-fought rematch in 2016 while still running far ahead of Trump's landslide loss in the 66th Assembly District in southwestern Los Angeles County. Hadley is ostensibly a relative moderate on social issues who publicly opposed Trump in 2016. The Los Angeles Times reports that he also has ties to Republican mega-donor Charles Munger, who spent heavily on Hadley’s unsuccessful re-election battle last year. Hadley says he'll unveil endorsements from 20 of the 38 Republican members of the legislature soon, meaning he could be a strong contender for the GOP, but California remains a very blue state that hasn't elected a Republican to statewide office in over a decade. Unfortunately for Republicans, every additional candidate they have running increases the chances that the party fails to make the top-two runoff next year entirely if they badly split the GOP vote against the much better-known Democratic field, which includes Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and state Treasurer John Chiang. Outspoken conservative Assemblyman Travis Allen and self-funding businessman John Cox are already running for Republicans in addition to Hadley, and all three of Team Red’s noteworthy candidates will nonetheless face an uphill battle to boost their name recognition in this incredibly expensive state. ● IA-Gov: Iowa's Democratic gubernatorial primary just grew a little less crowded after Davenport Alderman Mike Matson suspended his campaign. Although he stopped short of formally dropping out of the race, he doesn't sound likely to resume campaigning. An Army veteran, Matson had struggled to break through in a field that already includes several noteworthy Democrats who are eager to take on newly elevated GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds. The current field consists of former state party chair Andy McGuire, former Tom Vilsack chief of staff John Norris, state Sen. Nate Boulton, state Rep. Todd Prichard, former Des Moines School Board President Jonathan Neiderbach, and labor leader Cathy Glasson. ● KS-Gov: We thought that every single statewide elected Republican in Kansas had already at least talked about running for governor, but in the words of Yoda, ""No. There is another."" Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer recently told the Kansas City Star that he is considering joining the race to succeed termed-out Republican Sam Brownback, but says that he won't decide soon. ● MN-Gov: GOP state House Speaker Kurt Daudt has been flirting with a bid to succeed retiring Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton for a while, and he tells the local CBS affiliate WCCO that he'll decide either by the end of the summer or the early fall. Back in April, Daudt sounded unenthusiastic about a run, and he told WCCO that he had indeed ""kind of decided to myself that I wasn't going to [run]."" Daudt still doesn't sound like he's chomping at the bit to get in, saying ""now I'm back to kind of thinking about it. But I wouldn't say that I'm leaning one way or the other."" However, Daudt also argues that the other GOP candidates aren't catching steam. ● NE-Gov: Ex-Nebraska GOP Gov. Dave Heineman really does not seem to like his successor, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. Heineman, who was termed out in 2014 but is eligible to run again, didn't rule out a primary bid against Ricketts back in September. Last week, Heineman told Lincoln radio host Coby Mach that he thought that ex-Speaker Mike Flood ""would make an outstanding governor."" However, Flood quickly declared that ""Ricketts is a good man, and he'll be re-elected in 2018,"" putting an end to the chatter that Heineman started. Flood, who briefly ran in 2013 before dropping out after his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, also said that Heineman hadn't talked to him first before volunteering him. Heineman himself didn't quite rule out a bid of his own, telling Mach in that same interview that a 2018 bid is ""certainly not my plan. Everybody misconstrued a comment I think I said a long time ago, 'You never say never,' I'm happy with my life right now."" However, Heineman doesn't seem to be in any hurry to actually support Ricketts. After he was asked if he could see himself backing the governor, Heineman replied, ""The governor has had some challenges. He needs to work through those. I'm disappointed we haven't solved the property tax issue here in Nebraska."" While Heineman doesn't appear particularly likely to run himself, we'll see if he continues to shop for a primary challenger. There's certainly little love lost between Heineman and Ricketts. Back in 2014, Heineman endorsed then-Attorney General Jon Bruning in the crowded primary, but the very-wealthy Ricketts narrowly won. It's possible that a challenger capable of standing up to Ricketts money could actually do some damage. The Lincoln Journal Star's Don Walton says that rural interests think that the governor hasn't provided them with enough state property tax credits, and that they may try to get a constitutional amendment on the 2018 general election ballot that would reduce property taxes. However, with Flood out and Heineman looking unlikely to jump in, there may just not be a primary challenger out there who could harness rural anger at Ricketts. Democrats haven't won the governorship since Ben Nelson was decisively re-elected in 1994, of all years, and there hasn't been much talk of giving Ricketts a serious challenge. Walton writes that many Democrats would love to see ex-state Sen. Steve Lathrop run, but that Lathrop seems much more likely to try to return to the legislature. ● IA-03: Democrats have landed another challenger to take on Republican Rep. David Young after real-estate company president Theresa Greenfield announced her candidacy on Wednesday. Greenfield does not appear to have run for office before, and it's unclear if she's capable of any self-funding. However, Iowa Starting Line previously reported that she has extensive ties to the Des Moines business community, which could bolster her fundraising. This Des Moines and Council Bluffs-area district flipped from 51-47 Obama to 49-45 Trump last year, while Young has twice defeated touted Democratic foes. However, Democrats are optimistic that they can compete in this light-red seat next year. Greenfield joins a Democratic field that includes attorney Anna Ryon and business consultant Cynthia Axne, while state Sen. Matt McCoy and political consultant Pete D'Alessandro have previously said they're thinking about running. ● IN-09: Indiana's 9th Congressional District doesn't usually top the list of Democratic offensive targets in 2018, but civil rights attorney Dan Canon announced on Monday that he would run against first-term Republican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth next year. Canon is making his first bid for elected office, and the News and Tribune reports that he was part of the legal team that took the landmark 2015 case legalizing same-sex marriage to the Supreme Court. Republicans drew this seat, which spans from the Louisville suburbs to the Indianapolis suburbs and includes Bloomington, to be safely red. However, Hollingsworth faced ruthless attacks that he was an entitled carpetbagging rich kid after he used his personal wealth and the support of his father's super PAC donations to run for office in 2016 almost immediately after moving to the Hoosier State from Tennessee. Hollingsworth only prevailed 54-40 over a strong Democratic challenger for a then-open seat last year even as Trump won the 9th District by 61-34. However, attacks over carpetbagging could be less potent in 2018 after Hollingsworth has had two years to represent the district, and Canon faces an uphill battle against the 9th's decidedly red lean. ● KY-06: On Saturday, state Sen. Reggie Thomas became the first prominent Democrat to kick off a campaign against Republican Rep. Andy Barr in Kentucky's 6th District, which covers the greater Lexington area. Thomas has represented downtown Lexington since winning his legislative seat in 2013, which is one of the rare few in the entire state Senate that is dark blue at the federal level. If Thomas defeats Barr, he would become the first African American to represent Kentucky in Congress. The 6th District favored Trump 55-39 and Mitt Romney by 56-42, while Barr easily dispatched an unheralded Democratic challenger in 2016 to win his third term. However, the 6th has a history of being more hospitable to state Democrats downballot, and Lexington Mayor Jim Gray managed to carry the seat 52-48 even as he was losing his Senate race 57-43 statewide last year. Gray has previously said he's considering running against Barr, as has Colmon Elridge, who is a former aide to ex-Gov. Steve Beshear. Meanwhile, retired Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath formed an exploratory committee last month while she considers a campaign. ● MA-07: Last week, the Boston Globe reported that Cambridge City Councilor Nadeem Mazen was planning to challenge Rep. Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for this safely blue Boston-area seat. Mazen himself ruled nothing out and has yet to announce he's in, but he wasted little time setting up a campaign account with the FEC that will allow him to raise money. As we noted last week, Mazen has a very tough task ahead of him if he wants to give Capuano a tough challenge. ● NC-09: Mark Harris, who came within one point of beating Rep. Robert Pittenger in the Republican primary last year for North Carolina's 9th District, previously stepped down as pastor of his church while he considers a rematch for next year's primary. He recently filed the paperwork to create a campaign committee, although Harris still has not yet formally announced whether he is indeed running again for this 54-43 Trump seat. While Harris could have some residual support from the 9th's large bloc of religious-conservative primary voters, he might find it harder to challenge Pittenger next year if he runs again. Harris benefitted immensely from the 9th being dramatically altered in last year's court-ordered redistricting, which left Pittenger with a roughly 60 percent new district that stretched from south Charlotte to Fayetteville. Pittenger will have had two more years to establish himself in the redrawn seat by 2018. Furthermore, the FBI and IRS recently dropped their investigation without any charges related to Pittenger's old real estate company over loans he made to his 2012 congressional campaign. ● NE-01: Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry has held Nebraska's 1st District with ease since his initial 2004 election, but in late June, former longtime University of Nebraska Regent Chuck Hassebrook said that he was considering challenging Fortenberry next year. Hassebrook was the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee and lost 57-39 statewide for an open seat against GOP now-Gov. Pete Ricketts in that midterm year's GOP wave. However, he did perform much better than either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama in the counties that make up the 1st District, which includes the state capital of Lincoln and much of eastern Nebraska outside of Omaha. The 1st District backed Trump 57-36, and Fortenberry doesn't look particularly vulnerable so far. However, Hassebrook surprisingly is not the only former Democratic gubernatorial nominee who has expressed interest in challenging the incumbent. Attorney Bill Hoppner, who was Team Blue's 1998 gubernatorial candidate, said shortly after the House passed Trumpcare that he might run against Fortenberry. ● NM-02: Republican Rep. Steve Pearce has held the 2nd District without much trouble since regaining it in the 2010 Republican wave election, but Democrat Tony Martinez recently kicked off his campaign for this southern New Mexico seat. Martinez is an Army veteran and was formerly a senior vice president for pharmaceutical company Endo, and does not appear to have previously run for office before. A member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, Pearce's ultra-conservative views have made him a boogeyman for New Mexico Democrats, but he won't be easy to defeat in this 50-40 Trump and 52-45 Romney district. However, the 2nd's large Latino population could be a particular asset for Martinez as he hopes to capitalize on a potential downballot backlash to Trump in 2018. It's also possible that Pearce might not even run for re-election here, since he said back in May that he was considering running for the open governor's office next year. ● NY-21: On Tuesday, businesswoman Tedra Cobb, a Democrat who served eight years in the St. Lawrence County Legislature until 2010, announced that she would challenge GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik. Cobb, who runs a local business development company, has a tough task ahead of her in this rural upstate seat, which includes the North Country in the northernmost part of the state. While Obama won this ancestrally red district 52-46, Trump carried it 54-40. ● OK-02: Back in 2012, Republican Markwayne Mullin promised to only serve three terms in this conservative eastern Oklahoma seat, a pledge he discarded on Monday when he announced that he would seek a fourth term. Mullin insisted that in 2012, he was worried what effects a long tenure in Congress would have on his business and his family, but now he’s seen the light and realizes he can in fact make a difference in D.C.! It’s like the plot of that classic film Mr. Smith Stays in Washington. Mullin’s move didn’t exactly come out of nowhere, though. In 2016, he said that while his position on leaving after three terms hadn’t changed, he would “continue to seek the Lord's guidance and do what is best for our family and the 2nd District of Oklahoma. The only election I am focused on right now is in 2016.” Ex-Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican who represented this seat in the 1990s, was not happy with Mullin backing away from his term limits pledge, and Coburn endorsed Army veteran Jarrin Jackson in the primary; Mullin ended up beating Jackson 63-37. This year, Mullin dismissed the fact that taxpayers pay for his $174,000 congressional salary as “bullcrap,” declaring, “I pay for myself. I pay enough taxes where before I ever got there, and continue to for my company and pay my own salary.” And Mullin may get more of that sweet $174,000 salary from all of us in the years to come. Mullin is far from the first politician to keep running past their voluntarily expiration date, and most of the time, voters don’t care enough to fire the incumbent over term limits. Still, Mullin’s primary win over Jackson was hardly impressive, and a stronger opponent may be able to give him more trouble. Trump won this seat 73-23, and while conservative Democrats used to do well here, it’s unlikely Team Blue will make a serious play for it no matter how the primary goes. ● PA-07: Over the weekend, Democratic state Sen. Daylin Leach announced that he would challenge GOP incumbent Pat Meehan in this competitive suburban Philadelphia seat. Leach ran for the neighboring 13th District in 2014 and he raised a credible amount of money. However, Leach ended up taking third place with 17 percent of the vote in the four-way primary, losing to eventual winner Brendan Boyle. Leach actually lives in Meehan's 7th District and represents about 17 percent of the seat in the legislature. Still, Leach hails from Montgomery County, which makes up a little less than 20 percent of the seat, rather than Delaware County, where a little more than half of the 7th's residents live. Leach also has a reputation as an outspoken liberal, and he hasn't been remotely shy about picking fights with Trump, with him tweeting in February, ""Hey @realDonaldTrump I oppose civil asset forfeiture too! Why don't you try to destroy my career you fascist, loofa-faced, shit-gibbon!"" Leach's very anti-Trump attitude could be a big asset in a primary and help him raise money from Trump-hating donors nationwide. However, Meehan loves to portray himself as a moderate, and if he faces Leach, he may be able to win over swing voters by depicting the contest as a battle between a centrist and a loud liberal. A few other Democrats are seeking this seat, which flipped from 50-49 Romney to 49-47 Clinton. ● TN-06: GOP Rep. Diane Black is likely to give up this very red suburban Nashville seat to run for governor (though as Missouri's Ann Wagner once again reminded us, sometimes likely candidates don't become actual candidates), and one local GOP legislator is already trying to replace her. State Rep. Judd Matheny announced on Friday that he would run for this seat ""no matter what"" Black does. Matheny has served in the state House since the 2002 elections, and he went on to become speaker pro tempore. Matheny attracted attention in 2011 when he tried to ban the practice of Islamic religious law in Tennessee. Matheny, who has defied GOP leaders before, mulled a 2012 challenge to Speaker Beth Harwell but decided to instead run for speaker pro tempore again, a post he lost to another Republican. Two years later, Matheny drove his car into a flower shop, though he luckily injured no one; Matheny said that his dog had jumped into the front seat, and Matheny tried to brake but mistakenly instead hit the gas. ● TX-23, TX-Gov: On Tuesday, ex-Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego set up an exploratory committee with the FEC, though he has yet to announce he's in. Gallego narrowly lost this seat, which stretches from the outskirts of El Paso to San Antonio, to Republican Will Hurd in 2014; in 2016, Gallego lost his comeback campaign 48-47 as Clinton was carrying this district 50-46. Back in May, Gallego said he was interested in running again especially if this seat gets redrawn, and he may be in luck. Earlier in 2017, a federal district court panel ruled that the GOP's 2011 congressional and state House maps were intentionally discriminatory against black and Latino voters, and there will be an expedited trial over the maps this month. Another local Democrat who had made noises about a House bid, however, seems to be turning his attention elsewhere. Four months ago, ex-state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said he was interested, though he also said he could run for the safely blue 20th District if incumbent Joaquin Castro ran for the Senate. Well, Castro decided to stay put, and the San Antonio News-Express recently noted that Martinez Fischer's name was being dropped for a possible gubernatorial bid against GOP incumbent Greg Abbott. Martinez Fischer told the paper that while a campaign against Abbott is ""a conversation that I'm not entertaining at this time,"" ""one thing is pretty clear: Republicans sure have a way of bringing me out of retirement."" It's going to be incredibly tough for anyone to unseat the governor, and as we noted in March, Martinez Fischer may not be the best person to try to appeal to swing voters. ● VA-02: Last cycle, Democrats ended up fielding only a little-known perennial candidate in this Hampton Roads district, and Republican Scott Taylor unsurprisingly won the open seat 61-38, running far ahead of Trump's 49-45 margin. On Wednesday, retired Air Force Colonel Dave Belote, the chair of the Virginia Beach Democratic Party, announced that he would run. Belote ran for an open state Senate seat in 2015 in SD-08, a Virginia Beach seat that Romney won 53-46, and that Trump would carry 51-43 the next year. Democrats didn't seriously target the race and Belote lost 59-41, though he raised a credible $400,000. Belote also was on Jeopardy! six times in 2009 when he was serving in the Air Force, and he ended up walking away with just shy of $135,000. This seat, which includes all of Virginia Beach and the Virginia portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, as well as Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, is an important one, and not just because it's home to many high school American history test answers. If you sort all 435 House seats by Donald Trump's margin of victory over Hillary Clinton, Virginia's 2nd falls right in the middle. This one seat likely won't be the seat that determines who controls the House, but Democrats need to win light red seats like VA-02 to win back the speaker's gavel. ● WV-03: Another Democrat has jumped in the race for this open southern West Virginia district, an ancestrally blue seat that has turned against national Democrats in recent years. Paul Davis, the CEO Tri-State Transit Authority, which is the city of Huntington's bus system, tells the local NBC affiliate that he's in. Davis joins state Sen. Richard Ojeda in the primary for this 73-23 Trump constituency. On the GOP side, state party chair Conrad Lucas says he'll decide after his wedding this month. Ex-Del. Rick Snuffer, who was the 2012 nominee, and Del. Rupie Phillips, a Democrat-turned independent-turned Republican, are already running for Team Red.

President Donald Trump said he would be different — the first Republican president to embrace LGBTQ people. He said the key acronym (“L, G, B, T … Q”) at the 2016 Republican convention. He held up a pride flag at a campaign event. He initially defended the right of Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, to use the bathroom that aligns with her gender identity. He tweeted, “Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.” And hey, Trump is from liberal New York — so how anti-LGBTQ can he be, really? Yet six months into his administration, Trump has repeatedly proven his LGBTQ-friendly attitude was a farce. While Trump is arguably a small step up from past Republicans, he is still very much against even basic LGBTQ rights. On Wednesday, Trump announced he will reinstate a ban on trans military service. On that same day, his Department of Justice also filed a legal brief at a federal appeals court arguing that anti-gay discrimination is legal under federal law. Before that, his administration pulled back an Obama-era guidance that protected trans kids from discrimination in public schools, he appointed a Supreme Court justice who opposes LGBTQ rights, and he even failed to recognize Pride Month. All of this comes at a pivotal time for LGBTQ rights. While the US has made enormous strides over the past few years toward LGBTQ equality, there are many issues LGBTQ Americans still face — from basic rights in the workplace to which bathrooms trans people are allowed to use. That’s why many advocates have emphasized that, while the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and legalization of same-sex marriage were big wins, they were supposed to be the beginning of a new era in equal rights. Trump poses a threat to that new era. While LGBTQ rights haven’t been a big focus of his administration, what he has done has by and large pulled back the gains of the past several years — and he’s poised to do much more in the years to come. Let’s get the one bit of good news out of the way first: Trump did make one LGBTQ-friendly move early on in his administration when he decided to maintain workplace protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for federal employees and contractors. (Though it would have been unprecedented to pull back these protections — even President George W. Bush, a major opponent of LGBTQ rights, maintained President Bill Clinton’s executive order that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal workforce.) Besides that, though, Trump has only provided loss after loss for LGBTQ rights. For one, the administration is largely made up of politicians who have been staunchly anti-LGBTQ for their whole public careers, like Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Pence in particular is an unquestionable opponent of LGBTQ rights. In Congress, Pence rejected workplace protections for LGBTQ people and opposed the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell.” In 2006, he said that being gay is a choice, that preventing same-sex marriage is “God’s idea,” and that same-sex couples signaled a “societal collapse [that] was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.” And in 2015, he triggered a big battle over whether businesses should be allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ people when, as governor of Indiana, he signed a “religious freedom” law that critics feared could be used to justify discrimination. In terms of policy, Trump and his administration have now taken several steps to pull back LGBTQ rights. Here are a few examples: This doesn’t include some of the smaller issues, such as Trump’s refusal to acknowledge June as Pride Month (although he did acknowledge it as National Homeowners Month). Trump also seems ready to go even further. He has said, for example, that he would support the First Amendment Defense Act, which would allow discrimination against LGBTQ people on a religious basis. And there have long been rumors — although they have yet to be substantiated — that Trump will sign a “religious freedom” order that will allow anti-LGBTQ discrimination. When you put it all together, it’s clear where the administration truly stands on this issue. Although it didn’t regress on some fronts (protections for the federal workforce), it overall represents a huge step back on LGBTQ rights from the Obama administration. It may be easy to see the massive progress of the past few years — particularly the momentous victory of same-sex marriage — and wonder what is left to be done when it comes to LGBTQ rights. But there are still a lot of issues left to address. Consider: We are just a little more than a year removed from the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida — not only the deadliest shooting in US history, but also one that explicitly targeted LGBTQ people. And if the shooting had happened just a few hundred miles north in Alabama or Georgia, it would not have been recognized as a hate crime under state law. It’d be recognized as a hate crime under federal law, but states maintain different laws to direct their own law enforcement agencies — and 20 don’t have such protections for any LGBTQ people.  We see this kind of patchwork at the state level with other laws relevant to LGBTQ people. For example, the federal government and most state laws explicitly prohibit discrimination in the workplace, housing, public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public), and schools based on race, sex (except public accommodations at the federal level), and other protected groups. But sexual orientation and gender identity aren’t explicitly included in federal or most state laws. So in most states, it’s legal under local and state law to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace, housing, public accommodations, and schools. That means an employer can legally fire someone because he’s gay, a landlord can legally evict someone because she’s lesbian, and a hotel manager can legally deny service to someone who’s transgender — for no reason other than the person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  In recent years, the battle over nondiscrimination protections has been held back by the bathroom myth. The argument, in short, is that if trans people are allowed to use the bathroom for their gender identity, either trans women or men who pose as trans women will sexually assault or harass women in bathrooms. There is zero evidence for this, as I have repeatedly explained. But the myth has been used to bar trans people from using the bathroom for their gender identity, with several states passing laws or considering bills to that effect. Gavin Grimm, a trans teenager who’s sued his school for access to the right bathroom, best captured why these anti-trans policies are a problem: “This wasn’t just about bathrooms. It was about the right to exist in public spaces for trans people,” he told me, quoting trans actress Laverne Cox. “Without the access to appropriate bathrooms, there’s so much that you’re limited in doing. If you try to imagine what your day would be like if you had absolutely no restrooms to use other than the home, it would take planning. You would probably find yourself avoiding liquids, probably avoiding eating, maybe [avoiding] going out in public for too long at a time.” This covers just a few of the many lingering issues in LGBTQ rights. There are also the unique challenges LGBTQ people face in the criminal justice system, LGBTQ youth homelessness, health issues like HIV/AIDS, and the extreme threat of deportation for undocumented immigrants fleeing anti-LGBTQ persecution. Simply put, there is a lot to be done — and Trump doesn’t seem interested in doing it. Trump poses a threat to LGBTQ rights not just by stalling any potential gains on all of these fronts, but also by taking his own actions to pulling back LGBTQ rights. That has offered activists a powerful reminder that, despite the progress of the past few years, nothing should be taken for granted — it only takes one bad election to threaten it. After all, the impact Trump will have on LGBTQ rights can only grow from here. Will he appoint another Supreme Court justice who won’t uphold LGBTQ rights — right as the court may soon consider whether workplace protections are covered by federal law? Will he encourage Congress to pass religious freedom measures that effectively allow discrimination against LGBTQ people? Will other actions he takes, such as an increase in deportations, disproportionately hurt LGBTQ people — by, for example, sending immigrants back to countries where they are persecuted for their identities? Trump suggested it wouldn’t be this way, painting himself as a uniquely friendly figure to LGBTQ people on the campaign trail. That is proving to be false. But more than just showing Trump’s dishonesty, this potentially threatens the rights of millions of LGBTQ Americans just trying to get through their lives.

Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for June 25 through July 1 is “Shoot-Up-Able,” the sixth episode of the third season of NBC’s The Carmichael Show. On the day The Carmichael Show’s episode about a mass shooting was originally set to air, two very real mass shootings unfolded at a Congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, and a UPS facility in San Francisco, California. NBC responded by pulling “Shoot-Up-Able” from its evening lineup to give the episode some space from the news — a move that series co-creator and star Jerrod Carmichael publicly disagreed with, saying that delaying the episode did “a disservice” to NBC’s audience. What he really wanted the episode to be, Carmichael insisted, was an “opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way, to really lend itself to conversation.” Now that I’ve actually seen the episode — which NBC finally aired on June 28, before outright canceling the show on June 30 — I can confirm that Carmichael was absolutely right. Related Written by Aeysha Carr, “Shoot-Up-Able” isn’t exploitative of tragedy, nor preachy in an after-school special kind of way. In fact, it doesn’t show any of the actual mall shooting that main character Jerrod (Carmichael) lives through, instead focusing on the quiet aftermath of a single person trying to process the fact that he lived through a really awful thing. It’s grounded and frank, thoughtful and smart. It lets The Carmichael Show’s characters not only process a horrifying event that’s nonetheless become an everyday occurrence, but question what that means. “Shoot-Up-Able” takes a tricky premise and turns it into comedy that’s insightful, considerate, and, yes, funny. It’s everything The Carmichael Show — a sharp multi-camera sitcom — has become so good at in three seasons of taking on fraught social issues. Even if it didn’t air in a week when it might have been sorely needed, “Shoot-Up-Able” will no doubt inspire necessary conversations among those who see it. Before I started watching “Shoot-Up-Able,” I wondered how the episode could possibly dive into the repercussions of a mass shooting while still remaining funny — but my question was answered immediately. Jerrod walks into his apartment to find his girlfriend Maxine (Amber Stevens West) bopping around and belting out a song. He sits down, listens, and even claps for her before she asks how his day was, and he drops the news that he’s just survived a mass shooting at the mall. “Three people are dead,” he says to her with a blank smile. As Maxine’s face falls through the floor, Jerrod tries to start up the song again so they can both go about their business. He survived, didn’t he? He’s fine. Except he’s clearly not fine; he just doesn’t want to talk about it. Jerrod says he would love to forget the shooting ever happened, and spends most of the rest of the episode brushing off the concerns of Maxine, his parents (David Alan Grier and Loretta Devine), and brother (LilRel Howrey). “These things happen, okay?” Jerrod says in response to Maxine’s horror. “Unfortunately, this is the society we live in. Some places are just shoot-up-able.” And as everyone tries to convince him that what he went through is a big deal and that there’s no shame in admitting as much, each has their own distinct reactions. Maxine keeps trying to get him to open up; Cynthia (Devine) thanks God for letting her favorite son escape; Joe (Grier) insists the incident will build character; and Bobby (Howrey) posts the news on Instagram in a bid for sympathy by proxy. (“Near death experiences get you the most likes on social media!” he exclaims.) At one point, Bobby’s ex Nekeisha (Tiffany Haddish) even bursts in to cackle that Jerrod’s finally “popped [his] shootout cherry,” so hey, welcome to the club! In true Carmichael Show fashion, no one comes out looking particularly right or wrong. As Bobby tallies his Instagram likes, Maxine gets off on Jerrod’s uncharacteristic vulnerability and Joe blames him for going to such a “shoot-up-able” place as the mall at 2:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon, because everyone knows “that's ISIS happy hour!"" Even though they’re all supportive and worried — and make no mistake, they absolutely are — they’re all still recognizably real people grappling to make sense of something so awful happening to someone they love. When a police officer comes around to ask Jerrod for his eyewitness account, Jerrod is forced to acknowledge the fact that running from a mass shooter when he was just trying to buy a food court pretzel might have been legitimately traumatizing. He tells the story he’s been trying so hard to gloss right over, with everyone in the room tearing up as it becomes clear that Jerrod truly did experience a very narrow scrape with death. (Credit where it’s due here to Grier, Devine, and Carmichael in particular for making this scene as much of a gut punch as it needs to be.) By the time the cop leaves, Jerrod is very obviously far more shaken up than he wanted to be. “Acknowledging the reality of your feelings is incredibly hard,” Maxine tells him gently, “but it's the first step to healing."" “How is that possibly a good thing?” Jerrod chokes out, helpless and furious. “I mean, all that proves is that I have no control over my life whatsoever. It just proves that life is this endless cycle of death. It just proves that one day you can be standing in line for a salted pretzel, and the next you can be choking on your own blood. Why feel anything? Does anything even matter?"" That’s when something completely remarkable happens: No one attempts, or knows quite how, to say anything reassuring in response. Jerrod is hurt, and angry, and confused, and his family and friends don’t have any idea what to say, or how to begin comforting him. The truth of the matter is that this kind of thing truly does happen all the time in America, and there’s usually no way to predict it. Telling Jerrod otherwise would be a lie, and they all know it. To emphasize how bold a move this is for the show to pull: The Carmichael Show is a multi-camera sitcom that’s taped in front of a live studio audience and airs on a broadcast network, not cable. Even though multi-cam sitcoms have always tackled controversial, political issues, they generally still try to wrap each episode in some kind of conclusive way, the better to move onto the next week’s episode without having to bear the weight of unresolved issues. But “Shoot-Up-Able” doesn’t bother. Instead, the episode emphasizes that what Jerrod went through is messed up, that there’s no guarantee it won’t happen again, and that it’ll take real time for him to work his way through how he’s feeling. It acknowledges that life is messy, and hard, and unfair — and then it ends. But even if “Shoot-Up-Able” has no real answers for Jerrod or its audience, it creates a space for both to process Jerrod’s experience. It’s bold, but more importantly, compassionate. Even if we don’t come away from “Shoot-Up-Able” feeling better about the terrifying randomness of gun violence and mass shootings, we can at least know we’re not alone in nursing very real fear surrounding those issues, admit that it’s fucked up that “these things happen,” and find a real way to talk about them rather than delaying the conversation for another day.

201,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/10/americas-future-is-texas,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories With right-wing zealots taking over the legislature even as the state’s demographics shift leftward, Texas has become the nation’s bellwether. By Lawrence Wright When Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Texas, in 1853, he became besotted with the majesty of the Texas legislature. “I have seen several similar bodies at the North; the Federal Congress; and the Parliament of Great Britain, in both its branches, on occasions of great moment; but none of them commanded my involuntary respect for their simple manly dignity and trustworthiness for the duties that engaged them, more than the General Assembly of Texas,” he wrote. This passage is possibly unique in the political chronicles of the state. Fairly considered, the Texas legislature is more functional than the United States Congress, and more genteel than the House of Commons. But a recurrent crop of crackpots and ideologues has fed the state’s reputation for aggressive know-nothingism and proudly retrograde politics. I’ve lived in Texas for most of my life, and I’ve come to appreciate what the state symbolizes, both to people who live here and to those who view it from afar. Texans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free. Outsiders see us as the nation’s id, a place where rambunctious and disavowed impulses run wild. Texans, it is thought, mindlessly celebrate individualism, and view government as a kind of kryptonite that weakens the entrepreneurial muscles. We’re reputed to be braggarts; careless with money and our personal lives; a little gullible, but dangerous if crossed; insecure, but obsessed with power and prestige. Texans, however, are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of NPR. It is progressive, blue, reasonable, secular, and smug—almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland. It’s endless bluster and endless ads. Paranoia and piety are the main items on the menu. Texas has been growing at a stupefying rate for decades. The only state with more residents is California, and the number of Texans is projected to double by 2050, to 54.4 million, almost as many people as in California and New York combined. Three Texas cities—Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio—are already among the top ten most populous in the country. The eleventh largest is Austin, the capital, where I live. For the past five years, it has been one of the fastest-growing large cities in America; it now has nearly a million people, dwarfing the college town I fell in love with almost forty years ago. Because Texas represents so much of modern America—the South, the West, the plains, the border, the Latino community, the divide between rural areas and cities—what happens here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation. Illinois and New Jersey may be more corrupt, and Kansas and Louisiana more out of whack, but they don’t bear the responsibility of being the future. I’ve always had a fascination with Texas’s outsized politics. In 2000, I wrote a play that was set in the state’s House of Representatives. The protagonist, Sonny Lamb, was a rancher from West Texas who represented House District 74, which, in real life, stretches across thirty-seven thousand square miles. (That’s larger than Indiana.) While I was doing research for the play, I met in Austin with Pete Laney, a Democrat and a cotton farmer from Hale County, who, at the time, was the speaker of the House. Laney was known as a scrupulously fair and honest leader who inspired a bipartisan spirit among the members. The grateful representatives called him Dicknose. We sat down in the Speaker’s office, at the capitol. I explained that I was having a plot problem: my hero had introduced an ethics-reform bill, which triggered a war with the biggest lobbyist in the state. How could the lobbyist retaliate? Laney rubbed his hands together. “Well, you could put a toxic-waste dump in Sonny’s district,” he observed. “That would mess him up, right and left.” Laney’s suggestion was inspired by an actual law that the Texas House of Representatives had passed in 1991. It allowed sewage sludge from New York City to be shipped, by train, to a little desert town in District 74, Sierra Blanca, which is eighty miles southeast of El Paso. The train became known as the Poo-Poo Choo-Choo. “Another thing,” I said. “I’d like my lobbyist to take some legislators on a hunting trip. What would they likely be hunting?” “Pigs,” Laney said. “Pigs?” “Wild pigs—they’re taking over the whole state!” Laney said. Feral pigs are a remnant of the Spanish colonization, and now we’ve got as many as three million of them, tearing up fences and pastureland and mowing down crops, even eating the seed corn out of the ground before it sprouts. They can run twenty-five miles per hour. “You ever seen one?” Laney went on. “Huge. They got these tusks out to here.” “How do you hunt them?” “Well, I don’t hunt ’em myself, but I got a friend who does.” He punched an intercom button on his phone. “Honey, get Sharp on the line,” he said. In a moment, John Sharp was on the loudspeaker. The former state comptroller of public accounts, he is now the chancellor of the Texas A. & M. system. “Sharp,” Laney said, “I got a young man here wants to know how you hunt pigs.” “Oh!” Sharp cried. “Well, we do it at night, with pistols. Everybody wearing cutoffs and tennis shoes. We’ll set the dogs loose, and when they start baying we come running. Now, the dogs will go after the pig’s nuts, so the pig will back up against a tree to protect himself. So then you just take your pistol and pop him in the eye.” And these were progressive Democrats. More or less. For more than a century, Texas was under Democratic rule. The state was always culturally conservative, religious, and militaristic, but a strain of pragmatism kept it from being fully swept up in racism and right-wing ideology. Economic populism, especially in the rural areas, offered a counterweight to the capitalists in the cities. But in the nineteen-seventies the state began shifting rightward. Bill Miller, a lobbyist in Austin and a longtime student of Texas politics, dates the change to May, 1976, when Ronald Reagan beat Gerald Ford in the Texas Republican primary. “Reagan won every Texas delegate and the popular vote two to one,” Miller told me. “He smoked an incumbent Republican President and his mainstream followers with a heretofore unknown coalition of conservatives. That day lit the conservative fuse. Suddenly, they knew they had the numbers to win.” Ford went on to gain the nomination, but he lost the Presidency to Jimmy Carter—the last Democratic nominee to carry Texas. In 1978, Bill Clements became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. To help him reach constituents, Clements hired a young direct-mail wizard named Karl Rove, who became a central figure in Texas’s transformation from blue to red. Rove attributes the change to the growth of the suburbs and the gradual movement of the rural areas into the Republican column: “They went from being economic populists, who thought the system was rigged against them by Wall Street, to being social and conservative populists, who thought that government was the problem.” Moderate and conservative Democratic politicians followed the voters to the Republican Party. Rick Perry, for one, served three terms in the Texas House as a Democrat, and even campaigned for Al Gore in his 1988 Presidential run, before changing parties, in 1989. In 1994, Texas elected its last statewide Democrat. “It was a complete rout of a political party,” Miller said. While George W. Bush was governor, between 1995 and 2000, a cordial détente between the political parties prevailed. The lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, and Speaker Laney were both Democrats, and, when Bush ran for President, they became exhibits in his argument that he would be a bipartisan leader. Like Lyndon Johnson, Bullock had a huge, battered face and an unbridled love of Texas, which allowed him to see past the barriers of party loyalties. (His legend was only enhanced by his ruinous personal life: alcoholism, cancer, chronic depression, five marriages.) At Bush’s fiftieth-birthday party, at the governor’s mansion, in July, 1996, Bullock offered a toast to the Governor as “the next President of the United States.” As far as I know, that was the first time such a statement had been made about Bush in public, and it was by the highest Democratic official in the state. In January, 2003, the Republicans finally took over the Texas legislature, and Laney lost the speakership to Tom Craddick, an ultraconservative Republican from Midland, the oil capital. More than anyone, Craddick was responsible for securing a Republican majority in the House, through clever fund-raising and indefatigable campaigning. “There were eight other Republicans in the House when I got elected, in 1969, and two in the Senate,” Craddick told me recently. “The first time I tried to introduce a bill, they told me I couldn’t, because I was a Republican.” When he entered the House, he was twenty-five—the youngest member. “Back then, most of the other members were retired, and they ran for office as a civic duty,” he said. Now, at seventy-three, he is the longest-serving legislator in Texas history. Craddick is slight and white-haired, wry and friendly, with a slur in his speech and a shuffle in his step. He’s easy to miss in the crowd of vigorous young legislators, few of whom were in office when Craddick turned the House into a Republican domain. His crusade started in the late eighties, he recalled. Initially, the Party had barely any infrastructure, and so he helped to organize candidates’ campaigns, requiring them to report how many doors they had knocked on and how many mailers they had sent out. Craddick was the first Republican speaker since 1873. With his election to the post, the coup was complete. “But it wasn’t just about winning elections,” he told me. “We had a redistricting plan.” In the 2002 elections, fifty-six per cent of Texans who voted for a U.S. representative chose a Republican, but Democrats nevertheless held more seats in the U.S. House—seventeen seats to the Republicans’ fifteen. Craddick worked with Congressman Tom DeLay, who was then the Majority Whip, to put into motion a sweeping plan to create a permanent Republican majority in the U.S. House. Under Craddick’s leadership, the Texas legislature began carving historical congressional districts into new fiefdoms. Taking care not to violate Supreme Court guidelines on minority representation, lawmakers jigsawed Texas into shapes that would decisively capture the state for the right. In May, 2003, the redistricting plan came up for a vote in the Texas House. Fifty-three Democrats, sensing a lethal threat to their party, fled to Oklahoma, denying Craddick a quorum. He locked the capitol chamber, to prevent any more defections, and called out state troopers to hunt down the missing members, who became known as the Killer Ds. In the midst of this hubbub, Pete Laney, the former speaker, flew his Piper turboprop from the Panhandle to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where he joined his Democratic colleagues at the local Holiday Inn. Someone from DeLay’s office obtained Laney’s flight plan from the Department of Homeland Security by implying that Laney’s plane was overdue to land and might have crashed or been seized by terrorists. Texas troopers and national reporters swarmed into Ardmore. The Democratic faction remained in Oklahoma for four days, until the deadline for considering new legislation had passed. The governor, Rick Perry—by then a stalwart Republican—called a special session for late June, whereupon eleven Democratic state senators decamped to New Mexico. It took two more special sessions to ram the vote through. The redistricting had a revolutionary effect. Today, the Texas delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives includes twenty-five Republicans and eleven Democrats—a far more conservative profile than the political demography of the state. The Austin metropolitan area, the heart of the Texas left, was divvied up into six congressional districts, with city residents a minority in each. All but one of these districts are now held by Republicans. I’m currently represented by Roger Williams, a conservative automobile dealer from Weatherford, two hundred miles north of Austin. Another Republican congressman, Lamar Smith, lives in San Antonio, but his district includes—and neutralizes—the liberal area surrounding the University of Texas at Austin. Smith, a member of the Tea Party Caucus, in Washington, denies that human activity affects global warming. He heads the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which oversees NASA, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Lloyd Doggett is the only Democrat representing the Austin area, and his district runs along I-35, from East Austin to East San Antonio, scooping up as many Democrats as possible in one basket. Texas’s redistricting process has since been replicated in statehouses around the country, creating congressional districts that are practically immune to challenge and giving Republicans an impregnable edge in Washington. “Texas became a model for how to get control,” Craddick told me. In 2005, DeLay was prosecuted for money laundering and conspiracy, in connection with the illegal use of corporate funds. Craddick was also questioned, but he was never indicted. DeLay’s conviction was overturned on appeal, in 2013, but by then he had resigned from Congress and made an unexpected appearance on “Dancing with the Stars.” The show has become a pathway to redemption for disgraced Texas politicos. In 2014, Rick Perry was indicted for abusing gubernatorial power, after he threatened to defund an anti-corruption agency. He was later cleared, and he, too, celebrated his comeback on “Dancing with the Stars.” Now he heads the Department of Energy. I wonder if Ted Cruz can dance. Texas has always had a burlesque side to its politics. The columnist Molly Ivins made a national reputation as a humor writer by lampooning the people we elect to office. One of my favorites in this category was Mike Martin, a state representative from Longview. In 1981, someone shotgunned the trailer he lived in during his months in Austin. Martin was inside, and was slightly injured. He declared that the shooting was in reprisal for an investigation he was pursuing involving a satanic cult. Later, his cousin admitted that he had fired the weapon at Martin’s behest, ostensibly to gain Martin sympathy votes. (Martin was running for reëlection.) Martin fled Austin, but, as Ivins noted, the police “tracked him to earth at his momma’s house, where he was found hiding in the stereo cabinet.” She added, “He always did want to be the Speaker.” Ivins, who died in 2007, would have loved writing about Mary Lou Bruner, a seventy-year-old retired schoolteacher from Mineola, who last year ran as a Republican for an open seat on the Texas State Board of Education—a frequent battleground of the culture wars. Because ten per cent of American public-school students live in Texas, the state exerts a great influence on the textbook-publishing industry. During her campaign, Bruner posted on Facebook that Barack Obama had worked as a male prostitute in his twenties. “That is how he paid for his drugs,” she reasoned. Bruner went on to assert that climate change is a “ridiculous hoax,” and that dinosaurs are extinct because the ones on Noah’s Ark were too young to reproduce. Somehow, she made it to a runoff, which she then lost. In March, 2016, a man named Robert Morrow was elected the Republican Party chairman of Travis County, which contains Austin. Like many reporters in Texas, I received wild e-mails from Morrow for several years. He once claimed that George H. W. Bush was “a seriously addicted homosexual pedophile” who was also involved in a C.I.A. drug-smuggling ring with the Clintons. In 2011, Morrow took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper: HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH RICK PERRY? Are you a stripper, an escort, or just a “young hottie” impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas? Nothing came of the ad, which, Morrow said, was designed to expose Perry as “a Christian-buzzwords-spouting, ‘family values’ hypocrite and fraud.” Morrow, a fifty-three-year-old Princeton graduate with an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, describes himself as an independent investor. In 2015, he wrote a book with Roger Stone, the political operative and occasional adviser to Donald Trump, called “The Clintons’ War on Women.” The Austin American-Statesman noted that it appeared “to be serving as a playbook for Trump” in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. (Upon its publication, Trump tweeted, “The latest book on Hillary—Wow, a really tough one!”) Mainstream Party officials were mortified when Morrow won the Travis County election, with fifty-six per cent of the vote. They promised to “explore every single option that exists” to remove him from office. Morrow responded, “They can go fuck themselves.” In June, he tweeted, “Top priority for Travis GOP: beautiful Big Titty women!!” Texas Republicans were having an unhappy time of it in 2016. Rick Perry, who retired from the governorship the previous year, was K.O.’d early in the Presidential primaries, and Senator Ted Cruz, probably the most unpopular politician in Washington, was eventually overmatched by Trump. Compounding the embarrassment, Morrow announced that he was running for President himself. This turned out to be against the rules for the Travis County chairman. At a meeting held in August, the Party deposed him. Morrow, who was present at the meeting, wearing a floppy motley-fool hat, did not object. That month, Trump campaigned in Austin, and Morrow, who had not endorsed a candidate besides himself, protested his party’s nominee by carrying a giant red sign that said “TRUMP IS A CHILD RAPIST.” Roger Stone, who was present at Trump’s campaign event, claimed that he had the police escort his co-author away from the rally. To add to the insult, Stone tweeted that Morrow was a “Clinton quisling.” The Texas capitol, constructed of red granite, was completed in 1888. The state was destitute then, and paid for the building with three million acres of public land in the Panhandle—about the size of Connecticut. At the time, the capitol was said to be the seventh-largest building in the world, and, as one would expect, it is somewhat taller than its uncle in Washington, D.C. During the summer in Austin, nighthawks swirl around the crowning statue on the dome: the Goddess of Liberty, holding aloft a golden star. The legislature meets every other year for a hundred and forty days, reflecting the state’s native aversion to government. The sessions begin on the second Tuesday in January and end around Memorial Day. The legislature’s only mandated task is to produce a two-year balanced budget. In the 2015 session, the state budget worked out to about a hundred billion dollars per year. This year, a drop in the price of oil and a rise in population augured substantial cutbacks and a struggle to meet the health and safety needs of citizens. When I visited the capitol in January, a group of high-school girls stood on a terrazzo mosaic in the middle of the rotunda. In the center was the seal of the Republic of Texas, a lone star wreathed in branches of olive and live oak. “It’s two hundred and eighteen feet from this star to the one above,” a guide told them, gesturing to its mate, on the ceiling of the dome. “You could fit the Statue of Liberty in here.” On the walls of the rotunda hang portraits of our former governors. When the current governor, the staunchly conservative Greg Abbott, leaves office, his portrait will go where Rick Perry’s is now, and those of all the previous forty-seven governors will take one step to the left. When a portrait arrives at the end of the circle on the ground floor, it moves to the wall of the floor above, and then higher and higher and further into obscurity. The next portrait that will ascend from the lobby is that of W. Lee (Pappy) O’Daniel. In some respects, O’Daniel, a Democrat, was a precursor of Donald Trump. When he successfully ran for governor, in 1938, he was a political naïf who had never cast a ballot, and he wasn’t even eligible to vote in that election, because he hadn’t paid his poll tax. He passed himself off as a rube, but he was a savvy operator. He had become famous as the host of a radio show in which he performed with his band, the Light Crust Doughboys. Radio was his Twitter. His only real platform was to stir things up. When his opponents staged a rally, hundreds would attend, but O’Daniel’s speeches attracted tens of thousands. In his first race, he defeated eleven contenders, without a runoff. As governor, he reneged on promises he had made to abolish the death penalty, block the sales tax, and raise pensions. He was a scaremonger, railing against “Communistic labor-leader racketeers” and politically controlled newspapers. He was terribly ineffectual but such a compelling showman that, in 1941, voters sent him to the U.S. Senate over a young man named Lyndon Johnson—the only election Johnson ever lost. The portrait of O’Daniel in the rotunda shows a handsome, full-faced man with slicked-back hair and a “Who, me?” look in his eye. Next to him is O’Daniel’s calmer successor, Coke Stevenson, and the bon vivant Beauford Jester, who, according to legend, died in the arms of his mistress, on the midnight sleeper to Houston. Of all the governors on the rotunda walls, Ann Richards, who served from 1991 to 1995, was the most memorable, at least in my lifetime. She had stark-white hair that was swept and sprayed into a blinding pompadour—Molly Ivins called it “hard hair”—and a switchblade sense of humor that was honed on the primitive male chauvinism she had grown up with. She became a national figure when, as the state treasurer, she gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. “Poor George,” she said of the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. “He can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.” She wasn’t nice, but she had a wonderful smile, and batted her icy-blue eyes as she stuck the knife in. Her rise to governor, as a recovered alcoholic and a divorced mother of four, was a near-miracle. Her wealthy Republican opponent—the West Texas rancher and oilman Clayton Williams, Jr.—had a double-digit lead in the polls when the general election began. He blew that lead with a series of character-revealing gaffes. He told reporters that inclement weather was like rape: “If it’s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.” He had to fight off persistent rumors that he had invited his ranch hands and clients to join in “honey hunts,” which involved scattering prostitutes on his property like Easter eggs. Then, at a forum in Dallas, he met Richards, who stuck out her hand and said, “Hello, Claytie.” He declined the gesture, violating the cowboy code that is deeply ingrained in every Texan. In that instant, he lost the election. Richards wore designer suits but picked her teeth, and she cleaned her fingernails with a Swiss Army knife. She always seemed a little surprised to find herself in the seat of power, but she cherished the comedy of the play she was cast in. Ivins once told me that, after the A.C.L.U. filed suit against a manger scene in the capitol, she called Governor Richards and asked, “Annie, is it really necessary to remove the crèche?” “I’m afraid so,” Richards replied. “And it’s a shame, because it’s about the only time we ever had three wise men in the capitol.” Richards had the most amazing drawl—devastatingly comic, but with a cut-the-crap edge to it. She was a flirt, and she loved dirty jokes and risqué stories. Once, we both took part in a fund-raiser at the Four Seasons in Austin, and the writer Kinky Friedman—who is also the lead singer of Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys—seized the opportunity to tell a story about going to the beach with a family friend, who wore a swimsuit that was so tight it squeezed one of his balls into view. It’s not that funny when I tell it, but Governor Richards laughed so hard that she could barely stay in her chair. Texas has a reputation for being super-religious, but there has always been a tolerance for the sexual misdemeanors of elected officials. Charlie Wilson, the U.S. representative from the Second District, in East Texas, one of the most conservative parts of the state, was a drunk, a drug user, and the most energetic playboy on Capitol Hill, who enjoyed lounging in hot tubs with showgirls and cocaine. He was elected to twelve terms. Texans’ tolerance for sexual liberty didn’t extend to Richards, however. She surrounded herself with a coterie of very powerful women, which led to countless innuendos about her sexual orientation. She complained to a lobbyist I know, “I could be fucking Charlie Wilson on Sam Houston’s bed, and they’d still call me a lesbian.” After one term, Richards was defeated by George W. Bush, marking the end of the Democratic Party as a force of any consequence in the state. Texans are notorious for loving guns, but when I was young it was illegal for residents to carry weapons outside their home or vehicle. In 1991, George Hennard, a thirty-five-year-old unemployed man, drove his Ford pickup through the plate-glass window of the Luby’s cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, where some eighty people were having lunch. At first, everyone thought that it was a freakish accident. Then Hennard shot a customer. “Is it worth it, Texas?” he cried. “This is payback day.” Suzanna Hupp, a chiropractor, was having lunch with her parents. “My father and I got down on the floor and put the table up in front of us,” she later testified before Congress. She reached for her purse, where she kept her revolver, then realized that she had left her gun in her car, fearing that she might lose her chiropractor’s license if she were caught carrying a concealed weapon. Her father confronted the shooter, but he was shot. Hupp told her mother that they needed to make a break for it, then climbed out a rear window. When she looked back, she realized that her mother had gone to comfort her dying husband. Hennard put a bullet in her mother’s head. He shot fifty people, killing twenty-three of them before killing himself. It’s the fourth-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “I’m not really mad at the guy who did this,” Hupp told lawmakers in Washington. “That’s like being mad at a rabid dog.” She continued, “I’m mad at my legislators for legislating me out of the right to protect myself and my family.” In 1996, Hupp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, and she subsequently passed a law that allowed concealed weapons to be carried. Since then, it’s also become legal to carry guns openly. I’ve yet to see anyone in public strapping a sidearm, but the law is tremendously popular. Especially among Texas politicians, there’s a locker-room lust for weaponry that belies noble-sounding proclamations about self-protection and Second Amendment rights. In 2010, Governor Perry boasted of killing with a single shot a coyote that was menacing his daughter’s Labrador. Perry was jogging at the time, but naturally he was packing heat: a .380 Ruger. The gun’s manufacturer promptly issued a Coyote Special edition of the gun, which comes in a box labelled “FOR SALE TO TEXANS ONLY.” An eccentric feature of Texas’s new gun laws is that people entering the state capitol can skip the long lines of tourists waiting to pass through metal detectors if they show guards a license-to-carry permit. In other words, the people most likely to bring weapons into the building aren’t scanned at all. Many of the people who breeze through are lawmakers and staffers who tote concealed weapons into offices or onto the floor of the legislature. But some lobbyists and reporters have also obtained gun licenses, just to skirt the lines. I recently got one myself. One winter day at the capitol, early in the 2017 session, I was bypassing the metal detectors when Governor Abbott rushed by in his wheelchair. At fifty-nine, he is an energetic man; his aides were racing across the rotunda to keep up with him. Abbott was a track star in high school—he is said to have never lost a race—but in 1984 a tree fell on him while he was jogging through the wealthy enclave of River Oaks, in Houston, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He had just graduated from law school and had no health insurance. Fortunately, he won a nine-million-dollar judgment against the homeowner whose tree had fallen and the company that had inspected the tree and failed to recommend its removal. Later, Abbott, as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and then as attorney general, supported measures that capped pain-and-suffering damages in medical-malpractice cases at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Abbott’s overarching issue is fending off the malevolent influence of California, which is widely seen as Texas’s political antithesis: it is more regulated and highly taxed, whereas Texas is relatively unfettered, with one of the lowest tax burdens in the country. Every statewide officeholder in California is a Democrat; in Texas, none are. Nevertheless, in 2015, Abbott declared, “Texas is being California-ized, and you may not even be noticing it.” He went on, “This is being done at the city level, with bag bans, fracking bans, tree-cutting bans. We’re forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.” He warned that the “Texas miracle” could become a “California nightmare.” The obsession with California puzzles me. I play the keyboards in a blues band, and our drummer has a sticker on his kit saying “Stop Californication of Texas Music.” The mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, is a Democrat, but he recently warned that, if our city stays on its current path, “we’ll end up like San Francisco,” with out-of-control housing costs. The newspapers often feature gloating stories about the number of Californians fleeing to Texas (eight per day to Austin alone), as an indication of the vast superiority of the Texas way of life. Although Abbott has a lower national profile than his predecessors Rick Perry and George W. Bush, he clearly has similar ambitions. In January, when the legislative session began, he latched on to a proposal, already adopted by ten other states, to call a constitutional convention aimed at reining in the power of the federal government. Abbott rebranded it as the Texas Plan. It would require the federal government to balance its budget, as Texas does, and would prohibit federal agencies—such as the E.P.A. and the Department of Labor—from issuing regulations that override state laws. As Texas’s attorney general, from 2002 to 2015, Abbott was on the losing end of many lawsuits that he filed on behalf of the state against the U.S. government—he objected to the Affordable Care Act, and to many federal environmental controls. Under the Texas Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court would need a supermajority of seven Justices to strike down a state law. Abbott designated the Texas Plan an emergency item, and it quickly passed the legislature and was signed into law, worrying mainstream Republican lawmakers in Washington, who fear that, in the current political climate, such efforts could lead to a runaway assault on federal authority. Another emergency item on the Governor’s list for the 2017 session was ethics reform, but many legislators saw the move as hypocritical. Lyle Larson, a centrist Republican state representative from San Antonio, told me, “Some of the most egregious violations are in the governor’s office. It’s well known that pay-for-play has been going on in that office for years. For you to be on the Parks and Wildlife board, for instance, or to be a regent at the university, you have to make significant contributions”—to Abbott’s campaign fund. “That’s not in the Governor’s bill.” (Abbott’s press secretary, John Wittman, said, “Governor Abbott selects and appoints individuals he believes are the most qualified and capable of bringing excellence to the organizations in which they serve. Any suggestion to the contrary is absurd.”) Little came of Abbott’s ethics-reform attempt. For all of Abbott’s initiatives, the legislature’s agenda is dominated by Dan Patrick, an evangelical Christian and a former radio talk-show host from Houston, who has been the lieutenant governor since 2014. In Texas, the lieutenant governor is also the president of the Senate, and, because the Senate currently has a Republican majority, Patrick has total control over it. He appoints bills to specific committees, and no legislation comes onto the floor without his say-so. He is unquestionably the most important political figure in the state. During his radio days, Patrick developed a knack for self-promotion; he once got a vasectomy on the air. (He now owns a radio station in Houston.) Clever and relentless, Patrick brought with him to Austin the AM Texas platform of anti-abortion absolutism and hostility to same-sex marriage and undocumented immigrants. He was first elected to the Senate in 2006, running as an outsider. “It was as if Rush Limbaugh were running,” Bill Miller, the lobbyist, told me. Patrick crushed three well-known candidates in the Republican primary, and won the general election with nearly seventy per cent of the vote. Since Patrick became lieutenant governor, one of his signature accomplishments has been the passage of the open-carry gun law; he also successfully pushed to legalize the carrying of concealed weapons on public-college campuses. During the 2016 Presidential race, he deftly pivoted from supporting Ted Cruz to becoming Donald Trump’s campaign chair in Texas. Evan Smith, the co-founder of the Texas Tribune, an online journal dedicated to state politics, told me, “Dan Patrick is the most conservative person ever elected to statewide office in the history of Texas.” (Patrick himself declined to speak to The New Yorker.) Patrick has driven his chamber in a far more radical direction. Even Democratic senators are loath to cross him. In this year’s session, Patrick worked on lowering property taxes and addressing some obscure matters, such as hailstorm-lawsuit reform. But the heart of his agenda was legislation that spoke to the religious right, such as a bill that would provide vouchers for homeschooling and private-school tuition, and a “sermon safeguard” bill, which would prevent state and local officials from issuing subpoenas to members of the clergy or compelling them to testify. He also worked to toughen the state’s voter-I.D. law. Patrick’s legislative agenda, if passed in its entirety, would bend Texas farther in the direction of the affluent and, above all, would fortify the political strength of white evangelicals who feel threatened by the increasing number of minorities and by changing social mores. Patrick’s extremism is often countered by Joe Straus, the speaker of the House, a centrist, business-oriented conservative from San Antonio. Whereas the lieutenant governor is elected by the voters of the state, the speaker is chosen by the members. That makes a crucial difference in the way that Patrick and Straus govern. “Dan Patrick rules by fear,” Representative Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, told me. “Joe Straus rules by consensus.” The 2017 session in Austin proved to be a bruising example of raw politics waged by two talented people, Straus and Patrick, who fervently believe in their causes. The story in Texas both reflects and influences the national scene. At a time when Democratic voices have been sidelined—“We’re lost in the wilderness,” Wu told me—the key struggle is within the increasingly conservative Republican Party, between those who primarily align with business interests and those who are preoccupied with abortion, gay marriage, immigration, religion, and gun rights. Politicians seldom pay a price for the damage that their legislation may do in the name of popular causes, such as declaring war or slashing taxes at the expense of vital social programs. In 2011, Governor Perry vetoed a bill that would have banned texting while driving, saying that it was “a government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults.” Texas is always above the national average in the number of highway fatalities. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, more than four hundred Texans are killed every year in crashes related to distracted driving, often because they are texting. To my surprise, the sponsor of the bill that Perry vetoed was Tom Craddick, the ultraconservative former speaker. This year, he put the measure forward again, for the fourth time. He compares it to Texas’s seat-belt law, which, he notes, “is very unpopular” in his district. “But they say that ninety-five per cent of the people obey the law.” On March 29, 2017, in the middle of the legislative session, a welder named Jody Kuchler called the sheriff’s offices in Uvalde County and Real County to say that a white truck was driving recklessly down a two-lane highway, swerving all over the road. Kuchler, who was following the truck, told the cops, “He’s going to hit somebody head on or he’s going to kill his own damn self.” He then watched helplessly as the truck rammed into a bus carrying members of the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels. Thirteen people were killed. The driver of the truck was twenty-year-old Jack Dillon Young, who was largely unhurt. “He said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was texting,’ ” Kuchler told reporters. “I said, ‘Son, do you know what you just did?’ ” (Young also had Ambien and other medications in his system.) The accident was one of many that might have been prevented had Governor Perry signed the 2011 texting bill into law. That year, the Republican state legislature turned its attention instead to defunding women’s-health programs. “This is a war on birth control and abortions,” Representative Wayne Christian, a Tea Party stalwart from East Texas, admitted. “That’s what family planning is supposed to be about.” The long-term goal of cultural conservatives is to cut off access to abortion in Texas, to end state subsidies for birth control, and to gut state funding for Planned Parenthood—which, in 2011, served sixty per cent of the health needs of low-income women in the state. The legislators slashed the family-planning budget from $111.5 million to $37.9 million. Eighty-two family-planning clinics subsequently shut down. Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the nation, and, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, about seventeen per cent of Texan women and girls live in poverty. After the family-planning budget was cut, there was a disproportionate rise in births covered by Medicaid, because so many women no longer had access to birth control. By defunding Planned Parenthood, the legislature also blocked many women from getting scans for breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In May, 2011, Governor Perry, who was gearing up for his first Presidential race, signed a bill requiring all women seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least twenty-four hours before the procedure. Carol Alvarado, a Democratic state representative from Houston, pointed out on the House floor that, for a woman who is eight to ten weeks pregnant, such a law would necessitate a “transvaginal sonogram.” She then displayed the required instrument to the discomfited lawmakers: a white plastic wand resembling an elongated pistol, which would be inserted into the woman’s vagina. “Government intrusion at its best,” she observed. Nonetheless, the bill passed in the House, 107–42. When the Senate approved the bill, Dan Patrick, then a state senator, declared, “This is a great day for Texas. This is a great day for women’s health.” Between 2010 and 2014, the proportion of women who died in childbirth in Texas doubled, from 18.6 per hundred thousand live births to 35.8—the worst in the nation and higher than the rate in many developing countries. These figures represent six hundred dead women. Researchers say that it’s not entirely understood what accounts for the rise in maternal mortality in Texas, because the rate was already rising before the 2011 laws went into effect. Obesity, heart disease, drug overdoses, and a lack of health insurance—all serious problems in the state—play a role. Nevertheless, a report in the September, 2016, issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted, “In the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a two year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely.” The mystery might be cleared up if Governor Abbott released records about how these women died. In 2011, when he was attorney general, he issued an opinion stating that information about the deceased would be withheld, supposedly to prevent fraud. Dan Patrick, Rick Perry, and other Texas lawmakers who have called their bills a victory for women’s health have shown no compassion for the women who have suffered, and perhaps died, because of them. Their legislation has been equally heartless toward children. A fifth of the uninsured children in the U.S. are in Texas. In 2004, the Texas Education Agency lowered the percentage of children who can be enrolled in special-education classes from thirteen per cent (about the national average) to eight and a half per cent (the lowest in the country). According to the Houston Chronicle, tens of thousands of children have been denied the education they need because of this arbitrary limit. In 2015, a federal judge, Janis Graham Jack, ruled that, in Texas, foster children “almost uniformly leave State custody more damaged than when they entered.” The state, she said, was violating the children’s constitutional rights by exposing them to an unreasonable risk of harm. Judge Jack declared that state oversight agencies had adopted an attitude of “deliberate indifference” toward the plight of the children in their care, even in the face of repeated abuse and, sometimes, homicide. “Rape, abuse, psychotropic medication, and instability are the norm,” she added. Governor Abbott promised to overhaul the child-welfare system, but things have only worsened. In the 2016 fiscal year, at least two hundred children in Texas died of maltreatment, compared with a hundred and seventy-three the previous year, and those figures don’t include more than a hundred other deaths that are still being investigated. Child Protective Services, the state unit charged with investigating cases of abuse, is in chaos. Nevertheless, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, appealed Judge Jack’s decision to appoint a special master to oversee the state’s foster-care system, claiming that it would amount to a “federal takeover.” Nearly a year after the judge’s ruling, Child Protective Services acknowledged that caseworkers had not even visited more than forty-seven hundred children at high risk of abuse or severe neglect. Hundreds of children have been sleeping in hotels or emergency shelters, or on air mattresses in government offices, because the state has nowhere else to put them. Hundreds of caseworkers have quit, complaining that they were overworked, demoralized, poorly paid, and often placed in dangerous situations. Union leaders have said that higher pay would help attract more applicants to the job, which offers a starting salary of thirty-seven thousand dollars, but state officials countered with a plan to lower the educational requirements for caseworkers. During the 2017 legislative session, while bills addressing the child-welfare crisis were being considered, a teen-age girl who was being housed in a state office building fled in the middle of the night. She was hit by a van and killed. Fed up with the callous treatment of women and children, Jessica Farrar, a liberal state representative from Houston, filed House Bill 4260, the Man’s Right to Know Act. It satirically employed the kind of patronizing, “we’re doing this for your own good” language that characterizes the many bills directed at abortion and women’s health—for instance, requiring a sonogram and a rectal exam before prescribing Viagra. Then, there was this: Sec. 173.010. FINES RELATED TO MASTURBATORY EMISSIONS. Masturbatory emissions created in health or medical facilities will be stored for the purposes of conception for a current or future wife. (a) Emissions outside of a woman’s vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life. The bill never made it to the House floor. Lobbyists got their name because they stand in the lobby. When I returned to the capitol on February 7th, about fifty of them, almost all dark-suited men, stood outside the Senate chamber, forming a mosh pit for any legislator who might appear. Although they seem like supplicants, lobbyists actually write much of the legislation and corral the votes. Bill Miller has been working in the lobby for three decades. When he first arrived, he noticed that all the political leaders had animal heads mounted on their walls. Miller had a papier-mâché sea-lion head made up for his office. “Wow, you killed a sea lion?” an impressed legislator asked. “Yeah,” Miller said. “With a surfboard.” Inside the chamber, a crucial debate was under way about Senate Bill 4, known as the sanctuary-cities bill. One of Governor Abbott’s priorities, it essentially required Texas officials to join the Trump Administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. There are about a million such immigrants in Dallas and Houston alone. A few days earlier, four hundred and fifty people had lined up to testify before the State Affairs Committee in protest of S.B. 4, which they saw as a discriminatory measure. The line snaked around the rotunda floor and up to the second level. The hearing lasted more than sixteen hours, and broke up well after midnight. The police chiefs of Austin and San Antonio testified that S.B. 4 would harm their ability to work with immigrant communities. A young woman spoke about attempting suicide after her father was deported. In the end, the bill passed out of committee, 7–2, on partisan lines. In 2016, Sally Hernandez, a political novice of Anglo descent, was elected sheriff of Travis County, having promoted Austin as a “sanctuary city.” Federal immigration authorities often ask local law-enforcement officials to put a “detainer” on people in their custody—that is, to hold off on releasing them until their citizenship status can be verified—but Hernandez declared that she would honor such requests only in cases in which individuals were charged with a violent crime. Otherwise, people who posted bond would be released. It was as if Hernandez had opened the door to a ravenous mob of flesh-eating zombies. Perhaps she didn’t fully appreciate how suspiciously Travis County is viewed by the Republican establishment—which, increasingly, is the Tea Party establishment. Governor Abbott abruptly cut off $1.5 million in state grants to the county. He went on Bill O’Reilly’s show and said of S.B. 4, “Today, we introduced legislation that will put the hammer down on Travis County as well as any sanctuary-city policy in the state of Texas.” O’Reilly said of Sheriff Hernandez, “I don’t understand her motivation.” “She is doing it to pander to the ideology of the left, just like what you see in California,” Abbott responded. S.B. 4 was loaded up with punitive amendments, all of which were endorsed by the entirely white Republican majority. (Of the thirty-one members of the Texas Senate, only eleven are Democrats; seven are Latino.) Under one amendment, Sheriff Hernandez—whom Abbott began calling Sanctuary Sally—could be jailed for up to a year if she refused to grant a detainer. On the Senate floor, Brian Birdwell, a Republican from Granbury, southwest of Fort Worth, rose to speak in favor of the bill. Birdwell is a retired Army colonel who was badly burned in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. He has undergone thirty-nine operations and numerous skin grafts. He said that he was worried about “a culture of insubordination” emerging in Texas, adding that the next step would be outright insurrection. “What you tolerate today you’ll endorse tomorrow, and subsidize the day after.” Juan (Chuy) Hinojosa, a Democratic senator from the fertile South Texas region known as the Valley, spoke against the bill. “I agree one hundred per cent that we as a nation have the right to define our borders,” he said. But the bill, he warned, could become an excuse for the wholesale expulsion of undocumented immigrants who had committed no crimes. “I was deported when I was five,” he said. He and his father were American citizens, but his mother was undocumented. She was picking tomatoes in Hidalgo County, which abuts Mexico, when the Border Patrol arrived. “They put us in a paddy wagon, and we didn’t even have time to notify my father,” he later told me. “We lived in Mexico for a year while my father was looking for us.” Hinojosa tried to find a middle ground during the debate. “Our biggest problem, when we talk about border security, it is politicized right away,” he said. He called Sheriff Hernandez naïve and inexperienced. “She talked about honoring detainers only in cases of violent crime, but suppose you’ve got somebody who smuggled in a hundred kilos of cocaine? If you got caught committing a burglary—hell, yeah, you ought to be detained.” Hernandez defended herself in an op-ed: “Tasking our community police forces with the job of federal immigration agents creates a strain, which is why the detainer policy on nonviolent criminals is optional.” Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began a national dragnet that ostensibly targeted undocumented criminals and violent offenders. Undocumented bystanders were also picked up. Fifty-one people were seized in Austin, fewer than half of whom were criminals—a lower proportion than in any other city in the country—leading residents to believe that the city had been singled out. In an open letter, Mayor Adler said, “These raids are sowing distrust, not just with ICE but even with local law enforcement, and that makes our community less safe.” Many Mexican-Americans in Texas support stricter enforcement of immigration laws. “As long as there is no profiling of Hispanics, we understand the process,” Hinojosa told me. “Since 9/11, the whole culture has changed.” Under current practice, however, undocumented migrants crossing from Mexico often simply surrender to the Border Patrol; they are then given a court date, a year or two in the future. Hinojosa said that it makes no sense to allow undocumented people into the country, let them go wherever they want, and then conduct raids to root them out. “It’s a real broken system,” he said. In session after session, the Texas legislature has sought to impose strict rules on voter identification, with the putative goal of preventing election fraud. A 2011 law required voters to present a U.S. passport, a military identification card, a state driver’s license, a concealed-weapon permit, or a Texas election identification certificate. The same law excluded federal and state government I.D.s, as well as student I.D.s, from being used at polling stations. In 2014, a federal judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, in the Southern District of Texas, struck down the law, calling it “an unconstitutional poll tax.” Texas appealed, but the appeal was rejected, in part because there was no actual evidence of voter fraud. (The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.) The appeals court sent the case back to Judge Ramos, asking her to determine if the law was intentionally discriminatory. If Ramos said yes, it could trigger federal monitoring of the state’s election laws under the Voting Rights Act. The question of voter fraud became a national issue after the 2016 Presidential election. Gregg Phillips, a former official of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, gave Trump the false idea that he would have won the popular vote if illegal votes were discounted. Phillips, the founder of a group called VoteStand, tweeted that three million unqualified voters had cast ballots in the election. He refused to provide proof, though he told CNN that he had developed “algorithms” that could determine citizenship status. Trump soon demanded a widespread investigation into voter fraud. In February, 2017, while Judge Ramos was still considering the Texas voter-I.D. law, a resident of a Fort Worth suburb was found to have voted illegally: Rosa Maria Ortega, a thirty-seven-year-old mother of four with a seventh-grade education. She had lived in the U.S. since she was an infant, and was a legal resident, entitled to serve in the military and required to pay taxes. She assumed that she could also vote, and had done so previously, in 2012 and 2014. The local prosecutor decided to make an example of her, and she was sentenced to eight years in prison. When she gets out, she may be deported to Mexico. I suppose it’s an irony that she is a Republican, and voted for Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who has made voter fraud a signature issue. In April, Judge Ramos issued her opinion: the Texas voter-I.D. law was intentionally designed to discriminate against minorities. Almost simultaneously, a panel of federal judges in San Antonio ruled that three of the state’s thirty-six U.S. congressional districts were illegally drawn in order to disempower minorities. Evan Smith, of the Texas Tribune, has closely followed thirteen legislative sessions. He noted that, even as Dan Patrick and his Republican allies slashed government services, they allocated eight hundred million dollars for border security. “White people are scared of change, believing that what they have is being taken away from them by people they consider unworthy,” he told me. “But all they’re doing is poking a bear with a stick. In 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. The last majority-Anglo high-school class in Texas graduated in 2014. There will never be another. The reality is, it’s all over for the Anglos.” Texas leads the nation in Latino population growth. Latinos account for more than half the 2.7 million new Texans since 2010. Every Democrat in Texas believes that, if Latinos voted at the same rate in Texas as they do in California, the state would already be blue. “The difference between Texas and California is the labor movement,” Garnet Coleman, a Houston member of the Texas House, told me. In the nineteen-sixties, Cesar Chavez began organizing the California farmworkers into a union; that kind of movement didn’t happen in Texas, a right-to-work state. “Labor unions create a culture of voting and political participation,” Coleman observed. In Texas politics, he says, “everything is about race—it’s veiled as public policy, but it encourages people to believe that their tax dollars are going to support lazy black and brown people.” Political views have become more entrenched because of redistricting, and yet the demographic majority in Texas is far more progressive than its representatives. Coleman predicts a showdown: “This is a battle about the future of the country, based on a new majority, and we have to have this out.” The most contentious item on Dan Patrick’s list of priorities for the 2017 session was the “bathroom bill,” S.B. 6, which would bar transgender people in public schools and government buildings from using rest-room or locker-room facilities that did not correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. It would also overturn any local antidiscrimination ordinances that permit transgender citizens to choose which bathroom to use. In 2016, a similar bill was signed into law in North Carolina. In response, musicians such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam cancelled concerts in the state, and sporting associations, including the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A., dropped plans to hold events there. Governor Pat McCrory, who supported the law, lost his bid for reëlection, in part because of the national outcry. Dan Patrick contends that his bill will have no economic effect on the state of Texas, and that the only people opposed to it are journalists and “the secular left.” At a prayer rally on the capitol steps, in February, he declared, “They don’t want prayer in public schools, they’re not pro-life, they see nothing wrong with boys and girls showering together in the tenth grade, or a man being in a women’s bathroom.” Attorney General Paxton, who was also present, added, “This is a spiritual war.” The bathroom bill was drafted after the superintendent of schools in Fort Worth announced, in April, 2016, that transgender students could henceforth use the rest room or the locker room that corresponded to their gender identity. This was in accordance with federal guidelines. The superintendent additionally instructed teachers and administrators to refer to students as “scholars,” rather than as “boys and girls.” At the rally, Patrick called for his resignation, suggesting that this sort of policy would represent “the end of public education” and ignite a mass revolt by parents. “I believe it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public school,” he concluded. The business community in Texas fiercely opposed S.B. 6, and produced a report suggesting that its passage could cost the state up to eight and a half billion dollars. (PolitiFact determined that this figure was hyperbolic.) A month after the Texas legislature began the 2017 session, the Super Bowl was held in Houston, and the National Football League intimated that, were S.B. 6 to pass, the championship might not be held in Texas again. Governor Abbott, who had been keeping his head down as the legislature debated the issue, told the N.F.L. to mind its own business. Bathrooms have been an issue in Texas before. At my first Willie Nelson concert, in Austin, in the nineteen-eighties, I was in the men’s room when a dozen women barged in and laid siege to the stalls. It was actually a rather jolly moment. There were similar episodes at other Texas events, and, in 1993, Governor Ann Richards signed a “potty parity” bill, which mandated that, in new sports and entertainment facilities, there be two toilets in women’s rest rooms for every one in the men’s. The debate over S.B. 6 was a much grimmer matter. Although a dozen other states have similar bills pending, Patrick’s legislation embodied the meanness and the intolerance that many Americans associate with Texas. In Austin, the bill was being sold as a way to protect women against sexual predators who might pose as transgender—a problem that scarcely exists. Laws already on the books protect women from being accosted or spied on. The sponsors of the bill claimed that S.B. 6 was not meant to discriminate against transgender Texans, although the law would do just that. The only remedy for trans people would be to change their birth certificates, a costly and time-consuming process. The bill proposed fining schools and state agencies up to ten thousand five hundred dollars per day for violations. Even in the Texas Senate, there were doubts about the need for such a bill. “How are they going to enforce it?” Chuy Hinojosa asked me. “Would a woman have to raise her dress?” As S.B. 6 made its way through the legislature, I noticed a new sign outside a bathroom in the Austin airport. It said “ALL GENDERS.” On March 2nd, I returned to the capitol to have lunch with the speaker of the House, Joe Straus. It was the hundred-and-eighty-first anniversary of the day that Texas became independent of Mexico, and the beginning of the “high holy days” among Texas historians. The climax comes on March 6th, the anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, where, in 1836, some two hundred and fifty “Texians” gathered to block the advance of the Mexican forces. The capitol rotunda was filled with schoolchildren wearing frontier bonnets and Davy Crockett coonskin hats, getting ready to perform Marty Robbins’s song “Ballad of the Alamo.” Kids from the Texas School for the Deaf would sign as the other children sang. Four retirees representing Buffalo Soldiers—the black cavalrymen who made their mark in the Indian Wars—had come to present the state colors. A tall man wearing a top hat paced about, preparing to recite the letter that William Barret Travis, the lawyer who led the Texian forces at the Alamo, wrote during the battle. (“I shall never surrender or retreat,” he declared, in one of the most famous passages in Texas history. “Victory or death.”) On the House floor, resolutions were offered to honor the “sacrifice of the heroes of the Alamo” and to commend notable citizens. A member proposed that the breakfast taco become the official state breakfast item. I met Straus in his office. He switched on a closed-circuit TV to watch a press conference by a new group of a dozen cultural conservatives, the Texas Freedom Caucus, which is led by Matt Schaefer, a state representative from Tyler, in East Texas. The group, which models itself on the similarly named body of far-right House Republicans in Washington, had formed, in part, because the term “Tea Party” had lost its meaning—in Texas, at least—as nearly every Republican in the legislature claimed to be unimpeachably conservative. What distinguished this group was that the members were all vociferously anti-Straus. The declared mission of the group is to “amplify the voice of liberty-minded grassroots Texans who want bold action to protect life, strengthen families, defend the Bill of Rights, restrain government, and revitalize personal and economic freedoms in Texas.” As he watched the conference, Straus shot me a weary look. We moved to the dining room, which had Audubon bird prints on the wall. “The thing that concerns me is the near-total loss of influence of the business community, which allows really bad ideas like the bathroom bill to fill the void,” Straus said, as we sat down to plates of delicious crab cakes. “C.E.O.s have stopped coming to the capitol to engage directly,” he continued. “They now work only through lobbyists.” Straus comes from a longtime Republican family in San Antonio. One of his ancestors founded the L. Frank Saddlery Company, which made saddles, harnesses, and whips. Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders stopped in San Antonio in 1898 to equip themselves with L. Frank gear on their way to fight in the Spanish-American War. The company’s slogan was “The horse—next to woman, God’s greatest gift to man.” When Joe Straus is not in Austin, he is an executive in the insurance and investment business. He entered that industry after a spell in Washington, where his wife, Julie Brink, worked in the Reagan White House and on George H. W. Bush’s 1988 Presidential campaign. During that period, Straus served in the Commerce Department. He is trim and dapper, like an account executive on “Mad Men,” and is the most prominent Jewish politician in Texas history. In campaigns, his opponents have mentioned his religion, to little effect. This is his fifth term as speaker, which ties the record. It’s a surprise to many observers that the laconic and even-tempered Straus has persevered. Evan Smith told me, “All the things they said about him—‘He’d show up at a gunfight with a butter knife,’ ‘He can’t make a fist’—they were all wrong. Joe Straus is so much tougher than he appears.” His speakership has focussed on providing the workforce and the infrastructure that Texas businesses need, by protecting public education, building roads, establishing more top-tier universities, and expanding job training. Perhaps his biggest victory was in 2013: in the middle of a devastating drought, he ushered through a two-billion-dollar revolving loan fund for state water projects. With each session, Straus has watched the Republican Party drift farther away from the “compassionate conservatism” of the Governor Bush era and become increasingly dominated by Christian ideologues, such as Patrick, for whom economic issues are secondary. Although Democrats and non-Tea Party Republicans alike see Straus as a brake on the controversial cultural agenda being pushed by Abbott and Patrick, he worries that his supporters have unreasonable expectations. “I can only do so much to keep the focus on fiscal issues and away from the divisive stuff,” he told me. “A few loud and fanatical people occasionally unsettle the majority of Republicans, who are really mainstream.” Unlike Patrick, who decides which bills come to the floor in the Senate, Straus has to exercise influence by artfully appointing committee members, who can dull the fangs of fearsome bills (or let them languish until there’s no time to consider them). Sometimes he thinks that his moderation, along with the relative centrism of the Texas House, is being used as a foil for the Senate radicals. “The confidence that people seem to have in the House to serve as a stopper only enables the Senate to run hotter than it ever has before,” he said. Straus believed that most Republicans in the House didn’t want to vote for the bathroom bill, but, like their conservative colleagues in Washington, they worried about being challenged from the right in primaries. “If it gets to the floor, it could be a close vote,” Straus observed. “I can’t imagine anyone really wanting to follow North Carolina’s example, but I can’t guarantee that’s not going to happen.” Meanwhile, he was pressing his own legislative agenda, which included securing additional funds for public schools, improving Child Protective Services, and devoting more resources to mental health—even though the state budget had been hit because of the fall in oil and gas revenues. Before the session began, Straus spoke out against the bathroom bill. “I’ve become more blunt than ever,” he told me. He frequently urges business leaders to remain firm in their opposition to such legislation. “I try to be diplomatic but clear—that if you give in on the bathroom bill to preserve a tax break, there’s another equally awful idea right behind it.” As the bathroom bill was moving through the Texas legislature, Mack Beggs, a seventeen-year-old transgender high-school student from Euless, Texas, won the girls’ state wrestling championship, in the hundred-and-ten-pound weight class. He had been taking testosterone supplements as he transitioned to male, and he had won fifty-six matches in a row. Although he wants to wrestle boys—“because I’m a guy,” he told ESPN—the University Interscholastic League, which oversees the athletic programs in Texas public schools, recently adopted a rule that requires wrestling opponents to have the same sex listed on their birth certificates. In February, the Trump Administration withdrew the protections that President Obama had instituted for transgender students in public schools. On March 6th, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case of a transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, who had sued to be allowed to use the boys’ bathroom at school. That left the issue up to individual states, at least for now. Dan Patrick said that the Texas bill would be a model for the rest of the nation. On March 7th, the bill had its first public hearing before the State Affairs Committee. Transgender Texans, along with their families, came to the capitol to speak, as did preachers, business leaders, and moral crusaders of all types. More than four hundred people signed up to testify at the hearing. The bill’s author, Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham, said that it was designed to “find the balance of privacy, decency, respect, and dignity, to protect women, children, and all people.” Dana Hodges, the state director of a right-wing Christian organization called Concerned Women for America, was the first to testify in favor of the bill. She cast the issue as a matter of women’s safety. “I myself was the victim of being videotaped by a hidden camera placed in a women’s bathroom stall by a man,” she said, her voice trembling. She held up a plastic coat hook that, she said, was embedded with the kind of miniature camera that had been used to spy on her. Under questioning, she acknowledged that a non-transgender man had hidden the camera inside her stall, and that he had been punished under existing laws. Kolkhorst also conceded that she knew of no crimes committed in Texas bathrooms which had been attributed to transgender people. But her intent, she said, was to prevent nefarious people from taking advantage of inclusive bathroom policies. (Crimes against transgender people, meanwhile, are routine; according to Texas Monthly, a quarter of all transgender Texans have been physically assaulted.) Dan Forest, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina and a strong advocate of that state’s bathroom bill, came to Austin to testify that no businesses had actually left his state because of the bill, and that its economy had been hurt by “less than one tenth of one per cent of North Carolina’s annual G.D.P.” (The Associated Press, after examining public records and interviewing business leaders who said that they had cancelled projects because of the bill, estimated that North Carolina would lose nearly four billion dollars over a dozen years.) On March 30th, the North Carolina legislators, assailed on many fronts, partially repealed their bill. In Austin, the vast majority of witnesses spoke against the bathroom bill. One of them was Colt Keo-Meier, a transgender psychologist, who is currently enrolled in medical school at the University of Texas at Galveston. He wore a white lab coat, and a stethoscope around his neck. He said, “If you pass this bill, my gender identity will be further invalidated, as I will not be able to continue attending medical school in the state of Texas. I would not be able to enter the men’s rooms legally.” Keo-Meier, who has a full beard, added, “Look at me—I would not be able to enter the women’s rest rooms safely.” Concerns about voyeurism, he argued, were misplaced: “I used the women’s rest room for twenty-three years, and I used the men’s rest room for ten years. I have not once seen any genitalia.” A woman in a short-sleeved black dress identified herself as Jess Herbst, the mayor of New Hope, a tiny town north of Dallas, in a firmly Republican section of the state. A few weeks earlier, Mayor Herbst had written to her constituents to tell them that she was taking hormone-replacement therapy and transitioning to female. She had received overwhelming support, she told the committee. “I just want to be able to use the women’s room and not have someone ask me at the door for my papers,” she said. The testimony continued until nearly five in the morning. The committee voted to support the bill, 8–1. On the evening of April 6th, I went to the capitol to watch the legislature struggle to fulfill its mandatory duty to pass a budget. House members had been at it all day, and, yet again, the discussion would go on until the early morning. The air-conditioning was merciless; one of the members showed me the long johns poking out from under his shirt cuffs. I saw 5-Hour Energy shots arrayed on some desks. Desperation suffuses the chamber on Budget Night—the last stand for bills that have not been funded. The trick is that, in order to get the money for your legislation, you have to take it from somewhere else. The members were on guard, lest their own bills be raided. More than four hundred amendments to the budget were awaiting their turn. One baffling amendment—offered by Valoree Swanson, a freshman Freedom Caucus member from a suburb of Houston—would prevent state funds from being used to renovate bathrooms in order to “allow or enable a man to enter a women’s restroom facility.” There are some extraordinary people in the House. Senfronia Thompson is a seventy-eight-year-old former teacher from Houston. Known as Ms. T., she is in her twentieth term, and is one of the few Democrats with real power: she chairs the Local and Consent Calendars Committee, one of the gateways many bills must pass through in order to reach the floor. Unlike a lot of other state legislatures, the Texas legislature still follows a tradition of awarding important posts to members of the minority party. This is true even in Dan Patrick’s Senate. Thompson once told me that, when she was a girl, African-Americans were not welcome in the capitol. Now she is the longest-serving woman and black person in Texas legislative history. Among her many accomplishments is a hate-crimes act, passed in 2001, that includes protections for homosexuals. She has also fought against racial profiling and passed measures to help low-income Texans pay their utility bills. Armando Martinez, a forty-one-year-old Democratic member from the Valley, is a firefighter and a paramedic. He showed up on the first day of the session with a bandage on his head; on New Year’s Eve, he’d been hit by a stray celebratory bullet. Martinez filed a bill to prohibit the “reckless discharge of a firearm.” Dr. John Zerwas, a Republican anesthesiologist from Richmond, Texas, is the chair of the Appropriations Committee. A business conservative in the Straus mold, he is deeply respected in the legislature, and Straus selected him to craft the House version of the budget. The main difference between the House’s budget and the Senate’s was that Zerwas proposed dipping into the Rainy Day Fund. The fund, which is amassed largely from oil and gas taxes, is designated for emergencies. It is projected to grow to twelve billion dollars by 2019, which is more than the annual budget of a dozen other states. Patrick maintains that the fund should not be used for “ongoing expenses,” but Zerwas wanted to take two and a half billion dollars out of the pot, in part to finance health care and public schools—Joe Straus priorities. An incident in the afternoon had suggested how the budget fight would play out. A freshman member, Briscoe Cain, presented an amendment to shut down an advisory panel on palliative care. Normally, freshmen keep quiet, but Cain is an assertive member of the insurgent Freedom Caucus. Thirty-two years old, he is proudly bratty, like Matthew Broderick in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” “This amendment seeks to get rid of what I’ve kind of nicknamed the ‘advisory death panel,’ ” Cain said, using a term for end-of-life counselling that is popular among the far right. Soon afterward, Zerwas came to the microphone and stood there, giving Cain what Jonathan Tilove, in his blog for the Austin American-Statesman, jokingly called the morem pellis hispidus distentione nervorum: the hairy eyeball. It’s fascinating to watch the choreography of the members when deep political chords are struck. The Freedom Caucus members gathered with Cain at a microphone in the front of the chamber; the traditional Republicans, along with some Democrats, stood beside Zerwas at a microphone in the rear. It was the Texas version of the Montagues versus the Capulets. “Would you please describe for me what a death panel is?” the mighty chairman of appropriations demanded. “A death panel is whereby a group of individuals unrelated to the person in the hospital decide whether or not that person should live or die,” Cain replied. “Have you ever understood, really, what palliative care is?” Zerwas asked. “Mr. Zerwas, being in your profession, I am sure you could inform this body better than I could,” Cain replied. The old warhorses in the House knew, if Cain did not, that Zerwas had lost his first wife to brain cancer. He wore a ring on his right hand in her memory. Zerwas said, “You could probably ask fifty, sixty, seventy, a hundred members in this House who have had somebody with a serious illness who has dealt with this particular issue.” Zerwas forced Cain, several times, to admit having made false or uninformed statements. “You know about this, and I don’t,” Cain finally said. “My apologies.” The amendment was withdrawn. Cain later saved face when he offered an amendment that would block the Texas Department of Criminal Justice from paying for a “sex reassignment or gender transitioning” operation—something that has never actually happened. Cain’s battle cry: “Don’t California my Texas!” I caught the eye of Pat Fallon, a Republican member from Frisco, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He lives in a wealthy, intensely conservative bedroom community that was all cow pasture when I was growing up nearby. Many young legislators, like Fallon, are not originally from Texas. I asked him how he came to live in the state. He said that, after playing football for Notre Dame, he joined the Air Force, and was stationed in Texas. “They asked me my state of residence, and I said, ‘Massachusetts.’ The payroll officer informed me that Massachusetts has a 5.6-per-cent income tax, but there’s no income tax in Texas. So I said, ‘I’m a Texan!’ ” This term was his third. So far, he’s best known for co-authoring a bill, in 2013, that reasserted the right of students and employees at public schools to say “Merry Christmas” rather than “Happy Holidays.” “Have you got an amendment?” I asked Fallon. “Yeah, it’s No. 152, in which we defund the portion of the Travis County Public Integrity Unit’s investigation of insurance fraud and motor-vehicle tax fraud.” The unit has been under attack for years, because it also addresses crimes committed by state officials. Of course, anything attacking Austin—a spore of the California fungus that is destroying America—is popular. “Who would do the investigating, then?” I asked. “The attorney general,” Fallon responded. Ken Paxton, I reminded Fallon, was under indictment for securities fraud. (He has pleaded not guilty.) “I would prefer it not be that way,” Fallon said. “But he hasn’t been convicted.” Fallon ranks high on the conservative “report cards,” compiled by watchdog groups, by which modern right-wing legislators live and die. One of the most feared is the Fiscal Responsibility Index, a powerful weapon against less than ultra-radical Republicans. It is produced by Empower Texans, a group led by Michael Quinn Sullivan, who is known by his initials, M.Q.S. Some members pronounce it “Mucus.” Sullivan is tall and friendly. He likes to talk about the Boy Scouts (he was an Eagle Scout), the Aggies (he was in the A. & M. Corps of Cadets), and his three children. A right-wing zealot, he is sometimes described as the most powerful non-elected political figure in Texas. Several years ago, Sullivan and I had lunch, and he told me, “I’m not there to get a seat at the table. I’m there to get rid of the table.” In other words, he wants to destroy the government. Empower Texans is funded largely by a reclusive Midland oilman named Tim Dunn, an evangelical Christian who hopes to create in Texas an example of small government that could be replicated by other states and countries. Even people who hate Dunn’s politics consider him the most effective moneyman in the state. He has steadily pushed Republican lawmakers farther right, eliminating the kind of middle-ground figures who support Joe Straus. Dunn has made it a mission to bring down the Speaker. While Fallon and I were talking, Jonathan Stickland approached the front microphone. Stickland, a member of the Freedom Caucus, is generously supported by Empower Texans. He is a former pest-control technician from Bedford, near Arlington, who now calls himself an oil and gas consultant. Stickland is plump, with an imposing beard, narrow-set brown eyes, and an occasional broad smile revealing beautiful teeth. He made news in the 2015 session by posting a sign outside his office: Representative Jonathan Stickland FORMER FETUS District 92 Stickland’s amendment was to defund the state’s feral-hog-abatement program, which kills thousands of the rampaging beasts each year. Stickland called the program ridiculous and a waste of money. “It has not worked, and it never will work!” he declared, infuriating rural lawmakers, who consider wild pigs a nearly existential menace. They converged on Stickland from all sides. Everything came to a dead stop. A brass rail circumscribes the chamber; only members, pages, and clerks can go inside. I was hovering around the rail, and Speaker Straus came over to say hello. He seemed totally at ease: smiling, hands in his pockets. He said, “I guess all the hogs are going to move to Arlington”—which is partly in Stickland’s district. Straus was in no hurry to impose order. He looked at the scrum of lawmakers around Stickland. “Just think,” he said. “These are the people responsible for spending two hundred and eighteen billion dollars.” At the rear microphone stood Drew Springer, a Republican from North Texas, whose district—twice the size of Maryland—is copiously supplied with wild pigs. He proposed attaching an amendment to Stickland’s amendment. It would cut nine hundred thousand dollars in funds for roads and highways—the same amount as the hog-abatement program—but only in Stickland’s home town. The measure passed, with undisguised enthusiasm. Stickland pulled his amendment down, but then charged toward Springer. They met in the middle of the chamber, nose to nose. Stickland is known to carry a concealed weapon, so I was a little worried. But other members separated the men, and Straus reluctantly gavelled the House to order. I left before the budget was passed, long after my bedtime. By dawn, it was clear that Dan Patrick and the Tea Party had suffered one defeat after another in Joe Straus’s House. Earlier in the session, Patrick had demanded an up-or-down vote on subsidizing tuition for private schools, and it was crushed, 103–44. A proposal to “zero out” money for the Texas Commission on the Arts was brushed aside. Governor Abbott’s “enterprise fund,” which he used to lure businesses to the state, would be emptied, and its budget of forty-three million dollars would be dispersed between Child Protective Services and therapy for disabled children. Paxton, the attorney general, would lose more than twenty million dollars from his budget for lawsuits; that money would be redirected to foster-care programs. None of these changes had become law yet—they had to be ratified by the Senate first. The exhausted Democrats and Republicans made a deal: the Democrats agreed to provide only nominal opposition to the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which was going to happen in any case; in return, the bathroom amendment was pulled from consideration. Other controversial amendments were placed in Article 11 of the budget, a kind of wish list of things to be debated in the future. Legislators call Article 11 “the graveyard.” But in the Texas legislature the dead have been known to walk. The relationship between the capitol and the city of Austin is antagonistic. The city has long been known as a blue dot in a red state. It sees itself as standing apart from the vulgar political culture of the rest of Texas, like Rome surrounded by the Goths. Republican politicians bridle at the disdain. “It’s great to be out of the People’s Republic of Austin,” Governor Abbott declared recently, at a Republican dinner in Bell County. “Once you cross the Travis County line, it starts smelling different. And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom. It’s the smell of freedom that does not exist in Austin, Texas.” This tirade was apparently triggered by a local ordinance that requires a permit to cut down a “heritage tree”—one whose trunk diameter exceeds nineteen inches. When Abbott was attorney general and living in Austin, he was infuriated when he had to compensate the city before cutting down a pecan tree that stood in the way of his future swimming pool. Many residents of Austin don’t mind its image as a lonely liberal outpost. I’m part of a group that puts up statues in Austin, and our most recent work was a bronze replica of Willie Nelson. At Nelson’s request, it was unveiled, in 2012, on April 20th—National Marijuana Day. He stood in front of his giant likeness and sang “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.” On the Sunday after Trump was elected President, about a hundred and fifty people gathered on the capitol steps and marched down Congress Avenue. A small group of Trump supporters was staging a counter-protest. According to news reports, one man was especially conspicuous: Joseph Weidknecht, a laid-off sheet-metal worker, who is six feet six and weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. He was wearing a “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” cap and carried a sign that said “PROUD TO BE DEPLORABLE”—a reference to Hillary Clinton’s derogatory remark about Trump supporters. A number of the anti-Trump marchers, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, ripped the sign out of his hands, grabbed his hat, and tried to set his shirt on fire. “I can handle myself in a brawl,” Weidknecht later told the Austin American-Statesman. “But when they brought out the lighters I was genuinely scared for my life.” A small woman wearing a hijab forced herself between Weidknecht and the people assaulting him. She was Amina Amdeen, a nineteen-year-old student at the university, who had immigrated to the U.S. from Iraq when she was ten. “She stood there like a mountain, trying to stop the violence,” Weidknecht said. The police arrested six of the protesters. “I do not stand for what he stands for,” Amdeen remarked. “But I know his fears and concerns are valid. I love this country so much, and I don’t like what I see coming.” In February, two weeks after the Trump Administration began its attempts to block Muslims from entering the U.S., anti-immigrant posters started appearing outside buildings at the University of Texas at Austin. “IMAGINE A MUSLIM-FREE AMERICA,” one said. Around this time, a mosque was firebombed in Victoria, two hours southeast of Austin. Sid Miller, the state’s agricultural commissioner, told the BBC that he worried about America becoming a Muslim country. (Muslims account for about one per cent of the U.S. population.) He previously advocated dropping nuclear bombs on the Muslim world. My wife, Roberta, has a close friend, a writer, who is married to a professor. They are Jewish, and they have a “BLACK LIVES MATTER” sign in their yard. As the sanctuary-cities bill, S.B. 4, was being debated in the capitol, an unsigned letter was left at their front door. It threatened the lives of their children, by name. “Is this Austin?” Roberta cried. In April, S.B. 4 progressed to the House. Among Republicans who vote in Texas primaries, the hottest issue is immigration. Many state legislators who otherwise might not support the bill seemed intimidated by the political environment, and it was apparent that Straus and his team had no battle plan. Meanwhile, Patrick’s counterparts, frustrated by their losses in the budget battles, began adding amendments to make S.B. 4 even tougher. Matt Schaefer, of the Freedom Caucus, amended the bill to allow police officers to question a suspect’s immigration status—a “show me your papers” provision. Law-enforcement authorities in Texas’s major cities had loudly opposed such an idea, saying that it would make immigrants less likely to report crimes. Art Acevedo, Houston’s police chief, said that the number of Hispanics reporting rape in his city was already down forty-three per cent—apparently a result of Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Schaefer’s amendment was similar to a 2010 Arizona law that had been partly struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. “This is something that Texans in our district have been asking for,” Schaefer said. “This is good policy.” Gene Wu, the Democratic House member from Houston, who was born in China, spoke against the bill, tearfully comparing it to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the country’s first major anti-immigration law. “This topic is painful for me, because I’m an immigrant,” he said. “My parents are immigrants. I represent a district filled with immigrants.” As he spoke, supportive Democrats surrounded him. “Some are here as refugees. Some are here as citizens. Some are here without papers. But they are all my people.” For Wu, the sanctuary-cities bill was the natural culmination of the “bigoted, racist mentality” that has emerged in Texas, which he calls the epicenter of the Tea Party. “Trump is simply the most visible manifestation of that mentality,” he told me. “It’s been percolating up in the Republican Party for the past decade.” Another Democratic lawmaker, Ana Hernandez, of Houston, recalled coming to this country as a child: “I remember the constant fear my family lived with each day, the fear my parents experienced each day, as their two little girls went to school, not knowing if there would be an immigration raid that day.” Behind the scenes, the Republican and Democratic caucuses met for hours, trying to find a way to dodge Schaefer’s amendment. “The Republicans came to us and said, ‘Some of us are going to have a hard time voting against it,’ ” Wu told me. Knowing that the law would inevitably be challenged in court, Republicans offered to shelve the amendment if the Democrats made some minor concessions. But the Democrats took too long to agree on terms, and the Republicans withdrew the offer. After sixteen hours of emotional debate, the House passed S.B. 4 with the “show me your papers” amendment. A week later, Governor Abbott signed it into law, on Facebook Live. “Citizens expect law-enforcement officers to enforce the law,” he said. “Citizens deserve lawbreakers to face legal consequences.” As usual, the Texas legislature passed anti-abortion bills. One bans the safest and most common procedure for second-trimester abortions: dilation and evacuation. Supporters of the legislation call this a “dismemberment abortion.” The law also requires health-care facilities to bury or cremate aborted fetuses. In addition, the legislature passed several bills to reform the agencies overseeing abused and endangered children—one of Governor Abbott’s priorities. In the first seven months of the state’s fiscal year, the number of foster children spending two or more consecutive nights in hotels or government office buildings had risen to three hundred and fourteen. The new legislation gave raises to the underpaid caseworkers, but in some ways it was yet another anti-government measure. The bill partially stripped the state of responsibility for its wards, handing them off to contractors. Abbott said that Janis Graham Jack, the federal judge who had ruled that Texas’s foster-care system violated children’s rights, should dismiss the case before her, because the new legislation “completely transforms the system in ways that will make it better.” Child-welfare advocates have criticized the new legislation, saying that private groups may not have the expertise to take over case-management duties, particularly when dealing with troubled children. “I expect the Texas Child Protective Services and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to strive for, achieve, and to accomplish No. 1 ranking status in the United States of America,” Abbott said, as he signed the legislation. On April 6th, the hog-abatement funds were approved, despite Jonathan Stickland’s attempts at sabotage. And a new law allowed the hunting of wild pigs from hot-air balloons. “We’ve got a problem here, and we are willing to fix it,” Mark Keough, a Republican from the Woodlands, told the Texas Observer. “We have that Western, swashbuckling, cowboying type of way to deal with things.” Texans already could legally shoot pigs from helicopters—even with machine guns—but who knew that it was ever against the law to shoot pigs from balloons? Speaker Straus continued to sideline the bathroom bill. He remained certain that most Republicans in the House didn’t really favor the measure, though they also didn’t want to be seen as opposing it. He asked Governor Abbott to stand with him against the measure. Abbott is better known as a business conservative, like Straus, than as a cultural conservative, like Patrick, but he showed little interest in choosing a side, because he was bound to create enemies in either case. Finally, Abbott blandly stated that he favored a bill “to protect privacy in bathrooms.” He signalled that a bill then headed for a committee hearing in the House, H.B. 2899, was a “thoughtful proposal.” Although it would not mandate bathroom use based on biological sex, H.B. 2899 would impede the enforcement of local nondiscrimination ordinances, and it would not stop businesses or lawmakers from imposing bathroom bans in the future. On May 21st, the House began debating the measure. Once again, hours of anguished testimony ensued. Half a dozen female members wandered into the men’s bathroom just off the House floor. “We’re feeling like making trouble today,” one of the women, Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat from Austin, told reporters. “It’s that kind of mood.” Shortly before dawn, the House committee members retired without a vote, effectively killing the measure. At the last minute, several lawmakers had asserted their conservative bona fides by signing on as co-sponsors of the doomed legislation. It was the most desirable outcome imaginable. There were still eight days left in the session. One of the major forces behind the bathroom bill, and a big supporter of Dan Patrick, was Steve Hotze, a Houston physician and a longtime ultraconservative kingmaker. Starting in the mid-nineties, he made a fortune from alternative hormone-replacement therapies and the sale of controversial supplements, such as colloidal silver, which he recommends for treating colds and the flu, and for promoting pet health. Colloidal silver can cause argyria, in which a patient’s skin permanently turns the color of a blue jay. In 1986, Hotze signed the manifesto of an evangelical Christian group called the Coalition on Revival, which endorses the idea that “the ultimate cause of all disease, deformity, disability, and death is the sin of Adam and Eve.” As for government: “We deny that any final authority outside the Bible (e.g., reason, experience, majority opinion, elite opinion, nature, etc.) ought to be accepted as the standard of government for any individual, group, or jurisdiction.” In the aughts, Hotze hosted a show on the talk-radio station that Patrick now owns in Houston. He recently released a couple of songs—perhaps they should be called lamentations—such as “God Fearing Texans Stop Obamacare”: What would Sam Houston do? What would Davy Crockett do? I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight Obamacare, I’m going to defeat Obamacare. Hotze’s main cause is attacking homosexuals, or “homofascists,” as he calls them. “The homosexual political movement will force churches, schools, businesses, and individuals to accept, to affirm, and even celebrate those who participate in anal sex,” he has said. Sodomy, he went on, “will be mandated to be taught to the children in the schools at an early age, starting in kindergarten.” It goes without saying that homosexuals “want to make Texas a clone of California.” In 2014, Dan Patrick ran for lieutenant governor, and Hotze became one of his chief fund-raisers. In a video endorsement, he stood next to Patrick and said, “Dan Patrick’s leadership will keep Texas the most conservative state in the country.” Patrick added, “The Democrats understand that, if they can take Texas, we will never have a Republican in the White House again. They will control the country. There’s not another Texas to move to, folks. This is it.” Patrick was referring to the fact that, as Texas’s liberal cities have burgeoned, the state has grown markedly less red. All of its major urban areas except Fort Worth are Democratic and have been for decades. Dallas went for Obama in both elections. In Houston, America’s most diverse city, the country’s first openly lesbian big-city mayor was succeeded by the city’s second black mayor. (Harris County, however, which encompasses Houston, has Republican judges in the courthouse.) San Antonio has always been a progressive stronghold, though it often votes Republican in statewide races. In the 2016 election, Trump garnered fifty-two per cent of the vote in Texas, compared with sixty-five per cent in neighboring Oklahoma. Texas is more purple than many Americans realize, and that’s what keeps conservatives in the state on edge. Hotze runs a political-action committee called Conservative Republicans of Texas. He also maintains the group’s Web site, and on May 16th he wrote of the bathroom bill, “There are Texas legislators . . . who would allow perverted men and boys, who sexually fantasize that they are women, to enter women’s and girls’ bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.” He implored his readers to pray with him: In the Name of Jesus, I prophesy and declare: May all the individuals serving in the state legislature, and their staff, who support, promote and practice sodomy and other perverted, sexually deviant lifestyles, who support the killing of unborn babies, and who hate God’s Law and God’s Word, receive just retribution from God for their evil actions. . . . May they be consumed, collapse, rot and be blown away as dust from their current positions because of their wicked works, thoughts and deeds. In an e-mail, Patrick’s office described Hotze as a “longtime supporter,” but added, “The Lieutenant Governor does not agree with everything that any of his supporters say or do.” Straus told me, “Steve Hotze exists on the fringes. Mainstream Republicans don’t take him seriously.” Hotze, meanwhile, has been campaigning to have Straus removed as speaker. On May 20th, Tom Mechler, the chairman of the state Republican Party, resigned, citing personal reasons. He issued a letter pleading for party unity. “A party that is fractured by anger and backbiting is a party that will not succeed,” he said. He also warned that the Republican Party had failed to attract voters outside the white demographic, and was therefore destined for electoral oblivion. “If we do not continue to make efforts to engage in the diverse communities across Texas, our state will turn blue,” he warned. He urged the next chairman to reshape the Party in the image of modern Texas. Soon after Mechler’s resignation, Rob Morrow—the former Travis County Republican Party chairman with the motley-fool hat—announced his candidacy for the statewide position. His priorities had not changed since he had been drummed out of office. In a statement for the press, he declared, “I like big titties. I am a proponent of boobyliciousness. In the past several years I have shared on social media the pics of over 500 extremely hot, busty women.” He concluded by saying, “I am for having bikini contests at the Alamo every 4th of July. Case closed.” The twelve members of the Texas Freedom Caucus were furious at Straus and his allies for impeding their legislation, which included yet more bills targeting abortion, and measures that would further loosen gun laws and roll back property taxes. They decided to get revenge, with what became known as the Mother’s Day Massacre. Bills that are not considered controversial are often placed before the House for a pro-forma vote. In May, a hundred and twenty-one such proposals, known as consent bills, were awaiting approval. However, if five or more members object to a consent bill, it must go through the normal legislative process, and be scheduled for discussion on the House floor. This year, the clock for such discussions ran out at midnight on May 11th—the Thursday before Mother’s Day weekend. Hours before midnight, the Freedom Caucus objected to the entire slate of consent bills, making it impossible for them to be heard this session. The doomed consent bills included two that addressed the sharp rise in maternal mortality in Texas. Shawn Thierry, a Democrat from Houston, begged Freedom Caucus members to spare her bill, which would have commissioned a study that focussed on low-income black mothers. She argued that the bill was pro-life, because mothers who died in childbirth had carried their babies to term. Although the Freedom Caucus members agreed with her on this point, they refused her request, adding that it wasn’t personal. “It was like a drive-by shooting,” Thierry later said. Next the Freedom Caucus chewed up time in leisurely debate, proposing amendments and making objections to bills already under consideration. The House was brought to a standstill. An hour passed as they debated inconsequential amendments to a bill on industrial-workforce training. (The minority Democrats had perfected such tactics in the past.) Time was running out to consider any of the other scheduled legislation. Drew Springer, the representative from North Texas who killed Stickland’s anti-hog-abatement amendment, pleaded for H.B. 810, which would fund experimental stem-cell treatments. He spoke on behalf of his wife, who is in a wheelchair. Such treatments “might give somebody like my wife a chance to walk,” he said, between sobs. “I’d trade every one of my bills I’ve passed, every single one, to get the chance to hear H.B. 810.” The Freedom Caucus gave in on this one, and it passed. Also among the slain consent bills was H.B. 3302, a sunset safety-net bill. It had been crafted to preserve important state agencies that would otherwise be phased out under an automatic review policy, which takes place every twelve years. One of the agencies up for review was the state medical board. If the medical board expired, there would be no agency to license doctors in Texas. It wasn’t clear if Freedom Caucus members had realized the far-reaching consequences of killing H.B. 3302. Dan Patrick, however, recognized that an important lever had been handed to him. The only way to avoid the consequences of H.B. 3302’s failing to pass was for a similar bill to be passed in the Senate—which had a later deadline—and then sent back to the House. On the Monday after Mother’s Day, Speaker Straus wrote a letter to Patrick, urging the Senate to pass such a bill—along with the budget—so that the legislature could avoid a special session. In response, Patrick privately sent him specific terms for a deal. The House had to pass the bathroom bill and another item on Patrick’s agenda—a bill that capped local property taxes. In return, the Senate would agree to pass its own version of the sunset safety-net bill, as well as the budget and several other items, including one championed by Straus, which dealt with school-finance reform. Public schools in Texas are financed through property taxes, along with federal and state funds. Over the years, the state’s contribution per student has diminished, with property taxes making up the difference. To restore the balance, Straus wanted to allocate one and a half billion state dollars to the public schools. The Senate had added an amendment to the school-finance-reform bill, however, which amounted to what Straus called a “poison pill”: a provision for vouchers for private schools. The House had already rejected this idea, but Patrick felt that Texas schools had enough money. In an op-ed published in early June, he noted that total education spending, including universities, was already the largest item in the budget—“about fifty-two per cent of all state dollars.” He added, “It is disingenuous to suggest that we are, somehow, holding back funding that we could spend on schools.” (Education spending, as a percentage of the Texas budget, is lower than it has been in at least twenty years.) By now, the ill will between the two men had spilled over into the chambers they led. Lyle Larson, the San Antonio Republican, who is close to Straus, accused the Senate of “taking hostages” when it promised to pass certain House bills only if the House voted for Patrick’s priorities. “I’ve got six,” Larson cried. “How many other bills were held hostage by the Texas Senate?” A roar went up in the House, which only grew when Harold Dutton, a Houston Democrat, took to the front microphone. “When the Senate won’t respect us, they need to expect us,” he said. “I don’t know if they can see us. But would you have them open the door so they can hear us?” The House doors were flung open, as the frustrated representatives bayed like wolves at the Senate chamber, across the capitol. Governor Abbott had warned Speaker Straus that he would demand action on the bathroom bill—even if he had to call a special session. With Straus’s blessing, a compromise was crafted by Chris Paddie, a Republican representative from Marshall, in northeast Texas. It was styled as an amendment to a bill on school safety, and would affect grade schools and high schools but not universities or government buildings. It affirmed the right of all students to use the bathroom with “privacy, dignity, and safety”—language that strongly echoed Patrick’s scaremongering about potential transgender predators. But it did not explicitly bar students from using particular bathrooms. Across Texas, school districts and chambers of commerce seemed resigned to accept the amendment. In Straus’s opinion, it codified a reasonable practice that many schools had already adopted. Still, there was fierce opposition in the House from Democrats who saw it as appeasement. Representative Rafael Anchia, of Dallas, reminded the other members that, since they had begun debating the bathroom issue, in January, ten transgender people had been violently killed in the U.S. He read their names aloud. The amendment passed the House, but Patrick wasn’t satisfied. He said that it didn’t “appear to do much.” Time was running out. Straus declared that Patrick could take Paddie’s amendment or leave it. “For many of us—and especially for me—this was a compromise,” Straus told reporters. “As far as I’m concerned, it was enough. We will go no further. This is the right thing to do in order to protect our economy from billions of dollars in losses and more importantly to protect the safety of some very vulnerable young Texans.” It was “absurd,” he said, that passing a bathroom bill had taken on more urgency than fixing the school-finance system. Patrick did not relent. He said of Straus, “Instead of siding with the people of Texas—and, as a Republican, siding with Republicans of Texas—he has decided to support the policies of Barack Obama, who said, ‘I want boys and girls in every shower in every school in the country.’ ” (Obama never said this.) Patrick then added a remark aimed directly at Abbott: “Tonight, I’m making it very clear, Governor. I want you to call us back on your own time.” The two chambers succeeded in passing a budget, but a special session seemed inevitable. Abbott clearly hated the position he had been thrust into. A special session devoted almost entirely to the bathroom bill, he knew, would focus even more unwanted national attention on Texas. Only the governor can call a special session, and though he can nominally set the agenda, special sessions can get out of hand. There was no guarantee that Abbott would get the outcome he hoped for. On May 27th, the C.E.O.s of fourteen companies with a significant presence in Texas, including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and I.B.M., sent Abbott a letter. “We are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas’ reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families,” it said. The bill would harm the companies’ ability to recruit talent to the state, they asserted, adding, “Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas.” Around this time, reporters caught up with Abbott at a gun range, where he signed a law lowering the cost of gun licenses. He then shot a few rounds at a target sheet, which he proudly displayed to the reporters. (The Texas press has generally been very kind to him.) This was the day after Montana elected a U.S. representative, in a special election, who had body-slammed a reporter, sending him to the hospital. This was the same season in which Trump had declared the press the enemy. Abbott held up his bullet-riddled target and said, “I’m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.” On the Friday before the end of the session, Straus told me, Patrick sent two emissaries from the Senate to visit him at his office. (Patrick’s spokeswoman says that this is “not accurate.”) One of the senators carried an envelope that apparently contained the language of a bathroom bill that Patrick would accept. The senator, whose name Straus would not disclose, was a lawyer, and told Straus that the language had been carefully crafted to insure that the bill would override any local antidiscrimination ordinances. The senator started to open the envelope, but Straus said not to bother. “I’m not a lawyer, but I am a Texan,” he said. “I’m disgusted by all this. Tell the lieutenant governor I don’t want the suicide of a single Texan on my hands.” During the regular legislative session, more than sixty-six hundred bills were filed, and more than twelve hundred were passed into law. The session was widely seen as being dictated by Dan Patrick, but many of the signature items that he had supported—school vouchers, property-tax rollbacks, and the bathroom bill—failed to pass. The major cities in Texas recently joined in a lawsuit against S.B. 4—the sanctuary-cities bill—saying that it will lead to racial profiling, and that regulating immigration is a power reserved for the federal government. The U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the Justice Department would help defend S.B. 4. “President Trump has made a commitment to keep America safe,” he said. “Texas has admirably followed his lead by mandating statewide coöperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal aliens who have committed crimes.” One of the bills that Governor Abbott signed into law allows faith-based adoption groups to reject applicants whose sexual orientation is counter to their beliefs. In response to the law, California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, banned state employees from travelling to Texas at taxpayers’ expense. Dan Patrick jumped at the chance to taunt California. “Of course, California does have a reason to be angry at Texas,” he said. “Thousands of folks fled California’s high taxes and liberal attitudes to come to Texas in 2015.” The session concluded this year on Memorial Day, and so fallen soldiers were honored. Legislators said goodbye to colleagues with whom they had endured a hundred and forty of the most intense days of their lives. Meanwhile, buses began arriving at the capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some from distant states, burst through the doors, filling all four levels of the rotunda and spilling into the House gallery. They unfurled banners (“SEE YOU IN COURT!”) and chanted, “S.B. 4 has got to go!” One of the protest organizers, Stephanie Gharakhanian, explained to reporters, “We wanted to make sure we gave them the sendoff they deserve.” A few of the Democrats in the chamber looked up at the chanting protesters and began to applaud. State troopers cleared the gallery and broke up the protest, but by that time some of the Republicans on the floor had taken offense. Matt Rinaldi, a member of the Freedom Caucus from Dallas County, who is sometimes rated the most conservative member of the House, later told Fox Business Network that he noticed several banners bearing the message “I AM UNDOCUMENTED AND HERE TO STAY.” He called ICE, and then bragged to his Hispanic colleagues about it. A shoving match broke out on the House floor. Curses flew. Afterward, Rinaldi posted on Facebook that Poncho Nevárez, a Democrat from the border town of Eagle Pass, had threatened his life. “Poncho told me he would ‘get me on the way to my car,’ ” Rinaldi wrote, adding that he made it clear that “I would shoot him in self-defense.” The next day, the capitol was subdued. In the House chamber, docents were again leading school tours. In the rotunda, a high-school orchestra was playing a piece for woodwinds. I went up to the second floor, where the acoustics were better. The orchestra was from Kountze, a little East Texas town that had the distinction, in 1991, of electing America’s first Muslim mayor. The musicians were arrayed in the center of the rotunda, atop the seals of the republic and the five nations of which Texas had once been part: Spain, France, Mexico, the United States, and the Confederacy. I was moved by the thought that the long and bloody history of Texas had arrived at this moment, with small-town kids bringing the many voices of the state into harmony. Speaker Straus was waiting in his chambers, seated on the couch in his shirtsleeves, under a painting of Hereford cattle. He looked far more relaxed than I thought was warranted, given that Governor Abbott was poised to call a special session that would likely focus on Patrick’s must-pass bills. But Straus seemed satisfied. He boasted that the priorities of the House—his priorities—had mostly been accomplished. “We did the Child Protective Services reforms, adding fourteen hundred new caseworkers,” he said. “We made tremendous progress on mental-health reforms and funding.” Texas’s decrepit hospitals were going to be upgraded. A health-care plan for retired teachers had been saved. Enormous cuts to higher education had been averted. “These were issues a little bit under the radar, because they’re not sensational, but they’re issues that are going to make a big difference in Texas lives,” Straus said. “What we didn’t achieve was to begin fixing the school-finance system, which everybody knows is a disaster.” Straus said that some schools in districts that had been strongly affected by the downturn in the oil and gas economy might have to be closed. “We had a plan to bridge that,” he noted. “Unfortunately, the Senate had other priorities.” He attributed the failure to Patrick’s “fixation on vouchers.” I asked Straus about the clash between business and cultural conservatives. He quoted William H. Seward, Lincoln’s Secretary of State, who described the forthcoming Civil War as “an irrepressible conflict.” The prejudices unleashed by the election of Donald Trump had poured kerosene on the already volatile world of Texas politics. Straus, referring to the bathroom bill, said, “We came very close this session to passing a sweepingly discriminatory policy. It would have sent a very negative message around the country.” “That’s still possible, right?” I asked. Couldn’t Abbott put forward his own bill in the special session and threaten to veto any amendments? Straus agreed, but noted, “The legislature is not obligated to act upon his agenda items within the thirty-day period. And the Governor would have the option to call as many thirty-day sessions as he would like.” “So the bill could stay in committee and not get voted out?” Straus smiled. The session was the most fractious in memory, and the bad feelings stirred up in the capitol will linger long after the lawmakers return home. Immigrant communities are fearful, lawmakers are vengeful, and hatemongers feel entitled to spread their message. And the bitter battle among Texas Republicans isn’t over. Governor Abbott called a special session, to reconvene on July 18th, and set forth a list of twenty items that he said required action. Most of them could have been passed in the regular session; none of them were a priority for him before the session began. In addition to the bathroom bill, his list of demands included education vouchers, caps on state and local spending, and new abortion restrictions. He also asked for a thousand-dollar raise for public-school teachers, which the local school boards—not the state—would likely have to pay for. “I expect legislators to return with a calm demeanor, and with a firm commitment to make Texas even better,” he said. Straus was not intimidated. He told me, “We’re under no obligation to pass anything.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

By Peter Hessler When Karen Kulp was a child, she believed that the United States of America as she knew it was going to end on June 6, 1966. Her parents were from the South, and they had migrated to Colorado, where Kulp’s father was involved in mining operations and various entrepreneurial activities. In terms of ideology, her parents had started with the John Birch Society, and then they became more radical, until they thought that an invasion was likely to take place on 6/6/66, because it resembled the number of the Beast. “We thought we were going to have a world war, there would be Communists coming, we’d have to kill somebody for a loaf of bread,” Kulp said recently. She was thirteen when doomsday came. The family was living in Del Norte, Colorado, and they had packed gas masks, ammunition, canned food, and other supplies. As the day went on, Kulp said, she began to think that the invasion wasn’t going to happen. “And then I thought, I’m going to have to go to school tomorrow.” In time, Kulp began to question her parents’ ideas. Her father became a pioneer in far-right radio, re-broadcasting the shows of Tom Valentine, who often promoted conspiracy theories and was accused of anti-Semitism. The family sometimes attended Aryan Nations training camps. “It was for whites only,” Kulp said. “It would teach you that whites were the supreme race, all of that shit.” She pointed to her heart: “It just didn’t fit in with this right here.” By the time Kulp was twenty, she had rejected her parents’ racism. She worked as a nurse, eventually specializing in geriatric care, and during the nineteen-eighties she participated in pro-choice demonstrations. Last autumn, she was energized by the Presidential election. In Grand Junction, the largest city in western Colorado, Kulp campaigned with a group of citizens who became active shortly after the release of the “Access Hollywood” recording, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about assaulting women. One of the campaigners was a working mother named Lisa Gaizutis. Her eleven-year-old son had friends whose parents had declared that they would move to Canada if the election went the wrong way, so he did everything possible to free up his mother’s afternoons. “He said he’d take care of himself as long as I was campaigning,” Gaizutis remembered, after the election. “He’d text me and say, ‘You can stay late, I’m done with my homework.’ ” The majority of these activists were women, but their backgrounds were varied. Laureen Gutierrez’s ancestors had come from Spain via Mexico; Marjorie Haun was a special-education teacher who had left her job because of a vocal disability. Matt Patterson was a high-school dropout who, through a series of unlikely events, had acquired a classics degree from Columbia University. All of the activists had arrived in the same place, as fervent supporters of Donald Trump, and on the day of the Inauguration they met in Grand Junction to celebrate. On January 20th, nearly two hundred people attended the Mesa County Republican Women’s DeploraBall. They watched a live feed of the Presidential Inaugural Ball, and they took photographs of one another next to cardboard cutouts of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan, which had been arranged on the mezzanine of the Avalon Theatre. The theatre has an elegant Romanesque Revival façade, and it was built in the twenties, during one of the periodic resource-extraction booms that have shaped the city and its psyche. Grand Junction, with its surrounding area, has a population of some hundred and fifty thousand, and it sits in a wide, windswept valley. There are dry mountains and mesas on all sides, and the landscape gives the town a self-contained feel. Even its history revolves around events that were suffered alone. Residents often refer to their own “Black Sunday,” a date that’s meaningless anywhere else: May 2, 1982, when Exxon decided to abandon an enormous oil-shale project, with devastating effects on Grand Junction’s economy. The region is a Republican stronghold in a state that is starkly divided. Clinton won the Colorado popular vote by a modest margin, but Trump took nearly twice as many counties. The difference came from Denver and Boulder, two populous and liberal enclaves on the Front Range, the eastern side of the Rockies—the Colorado equivalents of New York and California. “Donald Trump lost those two counties by two hundred and seventy-three thousand votes, and he won the rest of the state by a hundred and forty thousand votes,” Steve House, the former chair of the state Republican Party, told me. “That means that most of Colorado, in my mind, is a conservative state.” It also means that Colorado’s economy and culture change dramatically from the Front Range to the Western Slope, on the other side of the Continental Divide. Between 2010 and 2015, the Front Range experienced ninety-six per cent of Colorado’s population growth, and the state’s unemployment rate is only 2.3 per cent. But Grand Junction lost eleven per cent of its workforce between 2009 and 2014, in part because the local energy industry collapsed in the wake of the worldwide drop in gas prices. Average annual family earnings are around ten thousand dollars less than the state figure. Most Grand Junction Republicans initially supported Ted Cruz, and, in August, 2016, after Trump won the nomination, a young first vice-chair of the county Party named Michael Lentz resigned. Lentz decided that advocating for Trump would contradict his Christian faith; he was particularly bothered by Trump’s attacks on immigrants and on the press. “I spent a month trying to come to grips with it, but I couldn’t,” Lentz told me. In October, Matt Patterson, who grew up in Grand Junction but now lives in Washington, D.C., returned to his home town to serve as the Party’s regional field director for the Presidential campaign. He lasted for four days. This was shortly after the “Access Hollywood” tape was leaked, and Patterson’s first act as field director was to propose that the Party hold a Women for Trump rally. But the county chairman refused. “His exact words were, ‘That’s picking a fight we can’t win,’ ” Patterson told me. He quit the campaign and organized the rally on his own. In his estimation, most Republicans would find Trump’s comments repugnant, but they would be even more resentful of the coastal media that was pushing the story. The Women for Trump rally was a local turning point. More than a hundred people showed up, and it galvanized a group of activists. Like other grassroots supporters across the country, they named themselves after Hillary Clinton’s comment that half of Trump’s adherents were racists, sexists, and others who belonged in a “basket of deplorables.” The Deplorables’ approach to the election was fiercely unapologetic. Karen Kulp told me that Trump wasn’t racist; he was simply calling for immigrants to be held accountable to the law. She said she would never support a hateful candidate, because her childhood contact with extremist groups had made her sensitive to such issues. For Kulp, who is in her mid-sixties and describes her income as limited, the campaign was empowering. Like many in Grand Junction, she believed that Trump would kick-start the local energy industry by reducing regulations. She told me that she had never shaken the sense that the country is under threat. “I think America is lost to us,” she said. “Because of the way I was raised, that is baggage that I will have for the rest of my life.” The Deplorables funded their own activities, and they pooled money in order to buy Trump shirts, hats, and buttons from Amazon, because the official campaign provided almost nothing. “I made about a dozen Amazon orders,” Kulp said, at the DeploraBall. “Every shirt you see here tonight, I bought.” At the Avalon, the crowd fell silent while a woman prayed: “Thank you for giving us a President who will, with your help, restore this nation to her former glory, the way you created her.” Less than two weeks later, the Deplorables effectively took over the county Republican leadership, with members winning three positions, including the chair. Others looked farther afield. “If Trump won Wisconsin, he could have won Colorado,” Patterson told me. “The issues were here—immigration and energy.” He believed that without the infighting of the last campaign they could do better. In 2018, there will be an election to replace John Hickenlooper, the Democratic Colorado governor, who will vacate his seat because of term limits. At the DeploraBall, Patterson told me that the Republicans can win the governorship and then, two years later, deliver Colorado to Trump. He said, “We’re going to start on the Western Slope and do a sweep east and color it red.” Like many parts of America that strongly supported Trump, Grand Junction is a rural place with problems that have traditionally been associated with urban areas. In the past three years, felony filings have increased by nearly sixty-five per cent, and there are more than twice as many open homicide cases as there were a decade ago. There’s an epidemic of drug addiction and also of suicide: residents of Mesa County kill themselves at a rate that’s nearly two and a half times that of the nation. Some of this is tied to economic problems, but there’s also an issue of perception. The decrease in gas drilling weighs heavily on the minds of locals, although few people seem to realize that the energy industry now represents less than three per cent of local employment. They’ve been slow to embrace other sectors, such as health care and education, which seem to have more potential for future growth. During the campaign, Trump’s descriptions of inner-city crime and hopelessness often seemed cartoonish to urban residents, but not to rural voters—in Mesa County, Trump won nearly sixty-five per cent of the vote. Pueblo, another large rural Colorado county, has a steel industry that’s been on the wane since the nineteen-eighties. Its county seat now has the state’s highest homicide rate, and last election the county switched from blue to red. Far from Denver and Boulder, there are many places where an atmosphere of decline has lasted for two or more generations, leaving a profound impact on the outlook of young people. Matt Patterson told me that as a boy he had always hoped to escape his home town. In 1985, when he was twelve, almost fifteen per cent of the homes in Grand Junction were vacant, because of the effects of Black Sunday. Patterson’s dream was to become a magician. His parents were middle class—his father sold lumber; his mother worked in insurance—and they were upset when he dropped out of school at the beginning of tenth grade. He moved to South Florida, where he established himself as a specialist in closeup magic. He worked in restaurants, performing sleight-of-hand tricks for diners, and eventually he expanded into private parties, trade shows, and cruise ships. By his early twenties, he was earning more than forty thousand dollars a year. Years later, he described the experience as a “brutal education,” and he self-published a business manual for aspiring magicians. Some advice is technical: for magic, silver Liberty half-dollars are better than Kennedys; in low light, use cards that are red instead of blue. The manual was written long before Patterson entered politics, but any candidate would recognize the wisdom of sleight of hand. (“A good friend once told me that the only difference between a salesman and a con-man is that a salesman has confidence in his product.”) In 1997, Patterson was riding in a car that was hit by a drunk driver, and the bones of his left arm were shattered into several dozen pieces. After six surgeries, he suffered permanent nerve damage, decreased arm mobility, and no future as a closeup magician. Having acquired his G.E.D., he enrolled in classes at the University of Miami. The quality of Patterson’s writing impressed an instructor, who persuaded him to apply to Columbia. The year that Patterson turned thirty, he became an Ivy League freshman. He majored in classics. Every night, he translated four hundred lines of ancient Greek and Latin. In class, he often argued with professors and students. “The default view seemed to be that Western civilization is inherently bad,” he told me. In one history seminar, when students discussed the evils of the Western slave trade, Patterson pointed out that many cultures had practiced slavery, but that nobody decided to eradicate it until individuals in the West took up the cause. The class booed him. In Patterson’s opinion, most people at Columbia believed that only liberal views were legitimate, whereas his experiences in Grand Junction, and his textbook lessons from magic, indicated otherwise. (“States of mind are no different than feats of manual dexterity. Both can be learned through patience and diligence.”) “Look, I’m a high-school dropout who went to an Ivy League school,” Patterson said. “I’ve seen both sides. The people at Columbia are not smarter.” He continued, “I went to Columbia at the height of the Iraq War. There were really legitimate arguments against going into Iraq. But I found that the really good arguments against going were made by William F. Buckley, Bob Novak, and Pat Buchanan. What I saw on the left was all slogans and group thought and clichés.” Patterson graduated with honors and a reinvigorated sense of political conviction. For the past seven years, he’s worked for conservative nonprofit organizations, most recently in anti-union activism. In 2013, the United Auto Workers tried to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, where Patterson demonstrated a knack for billboards and catchphrases. On one sign, he paired a photograph of a hollowed-out Packard plant with the words “Detroit: Brought to You by the UAW.” Another billboard said “United Auto Workers,” with the word “Auto” crossed out and replaced by “Obama,” written in red. In Patterson’s opinion, such issues are cultural and emotional as much as economic. He believes that unions once served a critical function in American industry, but that the leadership, like that of the Democratic Party, has drifted too far from its base. Union heads back liberal candidates such as Obama and Clinton while dues-paying members tend to hold very different views. Patterson also thinks that free trade, which he once embraced as a conservative, has damaged American industries, and he now supports some more protectionist measures. His message resonated in Chattanooga, where, in 2014, workers delivered a stinging defeat to the U.A.W. Since then, Patterson has continued his advocacy in communities across the country, under the auspices of Americans for Tax Reform, which was founded by the conservative advocate Grover Norquist. “So now I bust unions for Grover Norquist with a classics degree and as a former magician,” he told me. As a magician, Patterson went by the name Magnus, taken from Albertus Magnus, the thirteenth-century saint and supposed alchemist. Patterson is of slightly less than average height, with features that are nondescript in a way that allows him to shift easily from one appearance to another. At the DeploraBall he wore a fedora, a pin-striped suit jacket, and eyeglasses with stylish John Varvatos frames. But at other times he dresses with the flair of a goth: black T-shirt, leather bracelet studded with skulls, silver ring decorated with a flying bat. Sometimes he paints his fingernails black. These accessories vanish when it’s time to interact with factory workers, voters, or Republicans in Middle America. In July, 2016, Patterson bet a friend two hundred dollars that Trump would win the Presidency. His conservative Washington friends didn’t take Trump seriously, but Patterson believed that the candidate’s ability to connect with voters was uncanny. (“Remember that you will be performing for people of varying degrees of education, in varying degrees of sobriety, and your routines must be easily understood by all of them.”) Last October, three weeks before the election, Donald Trump visited Grand Junction for a rally in an airport hangar. Along with other members of the press, I was escorted into a pen near the back, where a metal fence separated us from the crowd. At that time, some prominent polls showed Clinton leading by more than ten percentage points, and Trump often claimed that the election might be rigged. During the rally he said, “There’s a voter fraud also with the media, because they so poison the minds of the people by writing false stories.” He pointed in our direction, describing us as “criminals,” among other things: “They’re lying, they’re cheating, they’re stealing! They’re doing everything, these people right back here!” The attacks came every few minutes, and they served as a kind of tether to the speech. The material could have drifted off into abstraction—e-mails, Benghazi, the Washington swamp. But every time Trump pointed at the media, the crowd turned, and by the end people were screaming and cursing at us. One man tried to climb over the barrier, and security guards had to drag him away. Such behavior is out of character for residents of rural Colorado, where politeness and public decency are highly valued. Erin McIntyre, a Grand Junction native who works for the Daily Sentinel, the local paper, stood in the crowd, where the people around her screamed at the journalists: “Lock them up!” “Hang them all!” “Electric chair!” Afterward, McIntyre posted a description of the event on Facebook. “I thought I knew Mesa County,” she wrote. “That’s not what I saw yesterday. And it scared me.” Before Trump took office, people I met in Grand Junction emphasized pragmatic reasons for supporting him. The economy was in trouble, and Trump was a businessman who knew how to make rational, profit-oriented decisions. Supporters almost always complained about some aspect of his character, but they also believed that these flaws were likely to help him succeed in Washington. “I’m not voting for him to be my pastor,” Kathy Rehberg, a local real-estate agent, said. “I’m voting for him to be President. If I have rats in my basement, I’m going to try to find the best rat killer out there. I don’t care if he’s ugly or if he’s sociable. All I care about is if he kills rats.” After the turbulent first two months of the Administration, I met again with Kathy Rehberg and her husband, Ron. They were satisfied with Trump’s performance, and their complaints about his behavior were mild. “I think some of it is funny, how he doesn’t let people push him around,” Ron Rehberg said. Over time, such remarks became more common. “I hate to say it, but I wake up in the morning looking forward to what else is coming,” Ray Scott, a Republican state senator who had campaigned for Trump, told me in June. One lawyer said bluntly, “I get a kick in the ass out of him.” The calculus seemed to have shifted: Trump’s negative qualities, which once had been described as a means to an end, now had value of their own. The point wasn’t necessarily to get things done; it was to retaliate against the media and other enemies. This had always seemed fundamental to Trump’s appeal, but people had been less likely to express it so starkly before he entered office. “For those of us who believe that the media has been corrupt for a lot of years, it’s a way of poking at the jellyfish,” Karen Kulp told me in late April. “Just to make them mad.” In Grand Junction, people wanted Trump to accomplish certain things with the pragmatism of a businessman, but they also wanted him to make them feel a certain way. The assumption has always been that, while emotional appeal might have mattered during the campaign, the practical impact of a Trump Presidency would prove more important. Liberals claimed that Trump would fail because his policies would hurt the people who had voted for him. But the lack of legislative accomplishment seems only to make supporters take more satisfaction in Trump’s behavior. And thus far the President’s tone, rather than his policies, has had the greatest impact on Grand Junction. This was evident even before the election, with the behavior of supporters at the candidate’s rally, the conflicts within the local Republican Party, and an increased distrust of anything having to do with government. Sheila Reiner, a Republican who serves as the county clerk, said that during the campaign she had dealt with many allegations of fraud following Trump’s claims that the election could be rigged. “People came in and said, ‘I want to see where you’re tearing up the ballots!’ ” Reiner told me. Reiner and her staff gave at least twenty impromptu tours of their office, in an attempt to convince voters that the Republican county clerk wasn’t trying to throw the election to Clinton. The Daily Sentinel publishes editorials from both the right and the left, and it didn’t endorse a Presidential candidate. But supporters picked up on Trump’s obsession with crowd size, repeatedly accusing the Sentinel of underestimating attendance at rallies. The paper ran a story about vandalism of political signs, with examples given from both campaigns, but readers were outraged that the photograph featured only a torn Clinton banner. The Sentinel immediately ran a second article with a photograph of a vandalized Trump sign. When Erin McIntyre described the Grand Junction rally on Facebook, online attacks by Trump supporters were so vicious that she feared for her safety. After three days, she deleted the post. In February, a bill that was intended to give journalists better access to government records was introduced in a Colorado senate committee, which was chaired by Ray Scott, a Republican. The process was delayed for unknown reasons, and the Sentinel published an editorial with a mild prompt: “We call on our own Sen. Scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward.” Scott responded with a series of Trump-style tweets. “We have our own fake news in Grand Junction,” he wrote. “The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill.” Jay Seaton, the Sentinel’s publisher, threatened to sue Scott for defamation. In an editorial, he wrote, “When a state senator accused The Sentinel of being fake news, he was deliberately attempting to delegitimize a credible news source in order to avoid being held accountable by it.” The Huffington Post and other national outlets mentioned the spat. When I met with Scott, he seemed pleased by the attention. A burly, friendly man who works as a contractor, he told me, “I was kind of Trumpish before Trump was cool.” “We used to just take it on the chin if somebody said something about us,” he said. “The fake-news thing became the popular thing to say, because of Trump.” He believed that Trump has performed a service by popularizing the term. “I’ve seen journalists like yourself doing a better job,” Scott told me. He’s considering a run for governor, in part because of Trump’s example. “People are looking for something different,” he said. “They’re looking for somebody who means what they say.” In late February, shortly after the exchange between Scott and Seaton, an entrepreneur named Tyler Riehl started a campaign against the Sentinel. He wrote on Facebook, “If I’ve learned one thing from Donald Trump’s election it’s that we can ignore the political pundits telling us we must play nice with the press—even when they’re crooked and dishonest.” Riehl announced a five-hundred-dollar reward for anybody exposing “local media malfeasance,” and he fashioned a hundred newspaper delivery boxes decorated with a “Ghostbusters”-style icon that read, “FAKE NEWS.” Riehl distributed the boxes at a rally called Toast for Trump, which was dutifully covered by the Sentinel, along with a fact-checked head count (a hundred and twenty). In Grand Junction, I learned to suspend any customary assumptions regarding political identity. I encountered countless strong working women, some of whom believed in abortion rights, who had voted for Trump. Cultural cues could be misleading: I interviewed one gentle, hippieish Trump voter who wore his gray hair in a ponytail. An experience like leaving a small town for an Ivy League college, which might lead some people to embrace more liberal ideas, could inspire in others a deeper conservatism. And so I wasn’t entirely surprised to learn that Tyler Riehl, like me, was a former Peace Corps volunteer. He had served in Slovakia. “Every time you get to look at how somebody else lives, it gives you perspective that’s useful,” Riehl told me. In 2000, he was sent to a village in eastern Slovakia, where he advocated for bicyclists’ rights. Riehl told me that living in a post-Communist society strengthened his appreciation for freedom, truth, and the virtues of small government. Now he was applying that idealism to his current campaign. “I do unequivocally state that the Sentinel is full of fake news,” he said. Some residents found these attacks deeply misguided. “I think there’s a lot of emotion involved, and people are bringing opinions from the national debate into the local arena,” Bill Vrettos, a consultant with the Alternative Board, which advises businesses, told me. He described his politics as “radically middle-of-the-road,” and he didn’t believe that the Sentinel was slanted. In his opinion, a small-town newspaper plays a different role from that of a big publication, and he mentioned a recent incident in which two high-school students had killed themselves within a twenty-four-hour period. Before the Sentinel reported anything, Seaton, the publisher, had organized a meeting with school officials, mental-health experts, a suicide task force, and the father of a boy who had killed himself. The experts warned about copycat suicides, so the newspaper kept the deaths off the front page. I met with Seaton at the Sentinel’s downtown office, where a conference-room wall is decorated with two framed front pages that reported the news from historically tragic dates: September 11, 2001, and May 2, 1982. The building has a three-level Goss printing press that is capable of turning out a hundred and fifty thousand issues per hour, because it was purchased in the early eighties, when people once again thought the oil-shale industry was about to take off. The current circulation is around twenty-five thousand. Seaton is from a Kansas-based family that owns eight newspapers around the Midwest; in 2009, they acquired the Sentinel. “I come from a long line of Republicans,” he told me. “My great-uncle served in Eisenhower’s Cabinet as Interior Secretary.” But he admitted that he finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile himself to today’s conservative movement. “The Party is too accommodating of elements that I would consider fringe, bordering on hate groups,” he said. Seaton formerly worked as a corporate lawyer, and he believed that he had a valid case of defamation against Ray Scott. But he had decided not to proceed with a lawsuit. He worried that Trump uses the term “fake news” so often that its interpretation might change by the time a case reached judgment. “Maybe those words have lost their objective meaning,” Seaton said. During the election season, it’s common for some people to cancel their subscriptions, but last year the Sentinel lost more of them than usual. That’s one of the ironies of the age: the New York Times and the Washington Post, which Trump often attacks by name, have gained subscribers and public standing, while a small institution like the Sentinel has been damaged within its community. Seaton didn’t know how to handle the fake-news accusations, although he had considered inviting Tyler Riehl to shadow a reporter for a day. He had also thought about doubling the reward for local media malfeasance. That five hundred dollars still hasn’t been claimed. In the past eight months, I have never heard anybody express regret for voting for Donald Trump. If anything, investigations into the Trump campaign’s connections with Russia have made supporters only more faithful. “I’m loving it—I hope they keep going down the Russia rabbit hole,” Matt Patterson told me, in June. He believes that Democrats are banking on an impeachment instead of doing the hard work of trying to connect with voters. “They didn’t even get rid of their leadership after the election,” he said. But Trump’s connection with supporters also involves a great risk. Many Presidential acts that feel satisfying—the unfiltered insults, the attacks on institutions—also make it difficult to achieve anything practical and positive. And the resulting legislative failures typically inspire more emotion. In late June, after the Senate delayed a vote on the health-care bill, Trump embarked on a Twitter spree, labelling various organizations fake news and claiming that Mika Brzezinski, the MSNBC host, had recently had a facelift that left her bleeding in public. Excuses are naturally built into this toxic cycle. Supporters can always say that Trump was never given a chance, and that the media, the Russia investigation, and other conspiracies have worked against him. In such a climate, it’s difficult to prove incompetence: true pragmatism would be quick and dirty, but emotional cycles can be sustained for much longer. I find it easy to imagine myself at a rally in 2020, standing in a pen while people scream at me. Smaller places may also be particularly vulnerable to the President’s negative tone, which makes it harder to find practical solutions to local problems. In Grand Junction, the average age of a school building is forty-four years, and the district is ranked a hundred and seventy-first out of a hundred and seventy-eight in the state, in terms of funding per student. Property taxes, which fund the schools, are among the lowest of Colorado cities. In November, two measures that would increase school funding will be on the ballot, but the last time such a proposal came to a vote, in 2011, it was rejected. Voters have also not approved an increase in the sales tax since 1989. The next ballot will propose a rise of about a third of one per cent, in order to fund local law enforcement and public-safety services. Even as crime has risen, resources have dropped; the county currently has 1.15 deputies per thousand residents, in comparison with a state average of 2.28. Police departments are so understaffed that many areas aren’t patrolled. “They just bounce from service call to service call,” Daniel Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney, told me. Approximately fourteen per cent of the population is Hispanic, although that figure would be higher if it included undocumented immigrants. When I asked Rubinstein about people who don’t have legal status, he said, “That’s never been a significant proportion of our crime problem.” Trump supporters also seemed to understand this. I never heard anybody blame Hispanics for local crime, or make racist remarks about them; it was much more common to encounter Islamophobia, although the nearest mosque is about four hours away. In a climate of intense distrust of government, it will be particularly difficult to persuade voters to approve new funding. Some residents told me that they want further cuts in education—even in the high desert they were determined to drain the swamp. But there are long-term costs to this mentality. One bright spot in the economy has been the growth of Colorado Mesa University, the largest institution of higher education on the Western Slope, but it’s hard to become a true college town when public schools are so badly underfunded. In June, at an economic conference at the university, I met Erik Valk, the founder of Principelle, a Dutch company that manufactures medical devices. Valk was thinking about opening a production center in Grand Junction, because he loved the natural setting, but he was concerned that the culture might be too inward-looking. “I’m trying to discover if there is a trend in this direction—whether they want to open to the world,” Valk said. “I spoke with the sheriff this morning and he has a funding problem, and he has a crime problem.” One person told me half in jest that the best way to get voters to approve new funding would be to blame everything on a lack of support by Denver élites: a tax increase in the guise of rugged self-reliance. “It’s about creating an us-versus-them victim narrative,” he said. He was being cynical, but he was also acknowledging the power of perspective and feeling. This seems to be the weakness of the Democratic Party, which often gives people the impression that they are being informed of their logical best interests. On the other side, people feel ignored or insulted—this was why they responded so strongly to Clinton’s use of the term “deplorables.” “What she said was, ‘If you don’t vote for me, you’re morally unworthy to talk to, to take seriously,’ ” Patterson told me. In Grand Junction, it was often dispiriting to see such enthusiasm for a figure who could become the ultimate political boom-and-bust. There was idealism, too, and so many pro-Trump opinions were the fruit of powerful and legitimate life experiences. “We just assume that if someone voted for Trump that they’re racist and uneducated,” Jeriel Brammeier, the twenty-six-year-old chair of the local Democratic Party, told me. “We can’t think about it like that.” People have reasons for the things that they believe, and the intensity of their experiences can’t be taken for granted; it’s not simply a matter of having Fox News on in the background. But perhaps this is a way to distinguish between the President and his supporters. Almost everybody I met in Grand Junction seemed more complex, more interesting, and more decent than the man who inspires them. During my conversation with Brammeier, I asked why she had entered politics. “I got pregnant when I was sixteen,” she said. Grand Junction has a high teen-pregnancy rate, and Brammeier had been one of eight girls, out of about two hundred in her twelfth-grade year, who had babies. The town has no Planned Parenthood clinic or designated abortion provider, and in 2015, for reasons both fiscal and ideological, the Republican-controlled state senate voted down a bill that would have provided funding for an effective state-wide contraception program. “Our state senator Ray Scott voted to defund it,” Brammeier said. Private funds filled the gap until last year, when it was included in the state budget. Brammeier told me that she wants to improve the community for her daughter: “She was on my back when she was three months old, and I was canvassing for Obama.” Who could stand before this woman and deny the power of her experience? But that was true on both sides; there were many hard-earned faiths in Grand Junction. In early March, I talked with Governor Hickenlooper, who had just met with Trump in Washington, along with other governors. “He was different from anything I had seen on TV,” Hickenlooper said, mentioning that Trump seemed intent on solving problems. But, since then, Hickenlooper has become sharply critical of the Administration. Last week, he announced that Colorado will join the U.S. Climate Alliance, and he told me that he will be “aggressive” in resisting Trump policies that contradict Colorado’s interests, especially with regard to the environment. “Our goal is not just to meet Paris, but to go beyond Paris,” he said. In 2014, Hickenlooper was reëlected with only forty-nine per cent of the vote, and next year’s election for his replacement will likely be close. In the middle of June, George Brauchler, one of the more conservative candidates in the Republican primary, came to Grand Junction and spoke to local members of the Party. Around sixty people attended, including some Deplorables. Brauchler is a district attorney in the Denver suburbs, where he prosecuted James Holmes, the perpetrator of the mass shooting, in 2012, in a movie theatre in Aurora. After Brauchler gave a short speech, the first question came from a heavyset man wearing a baseball cap: “What do you think about Sharia?” Brauchler kept it short—“Not a fan”—and moved on. “You’re from a liberal area,” another man said. “How are you going to handle that kind of media attack? Because you are going to be deluged with that liberal mentality from Boulder and Denver.” Brauchler said, “I’ve developed great relationships with the local media, and in part that happens through transparency and accountability. These are people who largely just want to report on stories and tell the truth as best they can.” Not long ago, I might have fixated on certain details of Brauchler’s speech. He complained about the overregulation of fossil fuels, and how the owners of electric Tesla cars don’t pay state gasoline taxes. But why split hairs? He didn’t threaten to throw other candidates into prison, and he didn’t ask people to vote for him while simultaneously telling them that the election might be rigged. His facts were real facts. He had worked in public service. He used the sentence “I’m not a rich guy.” He spoke well, and among his listeners he drew out one of the best qualities of Coloradans—not anger or fear or self-victimhood but a certain quirkiness that is at once direct and slightly off kilter. Afterward, a woman in her sixties approached Brauchler. “I kinda like you,” she said. “I’m a Libra,” he replied. “You remind me of my ex-husband.” In his speech, Brauchler expressed support for the President, but he separated himself from Trump’s tone. When I asked him about the Administration, he said, “I just would like there to be some deëmphasis on the stylistic stuff and more focus on the substantive stuff.” He mentioned health-care reform and the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. “If we fail to deliver on those things, there are going to be consequences,” he said. His comments made me wonder whether another bad few months will lead to more open separation by Republican candidates. This would be the hardest thing for supporters to accept—that the emotional appeal of Donald Trump means far less to professional politicians. During my last meeting with Matt Patterson, I asked whether Trump’s behavior might limit his effectiveness even while appealing to his base. “I see your point,” Patterson said, but he still believed that Trump would accomplish great things. “If Trump turns out to be a failure, I’ll take responsibility for that,” he said. “For my share.” We were at a coffee shop, and Patterson wore his goth look: silver jewelry, painted nails. “I’ve never been this emotionally invested in a political leader in my life,” he said. “The more they hate him, the more I want him to succeed. Because what they hate about him is what they hate about me.” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated Karen Kulp’s family name.

203,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/nbQ_tTaki9E/,"A U.S. judge rejected efforts by three University of Texas professors to ban students from bringing guns to their classrooms after the state granted them that right last year, court documents showed on Friday. Professors Jennifer Glass, Lisa Moore and Mia Carter had argued in a federal district court in Austin that academic freedom and classroom debate could be chilled under the so-called ""campus carry"" law backed by the state's Republican political leaders. The law allows concealed handgun license holders aged 21 and older to bring handguns into classrooms and other university facilities, including the University of Texas system, one of the nation's largest with more than 221,000 students. ""Plaintiffs present no concrete evidence to substantiate their fear,"" U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote in his decision dismissing the professors' complaint. Defendants included Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, University President Gregory Fenves and the university's Board of Regents. Paxton, who backed the law, praised the decision. ""The fact that a small group of professors dislike a law and speculate about a ‘chilling effect’ is hardly a valid basis to set the law aside,"" he said in a statement. University of Texas professors had lobbied unsuccessfully to prevent the law, arguing the combination of youth, firearms and college life could make for a deadly situation. Fenves reluctantly allowed campus carry, saying last year he was compelled to do so under state law. Republican lawmakers said campus carry could help prevent a mass shooting. A lawyer for the professors said the ruling was narrow and did not address the plaintiffs' constitutional concerns. ""The order accompanying the dismissal doesn’t reach the merits of either the professors’ substantive First Amendment claims or any aspect of their Second Amendment and Equal Protection claims,"" attorney Renea Hicks said in an email. As of the start of May, 10 states had provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public college campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state laws. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter. Whallon-Wolkind's identity as the unindicted co-conspirator was first reported by Alan Feuer, a reporter for the New York Times, on Twitter on Thursday. A knowledgeable source speaking on condition of anonymity provided the same information to Raw Story.                    No investigative story ever really ends. If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost."" The Washington Post published an excerpt from the book this week, and in the excerpt, Bender discusses a ""group of Trump's most hardcore rallygoers"" known as the Front Row Joes.
