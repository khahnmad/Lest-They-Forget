With Woodruff shackling the Pittsburgh Pirates on six hits and one run over 7 ⅔ innings, the Brewers squeezed out a 3-1 victory at Miller Park. It was only the fifth victory in the last 15 games for the Brewers, who are 4-5 on their last three-series home stand with a game remaining. Woodruff (10-2, 3.79 ERA) became the first 10-game winner in the National League with his eighth quality start of the season. Josh Hader, who has not allowed a hit or run over his last eight outings, worked the ninth to record his 20th save. The Pirates struck for a run in the first inning after Kevin Newman led off with a single and Bryan Reynolds was hit by a pitch. Woodruff recorded two outs before Colin Moran lined a run-scoring double to right-center but the Brewers cut down Josh Bell trying to score from first base, holding the deficit to one run. BOX SCORE: Brewers 3, Pirates 1 RELATED: Woodruff has been a winner for Brewers NOTES: Arcia's defense played role in Saladino replacing Perez HAUDRICOURT: Offense an issue but the rotation is a bigger concern Yasmani Grandal led off the bottom of the inning with a bunt hit to the left side, foiling the Pirates’ infield shift to the right. After Christian Yelich walked on four pitches, the runners advanced on Mike Moustakas’ sharp grounder to first. Pirates starter Jordan Lyles had a chance to escape the inning when Ryan Braun bounced into an out at the plate but he threw past first base on a pickoff attempt, allowing Yelich to trot home from third. Eric Thames followed with an RBI triple into the right-field corner to give the Brewers a 2-1 lead. Thames tacked a run on the Brewers’ lead with one down in the fourth inning when he sent a towering drive down the right-field line and well into the second deck for his 11th home run of the season. The blast came on a high 3-2 fastball from Lyles. Woodruff cruised through the second, third and fourth innings before finding some trouble in the fifth. After Corey Dickerson led off with an opposite-field double to left, Woodruff retired the next two batters, only to have Lyles hit a tapper to the left side for an infield hit. With runners on the corners, Woodruff stopped it there by inducing Newman to bounce into a force at second, keeping it a 3-1 game. The Brewers continued to mount threats against Lyles and the Pittsburgh bullpen without success. They collected only one hit in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position, keeping it a tight game. Yelich will be in HR Derby: FOX TV had Christian Yelich miked for the national broadcast and he was heard talking to Pittsburgh first baseman Josh Bell about participating in the All-Star Home Run Derby. Makes sense, since he leads the majors with 29 HRs. The Brewers’ Jesús Aguilar participated last year in the Derby but bowed out after one round. MLB has yet to announce the HR Derby field. Suter ready to move forward: Left-hander Brent Suter, 11 months past Tommy John reconstructive elbow surgery, is back in town and will travel with the club to Cincinnati, where he will meet with Dr. Timothy Kremchek, who performed his surgery. If Kremchek gives the go-ahead, Suter will return to the team’s training facility in Arizona and begin facing hitters in live batting practice, a big step in his recovery process. “I started throwing curveballs off the mound this week and it went good,” Suter said. “I’m excited. The process has been so day-to-day.” Suter still has hopes to pitch for the Brewers in September but manager Craig Counsell said that would fall in the category of “pleasant surprise” if it happens. In other words, the Brewers won’t count on it but would love if it happens. The same goes for reliever Bobby Wahl, who is recovering from an ACL tear in spring training. Brewers benefit from challenge: The Pirates challenged a safe call at second base with Keston Hiura in the sixth inning and rued doing so after the call was upheld. They lost their challenge and had to wear it in the seventh when Corey Dickerson was obviously safe at first on what was ruled a 3-6-3 double play. California Strong honored: In a pregame ceremony, Brewers players Christian Yelich, Ryan Braun and Mike Moustakas, and Mike Attanasio, son of team owner Mark Attanasio, were honored for their efforts in leading the California Strong movement that raised money for families stricken by the wildfires in that state as well as the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill. Several members of that group’s leadership were on hand for the ceremony as well as representatives of Southeast Ventura County YMCA, which partnered with California Strong to get money to those in need. To date, more than $2 million in donations has been raised, with more than 625 families benefiting. Yelich, Braun, Moustakas and Mike Attanasio were given YMCA Community Service Awards for their efforts. This year: 44-39 Last year: 48-35 Saturday: 37,821 This year: 1,506,000 (34,227 avg.)

The attack killed the DJ and an assistant as well leaving two others wounded. The state where the shooting took place is one currently dominated by a faction of Los Zetas. The shooting took place early Saturday morning at an events center in the city of San Luis Potosi in the state by the same name. According to information released by the San Luis Attorney General’s Office, a group of gunmen arrived at the event center in the Tierra Blanca neighborhood and began shooting at several individuals inside before fleeing the scene.

Paramedics rushed three other shooting victims to a local hospital where one of them also died. Authorities only identified that victim as 31-year-old Alvaro (N). The state of San Luis Potosi is currently under the control of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas — a violent criminal organization that has been terrorizing several other states in Mexico. As Breitbart News reported, the CDN is linked to numerous mass shootings at bars and other entertainment venues throughout their areas of operation. The shootings occur regardless of the presence of innocent bystanders.  In recent weeks, Dahan, had been on tour throughout Mexico performing at numerous cities. He recently posted a video where he was enjoying local food during his travels.  Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Border / Cartel Chronicles.

3,http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1905/21/se.01.html,"Return to Transcripts main page CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL Frm. Rep. Beto O'Rourke in a Town Hall with Dana Bash. Aired 10-11:12p ET Aired May 21, 2019 - 22:00   ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. BASH:  Good evening from Iowa, the first stop on the road to the White House.  And welcome to CNN's Democratic presidential town hall with former Congressman Beto O'Rourke.  I'm Dana Bash, and we are at Drake University for Congressman O'Rourke's first nationally televised town hall as a presidential candidate.   He captured the country's attention last fall by giving Texas Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money.  Now he's competing for a chance to take on President Trump.  With the Iowa caucuses a little more than eight months away, voters in our audience who say they plan to participate in the Democratic caucuses are ready to ask their questions.   Now please welcome Congressman Beto O'Rourke. (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  How are you?   BASH:  How are you?  Nice to see you.   O'ROURKE:  Hey, everybody.   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Is there a dog barking?   BASH:  I think there is.   O'ROURKE:  Yes.   BASH:  Maybe that's the dog at Drake University.   O'ROURKE:  I think that's the bulldog.  Yeah.   BASH:  So, nice haircut.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Yeah.   BASH:  I say that because we all saw the livestream on Facebook of you getting your hair cut.   O'ROURKE:  Yeah.   BASH:  So if you make it to the White House, what else will you be livestreaming?   O'ROURKE:  Yeah.  You know, my intent is to show off my hometown of El Paso, Texas.  And this extraordinary barber who produced this haircut that you are seeing right now... (LAUGHTER) ... who moved over from Ciudad Juarez nine years ago at the height of some horrific violence there to start a business in my hometown, to create jobs, to contribute to our quality of life, to help tell the American story.  This is a country of immigrants and asylum-seekers and refugees from the world over.  Nothing to be afraid of. Everything to celebrate.  So that's what we were trying to do.  Yeah.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  There's a lot of people here from Iowa.  We have a lot of great questions, and we want to begin with Sarah Duncan, a research associate for Vote Smart, a nonpartisan group that provides information on candidates running for president.   O'ROURKE:  Great.   QUESTION:  Good evening.   O'ROURKE:  Hey, Sarah.   QUESTION:  From the undoing of the Iran deal, labelling certain countries as ""shitholes,"" violating human rights within our own borders, promoting anti-Muslim sentiment, cheering on dictatorial leaders, et cetera, the U.S. has not only weakened its global status, but it has demonstrated that its own domestic partisanship is an interference to stable foreign relations.  How do you plan to restore global trust in American leadership and American foreign policy?   O'ROURKE:  Sarah, thank you for the question and giving us the opportunity to take stock of where we are in the world right now. This president, this administration, his policies here at home and abroad have been an absolute disaster.   Describing those immigrants who come to this country as rapists and criminals, though they commit crimes at a far lower rate than those who are born in this country, describing asylum-seekers as animals or an infestation -- an infestation is how you might describe a termite or a cockroach, something that you want to stamp out, something less than human -- you don't get kids in cages at the border until you have dehumanized them in the eyes of your fellow Americans.   To try to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, every tradition of faith, every walk of life. The day that the president signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel to the United States is the day that the mosque in Victoria, Texas, was literally torched to the ground.  And then his embrace of strongmen and dictators, not just Vladimir  Putin, who he called after the Mueller report was released, described it as a hoax to the man who invaded our democracy in 2016, giving him the greenlight to come in again, but it is Duterte in the Philippines, el-Sisi in Egypt.  It's Erdogan in Turkey.  It's MBS in Saudi Arabia, as they bomb Yemen into the last century with our help under this administration. And as he does all of this, he turns his back on our allies in the Western democracies, and our trading partners, and those markets for which we grow the soybeans and corn in this state, now closed off to us under this administration.   We need to get back to promoting democracy here at home, making sure that every single vote counts and everyone is able to vote.  And then abroad, making sure that we send the signal that the future of this world is a democratic one, not an autocratic one.   And then let's focus more of our attention on our own hemisphere. Those people to whom we are connected by land, by culture, and increasingly by families, if we invest in solutions in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, then fewer people have to flee those countries and come to our border at the United States-Mexico border, where we're proposing to build a 2,000-mile wall right now.   We have to do better here at home and do better abroad.  And under my administration, we will.  Thank you for asking the question, Sarah. Appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Congressman, our next question comes from Cris Wildermuth. She's an associate professor of education right here at Drake University.  Cris? QUESTION:  Good evening.   O'ROURKE:  Good evening.   QUESTION:  Two arguments for starting impeachment proceedings against President Trump are, first, that impeachment would bring into the open information withheld by the administration and, second, that it is the duty of Congress to protect the Constitution.  There seems to be a concern, however, that the move could backfire politically.  What is your stance on starting impeachment proceedings against President Trump and why?   O'ROURKE:  Chris, thank you for the question.  We should begin impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump.  Not something... (APPLAUSE) Not something that I take lightly.  It's an incredibly serious, sober decision that we should make as a country, really the last resort when every other option has failed us.  And at this point, where the president has refused to respond to any  subpoena, where his attorney general will not testify, where he will not furnish other witnesses so that we can find out what happened to this great democracy in 2016, and how we prevent future attacks in 2020 and beyond, a president who invited the involvement of a foreign power in this democracy in 2016 and then did everything in his power to obstruct the investigation into what has happened, if we do nothing because we are afraid of the polls or the politics or the repercussions in the next election, then we will have set a precedent for this country that, in fact, some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law.   And if this great democracy, 243 years into this idea and this experiment, is to survive for another 243 or even another year or two, we cannot allow that precedent to stand.  There must be consequences, accountability, and justice.  The only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.   Cris, thank you for asking the question.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  So just to follow up on that, you said that impeachment proceedings should start now.  Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, says that the president -- impeaching the president would be very divisive in the country and would only help the president solidify his base. Do you think there's something to that?   O'ROURKE:  I do.  You know, I understand the political implications of this.  But I think this moment calls for us to look beyond the politics and the polling, and even the next election.   It's the very sanctity of the ballot box and the very future of the world's greatest democracy.  And if this is important to us -- and I think it is -- then we need to look past those short-term consequences to the consequences to the future of this country.   And the only way that we're going to get the documents and the facts and the truth to be able to pursue them as far as they go, as high up as they reach, is to compel the testimony, the furnishing of those documents through impeachment proceedings.  It's the only way that we're going to get to the facts necessary to have that accountability and justice.   BASH:  Because short-term pain could be for you, if you were the Democratic nominee.  That's OK?   O'ROURKE:  That's possible.  But, listen, the consequence of the alternative is to turn a blind eye to this and, in doing so, turn our back on the future of this country.  And I cannot be part of that. We're going to have to make the tough decisions now.   BASH:  OK.  Let's get to the audience again.  Doug Thompson is a corn and soybean farmer who previously worked at the Department of Agriculture during the Clinton administration.  Doug? QUESTION:  Congressman, welcome to Iowa.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you.   QUESTION:  China and the Trump administration are in the midst of a protracted trade war.  Theft of intellectual property and forced transfer of technology are at the core.  I am a farmer.  I have been asked to be a patriot and cheer for the home team, all while 40 years of market development in China is destroyed.  The trade war has handed my soybean market to Brazil and to Argentina.  My question:  Where are our allies, the E.U., Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico?  Do we need to do this unilaterally?   O'ROURKE:  Thank you, Doug.  May I ask you a question?   QUESTION:  Sure.   O'ROURKE:  How long have you been farming?   QUESTION:  Since 1976.   O'ROURKE:  And is -- are there children to whom you would want to pass this farm onto, a next generation?   QUESTION:  My son, Adam, is sitting right over there.   O'ROURKE:  Adam, good to see you.  Yeah.   QUESTION:  He knew that he didn't want me to ad lib tonight.   (LAUGHTER) O'ROURKE:  Well, I'm glad -- yeah, I'm glad that you are both here, and I'm grateful for the question.  You said it better than I could. You are bearing the brunt of this president's disastrous trade war and the tariffs that he's imposed that are destroying the markets that you have worked a lifetime to establish, you and other farmers and growers here and in my home state of Texas and, frankly, across this country.   I was talking to your former governor and the former secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack.  And I was asking him, what do we do in this situation?  And he responded with a rhetorical question.  He said, when in the history of this country have we ever gone to war, a military fight or a trade war, without allies?  Because that's exactly what we are doing now with China.   Yes, they have manipulated their currency.  Yes, they have dumped onto this market at below cost.  And, yes, there should be a consequence and accountability for that.  But going this alone unilaterally has obviously not produced that.   And your ability to pass that farm on to the next generation when what you're growing cannot find markets around the world, when some of these fields, especially on the western part of the state up against the Missouri, are literally lakes right now, we've seen the bins that have blown open from the soybeans that were stored because they could not find a market, that had soaked up all of that water, and now spoiled and not covered by insurance.  We need to have a response to this.  We need to ensure that you can pass this farm on to the next generation.   A couple of ideas.  Let's bring our allies with us to the table, our traditional trading partners, like Mexico, Canada, the European Union, into this fight to make sure that we get the results that we're looking for.  Let's help farmers out today.  Let's make sure that crop insurance covers stored grain.   And then let's put you in the driver's seat for policy going forward. What are the best practices to grow corn and soybeans here?  How can we keep more land under conservation?  How do we pay farmers?  And I've heard this expressed as pennies per meal for doing environmental services, by leaving land in conservation or planting cover crops to pull more carbon out of the air, inject more of it in the soil, disturb less of it while it is there.   I want you to take the lead in our administration on agricultural policy.  And I want to win this fight with China, but I want to do it with allies, not alone.   Thank you for asking the question.  Appreciate it, Doug.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  So on that note, do you support the president's USMCA agreement to replace NAFTA?   O'ROURKE:  He might be headed in the right direction on this, but there's a lot more that we need to do.  We need to make sure that the U.S. worker is on a level playing field with everyone else against whom we compete.   Let me give you an example.  Many of the jobs that used to call my hometown of El Paso home crossed the river when the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed.  They're now in Ciudad Juarez, where people are making $40 or $50 a week doing what American workers had done before.  Part of the reason is there are no real labor unions or ability to organize or use the leverage of the value that they provide in those maquilas to demand better wages and working conditions and benefits that are good for those Mexican workers and then also make the worker here in the United States be able to compete on a more level playing field.   So I want to make sure that in a revised MCA, that I would love to be able to negotiate, that we ensure that that U.S. worker is on a more level playing field with any country with whom we have a trade agreement.  I would also add stronger environmental protections and stronger human rights protections.  If we do that, we will have fair trade for the United States.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Thank you.  Let's get back to the audience.  Olivia Welter is a pharmacy student right here at Drake University and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  Olivia? O'ROURKE:  Hey, Olivia. QUESTION:  Yes, good evening.  Welcome to Drake.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you for having me.   QUESTION:  My question for you is that recently several states have introduced and passed bills that legally prohibit those with uteruses from exercising their reproductive rights.  What specific actions will you take to allow us to gain back our right to our own bodies?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Thank you.  For so long, women have been leading this fight, shouldering the burden of making sure that their reproductive rights protected.  It's time that all of us join them in this fight. As president, I will make sure that every nominee... (APPLAUSE) ... to every federal bench, including the Supreme Court, understands and believes that the 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, is the settled law of the land.   (APPLAUSE) As president, I'll make sure that we do away with the gag rule which prevents providers from referring women to get the best reproductive healthcare that they can.  We'll do away with the Hyde amendment, so that ensures that regardless of your income or your ZIP Code you are able to access a safe, legal abortion, and also the other services that are provided in family planning clinics, a cervical cancer screening, family planning help, in a state like mine, in Texas, where we have not expanded Medicaid or one like yours where you've privatized Medicaid to disastrous results, being able to get the health care that will keep women alive in the midst of a maternal mortality crisis that is three times as deadly for women of color.   And then I will work with our partners in Congress to make sure that by statute we prevent states from taking away the right that every woman should enjoy -- making her own decisions about her own body and having access to the healthcare that makes that possible.  Thank you for asking.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  You probably know there are efforts underway right now to boycott these states, to try to stop people from spending any money in states like Alabama that have passed restrictive measures on abortion. Do you support those boycotts?  And how far should they go?   O'ROURKE:  Here's an alternative solution that I'd like to pursue. There's an extraordinary organization in Texas called Annie's List, and it helps women run for political office, city council, state rep, state senator, U.S. Congress, senator, and president.  More women in positions of power and public trust means better  results, not just on these policies, but just about any other policy that I can think of right now.  So let's change the composition of these state legislatures so that we have people who better reflect the genius of those states and of this country and of our great democracy. That's the path that I want to take.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  OK.  Our next question comes from Lydia Holm, a doctor and a supporter of yours.   O'ROURKE:  Wonderful.  Thank you.  Hi.   QUESTION:  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question, Congressman.  As a pediatric ER doctor and a mom, one of my greatest fears is a mass shooting happening in my community.  My kids have never known a time without mass shooter drills in the schools.  This year, my four boys are in four different schools, and my first thought was that if a shooting happens they won't all be in the same place.  And every time I go to work at the ER, I wonder if that will be the day.  What will you do to help stop this?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Thank you for asking this and then asking it in such personal terms.  Sometimes when we talk about the fact that we lose more than 30,000 of our fellow Americans to gun violence, that can seem an abstraction or a number.   When we think about our kids and others' kids who have been lost when gunmen enter a school and begin firing on those students and teachers and public school educators, it brings it home to us what is happening in our country right now.   This is the last week of school for my kids in El Paso.  And I had a chance to talk to my 8-year-old, Henry, who just ran the relay at Mesita Elementary today.  They came in first.  And I said if he keeps it up, he can come to the Drake relays down the road here.  So... (APPLAUSE) But not too long ago, perhaps like your children, he came home from first grade, and when Amy and I asked him what he had done at school that day, he talked about his teacher huddling Henry and his classmates into a closet and then resisting the temptation to open the door when someone impersonating an active shooter to get them ready begins to knock on it.   I met an extraordinary middle school student who may be here.  She goes to Berg Middle School in Newton.  Her name is Milan.  And when I had a chance to talk to her class, her one question is, I don't want to come to school and wonder whether I'm going to come home at the end of the day.   What's the answer to that?  We know that in this country, those states that have adopted universal background checks and close every loophole -- the Charleston loophole, the boyfriend loophole, the gun show loophole -- and make sure that everyone who purchases a firearm goes through a background check, those states have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent.   When we complement that by ensuring that weapons of war designed for use on the battlefield are no longer sold into our communities so they don't end up in our schools or our synagogues and our churches, we can save even more lives.   (APPLAUSE) Two more steps that I want to take.  Red flag laws, and not just do it town by town or state by state, but do it nationally so that anyone who exhibits a tendency to harm themselves or to harm somebody else can be stopped before they do that.   And then the last part, let's make sure that we invest in the counseling and the mental health and the therapy necessary for people to get the care that they need.   (APPLAUSE) So I want to make sure that we're up to this challenge.  Thank you.   BASH:  One other question.  Do you support mandatory federal licensing for guns?  Gun-owners, rather, in the United States, similar to what you hear from Cory Booker? O'ROURKE:  I think that's something that we need to look at.  And I'm grateful to Senator Booker for taking a bold approach to a very urgent problem that we have right now.   But I would start with those four steps that I just outlined.  There's consensus there.  There's agreement.  We're going to be able to make progress.  But, yes, I think this is something that should be debated. We should have a full hearing on that.  And if it makes sense to the American public, then let's move forward.  But I want to start with this area of agreement that we have right now.   BASH:  OK.  Let's get back to the audience.  Beverly Davis is a communications consultant.  She has our next question.   QUESTION:  Thank you for being in Iowa, Congressman.  My mother is an immigrant from Central America and a naturalized citizen.  And she, like so many Americans, is horrified and angry at the Trump administration's treatment of legitimate immigrants on our southern border.  What is your concrete plan to fix our broken immigration system and stop the inhumane treatment of immigrants?   O'ROURKE:  Thank you.  Thanks for the question.   (APPLAUSE) If you don't mind me asking you, what country did your mother come from?  O'ROURKE:  Panama.  She's right there.   O'ROURKE:  Right.  Thank you for being here.  We saw 400,000 apprehensions at our southern border last year.  To put that in perspective, in the second year of the George W. Bush administration, there were 1.6 million apprehensions.  And those that we were apprehending last year very often came from the northern triangle countries of Central America. And they were fleeing the deadliest places on the planet and making a 2,000-mile journey, much of that by foot, some of it atop a train known as the Beast, or La Bestia, to come here in an attempt to follow our asylum laws, perhaps as the O'Rourkes did in the 19th century, fleeing famine that claimed the lives of more than a million Irish on that island, coming to the one place that would take them in so they could do better for themselves and do better for all of us.   We met those asylum-seekers under this administration with cages for their kids, and we've deported those mothers who risked their very lives to bring their children here back to the very countries from which they fled.  You ask what I would do differently?  I would never again separate another family when they come here at their most vulnerable and desperate moment.   (APPLAUSE) And I will make every effort and we will spare no expense to reunite those families who have already been separated.  And then let's do this together and let's not do it as Democrats or independents or Republicans.  But let's do this as Americans.  Let's rewrite our immigration laws in our own image.   Let's reflect our values, our reality, the best interests and traditions of this country that is comprised of immigrants and asylum- seekers and refugees, free every one of the more than 1 million Dreamers from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in their home country.   (APPLAUSE) And then give others who are laboring in the shadows right now, working some of the toughest jobs that we can imagine, let's bring them out of the shadows, allow them to contribute to their full potential, put them on a path to citizenship, and then ensure that our visa quotas match the labor demands that we have here, our desire to have families be able to reunite, and have everyone contribute to the shared greatness and success of this country.   I know that we can do it.  We just have to set our minds to it and have a president who reflects that desire and that demand.  And I tell you, coming from a city of immigrants that also happens to be one of the safest cities in the United States of America, I've lived this experience, I have a powerful story to tell about the positive impact of immigrants, and that will be reflected in the White House under our administration.   Thank you for asking the question.  Appreciate it.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Let's do a follow-up question about that.  So far this year, just this year, Customs and Border Protection has apprehended nearly 50,000 unaccompanied children along the Southwest border.  So would a President O'Rourke grant those children asylum?   O'ROURKE:  If they meet the test for credible fear -- that they cannot return to their home country for fear of being attacked, being raped, being killed -- the answer is yes.  Now, that's -- that's who we are as a country.   And the beneficiary of that ultimately is not just the child.  It is all of us.  Everything that that kid is going to do over the course of their life, the genius that will be revealed, will be revealed for all of us.  It will benefit the United States of America, as it always has.   But, Dana, that can't be the solution in and of itself.  We need to invest in solutions in the northern triangle.  This president wants to cut $500 million -- that's all that we give to those three countries -- and if you put it into perspective, he wants to spend $30 billion on a 2,000-mile wall.  He wants to cut that.  I would double it.   And I would focus it on violence prevention so that no mother has to make the god-awful decision of sending her child on that 2,000-mile trek because it is the only choice that she has now.  Let's invest in those solutions there so that families can stay there, they can be prosperous there, they can help those countries come together, and make sure that we have partners in the Western Hemisphere going forward.   That's the wisest, best use of our diplomacy and our resources in this hemisphere.   BASH:  Thank you for that.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you.   BASH:  Let's take a quick break.  Don't go anywhere.  We'll be back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential town hall with Beto O'Rourke.  Stay right there.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Welcome back to Drake University in Iowa.  We're live for a Democratic presidential town hall with Beto O'Rourke.   We want to get back to the audience in a minute, but before we do, I just want to ask something personal, and that is about your dad.  He was a politician in El Paso, and you didn't always see eye to eye.  He wanted you to be in the family business of politics.  You were not that interested.  It's probably an understatement back then.  In 2001, he was hit by a car, he was killed, and I just wonder what you think he would say watching you now running for president of the United States.   O'ROURKE:  Well, since we're on live TV, and there may be kids watching, I'm going to -- I'm going to keep this clean.   (LAUGHTER) I think he would -- you know, I would like to think that he would be proud the way that we're doing this, being with people, having fun, all about connecting with folks where they are and where they live.   My dad, Pat O'Rourke, never met a stranger, loved every second of being alive, found total joy in serving others.  And to whatever degree I can emulate that and find that joy -- and it's been that way as we've traveled Iowa and the other states and in my time of service on city council and in Congress, I hope that I'm living up to the expectation that he set for me.  I miss him terribly every day, but I know that if he were with us, he would be having the time of his life. So I keep him in my thoughts, and I know that he is somewhere looking on us with a big smile on his face.   BASH:  And is he surprised saying, wow, you really did it?   O'ROURKE:  Yeah.  Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Because this was absolutely not my path in life.  I remember, I was fortunate enough to be able to go to Columbia, took out student loans every year that I was there, a work-study job every year that I was there.  My dad took out loans to be able to send me there.   And I came home my sophomore or junior year and I said, ""Dad, I'm an English major.""  And I just remember the look of disappointment on his face.   (LAUGHTER) We're taking all these loans out and struggling for you, and you're going to read books all day?  So I don't think he knew what course or path I was going to take, but I'm grateful that I get to do this.  I'm the luckiest guy in the world. BASH:  Well, he did know that -- and this is a little-known fact about you -- after you graduated, you were a live-in nanny for a family briefly, right, in New York City?   O'ROURKE:  Does anyone else have any questions?   (LAUGHTER) BASH:  A lot of questions.   O'ROURKE:  Yeah.  So I, after college, was trying to live in the city, trying to live in New York, and I was working full time but I still didn't have enough money to pay the rent.  And so this incredibly kind family said that if you will make our kids breakfast in the morning, walk them to school, take care of them at the end of the day, and then watch them on the weekends, you can have the little apartment above ours in our apartment building.  Great deal.  And so I took them up on that, and a great experience early on.  Yeah.   BASH:  OK.  Well, we're going to make a turn to other important topics.   O'ROURKE:  Yeah.   BASH:  To our audience, I want to get straight to Joey Lyons who is a registered nurse.  Joey? O'ROURKE:  Thanks. QUESTION:  Hey, Congressman Beto.   O'ROURKE:  Hi, Joey.   QUESTION:  I work at a hospital on a floor that specializes in helping people detox from drugs and alcohol.  First, as a society, how do we stop viewing drug users as criminals and start viewing them as people struggling with mental health problems?   Second, would you support decriminalization of drug use beyond just marijuana?   Third, would you commute sentences for people serving time for simple drug possession?  Thank you.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you.  And thank you for the work that you're doing. So incredibly important.   (APPLAUSE) We look at the fact that we lost 70,000 of our fellow Americans last year to drug overdose deaths, most of them to opioids, and most of those who were addicted to opioids began that addiction with a legally prescribed opiate, the vast majority.  And so often we treat them as a criminal justice problem instead of, as you've just suggested, a public health opportunity.   So, yes, let's not criminalize them.  Let's get them the long-term recovery help, the treatment that they need, the care that will get them back on their feet so that they're as productive as they should be over the course of their lives.   And let's also acknowledge this, that without consequences or justice for how this happened, for corporations like Purdue Pharma that marketed these opioids and not... (APPLAUSE) Though we have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars tonight, we are the most incarcerated country on the face of the planet, disproportionately compromised of people of color.  I was talking to somebody in Iowa, Tavis Hall (ph), who is an expert on this.  He said African-Americans comprise 3 percent of Iowa's population, 40 percent of the incarcerated population in this state.   We are busting people for possession of marijuana, putting them in jail, forcing them to check a box on every employment application form after they're released, making it less likely that they get the job, making it almost impossible to attend Drake because they no longer qualify for federally backed student loans.  And yet no one from Purdue Pharma has done a night in jail or paid any significant consequence.   (APPLAUSE) We've got to do better.  So let's end a war on drugs.  It has become a war on people, a war on some people more than others.  Yes, let's end the prohibition on marijuana and expunge the arrest records for everyone arrested for possession of a substance that is legal in most of this country.   (APPLAUSE) And then a few other quick steps.  Let's end for-profit prisons in the United States of America.   (APPLAUSE) No one should get rich locking other people up.  Let's end the cash bail system so that you are not too poor to be able to have your freedom in this country.   (APPLAUSE) And then, lastly, let's make sure that we really look at the consequence of slavery and segregation and suppression and Jim Crow in this country that has produced a criminal justice system, that has produced the results that we just described before.  If we do that, we begin the process of repair and we stop visiting this injustice on future generations going forward.   So thank you for the question.  Appreciate it.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Let me just ask you, to follow up on something you just said, do you want to put the drug manufacturers in jail?   O'ROURKE:  It is pretty clear that Purdue Pharma was marketing opioids to prescribers and to doctors as a miracle cure without side effects and playing down any consequences of addiction, though they knew something to the contrary.   And you see the rates of addiction that you have across this country. If there is not justice served in this case, then it will continue to happen.  So I back those attorneys general -- and I think of Josh Shapiro in  Pennsylvania, for example, but there are others across this country -- who are going to make sure that justice is served.  It's the only way to ensure that going forward you do not have that same problem marketed to future generations of Americans.   So, yes, there has to be legal consequences, including jail time, if that's what the judge finds at the end of the day.  Yep.   BASH:  OK.  Let's get back to the audience.  I want to bring in Diane Kolmer, a retired telecommunications lobbyist.  Diane? O'ROURKE:  Hey, Diane.   QUESTION:  Thank you, Dana.  And welcome to Drake, Congressman O'Rourke.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you. QUESTION:  I have multiple sclerosis, and this disease is treated with very expensive pharmaceutical drugs.  In addition to the ever- increasing costs of my generic drugs, the cost of the primary drug I take for the multiple sclerosis now retails, one dose, at $21,800.   I get this every six weeks, $21,800 for a little bag of white -- of clear liquid that is infused in my chest.  It has depleted our savings.  And I worry about how we can afford the ever-increasing costs of these drugs that reduce the progression of my MS.  O'ROURKE:  Diane, thank you for being here.   (APPLAUSE) And, again, for having the courage of sharing your story so we all understand the consequences of the policies that we have adopted in this country.   You should be able to get the care that you need to live your life to the fullest, and cost should not be an object or a concern or an anxiety of yours.  I want you to focus on being well and doing well for others.   To add insult to injury, you and I as taxpayers have funded so much of the research and development for the cures and the medications and the pharmaceuticals that are sold back to us at the highest prices on the planet.  We prevent you from buying from Canada or from Europe or somewhere else, where you can purchase it cheaper.  And we refuse to use the purchasing power of Medicare, the leverage in all of the prescription medications that we buy for those beneficiaries, to drive the price down.   We have a plan to address this.  We're going to make sure that every single American has access to high-quality universal healthcare, without exception.  It is a plan called Medicare for America...  (APPLAUSE) ... that will ensure that everyone who does not have care today is enrolled in Medicare.  Those who have insufficient care, they can't make the co-pay after insurance kicks in, or afford the premium or bridge the deductible, they can choose Medicare, as well.   But those who have employer-sponsored insurance and like it because it works for them and their families are able to keep it, and we use the leverage of this government not just for Medicare, but Medicaid beneficiaries, V.A. beneficiaries, Tricare beneficiaries, to bring the prices of these medications down so that you and other Americans can afford them.   That's what we should be able to do.  Thank you, Diane, for asking the question.  Appreciate it.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  So you mentioned your plan or the plan that you signed onto, Medicare for America.  Why not Medicare for all?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  I think about Diane.  I think about Joey, a young man, 27 years old, that I met in Laredo, Texas.  He's been to a doctor once in his life because he does not have insurance, and that doctor told him that he had diabetes, that he had glaucoma, and that he would be dead before the age of 40 because he's not getting any care right now in this country.   Joey, Diane, others, they don't have time for us to get to the perfect solution.  If we were to start from scratch, maybe we would start with a single-payer, but we've got to work with the system that we have here today.   The surest, quickest way to get there is Medicare for America.  It guarantees every single person in this country gets the care that they need to live to their full potential and do those things that they were placed on this planet to perform in the first place.  So that's why I support that plan.   (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Thank you for that, Congressman.  Don't go anywhere.   O'ROURKE:  You got it.   BASH:  We're going to be right back with a lot more from CNN's Democratic presidential town hall with Beto O'Rourke. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BASH:  Welcome back.  We're live in Iowa for a Democratic presidential town hall with Beto O'Rourke.  I want to get straight to the audience. We have a lot more questions, starting with Terrance Pendleton, who is a math professor right here at Drake.   O'ROURKE:  Great.  Hey, Terrance. (APPLAUSE) QUESTION:  Good evening.  So this past January, at Drake University, I taught a course entitled ""Mathematical Modeling of Weather and Climate Change.""  It was there that we studied the famous Keeling Curve.  And I was quite alarmed to read that this year carbon emissions have reached record levels.  At this pivotal time for our species and our planet, what steps would you take to curb the potentially devastating consequences of climate change?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Great question, Terrance.  Terrance, thank you for the question and for directing our focus on the most urgent priority facing all of us.   Yesterday, I spent part of the day in downtown Davenport.  That community saw a record level of flooding, broke the record set in 1993 from the Mississippi River.  Across the state, up against the Missouri, we saw towns that were underwater that had never flooded in any meaningful way before, the greatest run-off into the Missouri River Basin for as long as we've been keeping records of the Missouri River Basin.   In my home state of Texas, Houston had 58 inches of rain, the landfall record for as long as we've been keeping them, and it was the third 500-year flood in just five years in that one community.  These floods, the fires that we see in California, the droughts in west Texas, in the panhandle, are happening at record levels of intensity and devastation.  They are claiming lives and property, and in some cases entire communities. And it's not happening through an act of God or because of Mother Nature.  It is us.  Our emissions, our excesses, our own inaction in the face of the facts and the science and the truth has produced these results.  And the trajectory that we are on right now will make the devastation that we just described pale in comparison unless we take action at this moment.   Scientists, those who are studying the same things that you are studying, tell us that we have 10 years within which to act, to free this country from a dependence on fossil fuels and fully embrace renewable energy, to make sure... (APPLAUSE) ... to make sure that this planet is habitable for the generations that follow us.  We were able to release a plan.  It is the most ambitious plan to confront climate change that this country has ever seen.  It gets us to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, halfway there by 2030.  It mobilizes $5 trillion over the next 10 years, not just to make sure that we adopt and innovate the next technologies for us and for the world, but to help those in Davenport and Pacific Junction, and on the front lines of climate change, weather these storms and floods as they come with greater frequency and greater devastation.   And then we elevate those communities, very often lower income communities and communities of color, that have borne the brunt of pollution and climate change over the decades that has been happening here in this country.  If we do all of that, all of us doing our part, including farmers, when we free technologies like precision-till and no-till agriculture, pay them for the public service and the environmental service of capturing carbon. When everyone in this country does their part, then this country can take its rightful role as the indispensable nation and convene the other powers of the planet together to make sure that we solve this otherwise intractable problem and that the United States leads the way.  That is what we will do in an O'Rourke administration, with your help.   (APPLAUSE) Thank you, appreciate it.  Thanks.   BASH:  Our next question comes from Patrick Bourgeaoq.  He is the assistant director of international admissions here at Drake University and currently supports Bernie Sanders.   QUESTION:  Good evening.   O'ROURKE:  Good evening.   QUESTION:  Recently you signed the no fossil fuel money pledge and have also returned donations in this campaign that do not conform to this pledge.  Considering you've received over the years more fossil fuel money than every politician except Ted Cruz, many might consider that to be too little, too late.  In light of your voting record, sometimes sympathetic to the fossil fuel industry, how do you as a Democrat defend your history of accepting fossil fuel money at such a high rate?  And why should we believe you won't continue voting their interests?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Thank you for the question.  Appreciate it.  Look, we've just talked about some of the historic challenges that we face in this country -- healthcare, an economy that's not working for everyone, climate change that's affecting us right now at this moment.  And it happens in a country that's never been more divided with a president who seeks to make us more divided than we are, in a democracy that is badly damage with a president who will stop at nothing to further undermine our democracy.   My entire life has been about bringing people together and ensuring that our democracy works.  Having town hall meetings like these, I had them every single week when I was on city council, every month when I was in Congress.  It's how we came up to the solutions to our challenges. Five years ago, I swore off all political action committee money, all grassroots campaigns for Congress.  And then last year in Texas, we led the largest grassroots effort in that state's history without a dime of PAC money, including from energy companies.  We were able to take a state that was 50th in voter turnout to one that is a contender in our national politics, and we did it by bringing everybody in, writing nobody off, taking no one for granted, Democrats, Republicans, independents alike.  It's that kind of ability to bring people together and fix our democracy that we need right now.   So you ask about the contributions that we received from those workers in the oil and gas industry in Texas.  I'm proud of those donations and I'm grateful for the very tough work that they do day in and day out.   But it turns out that we raised more money in the grassroots fashion that I just described than any Senate candidate in the history of the United States of America.  So we received contributions from that industry and every other single industry, but never from corporations, always from human beings, from real people, whose support allowed us to help transform our democracy and our politics in the state of Texas.  So thanks for asking me the question.  Appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) BASH:  And Patrick asked about your votes.  I want to ask you about one in particular when you were in Congress.  You voted to lift a ban on crude oil exports, calling it an outdated policy.  Now, the League of Conservation Voters called that vote ""anti-environment.""  Was it a mistake, that vote?   O'ROURKE:  I begin by telling you that I'm grateful to have -- to have had the support of the League of Conservation Voters in our race for Senate in Texas.  I think I have a near perfect score with that organization.   Yes, I'm happy with that vote.  Because, look, I drove here tonight in a Dodge Grand Caravan that is burning gasoline.  I want to make sure that this country for as long as we use fossil fuels -- and I just made the pledge to transition this country as quickly as we humanly can from them -- but for as long as we're using them, I want to make sure that we're independent of the need to obtain those fossil fuels from the Middle East or Venezuela, from these endless wars that we've been in, 28 years and counting in Iraq alone, and this president threatening to invade Venezuela, the country with the largest proven oil reserves. I'd rather those jobs and that exploration take place here in this country to satisfy our energy needs and the energy needs of others around the world.  I'd love to toughen the EPA standards to make sure that we're doing this in the most environmentally sound way and then long term, as quickly as possible, transition totally off of fossil fuels to renewable energy.   BASH:  OK, thank you so much.   O'ROURKE:  Thank you. BASH:  We're going to take another quick break.  Don't go anywhere. We're going to be right back more from Beto O'Rourke. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BASH:  Welcome back to Iowa.  We are live for a CNN Democratic presidential town hall with Beto O'Rourke.  I want to get straight to the audience for a question from Nick Johnston, who is the student body president right here at Drake University.  Nick? QUESTION:  Congressman. O'ROURKE:  Hey, Nick. QUESTION:  While in Congress, you voted against several measures aimed at punishing Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014.  If you're elected president, will you work to counter Russian aggression in the world?  And if so, how are we to believe you when your record suggests otherwise?   O'ROURKE:  Yeah, Nick, thank you for the question.   (APPLAUSE) You may be referring to a vote that I took against arming Ukraine in their war against Russia.  If you think we need to enter more wars right now, now that we're in Afghanistan and Syria and Yemen and Somalia and Iraq, and a half-dozen other countries, where we are taking the lives of others and putting the lives of U.S. servicemembers on the line, then let's go for it.   But if we think that we can resolve these challenges peacefully without using military force or putting our foreign policy on the backs of 19- and 20-year-old women and men in the greatest armed forces the world has ever known, then let's pursue that.   And I think we have a lesson from our former president, Barack Obama, greatest president of my lifetime, as far as I'm concerned...   (APPLAUSE) ... who, when faced with the threat of a nuclearized Iran, without firing a shot, invading yet another country in the Middle East, sat at the table with Iran, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, and Germany, to halt that country's progress towards a nuclear weapon, an imperfect agreement, but a hell of a lot better than starting yet another war for this country.   So, now, I want to make sure that we give diplomacy a chance.  But, look, if you're going to compare me or any other contender for the Democratic nomination against Donald Trump, who invited Vladimir Putin to invade our democracy, who defended him on that stage in Helsinki, Finland, instead of this country and our intelligence community, the first call that he made after the Mueller report was released to a foreign head of state was to Vladimir Putin, with whom he spent an hour on the phone and described the whole report as a hoax, we can do a lot better than this guy in holding Russia in check.  And I certainly plan to do that.  Yeah.  Thanks for asking. (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Just a quick follow on that.  You've just said it again, and you've called many times for an end to wars in the Middle East.  As commander-in-chief, when would you think it would be appropriate to authorize military force?   O'ROURKE:  Only when it is absolutely the last recourse for our country.  We should never put a U.S. servicemember's line on the life -- life on the line unless it is the only thing that we can do to protect the lives of our fellow Americans. And I don't want to be naive about the threats that are arrayed against us right now.  We still have a challenge with ISIS, against which we must remain vigilant.  We have other powers, like Russia, like China, like Iran, like North Korea that we have to make sure that we address.  Again, I want to make sure that we do that nonviolently, working with other partners in the region to do that.   But if war is the last recourse, and it's the thing that we must do to protect this country and our fellow Americans, then as commander-in- chief I will lead our servicemembers into war.  But I want to make sure that that's the absolute last option. BASH:  OK, thank you.  Let's go back to the audience and bring in James Stevens, who works in financial services.   O'ROURKE:  Hey, James.   QUESTION:  Good evening, Congressman. O'ROURKE:  Good evening. QUESTION:  The current administration has demonstrated to me an uncomfortable tolerance towards hate and bigotry in the country. There have been situations where the president could have categorically denounced hateful acts but did nothing.  As president, how would you stand up to hate?  And what are your thoughts on how we can better overcome hate in this nation?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Thank you, James.  Appreciate that.  Thank you for the question.   Not too long after President Trump was sworn in, we were picking up these Valentine's Day cards that a third-grade class at LBJ Elementary had done for veterans at the V.A.  We did this ever year that I was in Congress, connecting the youngest generation with the generations that had served before them.   And this third grade girl, as she's giving us the Valentine's Day cards, asks, why does the president not like me?  Now, she happened to be Mexican American.  She'd internalized his hatred and racism, the fact that he called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals.  I told that story in Houston, Texas.  And a family took me aside and  they said, that really resonated with us, because our third-grade daughter came home, and because we're Muslim, she asked if we were in the right country or we should go somewhere else, despite the fact that she was born in this country, as were her parents.  What does that do to that child's conception of herself or what she's capable of in this country, of whether she's even in the right place to begin with?   When a president calls Klansmen and Nazis and white supremacists ""very fine people,"" when he conflates the words of Representative Ilan Omar, who happens to be a Muslim member of Congress, with the attacks on 9/11, stoking Islamophobia and hatred -- and, yes, violence -- you begin to be able to explain the rise in hate crimes every single one of the last three years.   I'm making the case that the president of the United States of America right now does not just offend our ears or our sensibilities.  He makes possible the acts of violence and hatred that we're seeing play out in this country today.   I want to make sure that we don't just tolerate and respect one another and our differences, but that we embrace them.  That is how we become a stronger country, and that's what I will reflect as your president.  Thank you.  Appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) BASH:  Our next audience question comes from Tony Crnic, who is an attorney here in Des Moines.   QUESTION:  Good evening, Congressman.  I'm an attorney with a good- paying job and 10 years of experience.  I am still over $300,000 in debt because my parents could not afford my tuition.  Two-thirds of the debt is federal student loans, that the income base repayment plans make repaying much easier.  The other third is private student loans.  My question to you is, as president, what would you do to urge the private student loan companies to offer repayment plans similar to the government's income-based repayment plans?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Yeah.  Thank you.  This is a real crisis in our country and demands that it be met with the urgency required to solve it.  There's $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt right now, a default rate of close to 10 percent, which shows us that far too many are unable to shoulder this burden for very long.  They're literally sinking under the weight of it.  It's a drag on them, and it's a drag on our economy.   If we want to open up this economy to everyone and deal with the crisis that you just described, there are two big things that we can do.  The first is to stop digging the hole.  Let's make sure that you do not accumulate debt if you are attending a community college or a four-year university.  Let's make community free for everyone in this country.  And let's ensure that four-year college... (APPLAUSE) ... all costs, not just tuition, but room and board and books, can be finished debt free for those of modest and middle-income means, and others who are able to pay their way should do so. And then the other big thing that we can do is refinance, to your question, existing student loan debt at the lowest possible rates for everyone who has it right now, whether the issuer was the government or a private issuer.  And it's going to necessitate an investment on our part to do that, but it's an investment in your future and your ability to contribute even more to our shared success.   And then the other thing that we can do -- and I like this idea a lot -- is to vastly expand the public service loan forgiveness program. There are 45,000 unfilled positions at the V.A. right now.  That means that veterans are waiting not minutes or hours but weeks and months to get in to see a provider.  If you're willing to go work at the V.A. and fill one of those 45,000 clinical positions, let's wipe clean and clear your debt so you can focus on taking care of those servicemembers.   (APPLAUSE) So I think that's how we can meet this challenge.  Thanks. BASH:  So you mentioned that -- it's a total of $1.5 trillion in student debt out there.  Would you support any plan to forgive all of it?   O'ROURKE:  No, but I think I would start with those steps that we just described.  If you're willing to move back to your hometown, a small community, in an underserved job that's in demand, I want to make sure that you're rewarded for doing that, that you can focus on your family, your career, getting ahead, contributing to your community, by wiping clear that debt.   There are others who have the means to pay that back.  And I don't know that we want to be in the business of rewarding the very wealthiest in this country.   And there's another thing that we should keep in mind.  Not everyone wants to go to college.  So if you are going to be career-ready at the age of 18 or 19, I want to make sure that we empower and lift up unions in this country, connect you with that apprenticeship that will allow you to command the skill or a trade and a living wage for the rest of your life.   (APPLAUSE) So I want to make sure that we're including everyone in this economy, not just those who go to college, but all who want to make sure that they can contribute to their full potential.   BASH:  So how much are you thinking about, if you don't want to do all of it?  Let's just give this a real-world example.  You heard Tony say that he is $300,000 in debt.  Do you think that your plan, that includes public service, could wipe out his debt?   O'ROURKE:  It depends on the career that he chooses.  If it's a career of public service -- for example, we need more public defenders in this country.  We need them to be able to afford that incredibly important role in our judiciary and in our democracy.  And so I think there's public value and interest in that.   If that's not something that he chooses to do, refinancing that existing student loan debt at the lowest possible rate, the rate that banks lend to one another, makes a hell of a lot of sense to me.   So, look, we can do a lot better than we're doing right now.  We can relieve the burden that is crushing people.  And we can do it in an affordable way for this economy and this country.   BASH:  OK.  One more question.  We want to get to the audience, to Neena Hayreh.  Neena is a high school English teacher.  Neena? O'ROURKE:  Hey, Neena.  QUESTION:  Hello, Congressman. O'ROURKE:  English teachers unite and take over, yeah. QUESTION:  Yeah, that's right. (LAUGHTER) Both Republican and Democrats each have 70-year-old men as their frontrunners.  Do you think this country is ready and will vote for a Generation X president?   (APPLAUSE) O'ROURKE:  Neena, I'll just tell you that I have found my inspiration, my guidance, my leadership from the very youngest among us in our democracy.   This is our 34th college visit in the last eight weeks of this campaign.  Why do we keep coming to where the youngest people in this country are right now?  Because on issues of gun violence, they're the ones walking out of their classrooms and leading the Marches for Our Lives.   On the issues of climate, they're the ones demanding answers and not taking any prevaricating or any waiting or any excuses.  They're going to have action at this moment.  On making sure that everyone has healthcare, again, it is the young people, their urgency is something that compels me, inspires me and is a lead that I'm following. So I don't know that I need to comment on the ages of other presidential candidates.  I've just got to tell you that I am so optimistic about the future of this country because of those who are taking the leadership right now.  And very often they're in places like the one that we're in at Drake University.  So thank you for asking the question.  And I just want to add this one  other thing.  Though we've held more than 150 town halls, many of them at college campuses, answered hundreds of questions, and are here tonight with Dana and with all of you, I know that not everyone has been able to attend one of these. So we're opening up an opportunity through our campaign right now called Town Hall for America.  You can go to betoorourke.com and ask me any question that you want to, and I will do my best to answer each and every single one of those and get you an answer.  That level of accountability will make me a better candidate and I hope a better president for you and others.  So, thank you.   BASH:  Thank you so much.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you. Thank you to our audience here at Drake University.   (APPLAUSE) And I will be back next Thursday at 10:00 p.m. for another live town hall, this time with Senator Michael Bennet, and then on Sunday, June 2nd, mark your calendar for back to back to back Democratic town halls with Congressman Seth Moulton, Tim Ryan, and Eric Swalwell, all starting at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, GMA:  Virginia Beach massacre.  12 dead in America's latest mass shooting. MAYOR BOBBY DYER (R), VIRGINIA BEACH:  Today is Virginia Beach's darkest hour. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cevera joins us live.  And the special counsel breaks his silence. ROBERT MUELLER, FBI SPECIAL COUNSEL:  If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sparking new calls for impeachment -- SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander and chief. (APPLAUSE) STEPHANOPOULOS:  And more pressure on the Speaker. NANCY PELOSI (D), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  11 instances of possible obstruction of justice. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pelosi fears impeachment’s a trap that could help President Trump.  How will Democrats escape this dilemma?  Can they force Mueller to testify?  What are the consequences for 2020?  We'll ask Democratic Candidate Senator Michael Bennet, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff and one of the president's top defenders in Congress, Jim Jordan.  Plus, Martha Raddatz on the ground in Tehran for an exclusive interview with Iran's foreign minister. MARTHA RADDATZ, CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS:  If you did come back to the negotiating table, would you trust President Trump? STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the president threatens new tariffs on Mexico and China.  As he prepares to launch his re-election bid, how will the escalating trade wars impact the race?  Insight and analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.  We’ll break down the politics, smoke out the spin, the facts that matter this week. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From ABC News, it's THIS WEEK.  Here now, Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good morning and welcome to THIS WEEK.  We have a lot to get to this morning but we begin in an all-too-familiar place, mourning the victims of another mass shooting in America.  Here are the 12 killed in a government building in Virginia Beach late Friday.  Laquita Brown, Ryan Keith Cox, Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Joshua Hardy, Missy Langer, Richard Nettleton, Katherine Nixon, Christopher Kelly Rapp, Herb Snelling, Bobby Williams.  The victims and their loved ones in our thoughts this morning (ph). We will not name the shooter as we confront what has become a deadly epidemic.  And we begin with the police chief of Virginia Beach, James Cevera.  Chief Cevera, thank you for joining us this morning.  Our condolences to your entire community.  In addition to the 12 victims we also know there were four injured.  What more can you tell us about their condition this morning and the latest on the investigation? JAMES CEVERA, VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE CHIEF:  We do know that three of the victims who were wounded are still in critical condition.  One is in much better condition.  Our fingers are crossed and our prayers are going out that that winds up in a positive outcome for all of them.  As far as the investigation goes, we’re currently in what we call the evidence recovery mode.  The FBI has sent a team of some 40 investigators on our evidence recovery team to assist us.  Actually they now have the lead at this point. So all the forensic techs from out city, evidence recovery techs from the FBI are still in the crime scene, in the building.  I have to let you know it’s a large building and because it’s an older building, the inside is a honeycomb maze of offices that have been added and some deleted as time went on when the building was first constructed.  They’ve been in there for -- since the initial shooting and my -- my deep honor goes out to the work that they’re doing right now to put this whole case together from this end. STEPHANOPOULOS:  None of us want to give the shooter any more attention than he deserves but from what you’ve discovered so far, anything more on the motive or whether anything could have been done to prevent this tragedy? CEVERA:  We don’t have anything additional on the motive.  We’re now interviewing co-workers, witnesses, family members, anyone who will step forward maybe to give us some additional background.  I appreciate the fact that we’re not mentioning his name.  We did it once, that’s the last time we’re going to do it.  As far as additional information on the case, like I said, we’re working every angle we possibly could.  Remember this is an open government building and he’s an employee of the open government building, so he has access through his card to get into numerous places that the general public would not be allowed into, so he had full access to the building. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And he obtained the guns legally as well, at least some of them.  We know the shooter used a sound suppressor.  What difference did that make and do we need more restrictions on gun accessories like that? CEVERA:  The sound suppressor is just that.  So someone in one end of the building would not have heard a gunshot going off as opposed to another end of the building.  But again, this is a very large building.  That might not have been an issue in this particular case.  As far as, you know, more legislation on -- on gun issues, I’m a member of Major City Chiefs, we did publish something about a year and a half ago.  I don’t think most of that would have mattered in this particular case.  We do have the Second Amendment, it is very stringent for our country.  In this particular case the weapons were obtained legally, everything was done in a legal manner by this individual. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And your officers responded with their training quite quickly, saved lives. You've been in law enforcement now 44 years.  This has hit home for you and your force this morning.  What is your message to the country? CERVERA:  Well, my message is this: the first four officers that made entry, made entry into that building within few minutes of that initial call going out.  Other officers responded to search other parts of the building. The team that made the entry that eventually confronted the suspect, made that entry, began to clear out the first floor, realized where the suspect was on an additional floor.  They immediately engaged with him. It was a long gun battle, for lack of any other word, what we would call a long firefight.  They stood their ground.  They held their ground.  He was moving, they were moving, this wasn't something that you would think of in most police officer-involved shootings.  And also everyone has to remember, this isn't a choreongraphed movie or TV incident, it was real, it was violent, it was going on.  Those cops stuck themselves in that place to stop him from committing more carnage in that building.  One officer was wounded.  I checked with him yesterday, he's doing just fine.   And they were able to take the individual down. And yes, it was a fatality, but we also have to know when they realize he was injured, he was down, they then switched over to first aid for that particular individual, because cops across the country believe in the sanctity of life, and they belive that they're the ones that put themselves in harm's way for other individuals.  And that's exactly what those young cops did. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Every single day. Chief, thanks for very much for your time this morning. CERVERA:  Thank you, sir. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And we are now joined by Senator Michael Bennet, one of the 23 Democrats running for president this year.  Senator Bennet, thank you for joining us this morning.  You just heard the chief right there kind of laying out the difficulties facing those who are calling for moregun restrictions, like you.  What difference can a president make here?  We know President Obama supported more gun restrictions, couldn't get it done. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET, (D-CO) 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thanks, George, thanks for having me. I think a president can make a big difference here. Look, we just -- the House of Representatives have passed background checks to close the gun show loophole and the Internet loophole.  This person bought the guns lawfully as we know.  And every single fact pattern is going to be different. But we should pass those background checks.  90 percent of the American people support it.  But we know what's going to happen, which is the House has passed it, Mitch McConnell will not allow it to come to a vote in the Senate, and we will not have national background checks. After Columbine in Colorado, the people of this western state voted to close the gun show loophole and the Internet loophole.  That was 20 years ago, George, and every single year about 2 or 3 percent of the people that try to buy a gun in Colorado are stopped.   And these these people are rapists and murderers and convicted felons of one kind of another.  And it's impossible to argue that our state is not safer as a result of this law. So, my hope is that if McConnell does not take this on the floor, that the America people, and the people of Kentucky, will hold him accountable for that and that we can actually put leadership in the Senate and the White House that will do something about this. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You're not the only Coloradoan in the race, your former boss when he was mayor of Denver, John Hickenlooper, is also running.  Of course he was governor of Colorado as well.  And yesterday, he got a pretty rough reception at the California Democratric convention when he denounced socialism.  I want to show it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HICKENLOOPER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF COLORADO:  Let me be clear, if we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big, progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.  I was re-elected... (BOOING) (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: You heard those boos right there.  You know, at State of the Union, you applaudedPresident Trump when he said America will never be a socialist country.  Are you worried that you and John Hickenlooper are out of step with the base of your party? BENNET:  Well, I think John might not wanted to have denounce socialism in San Francisco, that might be the last place that you'd want to do it. I don't think I'm out of step.  I was not applauding Donald Trump, I was applauding the idea that  this country will not become a socialist country.  I think we have 230 years of being the longest lived democracy on the planet, that's something we need to preserve, and it is becoming harder and harder for us because we have had 40 years of no economic mobility in the United States, 90 percent of the American people, 90 percent, George, have not shared in the economic growth over the last 40 years.  For them those periods of economic growth has acted as an recession and as a result they can't afford the basic components of the middle class life. And on top of that, if you’re poor in this country, your chances of getting into the middle class are lower today than they’ve been in generations.  That is tearing at our democracy.  And if we don’t figure out a way to begin to address that, to reestablish in this country the idea that, when the economy grows, everybody’s income grows, we’re going to have real problems. And so, I don’t think we need to call it socialism or not – doesn’t matter.  What we need is a country where everybody has a share in our prosperity. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But it’s not only rhetorical difference.  There are real substantive differences as well.  He was also booed when he took on the idea of Medicare for all, that it’s going to take away private health insurance from so many millions of Americans.  That’s your position as well.  Again, the base of the party seems to be going in another direction. BENNET:  Well, actually, I think the Twitter universe in the party is going in another direction.  The base of the party that I’ve – I’ve been meeting with in New Hampshire, Iowa, and just yesterday in South Carolina, they don’t think we should take insurance away from 180 people.  They absolutely, categorically do not agree that Bernie is right on that.  And I don’t think Bernie’s right on that.  I think he’s wrong. I remember when we voted on Obamacare, I was there and we all said ""If you like your insurance, you can keep it"" and thousands of people in the country lost it because they had insurance that didn’t prevent people with preexisting conditions from being bounced from their health insurance and it was a political catastrophe.  Now we’re saying ""Look, if you like your insurance, the Democrats are going to take it away from you and replace it with a government plan."" That’s not going to be acceptable to people.  If you want universal healthcare, which I do, I just – I just had a prostate cancer operation myself and I feel very strongly about this.  If we want universal healthcare, I think we’re a lot better off saying to the American people, you have an option.  For your family and for you to decide whether you want to be on a public plan, mine is called Medicare X, or on a nonprofit plan which is what I’m now, Kaiser, or a for-profit plan. If we tell the American people we have to take it away from you before you can have universal healthcare, it’s never going to work.  And that’s not because, by-the-way, single payer is a bad idea.  It’s because we have an existing system of insurance today.  If we had no existing system, I think we should be having a different conversation.  But I just – yeah. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know you’re hoping to be the – I know you’re hoping to be the nominee.  So is Bernie Sanders.  Can you support him as a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination? BENNET:  I absolutely can support him and I can support him wholeheartedly if it means we’re going to beat Donald Trump. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You think a Democratic socialist can beat Donald Trump? BENNET:  Well, I think the only way we’re going to lose to Donald Trump is if we disqualify ourselves.  And that’s why – that’s why these issues around how we approach universal healthcare, how we approach climate change, we – as Democrats, we have to build a broad constituency in the country not just of Democrats but independents and Republicans to overcome Trump.  We should never have lost to Trump. We lost to a climate-denier.  He should have been disqualified from office just on the basis of that yet we lost on a jobs argument to a guy who is threatening to – or, you know, promising to drag us back into the 19th century.  We have to – go ahead. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To make this case, you’re going to have to get on the debate stage.  Right now, you’re having – you haven’t qualified yet.  There are two criteria; 65,000 donors, want to show a chart here from 05/38, 65,000 donors.  You need 1 percent in at least three national polls.  They say it could be tough for you to make this debate, even tougher to make the third debate where they’re going to double those criteria.  You confident you’re going to be able to get on? BENNET:  Well, I hope so.  I only got in the race four weeks ago, so, George, I’m behind and anybody who wants to help, we’d love to have the help.  But I also think – I hope the DNC sort of takes a look at this and reconsiders.  I mean, I have won two really tough races in Colorado, a swing state, a purple state in the west.  I’ve chaired the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, I raised a record amount of money while I was doing that.  I’ve been in the Senate for 10 years and I think the tragedy for adding voices to the Democracy, if we’re basing it just on what people can raise on the internet in just a handful of weeks, I just don’t think it makes any sense. I mean, you should see, George, the e-mails that people are sending out to try to get fundraising contributions.  I mean, the desperation is unbelievable and has nothing to do with putting Democrats into a strategic posture to win the White House from Donald Trump, which is where we need to be. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Senator Bennet, thanks for your time this morning … BENNET:  At least I think that’s where we need to be. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you for sharing your views this morning. BENNET:  Thanks for having me. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Up next, tensions high between the United States and Iran.  Martha Raddatz is in Tehran for an exclusive interview with Iran’s foreign minister.  We’ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Martha Raddatz was able to enter Iran for an exclusive interview with the foreign minister.  She joins us now from Tehran, good morning Martha. MARTHA RADDATZ, CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS:  Good morning, George.  We have not been here since Donald Trump was elected and pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal, and what a difference we have seen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) It was nearly four years ago that the Iran nuclear deal was announced, we were on the streets of Tehran that night surrounded by Iranian people full of hope. These people are so happy that these punishing sanctions will eventually be lifted. And sanctions were lifted, double digit growth quickly followed, but today in Tehran there is little to celebrate.  With the sanctions back in place, the Iranian economy is in dramatic distress. Here in Tehran’s grand bazaar, there seems to be all kinds of goods and plenty of food, but the problem is now the prices are astronomical. Prices for red meat and poultry are 57 percent higher, vegetables 47 percent, milk, cheese and eggs a 37 percent increase. What have the sanctions done to you? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Very bad, very bad. RADDATZ:  Among the young people here, a majority of the population fears of war seem to be dwarfed by the crippled economy. Are you worried about finding a job? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I’m actually worried about everything in my life right now, because I cannot see any future ahead of me. RADDATZ:  We asked Iran’s foreign minister about Trump’s so called maximum pressure campaign when we sat down with him this morning. It looks like it’s having a devastating effect on the economy. JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Well President Trump has called it in fact economic war, I call it economic terrorism, and the reason I call it economic terrorism is that it targets ordinary Iranian people. RADDATZ:  President Trump says he wants to talk, he has invited Iranian officials to give him a call.  How likely is that? ZARIF:  It’s not very likely, because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure.  He is imposing pressure, this may work in a real estate market, it does not work in dealing with Iran. RADDATZ:  If you did come back to the negotiating table, would you trust the United States?  Would you trust President Trump? ZARIF:  The last experience was not very optimistic and does not provide an optimistic perspective for a future agreement.  So this is what I believe is happening to the national community, that is people think twice before they talk to the United States because they know that what they agree to, they may not hold to mark. RADDATZ:  On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran is in compliance with the original nuclear deal, but the IAEA is also raising questions about new centrifuges in Iran and the U.S. has accused Iran or its proxies of sabotaging four oil tankers near the Persian Gulf, charges Zarif disputes. If the United States decides to declassify some of its intelligence, if they show images which some officials say exist of cruise missiles being put on small Iranian boats, will you simply dismiss that and not believe it? ZARIF:  No, no, no, I believe – you see we call this place the Persian Gulf for a reason, so it’s next to us, we have the right to defend ourselves.  Just imagine if Iran were to come to California coast or to come to Florida coast, how do you feel (ph) – how would you treat that? These ships are located very close to our waters, we have the right to put whatever missiles we want to put on them. RADDATZ:  You’ve talked about escalation and that there would be dangerous consequences.  What kind of consequences are you talking about with the United States? ZARIF:  Well I like to keep President Trump guessing because he likes everybody in the world to keep on guessing about what is happening in the United States.  You hear to – one day something coming from the White House, the next day something else coming from the State Department. Since they want us to continue guessing, let them continue guessing too. RADDATZ:  What would you say to President Trump? ZARIF:  I’ve said it before, threats against Iran never work.  Never threaten an Iranian, try respect.  That may work. (END VIDEO CLIP) RADDATZ:  Foreign Minister Zarif says Iran would only act out of self defense, but that can have a very broad definition.  George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And it doesn’t sound like a lot of negotiations anytime soon.  Martha, thanks very much, when we come back after Robert Mueller’s surprise press conference, the debate over impeachment front and center in the House.  We’ll take that on next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  The impeachment debate is next with Congressssman Adam  Schiff and Jim Jordan.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUELLER:  The opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The opinion says you cannot indict a -- a president while he's in office but he could have reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Very different views there from William Barr, Robert Mueller.  Want to talk about that now with Congressman Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee.  Chairman Schiff, thank you for joining us this morning.  I know you're coming to us from San Francisco this morning, site of that state convention yesterday.  And I want to show everyone House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking at that convention and almost getting drowned out by calls for impeachment.  Let’s listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI:  The report lays out of 11 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president of the United States.  As -- (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  And now, you've been supporting the speaker as she holds the line against impeachment but the pressure is building.  Can you hold the line? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  Well, look, I think we're going to do what's right for the country and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion and I haven't had either it's best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know is destined for failure in the Senate.  Now that calculus may change if the president continues to stonewall, if the president continues to demonstrate his unfitness for office.  There may be little additional cost to going through that process. It is in a way, even if unsuccessful in the Senate, the ultimate form of censure in the House.  But we’re not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.  We have an important legislative agenda to try to advance, we have important oversight work we can do outside the context of impeachment, and I think at this point that is still the preferred course. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But it would still -- it could still strengthen your hand against the Department of Justice in court and -- and opening an inquiry isn't the same as reaching a final judgment on impeachment.  Why does the evidence laid out by Mueller require at least opening up that inquiry? SCHIFF:  Well of course Mueller didn't say that what he was presenting required impeachment in the same way he didn’t comment on the question of indictment.  And by the way, I think Bill Barr is completely disingenuous in saying that it would have been perfectly fine for Mueller to say the president was a criminal, I just can't indict him.  If that’s the way Barr feels, then perhaps he should let the Southern District of New York know that they can say, individual 1, the president of the United States should be charged when he leaves office. But in terms of the -- the impeachment process, it's not mandated by the Constitution.  We can avail ourselves of this when the president demonstrates acts that are high crimes or misdemeanors.  It is certainly true, I think that much of his conduct qualifies for that.  But at the same time, we have to recognize the reality that one party, the Republican party has turned itself into a cult of the president's personality and is not likely to act consistent with its Constitutional obligations.  And we have to figure out in that context, is this the right thing for the country, and I'm just not convinced, not yet, that that's the case. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What might help there is hearing from Robert Mueller before the Congress.  Where do things stand with getting his testimony? SCHIFF:  Well I was disappointed to see during his statement the other day such a profound reluctance to testify.  Now, I understand that but I think he has one last service to perform.  It’s not enough merely to speak for 10 minutes and say I’m not going to answer questions for the Congress and the American people.  There are a great many things that are not in the report. We want to find out what happened to those counterintelligence findings that were sent back to  headquarters.  What other things did you learn during the investigation that ought to concern us in terms of whether the president is vulnerable to influence from Russia.  Does the president still -- did you find evidence whether the president still intends to build a Trump Tower in Moscow?  Is that why that financial inducement why the president can't criticize Putin or take adequate steps to protect our elections? There are any number of questions that we have every right, the American people have every need to have answered here. So, I hope that Bob Mueller will understand, as painful as it may be, and as much as it may subject him to further abuse by the White House, he has a final duty here to perform, like any other witness, and it's my hope that he will do so, and it's my hope that he will do so voluntary. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And if he doesn't, subpoena? SCHIFF:  Well, it will be my recommendation, yes, but I hope that is not the case.  That will be a decision, really, that we'll have to make collectively and with our leadership whenever there's use of compulsion, because it may lead to litigation.  But I would hope none of that is necessary.  That's not how this process for Bob Mueller should end.  He's a dedicated public servant and I hope that he'll come and testify voluntarily. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Meantime the attorney general has made it pretty clear that he's going to continue this investigation of the investigation.  Here he was earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES:  Sometimes people can convince themselves that what they're doing is in the higher interest, the better good, they don't realize what they're doing is really antithetical to the democratic system we have. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  He hasn't reached a final judgment, but he's made it pretty clear he's suspicious something went very wrong at the start of this investigation. SCHIFF:  Well, ironically, of course, that statement you heard from Bill Barr is a perfect  description of his own conduct.  He's willing to cavalierly throw out terms like spying and pretend he doesn't know just how pejorative that term is.  He is a smart man and understands exactly how incendiary what his allegation is, and it's designed to be.  That's why he is, I think, falling into such legitimate criticism for acting as effectively a henchman of the president. You don't talk cavalierly about intelligence agencies or the FBI spying on presidential campaigns.  And given how much he mislead the country about Mueller's own report and findings, we can sadly expect that given this power to declassify information now, he will do in a selective way designed to mislead the country and the president's service.  And there may be no opportunity for rebuttal this time.  There will be no further Mueller report that will set straight this selective declassification that he may put into effect and the fact that he will say -- he doesn't want to speculate about what went on early in the investigation until he knows, but he's willing to speculate that it was spying, tells you all you need to know about how disingenuous he's being with the country. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Chairman Schiff, thanks for your time this morning. SCHIFF:  Thank you, George. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Let's hear from the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan from Ohio.  Thank you, congressman,m for joining us this morning. You just heard Chairman Schiff there, very suspicious of the attorney general. REP. JIM JORDAN, RANKING MEMBER, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE JUCIDIARY COMMITTE (R) OHIO:  Attorney general is going to get to bottom of this thing.  He said four things six weeks ago in from the Senate Finance Committee, George, four things I thought were very important.   First, he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI.  That is definitely true.  Comey fired, McCabe fired, under investigation, lied three times under oath, Chief Counsel Jim Baker demoted, then left the FBI, currently under investigation by the Justice Department, Lisa Page demoted and left the FBI counsel, and of course deputy head of counterintelligence Peter Strzok demoted and then fired. So, there was definitely a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. Then he said three other things that everyone should pay attention to.  He said spying did occur.  He said, second, that there's a basis for his concern about the spying that took place.  And then maybe most important, he used two terms that should scare all your viewers.  He used the unauthorized surveillance and political surveillance.  And he's going to find out if all of that actually happened.  The evidence seemed to suggest that it did. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we don't know that yet, but we will find out from his review what they find. Meantime, we've also heard from Robert Mueller.  He laid out four incidents in the obstruction of justice section of the report that met all three criteria for obstruction of justice -- an obstructive act, connection to an investigation, corrupt intent.  Does that concern you? JORDAN:  Look, Bob Mueller had 22 months, $30 million, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas.  If he could have accomplished obstruction, he would have done it.  He couldn't do it, that wasn't his finding, regardless of what the officer of counsel told him at the -- at the Department of Justice what they can do with a sitting president or not, if he could have established obstruction of justice, he would have done it.  He didn't do it.  Bill Barr said that, that there wasn't obstruction of justice, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the same darn thing. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well that’s not what Robert Mueller said, though, and he laid out the evidence.  Are you going to -- are you concerned enough to take a look at the evidence? JORDAN:  No, I’ve read the -- I’ve read the report, I’m looking at the evidence, but what I want to look at -- and this is what Bill Barr wants to look at, this is what John Durham is now charged with finding.  I want to look how this whole thing started.  I want to look why they put someone next to George Padapoulos, someone pretending to be somebody else, this Azra Turk individual to find out what was going -- I want to -- I want to learn about that.  I want to learn about why they didn't tell the FISA court.  This is something I want to ask Bob Mueller if he ever comes and testifies.  Did you actually explore the dossier? They took the dossier to the secret court, didn't tell the court the Clinton campaign paid for the document, didn’t tell the court the guy who wrote it, Christopher Steele, had told the FBI he was desperate to Trump.  So I want to -- I want to find out about that and I know Bill Barr wants to as well, and that’s why he’s doing the investigation he’s doing. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They did say that there was indication of political motive behind the funding the dossier.  But you just said you wanted to hear from Robert Mueller, so you believe he should testify? JORDAN:  I mea, that's up to Jerry Nadler.  I know this, I got questions for him.  I think the one question most Americans want to know, when did you first learn there was no obstruction -- or excuse me, no collusion?  The -- the central charge of Bob Mueller -- the central task was to find if there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia -- STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, he says he didn't look at collusion.  That’s not what he said.  When he spoke in his report, it says very clearly he didn't examine that question.  What he did say is that he could not establish a conspiracy between the Trump -- Trump campaign and Russia. JORDAN:  Say -- OK -- so when did you know there was no conspiracy, no coordination, no -- call it what you want, those -- those have been interchangeable for the last two years.  So when did you know there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia?  We knew when we deposed Jim Comey -- when we deposed Jim Comey, he said all the way up until the day he was fired, May 9, 2017, he told us they had no evidence of any type of conspiracy, collusion or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.  And that was after 10 months of FBI investigating him.  That was after -- that was after putting Azra Turk next to George Papadopoulos, that was after using the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign via Carter Page. So after 10 months if they couldn’t establish collusion, how long did it take Bob Mueller.  And if you learned this early on, why did you wait almost two years before you told the country there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election?  After all, that was your central focus, your central task of this entire special counsel investigation. STEPHANOPOULOS:  So -- JORDAN:  So that’s a question I think the whole country has for Bob Mueller. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He didn't -- he didn’t bring in an indictment of Roger Stone until the end of the process.  You don’t know that he didn’t -- that he had reached that conclusion early. JORDAN:  I don't know.  But -- but I do know what Jim Comey told us and he said after 10 months of the FBI looking into this, they had no evidence of any type of coordination, conspiracy or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the 2016 election.  So after 10 months he didn’t know, how long did it take Bob Mueller with 19 witness -- or 19 lawyers, most of them were Democrats who were out to get the president, how long did it take him to figure it out?  That just -- I think that's a question most members and frankly most people in this country would have for Bob Mueller.  So if he comes, that’s something that’s going to get asked. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We will see if he testifies.  Congressman, thanks for your time this morning. JORDAN:  You bet. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Roundtable’s up next.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:  Democrats can no more keep a promise to take us back to the 2000s or the 1990s than conservatives can keep a promise to take us back to the 1950s. REP. ERIC SWALLWELL (D), CALIFORNIA:  Let’s invest in hope in these places.  We don’t need a crime bill, we need a hope bill. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses.  But our country is in a time of crisis.  The time for small ideas is over. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Democratic state convention yesterday in California, Democrats taking their first shots at the frontrunner, Joe Biden, their veiled shots, perhaps.  Let’s talk about it on our roundtable joined by our chief political analyst, Matthew Dowd.  Rachael Bade, congressional reporter for the Washington Post, Lanhee Chen, policy director for the Romney 2012 campaign, now a fellow at Sanford’s Hoover Institution and Jen Psaki, Democratic strategist who was communications director for President Obama. And that is interesting to watch the footage yesterday from the Democratic convention out there in California.  It does appear that we’re heading into a new phase of this Democratic race. MATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, and I think everybody should keep in mind that every time we show an audience in one place, it doesn’t necessarily represent the broad audience in some allowance (ph). I take California Democratic Party activists are much different than somebody in New Hampshire. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well you heard – you have Michael Bennet call them the Twitter Democrats. DOWD:  And I think still that we don’t understand fully what – where they really want, do they want a new progressive, do they want establishment ground (ph), I think that’s still unknown. I think we are in a new era and a new time, mainly because we’re about to start the debates.  And I think those debates are really what’s going to just separate from sort of the top four or five from everybody else. And I think the first one’s, you know, this month, then July and then the ones that are on ABC – ABC in September.  I think that’s the time when somebody that’s not in the top tier right now can break through and come through in this, or Elizabeth Warren could separate herself from Bernie Sanders and how Joe Biden does. I think the debates will determine really more fundamentally anything else where we go. STEPHANOPOULOS:  In the mean time, a fundamental question, Jen, for Joe Biden of course you worked with when you were in the White House, it’s posed by Dan Balz in the Washington Post this morning, can he be the candidate of change which usually works for Democrats? JEN PSAKI, FORMER OBAMA COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  It’s more challenging for him no doubt.  I think, you know, he was criticized for not going to California, he made a decision to go to Ohio and that’s a strategic call. But I think for Joe Biden, I’ve watched a lot of his speeches, he’s appealing to people, people like him.  But a lot of it feels like the kind of speeches that John Kerry gave in 20014.  And I think he’s going to need to update his message, he’s going to need to give a more forward looking message. I think they’re thinking about that internally which is good, but right now he’s – they’re factoring in nothing changing with the rest of the field.  And as Matt said, I think the debates – seeing some of these candidates rise and have their own moment, some of these candidates that have been doing a lot of town halls, are very fresh with the kind of questions that will come up like Pete Buttigieg or even Beto O’Rourke who’s been a little off the radar. They could have good moments in the debates and I think Joe Biden has to be prepared for that. STEPHANOPOULOS:  One of the debates that’s already breaking through, Rachel Bade, you covered on Capital Hill, this debate over impeachment.  We saw Nancy Pelosi kind of get drowned out there, but within her caucus she still has a lot of support. RACHEL BADE, WASHINGTON POST CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER:  That’s right and pressure is building on her, there’s no doubt about it, after Robert Mueller came out and basically said verbally what he had written which was that he didn’t feel he could make a decision on obstruction and basically kicked to Congress. People saw that as a referral and more and more Democrats are coming out.  But Pelosi’s the boss and Pelosi doesn’t want to go there.  She is still worried that the Senate would acquit him and there’s all evidence showing that they would. And, you know, there’s sort of a split screen right now, you’re seeing actually in these swing districts there’s a lot of attention being paid to California and, you know, what happened yesterday with people saying impeach, impeach, impeach. But, you know, I was out in some of these Trump districts that are held by Democrats that make up Pelosi’s majority this week, nobody was talking about Mueller, nobody was bringing up impeachment, and that is exactly why Pelosi doesn’t want to go there. She’s worried it will blow back. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And that is why she calls it a gift to Donald Trump.  It is really a gift?  Does he really want to be impeached? LANHEE CHEN, ROMNEY-RYAN 2012 CAMPAIGN POLICY DIRECTOR:  I think it’s a gift because it feeds into the kind of energy that the president – you know, on the campaign trail, when he’s out there doing events, the more he’s able to feed on that energy from Democrats who say yes they want to impeach me, yes they only want to come after me, I think that does help his cause. I think that is frankly really in his wheelhouse in terms of how he appeals to his electorate.  More broadly speaking though I think that the challenge for Democrats is presenting an alternate vision, right. That really is what this campaign needs to be about, and the more they’re talking about impeachment, the more they’re talking about Trump and Mueller, the less opportunity I think they have to present that issue. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That’s a fair point, but Matt, how do they balance this out?  I mean for a lot of Democrats who’ve read the whole report, they look at those instances of obstruction of justice, say you can’t send the message that a president is above the law. How do they balance out the politics which could be negative of impeachment versus their responsibilities as members of Congress? DOWD:  Well first I think that both sides of the aisle I think should be confronting this.  We have a tendency to ask the Democrats what are you going to do on impeachment?  What are you going to do on impeachment?  And we let the Republicans off the hook, like you’re not doing anything. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well and you saw Congressman Jordan is very comfortable saying he’s not concerned. DOWD:  Yes, other – as opposed to his – one of his members, Justin Amash who basically said well you ought to start running this.  And I think that’s a question too for the Republican side of the aisle is do you – are you unwilling to hold the Republicans accountable in any of this? I think the Democrats have – I mean if you listen to the Democrats on the campaign trail, they talk very little about impeachment and they talk a lot about a lot of issues, guns which is obviously in the news today, healthcare and a lot of – number of other issues. I think there is a way to talk about this which is basically, the president should be held accountable.  Impeachment is one option.  Impeachment is one option but there are many other options to hold the president accountable and we as a Congress are going to both legislate, pass legislation, that we’ve tried to do over the course of the last three months, and investigate.  And I think that’s the way to talk about this. Just say ""Impeachment is one option but the president needs to be held accountable."" STEPHANOPOULOS:  And is it inevitable?  Is Speaker Pelosi, as more events unfold over the coming months, perhaps the testimony of Robert Mueller, going to have no choice but to at least open proceedings? PSAKI:  Well, I think the door is still open.  And the perception that Pelosi has closed the door, I think, is wrong and same with many moderate Democrats out there.  There is certainly a building – a building support for impeachment but I think Pelosi also – I mean, she has gotten to where she is because she has very astute political instincts and she knows how to get rid of opponents.  Her calculation is this is not the way to do it. And if that doesn’t change, I don’t think her position is going to change and she’ll still have members with her. STEPHANOPOULOS:  One of the questions will be, will she be able to get Robert Mueller to testify?  You’ve spent a lot of time talking to members about that this week. BADE:  Yes, they’re in a pickle because everybody thought, after the report came out, that Mueller would be the one bright spot.  They knew they would be going to war with the White House, they knew the White House was going to try to block testimony from aides that had talked to him, documents, but everybody thought Mueller would come in.  And you know, he’s made it clear he doesn’t want to and there’s a reluctance, you can see it – I hear it when I talk to my sources, that – about subpoenaing him. I mean, he’s basically saying that they might have to, right?  Because he’s not willing to appear in public, right?  But they don’t want – it to look like he did something wrong.  There’s a concern that they could look over-aggressive, there’s a concern that they could bog down their investigations by getting caught in this back-and-forth.  And some people frankly, privately, want to kind of move on. And so, this is an issue, though, because Americans overwhelmingly – think 3/4 of Americans in the latest polling want to see Mueller testify.  They want to hear from him.  And when he speaks he has an impact.  We saw that last week.  And so, it’s an issue for them. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Meantime, William Barr is really filling that vacuum.  Do you think that Robert Mueller, at some level, misjudged his old friend and colleague, William Barr, and was almost surprised by the lengths that Barr would go to in the way he characterized the Mueller report? CHEN:  Perhaps.  Perhaps, I mean I think it’s always difficult because now the Attorney General’s maybe in a different position than when he and Mueller first developed that relationship.  But look, I think the question on Mueller is, do we actually think he’s going to say anything else of substance?  I mean, he’s already come out and said, look, the report speaks for itself.  Maybe if they have him in closed session, he might say a few other things.  But he’s aware of the fact that he’s restricted from revealing what might be a currently operative case.  If there’s grand jury information, he’s probably not allowed to reveal that either. So, what do we really expect Bob Mueller’s going to tell us or tell members of Congress that’s really actionable in moving the ball forward on … STEPHANOPOULOS:  Does TV (ph) make a difference? BADE:  It does, though, because a lot of Americans have not read the report. PSAKI:  Yes. BADE:  And, you know – and that is – having him up there at a – at the witness stand, talking about Don McGahn getting a call from the president and saying you’ve got to get rid of Mueller.  That – people watch – there’s a difference – you know, the Democrats are saying there’s a difference between reading the book and watching the blockbuster film.  And I think we saw that last week. DOWD:  Well, and that’s what I think ultimately Bob Mueller’s message was is, listen, you have everything you need, just read the report.  Right?  His message was, I got the thing done, I put it all together.  Congress, do your job.  Read the report.  Read the report.  Read the report.  And I think you’re right.  I think the vast majority of Americans haven’t read the report.  I would bet the vast majority of people in Washington D.C. sitting in power in the halls of Congress have not read – fundamentally read the report. I think Bob Mueller’s right.  You have what you need, now decide. PSAKI:  I would say this is a clear, easy call for Democrats.  I think – I was very surprised by how muted they were when Mueller said he wasn’t going to testify.  They need to push on it, they need to subpoena him if needed.  It’s about repeating what’s in the report because people aren’t paying attention, but there are some clear questions that can be asked that he can give yes or no answers to.  He can give a little bit more context.  There’s more that needs to be said. And I think, for him, we owe him a great deal of thanks but his duty as public service, as Adam Schiff said, is not done and we can’t accept it.  You can’t say you’re not letting the president of the United States off the hook and then drop the mic and go on vacation.  He owes us more. BADE:  This also relates to impeachment as well because, you know, Democrats say they need to build the case to the public.  The public is not on board with impeachment right now.  But in order to do that, if they want to do that, they’ve got to have people testifying, they have to have people in the witness chair and they don’t – they haven’t had anyone yet … STEPHANOPOULOS:  (Inaudible) DOWD:  If I were – if I were the Democrats, George, tomorrow morning the thing I’d be talking about is gun reform.  After what happened in Virginia Beach, I would just say ""OK, we can give this a break for 24 hours about Bob Mueller.""  But we’ve now had another tragedy, we’ve passed a bill in the House of Representatives, it may not do everything, it will do something, it’s time to act for Republicans on this. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Meantime, the president is talking about tariffs and Mexico, about to relaunch his campaign as well in a couple of weeks.  And Lanhee, I want to talk to you about that.  He’s got clear sailing now except for (inaudible) on the Republican side, John Kasich this week said he’s not going to challenge him.  Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, said he’s not going to challenge him.  The economy, so far still a strength for the president.  Is he putting it at risk with these calls on tariff on China and Mexico. CHEN:  You know, I think this is the big challenge for the president is that is he trading off some short-term potential gains for really long-term trouble in the economy?  If you think about the tariffs, there's an argument in short run, he gets Mexico to table on immigration, it certainly seems like President Lopez Obrador is saying  we're willing to make some concessions on immigration.  But in the long term, does that mean he doesn't get USMCA, the revised NAFTA trade deal, which really would be important for the economy.  Does it mean with China, for example, he wants that short-term deal at the expense of the longer term relationship with China. I think that's really the big X-factor for this president in this coming election is what's going to happen to the economy?  And how much of this is going to end up being self-inflicted.  I think the president has an opportunity here to focus on some of these economic themes, but by mixing, for example, immigration with trade now, I really think he's putting that at jeopardy. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Hitting some of his own voters, farmers, across the Midwest.  Also, the stock market is not the economy, but since he's been talking about these tariffs over the last months, about a 5, 6 percent drop. PSAKI:  That's right.  And I think the politics of the economy is to build on what you were saying, what you just eluded to.  I mean, the imports are not just avocados, right, they are auto parts and trucks and manufacturing parts, and states like Michigan and parts of the Midwest, as you said, there are places in the country that will be deeply impacted, could be deeply impacted, by these tariffs.  It also won't address the root cause issues. So maybe in the short-term Mexico may come to table, I don't know, I'll be surprised.  But at the same time, he's still threatening to cut off funding to Honduras and a lot of these country people are coming over because they're facing such terrible conditions.   So, this is a short-term gain in that regard even as well. DOWD:  I think his instincts on the trade deals back in the campaign were actually right on, which is the trade deals over the last 20 years have not necessarily benefited working-class people.  Whatever those trade deals were.  And there's a lot of people... STEPHANOPOULOS:  They certainly don't feel they have. DOWD:  And especially in the industrial Midwest where he put together -- where they felt suffered under these trade deals that helped big business but did not necessarily help the working class. But I agree with Lanhee, there doesn't seem to be real strategy here, a long-term strategy of how do we put together deals, and if we should use tariffs and how do we revise these deals? STEPHANOPOULOS:  To build on that point, the president just hours before he announced those tariffs had actually signaled to congress he wanted them to try to work on the revised NAFTA. BADE:  Yeah, bipartisan, both Republicans and Democrats, are very confused by these moves.  I think the one strategy we could see from this is that, again, reinforcing the 2020 for Trump is all about immigration and following through on a campaign promise to do something at the border.  He has gotten rid of a whole bunch of leaders at DHS, he has used an emergency declaration to build the wall, he has threatened to cut off aid to these countries where the migrants are coming from, nothing is working.  And so now he's trying to shift the blame to Mexico to say it's their fault. But really what needed to happen was he needed to do a bipartisan deal with congress, and he walked away from the table on immigration when it came to a bipartisan deal a lot, several times over the past few years. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And that seems like that's not going to happen any time soon.   That is all we have time for today.  Thank you all very much Before we go, we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice. In the month of May, one service member died overseas supporting operations in Afghanistan. And that's all for us today.  Thank you for sharing part of your Sunday with us.  Check out World News Tonight.  And I'll see you tomorrow on GMA.

The tragic murder of four and suicide last weekend causes me to write to publicize the availability of a gun removal order. This law arose in the aftermath of the 2014 mass shooting in Isla Vista in which six people were killed despite the family’s efforts to warn police that the shooter posed a danger to others.

6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/us/david-briscoe-santa-fe-shooting.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs After last year’s mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, a man calling himself David Briscoe described how he had heroically barricaded the door of the classroom he was teaching in and instructed students to lie down and cover their mouths as gunshots rang out nearby. But the school district said Monday that the story was false, and no one by that name had ever worked for the school. Multiple news organizations included quotations attributed to Mr. Briscoe after the May 2018 shooting that killed 10 and wounded 13. He said he was a substitute English teacher and that the massacre took place on only his third day teaching at the school. “I barricaded the door with desks and tables and shut the lights,” CNN quoted him as saying. In an article that has since been updated to remove Mr. Briscoe’s account, CNN also reported that he said he had “heard what sounded like a student getting hit by a bullet.” The story fell apart when The Texas Tribune began making inquiries following a phone interview in April and discovered that it appeared Mr. Briscoe was never at the site of the shooting. “We can confirm that there has never been an employee (part-time or full-time), substitute, vendor, contractor or intern working in Santa Fe ISD named David Briscoe,” Lindsey Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Sante Fe Independent School District, said in an email. The district’s superintendent, Leigh Wall, said on Monday that the apparent hoax was an example of how fast misinformation can spread, “especially when the amount of detailed information available is limited.” “We are extremely disappointed that an individual that has never been a part of our school community would represent themselves as a survivor of the mass violence tragedy that our community endured on May 18, 2018,” she added. Dr. Wall said that the district was thankful for the people correcting the record and was continuing to focus on the needs of its students. Social media posts indicate that a Twitter account under Mr. Briscoe’s name continued to seek out reporters this year by claiming to have survived the shooting. “I’m not too sure if you remember me but I was actually was apart of the Santa Fe shooting last year,” the account tweeted in April in response to a CNN reporter. “You briefly wrote about me in an article last year and it was great. :) However, I was wondering if you were interested in doing a follow-up article? In light of the recent suicides.” The operator of the Twitter account under Mr. Briscoe’s name did not immediately respond to a direct message. Mr. Briscoe is listed as the chief executive of a social media marketing agency, but an email sent to the listed address was returned with a message saying it could not be delivered. The Tribune reported that the Twitter account with Mr. Briscoe’s name stopped responding to the news organization’s messages when it began asking for a follow-up interview in May. In direct messages posted by the news outlet, the Twitter account told a reporter that he had never lived in Texas, that one of his employees had stolen his identity and that the employee had been the one quoted by other news outlets. Time magazine, which also updated its article to remove the man’s quotations, wrote at the time that “Briscoe’s reality — though, he says, it still feels like a dream — is a nightmare for any teacher.” Alexandra Samuels, the reporter who broke the story for The Texas Tribune, said she first questioned Mr. Briscoe’s account while reviewing notes from a phone interview she conducted with him. His comments, she said, were strikingly similar to those she had read in his interview with Time magazine. As Ms. Samuels continued reporting for a series on Santa Fe High School one year after the shooting, her suspicions only grew stronger. “When I mentioned him, no one knew who he was,” she said.

7,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/7UXMRj2_trY/,"Parkland shooting survivor Emma González‏ slammed to Madonna’s controversial “God Control” music video, calling the depiction of the mass shooting “fucked up” and “horrible.” “So I’ve been ruminating on this thread for the past few days, make sure I get the words right. Madonna’s new video for her song #GodControl was f*cked up, it was horrible,” Emma González said, berating Maddona for failing to post a trigger warning ahead of the shocking video’s release. “She should have sent out a message warning what her new video contained, ESPECIALLY to the Pulse Victims, ESPECIALLY as it was released Just After the Anniversary on June 12th,” González wrote. So I’ve been ruminating on this thread for the past few days, make sure I get the words right. Madonna’s new video for her song #GodControl was fucked up, it was horrible. — Emma González (@Emma4Change) June 29, 2019 She should have sent out a message warning what her new video contained, ESPECIALLY to the Pulse Victims, ESPECIALLY as it was released Just After the Anniversary on June 12th. — Emma González (@Emma4Change) June 29, 2019 González continued to ream the pop icon, telling her 1.65 million followers that Madonna’s video failed to properly contribute to conversations about the gun violence movement. If you want to support the gun violence prevention movement, donate to the places who need it, in this case the One Pulse Foundation and listen to the actual stories from actual survivors of gun violence. #GodControl — Emma González (@Emma4Change) June 29, 2019 Also if you tweet pictures or videos from the video of #GodControl, please tag it as Triggering for fucks sake — Emma González (@Emma4Change) June 29, 2019 The “I Rise” singer’s video contains scenes eerily reminiscent of the tragic shooting that occurred at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in 2016, which resulted in 49 dead and 53 injured. Madonna says she made the video because she “can’t take it anymore” and wants to “draw attention to a crisis that needs to be addressed.”  The Parkland shooting survivor is not the only activist to speak out against the controversial video. Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf said he “appreciated” the message Madonna was trying to convey but questioned her careless methods. “What I don’t particularly appreciate and the questions I have for Madonna center around the timing, center around her not involving the Pulse community at all in this conversation,” Wolf said, according to a video released by TMZ.  “She didn’t acknowledge that it was it was Pulse that inspired the intro to this video. She didn’t acknowledge the 49 people who died for that artistic inspiration,” he continued. “This is the same Madonna who– right after the Pulse shooting happened – posted a picture of herself kissing Britney Spears to honor the 49 victims who had just lost their lives.” “I just question and wonder where Madonna’s head is at,” he added. Patience Carter, another Pulse shooting survivor, said the video was difficult to watch. “I understood what she was trying to do with bringing awareness to the topic of gun control, but I definitely felt that wasn’t the right way to go about doing it,” Carter said. 2nd AmendmentEntertainmentEmma Gonzalezgun controlmadonnaParklandPulse nightclub .

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The largest sheriff's office in Florida sustained another blow after it was revealed Monday that a state panel last week voted to revoke the law enforcement accreditation of the controversial department in the wake of mishandling two major mass shootings in its jurisdiction. The Commission for Florida Law Enforcement Accreditation voted 13-0 on Wednesday to strip the Broward County Sheriff's Office of the accreditation, citing the missteps from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in 2018 that killed 17 people and the 2017 Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport shooting, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by the Miami Herald. Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay said the law enforcement agencies are supposed to prove that proper standards and regulations are in place, in addition to personnel that are following those rules. BROWARD SHERIFF FIRES TWO MORE DEPUTIES FOR 'NEGLECT OF DUTY' IN PARKLAND SHOOTING RESPONSE “During the rating period of the time we’re talking in question here, there were substantial periods where they were not in compliance with how they performed in the field,” Ramsay said in the audio obtained by the Herald. “As a result we saw the catastrophic loss of life and injuries and what transpired because of lack of following procedures and things in place.” Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony, center, announces that two additional deputies have been fired as a result of the agency's internal affairs investigation into the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, at the Broward Sheriff's Office headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Wednesday, June 26, 2019.
      (Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) Last week, Sheriff Gregory Tony said that deputies Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were fired as a result of an internal affairs investigation for their inaction following the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting. A state investigative commission found that Stambaugh was working an off-duty shift at a nearby school when he responded to reports of shots fired at the school. He got out of his truck, put on his bulletproof vest and took cover for about five minutes after hearing the shots, according to body camera footage. He then drove to a nearby highway instead of going toward the school. Scot Peterson, the resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has been charged with child neglect. In Eason's case, the report reveals he provided inconsistent and conflicting statements to investigators. It also shows that instead of responding to the gunshots at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, he went to nearby Westglades Middle to lock it down. Eason, however, ""never transmitted his actions,"" and took 19 minutes to check the doors of the middle school to see if it was locked down. Eason was also faulted for not writing an official report after receiving a tip in February 2016 that the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, was making threats on social media to shoot up a school. Tips to the FBI about Cruz also were not followed up, a separate investigation has found. FLORIDA RESOURCE OFFICER WHO DIDN'T ENTER SCHOOL DURING SHOOTING MASSACRE IS ARRESTED Two other deputies were fired earlier this month for neglect of duty in connection to the February 2018 shooting. One of those was school resource officer Scot Peterson, who was also arrested on charges of child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury. Peterson's lawyer has said he will fight the charges. The sheriff said no action was taken on three other deputies who were involved in the investigation. Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony Tony said deputies Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were fired Tuesday for their inaction following the Feb. 14, 2018 shooting.
      (Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) Scott Israel, the sheriff at the time, was removed from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for similar reasons. He is appealing that decision before the state Senate. The loss of accreditation isn't expected to affect the department's overall operations, but is a further blow to the agency, according to the Herald. The title allows law enforcement agencies to standardize practices and defend themselves against lawsuits if they are using validated procedures. There are over 200 standards that agencies in Florida must do to maintain accreditation. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Records obtained by the Herald said the department initially was reviewed in December 2018 and May 2019 an assessment team and was ""favorably reviewed. The commission, however, ultimately voted against that recommendation. The sheriff's office had not yet commented on the state panel's vote.

9,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_krHG7k9on0/,"Madonna performed in front of a crowd of thousands at the WorldPride NYC 2019 concert at Pier 97 in New York City and closed her set with calls for more gun control. Madonna addressed the packed audience, saying America’s greatest problem is a lack of “gun control which is disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.”  Fox News reports that Madonna’s gun control push was tied to her performance of “God Control,” the music video for which depicts a mass shooting. On June 28, 2019, Breitbart News reported that numerous Orlando Pulse survivors have criticized Madonna’s mass shooting imagery. TMZ quoted shooting survivor Brandon Wolf, who said, “What I don’t particularly appreciate and the questions I have for Madonna center around the timing, center around her not involving the Pulse community at all in this conversation.” Wolf added, “She didn’t acknowledge that it was it was Pulse that inspired the intro to this video.

10,https://splinternews.com/new-zealands-antifa-movement-is-trying-to-prevent-anoth-1836012644,"“Christchurch was our worst nightmare realized,” Anu Kaloti said. Kaloti is a veteran activist and organizer in New Zealand. She immigrated to New Zealand from the UK in 2003, but her family is originally from the Indian subcontinent. Though she didn’t feel the same intense racism in her new home as in her old one, she told Splinter that she could still see its presence in the treatment of migrant workers and immigrants. In 2018, Kaloti founded a radical antifascist organization called Love Aotearoa Hate Racism (Aotearoa is the indigenous Māori people’s name for New Zealand) to fight against the prejudice she saw rearing its head in her country. The organization mounted a protest when Canadian white nationalists Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern came to speak in New Zealand, and successfully got the event canceled. But generally, antifascist activism was on the fringes of the country’s political scene. That all changed in March, when a 28-year-old Australian man shot and killed 51 people at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch. Suddenly, hundreds of people were turning up at antifascist meetings, instead of a few dozen, and large marches targeting white supremacy were held in major cities. Activists, grappling with their own grief over the attack, were thrilled by the momentum, but weren’t sure of the best way to harness it. Months later, veterans of the antifascist movement are still trying to figure out how to direct this swell of energy without alienating mainstream Kiwis who aren’t familiar with their style of direct action. To make things more difficult, the Christchurch attack wasn’t the result of a single, local hate group. Instead, it was born of a decentralized online white supremacist movement in which an increasing number of people are self-radicalized. The shooter wasn’t even from New Zealand. Activists have been left asking: how do you tackle a global community of hate from a small country at the bottom of the world? It’s not just the rest of the globe which was shocked by the fact that a far-right massacre could happen in New Zealand; for many within the country, both the nature of the shooter’s beliefs, and the style of the attack he carried out, were completely unexpected. This is perhaps because, despite increasing immigration, New Zealand has largely avoided the mass far-right populism that has infected so many liberal democracies around the world in recent years. A 2017 study, for instance, found that Kiwis had the most positive feelings about immigration of all 25 countries surveyed. “[Anti-immigrant populism] hasn’t had the same resonance in New Zealand [as elsewhere],” Prof. Paul Spoonley, the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Massey University in Auckland, who has spent decades studying the far-right in New Zealand, told Splinter. “Even when you get anti-immigrant politics, it’s a very light version of what you would get elsewhere.” But even New Zealand is not invulnerable. There has been a relatively small, but persistent, and growing, threat from the far right. People in the antifascist movement say that they—along with immigrants and people of color who find themselves in the crosshairs of the far right—have been warning about the threat and getting almost nowhere. “I don’t think anyone expected an American-style mass shooting in New Zealand, ever,” Justine Sachs, the outreach coordinator at the socialist organization Organize Aotearoa and part of the small New Zealand Jewish community, told Splinter. “But on the other hand, I wasn’t surprised. I wasn’t surprised that the Muslim community was a target, I wasn’t surprised that it was in Christchurch, and I wasn’t surprised that it was a white supremacist terror attack.” While they’ve never gone as mainstream as in other countries, fascist and white supremacist groups have maintained a foothold in New Zealand for half a century, largely in opposition to indigenous rights movements. “Through the ‘70s and ’80s, New Zealand went through an extensive debate about biculturalism,” Spoonley said. “[The debate] hinged upon Māori sovereignty. You could be both a New Zealand citizen and Māori, and both had citizenship rights. It prompted those who were anxious or hostile to that to politically mount opposition.” Most of this opposition came from groups of skinhead neo-Nazis who took up residency in Christchurch, a traditionally white, working class town with strong English cultural roots. The New Zealand branch of the National Front, a white supremacist group originally founded in the UK, was first organized in 1977. It was still active in 2004, when it staged a protest in the capital city, Wellington. That protest was met with resistance from an antifascist group called MultiCultural Aotearoa. “[The National Front] managed to get about 40 or 50 people; we had about 1,000 people,” Barrie, an antifascist organizer involved in the protest who asked to be referred to only by his first name, told Splinter. “It basically turned into a running battle. We hounded them all over Wellington. They were literally chased out of town. It was quite a success, really.” In 2017, the National Front reared its head again, this time with new leadership, and attempted another rally outside Parliament in Wellington. (The rally was again shut down by counter-protesters.) But on the whole, National Front-style, overt skinhead-type activism has been on the decline in New Zealand in recent years. However, those groups have been replaced by newer ones like the Dominion Movement, which have modeled themselves after North American “identitarians” like Richard Spencer, cloaking their violent white supremacy in language about identity and claims that ethnic cleansing can be done peacefully. These groups have tried to appeal to normal people, rather than to those who have already been radicalized. “[They were] wearing three-piece suits, toning down some of the language,” Barrie said of the Dominion Movement. “They would have pictures of themselves picking up rubbish. They were very articulate, well-organized, and growing in Wellington. They were an upcoming threat.” But with open white supremacy largely dormant in New Zealand, activists like Barrie had been spending most of their time online, researching growing hate groups and organizing responses to events like Molyneux and Southern’s visit. “The key part of antifascism is ‘anti.’ If the other side is quiet, then you don’t have a lot to do,” Barrie said. And then, on March 15, everything changed. The first few days after the attacks were dominated by peaceful vigils with limited political rhetoric. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was praised around the world for her quick and empathetic response. She visited the country’s Muslim communities, donned a hijab, and emphasized honoring the victims and denying the shooter fame. “I implore you: speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He may have sought notoriety but we, in New Zealand, will give nothing–not even his name,” Ardern said in a statement days after the attack. Though activists claim that New Zealand’s intelligence agencies were not tracking far-right extremism before the attacks, a New Zealand Security Intelligence Service spokesperson says they’ve been following the threat for years. “The NZSIS is concerned by all forms of violent extremism. Over the years, the agency has received tips from the public concerning right wing extremism and each has been taken seriously,” the spokesperson told Splinter. “In light of global trends, the NZSIS increased its focus on right-wing extremism over the last year in an effort to obtain a better picture of the threat posed to New Zealand by far right extremist groups.” Ardern has also assured the public that security agencies are tracking white supremacy. “Our agencies here in New Zealand have stepped up the work that was being done in that area but again that did not result in this individual being on any kind of watch list,” she said in March, according to the website Newshub. However, researchers like Patrick Gower say the government hasn’t done enough. In May, he tracked 200 people with extremist views in New Zealand to get a sense of the scope of the problem. “The law has not kept up with this. This country has missed warnings, and we’re acting too slow,” Gower told Newshub. One of the extremists Gower tracked, Phillip Arps, has now been sentenced to 21 months in prison for sharing the Christchurch gunman’s video of the attack. But Gower told Newshub that authorities should have been aware of him before. In 2016, Arps put up a video of himself delivering a severed pig’s head to the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch. In the video, he talks about wanting to “cull” Muslims in New Zealand. He got off with an $800 fine. In the wake of the attacks, activists set about providing venues for expressions of grief and solidarity. “We recognized that there was a big need within the community to come together to grieve and to stand in solidarity with Muslim people,” Laura O’Connell Rapira, the director of the activist network ActionStation, which helped organize the largest vigil in Wellington in response to the attack, told Splinter. Their vigil drew 12,000 in a city of only 250,000, and was able to raise $26,000 (about $17,000 USD) to help family members of the victims fly to New Zealand for funerals. But as the days went by, and the country mourned, the tone shifted. Kaloti recalled predicting, “There’s going to come a time when people are going to be vigiled out.” And sure enough, when an Auckland group called Migrants Against Racism and Xenophobia (MARX) organized their own vigil a week later (with ActionStation’s help), differences between the groups’ approaches quickly became apparent. “[MARX] had a giant banner at the back of their vigil that said, like, ‘Destroy White Supremacy’ and ‘Destroy Islamophobia,’” O’Connell Rapira said. “They took a very protest-oriented way of framing their event, whereas ours was sort of like, ‘Stand together for love.’ [It’s] kind of the usual thing that plays out among progressives and radical left activists. “Like us, they had only speakers of color, but they also had Māori speakers as well as migrants and Muslim speakers,” she added. “That connection between colonial white supremacy and white supremacy today was made much more strongly at their event. It caused a walk-out of some people, because they felt so uncomfortable with the discourse presented to them.” “Obviously not everyone is comfortable going to political rallies and what have you,” Kaloti said. But she emphasized that the community felt something needed to be done to show that racism and hatred wouldn’t be tolerated in their communities. Two days later, Love Aotearoa Hate Racism organized a large protest against racism in Auckland, attended by around 5,000 people. That march was criticized by one Māori attendee, who wrote in an op-ed that a speaker had made reference to conspiracy theories with anti-Semitic undertones. (The group denounced the speaker’s comments in a subsequent statement.) Activists began to worry they would lose the groundswell of energy that emerged after the attacks. “[The LAHR march] would have been the first time that more mainstream liberals or progressives people who don’t really think about racism had ever turned up to an event,” O’Connell Rapira said. “Then they hear [conspiracy theories], and I worry that it means that they won’t come back in the future because that was their experience with anti-racism protests.” Soon after the attacks, some far-right groups — including the Dominion Movement — announced they were disbanding voluntarily due to the pressure put on them by a government newly invested in investigating white supremacy. At face value, this looks like a victory for antifascists, but there’s also the possibility that these groups going underground will make it more difficult to track their members and actions. The most worrying lesson from the Christchurch attacks, however, is that devastating white supremacist violence can occur without the involvement of any sort of organized far-right group. The Christchurch shooter—who was active in online communities like 4chan, streamed his shooting on Facebook, and posted a long, meme-filled manifesto—is living proof of the threat posed by individuals who self-radicalize and decide to enact violence without ever meeting up with a group of extremists in real life. Traditional tactics like no-platforming and showing up to protest are ineffective against such people, and antifascists around the world are wondering exactly what tactics are effective against this new threat. In light of this trend toward self-radicalization, along with the sheer volume of hatred, disinformation and conspiratorial thinking on the internet — many online extremism researchers have grown pessimistic about their ability to combat rising extremism and hate speech online, according to a recent article in Wired. The increasing popularity of the kind of irony-damaged white supremacy espoused by the Christchurch shooter makes things even more complicated. The same infuriating Catch-22 is true for the media: the more journalists cover the far-right and their ideas, the more they risk elevating and spreading them. At the same time, without public discussion and understanding of these threats, there’s no way to organize resistance. “You can’t tackle something if you don’t know what it is,” Barrie told Splinter. “At the same time, we don’t want to give a platform for fascists to distribute their ideology. It’s quite paradoxical.” In response to these dizzyingly complex issues, O’Connell Rapira’s organization, ActionStation, has tried some interesting methods to counteract online radicalization on a local, interpersonal level. “We run a project called Tauiwi Tautoko, which means ‘non-Māori supporting Māori.’ It’s a volunteer program where non-Māori volunteers are trained in the skills of evidence-based listening and messaging techniques,” she said. “Then they go into online spaces to gently counter and challenge racism directed towards Māori on forums such as Facebook. We train them to do that at a full-day training; then they are asked to do that work for one [to] two hours per week over eight weeks.” [UPDATE, 7:25 p.m. ET: O’Connell Rapira reached out after the publication of this piece to clarify that the entire Tauiwi Tautoko program lasts ten weeks.] But many antifascists believe that tackling extremism is best done in person, by countering the vestiges of visible far-right activism that remain in New Zealand. “If we want this to not happen again we have to build a strong antifascist civic culture,” Sachs said. “If there’s a known white supremacist bar in Christchurch, there shouldn’t be a day that someone isn’t out there making it known that these people are not welcome. If a skinhead walks into a restaurant, he [should] get chased out.” Sachs says she’s not directly involved in efforts to confront fascists in Christchurch, but that there is a countrywide effort from antifascists to “name and shame” known white supremacists, which she called a “powerful tool.” Others suggest political solutions. “We need to be working together and uniting against the evil economic system called capitalism, which divides us and is the cause of the refugees and migrants displaced from their home countries,” Kaloti said. “If we grow large in number and gather [enough] momentum, it will become increasingly difficult for whoever the governing party is to ignore the voice of civil society of New Zealand.” “So that’s the plan we are working on: getting the ordinary working class people to join us,” she added. “Because that’s where the power lies, with the people.” Despite misgivings from some in the antifascist community about how to harness this newfound energy, activists agree the new interest from the public isn’t going away. In June, a conference was held in Auckland to discuss the culture of racism in New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand’s Islamic Women’s Council also launched a new organization to combat discrimination. Another group of Muslim women started a website where Islamophobic abuse can be reported. “I don’t think interest has waned,” Sachs told Splinter. “It was such a traumatic event we are still feeling the aftershocks. I don’t think the left in New Zealand will ever really be the same again. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness that was not there before.”",2019-07-01 13:05:00,New Zealand's Antifa Movement Is Trying to Prevent Another Christchurch,,6154,http://jezebel.com

News outlets report Ford Motor Co. told Ford Chatom that the promotion was inappropriate after a worker fired from a California dealership killed two employees last week before killing himself. Dealership general manager Colin Ward says he’s disappointed the automaker requested the promotion be ended. He says the dealership is fulfilling any commitments it already made. Ward says customers could have received a Torah or Quran instead of a Bible if they wanted during the “God, guns and freedom” promotion. Ford Motor Co. spokesman T.R. Reid says the company wasn’t involved in developing the local promotion. Anchorage: Northern Alaska coastal communities and climate scientists say sea ice disappeared far earlier than normal this spring, and it’s affecting wildlife. The Anchorage Daily News reports ice melted because of exceptionally warm ocean temperatures. Janet Mitchell of Kivalina says hunters used to be able to find bearded seals on sea ice just outside the village. This year, family hunters traveled more than 50 miles by boat to find bearded seals in early June. The hunters ran out of gas on their way back and had to call other residents to bring them more fuel. University of Alaska Fairbanks climatologist Rick Thoman says sea surface temperatures last week in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas were as high as 9 degrees above the 1981-2010 average. Yarnell: Nineteen bells rang and 19 names were spoken aloud amid somber silence Sunday afternoon in this town at the edge of a wildfire that killed 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters six years ago. Every year since, on June 30, Prescott and Yarnell have remembered the 19 men, casualties of the deadliest U.S. wildland fire in 80 years. The Yarnell Hill Fire, which began June 28, 2013, burned across 8,400 acres and ruined more than 100 structures. At the Yarnell Hill Fire Memorial Park on Sunday, nearly 200 people assembled in a dirt enclosure that is hoped to become a park dedicated to the Hotshots and the fire they battled. Simultaneously in Prescott, the home base for the firefighters, community members gathered in the town square as the Yavapai County Courthouse rang its bell 19 times. Hot Springs: Sports wagering has begun in the state, with the first bets being placed at a Hot Springs casino. Spokeswoman Jennifer Hoyt said in a statement that Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort began offering sports wagering Monday morning and will allow gamblers to bet on games ranging from professional football and college basketball to cricket and rugby. Hoyt said bets can be placed with tellers seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or at kiosks at the casino. The Arkansas Racing Commission approved sportsbook wagering at Oaklawn last month. In March, the commission approved full casino licenses for Oaklawn and Southland Gaming and Racing in West Memphis. San Francisco: A $2 billion transit terminal that shut down shortly after its inauguration last year has partially reopened. The terminal’s lobby and its 5.4-acre rooftop park reopened Monday to the public, but bus service won’t resume until later this summer. KPIX-TV reports officials say programs and activities, including live music, yoga and activities for kids, will restart this week. The terminal called the Salesforce Transit Center opened Aug. 12, 2018, to great fanfare. Officials closed the terminal in September after finding two cracked beams. The new center replaced the grim and seismically deficient Transbay Terminal nearby. It is meant to be a modern transportation hub with food trucks, pop-up retail shops and a rooftop park. Denver: Five years after the recreational use of marijuana was legalized, the state has surpassed $1 billion in tax revenue from pot sales. The Colorado Department of Revenue announced last month that sales since legalization had topped $6.5 billion. The state has more than 2,900 licensed marijuana businesses and more than 41,000 licensed workers in the industry. “This industry is helping grow our economy by creating jobs and generating valuable revenue,” Gov. Jared Polis said. The Denver Post reports marijuana revenue funds a variety of public health programs, including mental health services, youth literacy initiatives and anti-bullying programs in schools. The tax revenue goes to state and local governments. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana. Hartford: The city is planning a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of what has become known as the Day the Clowns Cried, when more than 150 people died in a big-top fire. The remembrance ceremony for the Hartford Circus Fire will take place July 6 at the memorial site on Barbour Street. An estimated 7,000 people were attending the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1944 when the big top caught fire. The blaze spread quickly, fueled by a mixture of gasoline and paraffin wax that was used to waterproof the tent. The death toll has been put at various times between 167 and 169 people. More than 700 were injured, many of them children. The cause of the fire has never been determined. Dover: House lawmakers have given final approval to a bill expanding the state’s decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana to juveniles. Lawmakers voted 34 to 7 for the bill Sunday, the last day of this year’s legislative session. The measure now goes to Democratic Gov. John Carney for his signature. Possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is currently a civil violation for anyone over 21 but a criminal misdemeanor for those under 18. Nineteen- and 20-year-olds are subject to a civil violation for a first offense but misdemeanor charges for a second or subsequent offense. The bill makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil violation for a first offense in all cases. A third or subsequent offense would subject anyone under 21 to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Washington: A court has ordered police in the nation’s capital to start tracking the race of everyone stopped by officers, regardless of whether the stop results in an arrest or search. News outlets report the Thursday ruling gives the department a month to comply. The D.C. Council passed legislation three years ago that required the department to track race, but it never followed through. Advocacy groups sued the department, its chief and city officials last year over the noncompliance with the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results act. Chief Peter Newsham says the department planned to implement IT upgrades to comply by next month, regardless of the court order. Superior Court Judge John M. Campbell questioned why a short-term, low-tech measure wasn’t put in place to collect the required data in the meantime. Miami: An LGBTQ organization has suspended its director while it investigates why four men charged with hate crimes in an anti-gay attack attended the group’s gay pride gala. In a Sunday statement, the Miami-based nonprofit SAVE said it has placed director Tony Lima on administrative leave. Lima said in a Facebook video that the men bought their own tickets after volunteering with the group, but he didn’t consult with board members before welcoming them in his remarks. The South Florida Gay News publication said Lima announced on stage that the men had been “wrongly accused.” Lima said he doesn’t remember saying that, but “if that’s what I said in haste, I apologize.” The four men are accused of attacking two men and shouting anti-gay slurs following last year’s Miami Beach gay pride parade. Savannah: Scientists say a warm winter may have given a head start to a shrimp-killing parasite. The Savannah Morning News reports researchers found a shrimp with black gills during a June 21 cruise. Shrimp with black gills are infected with a parasite that can weaken or kill them, especially as water grows warmer and holds less oxygen. Marc Frischer of the University of Georgia’s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography says it’s only the second time that shrimp with visible black gill have been observed in June. He says live shrimp collected are also dying at a high rate “suggesting that we are in the midst of a mortality event.” Frischer says warmer winters, possibly caused by climate change, appear to lead to smaller shrimp catches the following fall. Lihue: A new two-day festival on Kauai aims to explore the influences traditional Hawaiian music has had on traditional folk music, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports. The Kauai Folk Festival, scheduled for Sept. 28-29 in Lihue, is the brainchild of Matt Morelock, a multi-instrumentalist best known as a banjo player. Morelock, who was raised on bluegrass and country music and previously produced a live-performance radio show called the “WDVX Blue Plate Special” in Knoxville, Tennessee, has been trying to grow Kauai’s folk music scene since he and his wife, Hollis Church, moved to Moloaa on the northeastern part of the island eight years ago. While Morelock said it’s commonly known Hawaiians invented Hawaiian-style steel guitar playing, he’s identified other connections, including Hawaiian-style vocal harmonies and yodeling. Boise: Former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador has been elected chairman of the state Republican Party. He defeated former Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna by a 111-109 vote Saturday. The chairman is responsible primarily for overseeing the party’s goals of electing Republicans and developing a political game plan for elections. “Let’s stand united, and let’s do the things that are necessary to defeat the real enemy, which is the bad ideas of the other side,” Labrador said. He said more people are moving to Idaho and possibly bringing different views. “You see what’s happening on that national stage, and that stage is moving to the state of Idaho,” he said. Labrador served as a U.S. congressman starting in 2010. He left that position to run for governor in 2018 but lost to now-Gov. Brad Little in the Republican primary. Rockford: Officials in this city home to the women’s baseball team that inspired the 1992 film “A League of Their Own” want to help fund a $7 million museum honoring the role of women in the sport’s history. The city of Rockford’s planning committee agreed last week to provide $20,000 to help kick off construction of the International Women’s Baseball Center. The Rockford Register Star reports that the City Council will likely vote on the plan this week. The museum, hall of fame and training facility will be located near the stadium where the Rockford Peaches played in the 1940s and 1950s as part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The first exhibit will be dedicated to Penny Marshall, who directed the film starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis. Indianapolis: Several new state laws have been set in motion with July’s arrival, from a required high school state government test to allowing wrongfully incarcerated individuals to collect $50,000 a year. Starting Monday, Indiana high schools will have to administer, as part of a mandatory government course, the U.S. naturalization test that’s given to immigrants hoping to become U.S. citizens. An initial plan had proposed that students had to pass the test to earn a high school diploma, but that plan was scrapped. Other new laws include making people who are wrongfully incarcerated eligible to receive $50,000 for each year behind bars once a conviction is vacated due to innocence. Also, the head of the Indiana Department of Education will now be appointed by the governor, starting in 2021. Des Moines: A summer tradition entering its 28th year will overtake the Iowa State Fairgrounds this week, with more than 4,000 hot rods, muscle cars and other custom rides all on display. The Goodguys Heartland Nationals will run Friday through Sunday, providing visitors with a close-up look at thousands of unique rides produced before 1987. The Des Moines event is one of 18 held nationally by California-based Goodguys Rod & Custom Association. For those needing extra horsepower in their holiday, multiple racing competitions will be held during the three-day event. Cars registered in the show are eligible to compete. There’s also no shortage of traditional summertime family fun, including an apple pie bake-off, watermelon eating competition, live entertainment and July Fourth fireworks. Manhattan: State agricultural officials are considering a quarantine to slow the spread of an invasive plant threatening native grasses. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the Kansas Department of Agriculture recently sought public input on a plan to quarantine invasive yellow and Caucasian bluestem grasses. The varieties have invaded all but three counties in the Sunflower State. Declaring the quarantine would prohibit the movement of all seeds, plants or parts of bluestem grasses within or into the state. The move could affect some ranchers who rely on the species when cutting hay to feed livestock. Ron Klataske, who leads environmental nonprofit Audubon of Kansas, supports the proposal, saying bluestems destroy all native plants. Kansas Livestock Association Attorney Aaron Popelka says the group opposes the plan because it could economically hurt producers. Frankfort: More than two dozen Catholic school students and their parents have lost an initial appeal in challenging a regional health department’s efforts to control a chickenpox outbreak. The students claim the agency’s actions infringed on their religious beliefs. But a three-judge panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals sided with a trial court judge who ruled in April that the Northern Kentucky Health Department acted within its authority. The health agency canceled extracurricular activities and later imposed a temporary ban on school attendance for unvaccinated students as the chickenpox outbreak spread. Last week’s ruling applied to the refusal to impose a temporary injunction on behalf of the Catholic school students and their parents. Their attorney says they’ll appeal to the state Supreme Court. New Orleans: A NASA official says some crews are working around the clock at the space agency’s rocket factory in the city to meet a fall 2020 test launch deadline for a mega-rocket designed to propel astronauts toward the moon and Mars. Deputy Administrator James Morhard says he recently visited the Michoud Assembly Facility at midnight, and people were working on the engine section for the 212-foot core of the Space Launch System. The other four sections have been assembled, and NASA says the rocket’s core section is 80% complete. Morhard wouldn’t say whether he expects NASA to get the $1.6 billion requested by President Donald Trump for space exploration. He says he’s waiting to see what the Senate does with the proposal. Ellsworth: Supporters of the sea urchin industry say a federal law change will make it easier to ship the seafood out of state. Maine is the site of a fishery for sea urchins, which are harvested so their roe can be used as food. But members of the industry and some lawmakers have charged over the years that burdensome inspection regulations make it difficult to ship the product where it needs to go. Former Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin and current Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree are among the lawmakers who have called for an ease on those burdens, which sometimes result in the seafood spoiling while awaiting inspections. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says in the Federal Register that it’s amending regulations about importation and exportation of urchins to address the problem. Annapolis: The state’s highest court has suspended a Baltimore judge for six months without pay for “a pattern of discourtesy and uncontrollable incivility.” Judge Devy Patterson Russell’s suspension began Monday. Maryland Court of Appeals Judge Clayton Greene wrote that her behavior “had pervasive effects on the administration of justice.” He wrote that from 2007 to 2015, Russell failed to handle and process search warrant materials properly. Greene also wrote that she instructed a law clerk to destroy warrant materials and repeatedly yelled at court clerks and judges. Greene wrote that Russell’s reinstatement is based on finishing “a complete emotional and behavioral assessment” by a qualified health care professional. Russell has denied wrongdoing, contending the matter amounted to personality disputes that were not sanctionable. Lenox: The Boston Symphony Orchestra’s summer home at Tanglewood has unveiled one of the most transformative new additions in its history. Officials on Friday held a ceremonial ribbon-cutting on the $33 million, four-building Linde Center for Music and Learning. The climate-controlled facility will play an essential role in establishing the 500-plus-acre Tanglewood campus in Lenox and Stockbridge as a year-round facility for the first time in its 80-year history. It includes studio, rehearsal and performance space, including one that can seat up to 270 people. It’s the largest building project at Tanglewood in 25 years since the construction of Seiji Ozawa Hall. It is named for lead donor Joyce Linde, her late husband, Edward, and their family. Detroit: Aging care experts are warning that the state’s safety net services for elderly populations are becoming strained as more residents live longer. The Detroit News’ analysis of recently released U.S. Census Bureau data shows that Michigan’s overall population has a median age of nearly 40 years. In 21 of the state’s counties, the median age tops 50 years. Area Agency on Aging of Northwestern Michigan serves some of those counties, and the Traverse City-based nonprofit’s executive director, Heidi Gustine, cautions that the state is about to reach a tipping point, as more baby boomers reach retirement age. Gustine says safety net systems are already buckling as demand for home health care increases with fewer workers to fill the jobs. Aging organizations also need more funding and affordable senior housing. Eagan: Parents in the state are complaining that they face long waits and have to drive long distances so their teens can take their driver’s license road tests. Cheree Johnson of Rockford told KSTP-TV she and her 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, had to drive an hour to Eagan to take the test recently because a closer location was booked until October. The Eagan office is now booked into October, too. Other young drivers from the Twin Cities have had to travel more than 100 miles to take their tests. State Rep. Jon Koznick says it shouldn’t be so frustrating. He’s considering whether the Legislature should do something about it next session. Driver and Vehicle Services says it has 110 examiners across Minnesota, with plans to hire seven more. McComb: People are raising money for two Mississippi Blues Trail markers to commemorate the 1977 plane crash that killed three members of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, their road manager and two pilots. The Enterprise-Journal reports the markers will be unveiled in October – one near the crash site in Gillsburg and the other at Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center in McComb, where survivors were treated. Mike Rounsaville, a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan from northern Mississippi, is raising money, and a GoFundMe page had nearly reached a $10,000 goal by last week. The Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center Foundation is also collecting donations. Lynyrd Skynyrd was founded in Florida and is known for hits such as “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Free Bird.” The current iteration of the band is touring Europe and the U.S. this year. Columbia: The University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources has received an $8.6 million federal grant for a new research center. The university announced last week that it had received the grant from the National Institute of Health. The five-year grant will go toward the Swine Somatic Genome Editing Center, where researchers from across the country will use wild pigs to develop delivery methods for gene-editing compounds. The Columbia Missourian reports the center is the latest addition to NIH’s Somatic Cell Gene Editing Consortium, which researches tools for genome editing in human patients. The center will operate out of an existing university research facility after it is renovated to meet federal standards. Moiese: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service diverted roughly a third of the National Bison Range Complex’s budget in 2015 and never gave it back. The shrunken budget hobbled staff, slashed Visitor Center hours, and left buildings in disrepair at a place often referred to as the crown jewel of the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System. A 10-month investigation by the Missoulian charted a years­long funding crunch at this group of National Wildlife Refuges. Fish and Wildlife Service financial records indicate the Bison Range Complex’s annual budget dropped from as much as $2.7 million from 2012 to 2014 to as little as $1.2 million in the years since. By May 2017, Bison Range manager Jeff King was warning his superiors that “we are (past) the muscle and bone and into the marrow on our ability to even manage our highest priorities, and even those things are suffering.” Lincoln: Voters may decide next year whether to legalize casino gambling in a ballot measure that could tip the number of states that allow commercial gambling into the majority. Supporters of legalized casinos have launched a petition drive to place the issue on the 2020 ballot with financial backing from the economic development corporation owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Twenty-five states – including neighboring Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota – allow commercial casino gambling with games such as slot machines, craps and roulette wheels, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Iowa casinos near Omaha, in particular, cater to Nebraska residents looking to gamble. “Hundreds of millions of dollars go across the border every year,” said Lance Morgan, the CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc., the corporation pushing the measure on the tribe’s behalf. Sparks: The state has become the latest to honor the sacrifices of servicemen and servicewomen killed in military service. The Gold Star Families Memorial was dedicated Saturday on the grounds of the recently opened Northern Nevada State Veterans Home in Sparks. The Nevada Appeal reports the black granite memorial has one side for a tribute to Gold Star Families and the other to tell a story on four panels of Homeland, Family, Patriot and Sacrifice. Among the speakers at the event was 96-year-old Hershel “Woody” Williams, a former Marine who earned a Medal of Honor for his heroism at the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Williams said the U.S. has done a good job of recognizing veterans but a very poor job in honoring the families until now. Bretton Woods: The Mount Washington Cog Railway is about to mark its 150th anniversary. Festivities for the July 3 birthday of the world’s first mountain-climbing cog railway are scheduled at the base station from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. There will be a guest booth with goodies from Calef’s General Store in Barrington, a partner property celebrating its own 150th anniversary. There also will be barbecue and birthday cupcakes from local businesses. The day also will include Victorian lawn games and fish feeding at Peppersass Pond, plus a live acoustic guitar performance by Michael Bloom and fireworks at dusk by Andrew Day. Atlantic City: The state will consider expanding its beach access regulations to take into account two things every day-tripping beachgoer knows: Being able to access a beach also includes being able to park near it and use a public restroom. Catherine McCabe, the state’s environmental protection commissioner, says her department will take a renewed look later this year at beach access, including the issues of parking and restrooms. Under the administration of former Gov. Jon Corzine, New Jersey required public access points every quarter-mile, plus public restrooms in any shore town that accepted government money for beach replenishment. Those rules were struck down by a court in 2008. The state recently enshrined the Public Trust Doctrine into law, establishing the public’s right to swim in waterways and walk along their shorelines. Santa Fe: The effects of a progressive shift in the state are being felt as new laws take effect that restrict gun access, raise taxes, decriminalize low-level drug possession, and provide a major boost in spending on everything from teacher salaries to road construction. Starting Monday, taxes on vehicle sales rose by 33%. Background checks are required for nearly all firearms purchases, and smaller public bathrooms are becoming gender-neutral. The state also is raising its salaries and channeling more money toward public education initiatives to help at-risk students in response to a court order mandating greater school resources. A windfall from the oil sector will help with increased government spending, as the industry is expected to provide the state with a $1 billion surplus for a second consecutive year. Hyde Park: Renovations are planned next year at President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s historic home on the Hudson River. The National Historic Site mansion will be closed to tours from April through October 2020 as the building undergoes extensive renovations. The Poughkeepsie Journal reports that the project will include a replacement of the heating and air-conditioning system and exterior painting. It’s slated to cost more than $3.2 million. The grounds of the site, which includes Roosevelt’s burial plot and a museum, will remain open. The National Park Service says about 154,000 visitors came to the Hyde Park site last year. Tryon: The effort to preserve music legend Nina Simone’s childhood home now has the backing of a few of the biggest names in entertainment. This month, the National Trust for Historic Preservation kicked off a crowdfunding campaign it hopes will support the rehabilitation of the nearly 90-year-old house where Simone, then known as Eunice Waymon, grew up in Tryon. Members of the public can donate to the campaign in addition to buying new Simone-inspired merchandise designed by artist Dare Coulter and other merchandise donated for the cause by singer John Legend, rapper Talib Kweli and comedian Issa Rae. Funds raised are expected to be integral to restoring the exterior of the home where the “Mississippi Goddam” singer learned to play piano. Others involved in the fundraising effort include singer Yusef/Cat Stevens and Academy Award-winning actor Mahershala Ali. Fargo: A group that pushed to legalize marijuana in the state last year is back for another try. Legalize ND expects to submit a new proposed initiative to the secretary of state’s office soon. The group’s leader, David Owen, said the new measure will be far more specific than the one that voters soundly defeated in November. The group’s proposal would limit possession to 2 ounces and wouldn’t allow home growing. It also calls for child-resistant packaging and no marketing to children. Owen said it also would prohibit smoking in public or in vehicles. The group needs about 13,450 signatures for the initiative to be approved for next year’s ballot. Owen said he expects signature-gathering to begin in August, several months earlier than last time around. Toledo: Researchers say toxin-producing algae have formed in Sandusky Bay and are migrating into Lake Erie near Cedar Point, a signal the lake’s western basin could see massive blooms this summer. The Blade reports an official from Bowling Green State University’s Great Lakes center says tests show toxin levels thus far are relatively low and don’t threaten water treatment systems in lakeside communities. Toxins from an algae bloom in 2014 caused massive problems for Toledo’s lake-fed system. Rick Stumpf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says heavy spring rains have helped push algae from the bay into the lake. Stumpf says that while spring rain has prevented farmers from planting and fertilizing, researchers can study the residual threat of “legacy” phosphorous runoff on the lake’s health. Tulsa: A community council study reveals that 1 in 5 homeless people in Tulsa was employed last year, including almost 100 people who had no home despite having a full-time job. The Tulsa World reports that data from the Community Service Council study indicates more than 5,600 people were homeless in 2018. The survey found it took people 27 days on average to secure a home, and 65% were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers are partially based on an annual “point in time” census, in which officials counted every homeless person they could find at shelters, on the streets, in alleys and along underpasses. A homelessness coalition noted the number of homeless veterans in Tulsa fell by 16%, mirroring the success of programs that prioritize veterans. Salem: The state will pay for prepaid postage on mail-in ballots for next year’s general election in an attempt to boost turnout. The House voted 37-18 on Sunday to allocate nearly $1.7 million to pay postage costs. The program could cost the state more depending on how many voters send in ballots. Oregon switched to a vote-by-mail system in 2000. Gov. Kate Brown made prepaid postage a priority this year. She said low-income and younger residents don’t always have access to postage stamps. Opponents say that the move won’t noticeably increase voter turnout and that the money could be better used elsewhere. Washington state and California also cover postage costs for mail-in ballots. Harrisburg: Legislation to help agriculture in the state is going into effect, including measures to foster younger farmers, help clean water going into Chesapeake Bay and expand butchering services for small farmers. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed eight related farm bills in the Capitol on Monday, flanked by state presidents of the Future Farmers of America and the 4-H. The $23 million initiative includes funding for agricultural business development, marketing, educational programs and conservation practices. Money will also go to encourage specialty products such as hardwood, hemp and hops and to build agricultural infrastructure in urban areas. State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding calls it “the most comprehensive investment in agriculture in a generation.” Pawtucket: U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is planning a barbecue for veterans with the head of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The Rhode Island Democrat announced Thursday that he’s holding a community conversation and barbeque at the Slater Memorial Park pavilion in Pawtucket. House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, a California Democrat, plans to attend the July 14 event. It begins at noon. The committee has jurisdiction over legislation for veterans’ health care, benefits and other issues. The event is free and open to Rhode Island veterans and their families. Cicilline asks that attendees RSVP with his Pawtucket office. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Office of Veterans Affairs will be there to provide information about resources available to local veterans. Columbia: Residents will pay less to go to the state’s only public law school next year. The State newspaper of Columbia reports that in-state tuition will fall $5,100 next year at the University of South Carolina School of Law, thanks in part to an injection of new money by the General Assembly into public colleges and universities. Law School Dean Robert Wilcox says South Carolina has been losing students to out-of-state law schools because of cost. The full tuition price for law students last year was $29,608. Now it will be $24,508. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican, says lawmakers boosted spending at USC by $8 million this year, with the understanding that $1.9 million would specifically go to lower law school tuition. Sioux Falls: The state has seen an uptick in sales tax revenue following a June 2018 Supreme Court decision that allows it to collect money from online retailers. A new law following that decision, which requires online businesses to pay sales taxes if they conduct at least $100,000 in gross sales in at least 200 transactions in the state, went into effect Nov. 1. Revenue Secretary Jim Terwilliger says business tax licenses issued to out-of-state and online retailers since then have helped South Dakota pocket $15.9 million in tax revenue. Terwilliger says the ruling was a “landmark decision” in tax administration. Thirty-one states have enacted legislation allowing them to collect sales taxes from online businesses. Nashville: As of Monday, drivers in the Volunteer State could face a fine up to $200 for using cellphones behind the wheel. All motorists will be prohibited from holding or physically supporting a phone while driving. Hands-free devices will be allowed, including “earpieces, headphone devices or a device worn on a wrist to conduct a voice-based communication,” the legislation says. Dashboard mounts will also be allowed. The state Senate approved the ban 23-7 in April. A driver’s first violation will result in a $50 fine. If the violation is the driver’s third offense or if it results in a wreck, the fine jumps to $100. If the violation occurs in a work zone when workers are present or in a school zone when warning flashers are on, the fine is $200. The bill excludes law enforcement, first responders, utility workers and others using a phone to make an emergency call. Dallas: The city is set to bring 10 rainbow crosswalks to a neighborhood known as the historic heart of the city’s LGBTQ scene. The Dallas Morning News reports the city council approved the crosswalk project in the Oak Lawn neighborhood last week as part of $1.4 million in street improvements. Former city council member Chris Luna, one of the city’s first openly gay officials, says the crosswalks will cost $128,000. Luna and the GLBT Chamber of Commerce Foundation raised $70,000 in six weeks for the crosswalk project. He’s also looking to raise another $30,000 for ongoing maintenance. He notes that construction is slated to begin in September and expected to finish by next March. Luna says he believes the project will mark the area as a safe space. Salt Lake City: Serving a mission with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will soon be more expensive for many members of the faith. Church leadership sent a letter last week announcing that members will have to pay $500 a month starting in July 2020 for missions in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan. That is a 25% increase from the $400 a month that has been the rate since 2003. The Utah-based religion says the increase is needed because of rising costs of rent, food, utilities and transportation. The proselytizing missions are considered rites of passages for young members of the faith. Men serve two years, while women serve 18 months. There are currently about 67,500 missionaries around the world. Montpelier: Future state troopers will be allowed to have arm tattoos, if they cover them up. In the past, applicants with tattoos that were visible when wearing short sleeves were not considered for employment. Under a policy update that starts Monday, such applicants would be welcomed but, if hired, would have to cover their arms with department-issued fabric sleeves. The policy continues to prohibit tattoos on the face, neck or hands, except for commitment band tattoos on ring fingers. Officials say that they recognize that tattoos have become more popular and that the new policy will allow the state to recruit a wider pool of applicants. Virginia Beach: The National Rifle Association is holding a town hall meeting in the state about a month after the city experienced 2019’s deadliest mass shooting. The Virginian-Pilot reports one town hall was being held Monday, with another scheduled for Tuesday in Belle Haven on the state’s Eastern Shore. The lobbying arm of the NRA planned to focus on proposals that are likely to come up at the July 9 special legislative session that Gov. Ralph Northam convened in the tragedy’s wake. The Democrat said he wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider several gun control measures. Republicans have given little indication they plan to follow Northam’s agenda. Democrats quickly seized on the news of the NRA’s meetings, which some GOP lawmakers may attend. Olympia: New gun regulations taking effect in the state include a ban on undetectable guns made using 3D printers. The Seattle Times reports that a law against so-called ghost guns took effect Monday, along with components of a previously instituted law raising the legal purchase age for some guns. A law passed in January raises the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles to 21. Additional clauses taking effect Monday include enhanced background checks for semi-automatic rifle buyers and a safe gun-storage provision. A gun owner could be charged with community endangerment if a firearm is accessed and used by someone who is not allowed to possess it, such as a child or a felon. Gun-rights advocates have filed a legal challenge against the initiative’s age restriction for semi-automatic rifles. Fairmont: NASA is holding a formal ceremony to rename a facility in the state after a mathematician whose calculations helped astronauts return to Earth. The ceremony is set for Tuesday in Fairmont for the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility. Congress passed a bill allowing the name change, and President Donald Trump signed it into law Dec. 11. Johnson, who is now 100, worked at NASA’s Langley Research Center as a human “computer.” She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in the film “Hidden Figures,” which documented the contributions of her and two other African American women while overcoming racism and sexism. Last year, Johnson was honored by alma mater West Virginia State University with a bronze statue and scholarship dedication. Madison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that gives the state Department of Corrections another six months to close its troubled youth prison. Allegations of guard-on-prisoner abuse have plagued the facility near Irma for years. Legislators last year passed a law forcing the DOC to close the prison by Jan. 1, 2021, and create smaller facilities for juvenile offenders. Evers has said that timetable is too aggressive. He says replacement facilities won’t be ready by then. Republican Rep. Michael Schraa introduced a bill that keeps the prison open until July 1, 2021. The Assembly and Senate approved the bill in June. Evers announced Monday that he signed the bill Friday. He said in a news release that his top priority remains getting kids out of the youth prison. Gillette: The final deadline for competitors in a carbon-capture contest has been extended by four months. Carbon XPRIZE Executive Director Marcius Extavour says organizers want to make sure competitors have enough time to demonstrate their technologies. The extension means the final data submission for the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition is due June 30, 2020. Wyoming Public Radio reports XPRIZE will now announce the winner in September 2020, instead of the spring. The contest seeks to promote technology to put carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant to profitable use. The profits would offset the cost of keeping the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. Five teams will compete in the final round and get to test their ideas at a coal-fired power plant near Gillette.

          / CBS News Former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is campaigning for his old job after being removed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for his officers' failure to protect Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where 17 students died in a mass shooting last year. DeSantis quickly suspended Israel after assuming the governorship this year and appointed former Coral Springs police Sgt. Gregory Tony to replace Israel. CBS affiliate WPEC-TV reports that Israel filed his paperwork Monday morning to run for re-election as sheriff in the 2020 Democratic primary. ""I want to get back to working with the incredible men and women of the Broward County Sheriff's Office,"" Israel said. ""I want to get back to my communities."" During the governor's campaign, DeSantis originally said he would suspend Israel, but then backed off slightly, saying he would hold officeholders accountable. DeSantis tweeted that the suspension was over Israel's ""repeated failures, incompetence and neglect of duty."" In the fallout of the shooting, two other Broward County deputies were fired for neglect of duty. One of those was school resource officer Scot Peterson, who was also arrested on criminal charges for child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury. The sheriff's department has also since lost its law enforcement accreditation over its mishandling of the mass shooting as well as a 2017 shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. A state commission investigating the shooting at the Parkland, Florida school had concluded Israel's changes to the department's active shooter policy may have contributed to some deputies' inaction during the shooting. DeSantis' executive order said that Israel inserted into the department's active shooter policy that deputies ""may"" enter a building to confront a shooter in order to preserve life. Israel argues, however, that training was ""industry standard."" ""The same training as many other sheriffs and police departments,"" he said. The former top cop has since been fighting his suspension before a Florida senate, claiming it was a politically motivated attack. ""This was about politics, not Parkland,"" Israel said. The full state senate, however, could vote on Israel's fate in the fall, throwing a wrench into Israel's campaign. ""If and when the people of Broward County vote for another person who receives more votes than me, then I'll walk away from this job with my head held high,"" Israel said.

14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-2020-democrats-differ-gun-control/story?id=62970498,"Younger voters have put the pressure on Democrats to deliver solutions. Beto O' Rourke talks guns, racism and immigration with Texas voters Democratic presidential candidates are both renewing their gun control proposals and pushing for more progressive plans in the wake of recent mass shootings in Odessa, Texas, El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left more than 30 victims dead. Here are the current and former candidates who have put out proposals so far and what we know about the candidates who have yet to do so. The list doesn't include every Democratic candidate, but highlights candidates who have significant positions or experiences that set them apart -- whether they were the first to support a policy, switched positions over the years, held office at the time a mass shooting occurred or have experience with guns through military service. Former candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., carved out one of the most ambitious paths in the gun policy debate ahead of 2020 -- a plan he called ""the most comprehensive gun violence prevention plan of any candidate for president in decades."" Booker's policy, announced in May, would have required all gun owners to acquire a license through the federal government. Currently, 16 states have similar laws to varying degrees. His plan ultimately pushed federal licensing into the conversation for Democrats, prompting Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke to echo their support for a national gun licensing program or include it in their own policy announcements. O'Rourke, who also ultimately ended his bid,  demanded banks and credit card companies to stop processing assault weapons sales and firearm transactions without a background check. O’Rourke’s plan was to drum up public pressure by calling on these financial institutions to deny services to all gun and ammunition manufacturers that produce or sell assault weapons. This call appears to be the first of its kind among the Democratic candidates. Some have also issued support for buyback programs, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Biden, who authored the 1994 assault weapons ban, is in favor of universal background checks and renewing a ban on assault weapons. However, he has yet to release a detailed plan on gun control reform. Another candidate who is no longer in the race, Castro, who unveiled a gun policy after the El Paso shooting, also came out in support of buybacks. In the past, Castro has described buybacks as having ""had mixed success,"" but as being ""good policy"" in some circumstances. Warren, who did not include support for buybacks in her gun policy announced in the wake of the El Paso and Dayton shootings, described her focus on reducing the power of the NRA, putting $100 million annually toward gun safety research and reducing gun deaths in the country by 80%. ""Historically, when Congress works to address big national issues, we don't simply pass one law and cross our fingers. Instead, we continue the research -- into new policies and around the consequences of our existing policies -- and then come back on a regular basis to update the law,"" she wrote in her plan. ""We don't do this with guns."" ""This ends when I'm president,"" Warren said. Warren, who was born and raised in Oklahoma and has said that she values the rights of ""law-abiding citizens"" to own guns, was one of the last front-runner candidates to unveil a gun policy, despite her efforts to be out in front of a host of other 2020 issues by dominating the arena of plans. Before announcing her policy, Warren had gained support of gun control advocates for her work in the Senate. After the deadly 2017 shooting in Parkland, Florida, Warren wrote letters to several major companies that invested with gun manufacturers and asked them to pressure the industry to change. ""I encourage you to take action to ensure that the gun companies in which you invest are taking steps to reduce gun violence,"" Warren wrote to Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and others. In her presidential plan, Warren echoed Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in pledging to act on gun control within her first 100 days through executive action. Harris, too, has since ended her presidential bid. Harris, who announced her plan in April, said she would also require near-universal background checks to be run by people selling more than five guns in a year and revoke the licenses of gun manufacturers and dealers that break the law. She has also talked about renewing the 1994 law that banned assault weapons but expired in 2004 -- an idea with near universal support among Democratic candidates. For Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., judging gun control legislation is about what would ""hurt [her] Uncle Dick in the deer stand,"" a perspective that comes from her state's value of the outdoors, including hunting and fishing, Klobuchar said in a CNN town hall in February. ""And so I come at it from a little different place than some of my colleagues running for this office,"" she said. But those factors don't keep her from supporting universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons, she said. In the past, Klobuchar has applied the same rule about her Uncle Dick to other laws, like preventing people on a terrorist watch list from buying guns. ""Would closing off the loophole in the terrorist watch list hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand? Not at all,"" Klobuchar said in 2016. Much like Klobuchar, Sanders has many constituents who hunt. According to Vermont's Department of Fish and Wildlife, there are 66,000 residents who hunt and the state rakes in nearly $4 million in hunting license revenue each year. In the past, the rural connection has led to criticism by some progressives that Sanders was too moderate on gun control, especially in his early career. The Vermont senator has made a point since kicking off his 2020 campaign to show he's evolved. During the 2016 battle for the Democratic candidacy, Sanders frequently was attacked for repeatedly voting against a 1993 law that established federal background checks. At the time, Sanders told a local newspaper that he supported background checks but was opposed to the federally mandated waiting period that came along with it because it might affect local gun shop sales. Sanders often brings up his lengthy record to prove a different point: He has consistently voted since the 1980s to ban semi-automatic assault weapons. Only one of the nearly two dozen major Democratic presidential candidates has not seen a mass shooting take place in their state while in office: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. For the purpose of this analysis, ABC News defined a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooter. Harris, for example, who has made gun control a key part of her 2020 platform, held office in California when two of the state's most deadly mass shootings in recent history took place: 14 people were killed in San Bernardino in 2015 and 12 people were killed in a shooting at a college bar in Thousand Oaks in 2018. Colorado has also seen some of the most notable mass shootings in the country and there were two candidates in the race from the state: Sen. Michael Bennet and former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 15 and later announced that he would run for a Colorado Senate seat in 2020. After a shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2012 claimed 12 lives, Hickenlooper signed gun control measures that required background checks for private and online gun sales and banned high-capacity magazines. Bennet also voted to ban high-capacity magazines, but in 2010 voted to oppose restricting the right to bear arms and in 2009 voted to allow Amtrak riders to check bags containing guns. During Biden's nearly five decades in public office, there were dozens of mass shootings, which has in turn made Biden a longtime advocate for gun control. As a U.S. senator, he introduced the assault weapons ban, which was signed into law in 1994. And after the deaths of 20 first-grade students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, then-Vice President Biden led a new task force on gun violence. Four months after the tragedy in Connecticut, Biden's modest measure on background checks passed the House, but didn't make it out of the Senate. For O'Rourke, a minor switch came just a few months into the 2020 cycle, after Booker announced his proposed plan, and again after the shooting in El Paso shattered his hometown. Asked about establishing federal gun licensing in May, O'Rourke initially told reporters on the campaign trail that it went ""too far."" But after a night of reflection, he changed his mind. ""What I think Sen. Booker has done is to push us past that to seek to do even more, and I'm grateful that he's done that and I, you know, as I've thought about it, I really think that we should be looking at everything,"" O'Rourke said the next day on the trail. After the shooting in El Paso, O'Rourke also came out in support of a buyback program. For the former governor of Colorado, the evolution on guns was a longer, more-complicated process. ""This wasn't a Colorado problem. This is a human problem,"" Hickenlooper told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in 2012, in the wake of the Aurora shooting. ""Even if he didn't have access to guns, this guy was diabolical. … He would have done something to create this horror."" Since then, Hickenlooper has adapted his tone, and more than once. Colorado has passed measures expanding background checks and limiting magazine sizes to 15 rounds, despite backlash from gun rights groups. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 28, has also evolved, tumbling from an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association to an ""F"" -- a point of pride, she's said. ""I didn't have much of an understanding about what gun violence actually looks like in a community,"" Gillibrand said in a 2016 podcast about her past pro-gun stance, when she represented a rural upstate New York district. She was changed by conversations with families who'd been devastated by gun violence in cities, she said. Gillibrand was joined by fellow former presidential hopeful Rep. Tim Ryan, of Ohio, who was also formerly given an ""A"" rating from the NRA. Ryan shifted his stance more recently than Gillibrand, speaking out after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. He has since donated roughly $20,000 to gun control organizations. There were three candidates in the race who were trained to use guns in combat. Even though their legislative records differ, all three support a ban on military-style assault rifles. After 49 people were killed at Pulse, a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, Marine veteran and current Rep. Seth Moulton tweeted a photo of himself in uniform holding a military-grade rifle, saying, ""I know assault rifles. I carried one in Iraq. They have no place on America's streets."" The rifle the Massachusetts congressman was holding is not available to civilians and was not the same gun that was used in the nightclub shooting. Moulton, who dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 23, also authored bipartisan legislation to ban bump stocks, an accessory that increases the firing rate, after the device was used in the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people in 2017. ""There are common sense reforms, there are common sense laws that we can pass, that are respectful of gun rights but still will reduce this public health crisis in America,"" he said in an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" with co-anchor Martha Raddatz after the Las Vegas shooting. Also after the shooting in Las Vegas, Buttigieg, a U.S. Navy Reserve veteran who was deployed to Afghanistan, similarly denounced AR-style rifles. ""I did not carry an assault weapon around a foreign country so I could come home and see them used to massacre my countrymen,"" he tweeted. Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has come under criticism for not sponsoring gun control measures that are widely supported by other Democrats in the House. But she has voted to ban assault weapons, and, shortly after the deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, killed 17, Gabbard added her name as a co-sponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Here's how the 2020 Democrats differ on gun control,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Peter Lumaj, an attorney who fled communist Albania to the U.S., explains why The Times is wrong. The New York Times opinion team got an early start on celebrating Independence Day, declaring Monday that America is “just OK” with a slickly produced video that argues the United States is only great if you’re wealthy and privileged. “We argue that the myth of America as the greatest nation on earth is at best outdated and at worst, wildly inaccurate,” Times producers Taige Jensen and Nayeema Raza wrote when describing the video. The nearly five-minute video mocks pop culture items such as cartoons, movies and even mattress commercials for pushing the “narrative” that America is the greatest country on earth before playing devil’s advocate. NIKE DROPPED BETSY ROSS-THEMED FOURTH OF JULY SNEAKER AFTER COLIN KAEPERNICK COMPLAINED, REPORT SAYS “We argue that the myth of America as the greatest nation on earth is at best outdated and at worst, wildly inaccurate."" “Now, hold on patriots, I know what you’re thinking, ‘America has done some pretty great stuff,” a narrator says before using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as a litmus test. “Which is basically a gold club of 36 countries, predominantly wealthy, Western and Democratic. And, unlike most golf clubs, this one has got some diversity,” the narrator said. “America is the richest country in this club, but we’re also the poorest with a whopping 18 percent poverty rate, closer to Mexico than Western Europe.” The video then pivots from animated cartoon to a black screen with white font stating: “12.8 million American children live in poverty.” The clip, posted under the Times' opinion banner, then lists a series of statistics that paint America in a negative light, such as poor rankings for high school science and math levels, costs of health care, lifespan, adult obesity rates, and infant mortality rates. “But we have freedom in America,” the narrator sarcastically says. “Turns out, a lot of countries have freedom.” The video points out that while Americans “boast” about freedoms, only 56 percent of them vote while closer to 80 percent vote in other nations. “It’s getting worse, this year America slid on global rankings of corruption and freedom,” the narrator says. The video then lists areas where America succeeds, downplaying the economy and military in the process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “So what, besides our economy and military are we actually No. 1 at? Turns out, a lot of things,” the narrator says, listing civilian gun ownership, mass shooting, TV watching, prescription drug abuse, prison population and “almost No. 1” in environmental damage. The video then compares America to countries “like Pakistan or Nigeria where the rich don’t worry about the sad state of electricity or police,” pointing out that Kim Kardashian once rented private firefighters to protect her home from a devastating wildfire. “When health, education, and safety are increasingly privatized or driven by privilege, the truth is ‘how great America is really depends on how rich you are,’” the narrator says. “Now, I’m not saying we’re Pakistan or Nigeria or any number of what we like to call developing countries, but we’re not perched as high above them as we like to think.” The video says Americans have “long ignored the cracks in our system” and while it may “once have been the greatest,” that no longer applies. “Today, America, we’re just OK,” the narrator says.

16,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/A9yU-3lZbN8/,"Former Google engineer Mike Wacker claims that CEO Sundar Pichai lied to Congress when claiming that the company does not manually intervene on users search results. In a Medium blog post titled “Google’s Manual Interventions in Search Results,” former Google engineer Mike Wacker alleges that Google CEO Sundar Pichai lied to Congres when he stated “We don’t manually intervene on any particular search result.” Wacker notes that Pichai’s comment was in answer to a question from Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) who asked why photos of President Trump were returned under image searches for the term “idiot.” Pichai claimed that this was an automated process as Google ranked results based on thing such as “relevance, freshness, popularity,” etc. and outright stated that the company does nto intervene on particular search results. Wacker notes that a few days later, Slate writer April Glaser searcher for the term “abortion” on YouTube and was unhappy with the results returned, writing an article about the issue. Wacker writes: She would later receive a response from a YouTube spokesperson. However, this answer was different from the answer that Sundar Pichai delivered to Rep. Lofgren. Instead of explaining how search works and how these results were produced by an objective, automated process, the spokesperson “stressed that the company is working to provide more credible news content from its search and discovery algorithms.” Wacker began his own investigation into Google’s search algorithm where he made a discovery. “I eventually found the smoking gun: the exact change where Google had altered the search results for abortion. My initial reaction was a mix of excitement and shock.” Wacker goes on to describe the full details of the evidence he found that shows that YouTube — a Google-owned company — actively manipulated user search results: To reference the infamous phrase “alternative facts,” the change essentially used an alternative algorithm that delivers alternative search results. A special file named youtube_controversial_query_blacklist could be used to manually trigger this alternative algorithm. For any search or query that matched an entry on that blacklist, YouTube would blacklist the normal search results, switching over to the alternative search results instead. The smoking gun I had discovered was a change that added two entries to that blacklist: “abortion” and “abortions”. As a result of this change, searches for those terms displayed the alternative search results. The change had been made at Dec 14, 2018, 3:17 PM PST, mere hours after April Glaser of Slate had emailed YouTube. Wacker then goes on to give examples of some of the blacklists created by Google to suppress certain content: It didn’t end there. Herein lies the key point: it’s not about where the blacklist begins, but where the blacklist ends. In this case, that contrast could not be more stark: the first entry on the blacklist was added because of a mass shooting, and the last entry was added because a Slate writer complained about search results for abortion. Two other additions to the blacklist deserve additional scrutiny. The first one is related to a member of Congress. On December 14, 2017, “maxine waters” was added to the blacklist. This change had been made because a single employee had complained that search results for her were low quality. The potential motivations and biases of that employee are not known. Another employee then compared the normal search results and the alternative search results for “maxine waters” and decided to switch over to the alternative search results. The criteria used to determine which search results are better are also not known. The consequences of this change would then carry over into the 2018 midterm election. During that election, users who searched for Maxine Waters on YouTube would have received the alternative search results, whereas users who searched for her opponent, Omar Navarro, would have received the normal search results. In Wacker’s opinion, it is clear that Pichai did not tell the truth to Congress: Sundar’s answer misled Rep. Lofgren, who responded that the potential biases of Google’s employees “has nothing to do with the algorithms and the really automated process that is the search engine that serves us.” As it turns out, the question of “what we’re going to show the user” is not dictated solely by algorithms and automated processes, and the biases of Google’s employees could have something to do with those search results.

19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/bumpstocks-las-vegas-guns-manufacturers-lawsuit.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Mike Baker For years, advocates of gun control have struggled to pierce a legal shield that protects firearms manufacturers from liability, even as gunmen in mass shootings have relied on their powerful wares to amplify the carnage of their attacks. More than a decade ago, New York City failed in its bid to go after some gunmakers under public nuisance laws. In 2009, a case against a manufacturer associated with a series of sniper shootings in Washington, D.C., was thrown out. Then, in 2015, the family of a victim in the theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., lost a case against an ammunition dealer — and was ordered under state law to pay the dealer’s legal fees. The vast immunity offered by a 2005 federal law shielding gun manufacturers from most liability began to give way earlier this year, when the Connecticut Supreme Court issued a milestone ruling allowing some families victimized in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to sue Remington Arms and other companies over their marketing practices. Now, building on that success, those same lawyers are opening a new front against firearm manufacturers, working with the parents of a victim in the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas to argue that the design of AR-15-style rifles used in the massacre violates federal law. Thousands of people impacted by the Las Vegas shooting have filed claims against MGM Resorts, which owns the hotel where the gunman took up his perch before firing more than 1,000 rounds into a crowd of concertgoers, killing 58. But the lawsuit filed Tuesday night appears to be the first to directly target gun manufacturers based on the ease with which their products can be converted into weapons of large-scale destruction. [A Las Vegas police officer who said he “froze” and remained one floor below the gunman has been fired.] Katie Mesner-Hage, one of the lawyers on the case, said the plaintiffs will try to prove that manufacturers of firearms have made conscious decisions to allow their firearms to be readily adjusted to fire as fully automatic weapons, which are otherwise heavily restricted under state and federal laws. “We can’t fix the inherent danger of firearms,” Ms. Mesner-Hage said. “But we can address reckless and irresponsible corporate conduct.” Given the federal protections, the case faces a challenging path forward, especially with a conservative majority on the United States Supreme Court that could take a dim view of any liability for manufacturers. Filed in Nevada state court, the latest case argues that the AR-15-style rifles that have become such common weapons in mass shootings are illegal because they are one modification away — most commonly, by adding a simple device known as a “bump stock” — from approaching the rapid-firing lethality of a fully automatic rifle. The guns are often designed for customization with various accessories. [Read: What is a bump stock and how does it work?] The bump stocks used by the Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, were modified versions of the gun’s stock that allowed him to fire about nine rounds per second. Last year, the Trump administration banned bump stocks, prohibiting the sale of them and ordering the destruction of those already in use. The new case targets not the bump stocks, but the makers of the rifles themselves; a bump stock is only one way in which such rifles might be modified to become more lethal, the plaintiffs argue. Colt Manufacturing Co., listed as the lead defendant in the case, which also named seven other manufacturers of AR-15-style guns, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday. Lawrence G. Keane, general counsel for the industry’s National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the lawsuit was trying to blame manufacturers for “the deranged actions of a madman,” likening the legal argument to blaming Ford for the actions of a driver whose car had been modified with aftermarket parts. “I don’t know any right-minded person that would say that’s a valid legal theory,” Mr. Keane said. After legal victories against the tobacco industry demonstrated the power of such litigation in the 1990s, individuals and municipalities turned their attention to gun companies. At that point, the cases were flimsy, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written about gun laws. But the gun industry saw litigation as a potential existential threat, made it the No. 1 priority to resolve, and worked with the National Rifle Association to convince Congress to alter federal law so that companies would have broad immunity under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. “Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products,” President George W. Bush said at the time the law was passed in 2005. “This legislation will further our efforts to stem frivolous lawsuits, which cause a logjam in America’s courts, harm America’s small businesses, and benefit a handful of lawyers at the expense of victims and consumers.” The law included some narrow exceptions to the immunity, including a seller negligently entrusting a weapon to a dangerous person or a company violating laws surrounding the sale or marketing of the product. In the Sandy Hook lawsuit, families focused on the marketing for the AR-15-style Bushmaster, which the gunman used in the massacre. The marketing materials linked the gun to “macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection,” lawyers argued, highlighting one slogan used in advertising: “Consider your man card reissued.” State Supreme Court justices agreed that the case could move forward on the narrow issue of how the weapons were marketed. The manufacturer, Remington, has said it will seek intervention from the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Winkler said the Sandy Hook case could have substantial implications, though it is difficult to predict how the Supreme Court might respond. “It has the potential to be far-reaching,” he said. Under the new lawsuit, lawyers have traced the history of gun legislation and regulatory efforts to limit or prohibit guns with the capability of continuously firing bullets with a single pull on the trigger. transcript The AR-15-style rifle has become a common weapon for consumers, but it’s also become a weapon of choice for mass shooters. Gunmen have used them to kill dozens in horrific rampages across the country. Some of the factors that make the AR-15 popular with consumers may also help explain why mass murderers have opted to use them too. They’re capable of firing rounds that can go straight through a human body and penetrate a wall behind it. They’re lightweight and easy to use. Since the muzzle doesn’t rise up much, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to bring it back down, acquire a proper sight line and to fire again. A weapon that’s already deadly can potentially be made more dangerous by adding things like foregrips, scopes and red dot sights. The guns are expensive. But they’re within reach. They cost between $500 and $900. The AR-15 model is basically a consumer version of military-grade assault rifles such as the M-16 or the M-4 carbine. They look almost identical. The big difference: The AR-15 and its variants are semiautomatic; the M-16 and M-4 can be switched to automatic or burst. AR-15-style rifles were prohibited under the assault weapons ban from 1994 to 2004. But since that ended, sales have surged. These weapons have been branded under the term “modern sporting rifle,” which gives a weapon designed for war a consumer-friendly label. The gun is also marketed for home defense. But although they’re clearly strong enough to stop an intruder, critics say AR-15-type rifles could also cause unintended damage or even death in untrained hands. One thing is clear: No matter who’s using it, it can be an extremely lethal weapon. Federal law prohibits most weapons that are designed to fire more than one shot automatically. In its handbook about the firearm law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says it has interpreted “designed” to include weapons that “possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by simple modification. …” AR-15-style rifles are designed for modification and accessorization, with parts that can be removed and added to improve the core product. One of the components that can be modified is the stock of the gun. In the Las Vegas shooting, the gunman used AR-15-style rifles modified with bump stocks, which harness the firearm’s recoil energy. A gunman can hold his trigger finger steady as the gun slides back and forth, causing a repeated press of the trigger so that he doesn’t have to move his finger. “It was not just possible — or even probable — that a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying AR-15s to fire automatically in order to substantially increase the body count during a mass shooting. It was inevitable,” lawyers wrote in their Nevada complaint. Mr. Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation emphasized that the bump stock was an aftermarket accessory and disputed that the option makes the AR-15 convertible into a fully automatic weapon under the definition of the law. “It’s customizable, but the underlying semiautomatic action is not altered,” Mr. Keane said. But Steve Lindley, a program manager with the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Los Angeles, a gun control advocacy group, said AR-15 stocks can be easily unscrewed, removed and replaced virtually instantaneously with something like a bump stock. At that point, he said, “You have an assimilated fully automatic firearm.” It is that purported ease with which the gun can be converted that lies at the heart of the latest lawsuit. Did its manufacturers deliberately design it that way, and does that leave them unprotected by the immunity afforded under federal law? The A.T.F. determined in 2010 that it could not regulate bump stocks because they could not be defined as the kind of automatic weapon prohibited under the law. Last year, the Trump administration reversed that decision, banning the product. One industry group later challenged that decision, but the Supreme Court allowed the ban to stand. The Nevada case was filed by the parents of Carrie Parsons, who was 31 years old and living in the Seattle area when she went to Las Vegas for a weekend with friends and attended the festival where the shooting occurred. As the first shots sent people scattering, Ms. Parsons and a friend began running, holding each other’s hands, according to the lawsuit. They managed to leave the venue, ran through a parking lot and climbed over a fence. As they approached a street and an ambulance, a bullet struck Ms. Parsons in the shoulder. She managed to reach the ambulance, but did not survive her wound. James Parsons, who is the plaintiff in the lawsuit along with his wife, Ann-Marie, said the public needed to know the level of danger posed by weapons such as those used in Las Vegas. “I’m not trying to ban guns. I’m not trying to change the Second Amendment,” Mr. Parsons said. “But when you manufacture something that is easily illegal, those people should be held responsible.” Advertisement",2019-07-03 07:01:34,"Setting Sights on the AR-15: After Las Vegas Shooting, Lawyers Target Gun Companies",,1,http://nytimes.com

The capsule was empty for the morning demonstration, which officials said appeared to be successful. Barely a minute after liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the abort motor fired, pulling the capsule from the booster about 6 miles up. The capsule continued upward another 2 miles, then flipped to jettison the abort tower. NASA chose not to use parachutes to keep this test version of the capsule simple and thus save time, and so it crashed into the Atlantic at about 300 mph as planned, the three-minute test complete. Twelve data recorders popped off in bright orange canisters before impact, for ocean retrieval. ""By all accounts, it was magnificent,"" said program manager Mark Kirasich. It will take a few months to go through all the data collected by the hundreds of vehicle sensors, he said. NASA aims to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024 using its still-in-development Space Launch System rocket. Tuesday's test represents ""a really great, great step forward today for the team,"" Kirasich said. Atlanta bans eatery smoking, vaping ATLANTA -- The Atlanta City Council has approved a far-reaching ban on smoking and vaping in restaurants and bars -- and potentially one of the world's busiest airports. City Council members approved the ban Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. It covers cigarettes, cigars and electronic cigarettes. If signed by the mayor, it would take effect on Jan. 2. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is one of the few major U.S. hubs where people can still smoke in designated rooms. Most of the busiest airports in the U.S. ban smoking in all indoor areas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 2017 report. Denver International Airport last year closed the last of its indoor smoking lounges and is now smoke-free indoors. Those still allowing smoking in designated places inside include Dulles International Airport near Washington D.C., along with airports in Atlanta; Las Vegas; and Nashville, Tenn. Atlanta's airport will fully comply with the ordinance, and the current smoking rooms inside Atlanta's airport ""will be converted to other spaces,"" airport spokesman Andrew Gobeil said in an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday. Shots survivor faces disruption charge VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- A survivor of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach who doesn't want to return to his workplace has been arrested on a ""disturbing the peace"" charge. Jonathan McIvor is accused of raising his voice and showing hostility when his supervisors asked why he won't return to work in the building where a city employee killed 12 people. The Virginian-Pilot reported that chief technology officer Darrell Riddick and acting operations manager Jamie Weaver filed the complaint. They alleged that McIvor began yelling, ""stood up aggressively"" and stormed out, saying he was going to call human resources. McIvor's bosses said the shooting has them afraid of future escalations. They accused McIvor of having acted aggressively before. The newspaper reports that McIvor was held for more than 24 hours before he was freed pending a July 31 trial. McIvor's attorney Taite Westendorf is hoping the charge is dropped. Virginia Beach's city manager has said nobody will be forced to return to the building. But McIvor's information technology job apparently requires that he access server equipment in the basement. Houston increases DWI arrests by 75% HOUSTON -- The Houston police chief said a citywide crackdown has led to a 75% increase in the number of people arrested for drunken driving in the first six months of this year. Chief Art Acevedo said Monday that Houston police logged more than 3,850 arrests for driving while intoxicated, up from the approximately 2,200 arrests in the first six months of last year. Acevedo provided the numbers while warning against drunken driving over the extended Fourth of July weekend. He said the department also is working with the Harris County district attorney's office to more quickly prosecute drunken-driving cases. An earlier Houston Chronicle investigation that analyzed data from 2001-16 found that the nine counties in the Houston region had more fatal drunken-driving wrecks than any other large metropolitan area in the U.S. A Section on 07/03/2019 Print Headline: The nation in brief Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

In the graphic clip, a gunman opens fire on a nightclub dancefloor with an automatic rifle, in reference to the shooting at the gay club Pulse in Orlando on 12 June 2016, in which 49 people died and 53 were wounded.  In the song, taken from her new album, Madame X, Madonna sings: “Blood of innocence, spread everywhere.” A written statement at the end of the video reads: “Every year over 36,000 Americans are killed in acts of gun violence and approximately 100,000 more are shot and injured. No one is safe. Gun control. Now.” González, 19, called the video “fucked up” and “horrible”, and criticised Madonna for the timing of its release. “She should have sent out a message warning what her new video contained,” she wrote on Twitter, “ESPECIALLY to the Pulse victims, ESPECIALLY as it was released just after the anniversary on June 12th.” González called on anyone who wants to support the gun violence prevention movement to donate to One Pulse Foundation and to listen to “the actual stories from actual survivors of gun violence”, and suggested that anyone sharing images or clips from the video “please tag it as triggering”. The video opens with a written message: “The story you are about to see is very disturbing. It shows graphic scenes of gun violence.” Madonna sampled a clip of González’s February 2018 speech at a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the Madame X song I Rise. “Us kids don’t know what we’re talking about,” she can be heard saying at the start of the track. “That we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.” Until the October 2017 shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that killed 58, the Pulse terror attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, was shot and killed by police during the attack – he had described himself as an “Islamic soldier” and pledged allegiance to Islamic State. In a recent interview, Madonna said: “When you think about the amount of people who have died, been killed, have been wounded, whose lives have been changed irrevocably because of the lack of gun control in America, it’s such a huge, huge problem.” In the same interview she also championed LGBT rights and criticised recent US restrictions on abortion, saying: “We fought really hard for a lot of these freedoms and now it seems like they are all systematically being taken away … It doesn’t make me feel hopeless. It just makes me want to fight back.”",2019-07-03 05:26:19,Parkland survivor Emma González criticises Madonna for gun violence video,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

The family argues that their guns are designed in a way that could be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons.  The lawsuit, which targets Colt and seven other gun manufacturers, along with gun shops in Nevada and Utah, is the latest case to challenge a federal law shielding gun manufacturers from liability.

Such a bump stock attachment was used by the Las Vegas gunman, allowing him to fire in rapid succession, killing 58 people and injuring more than 800 others in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The Trump administration banned bump stocks this year, making it illegal to possess them under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns. The lawsuit charges the manufacturers showed a “reckless lack of regard for public safety” by advertising the firearms “as military weapons and signaling the weapon’s ability to be simply modified”. The lawsuit alleges there are dozens of videos online showing people how to install bump stocks on their AR-15-style rifles. “It was only a question of when – not if – a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying AR-15s to fire automatically in order to substantially increase the body count during a mass shooting,” the lawsuit states. “Having created the conditions that made a mass shooting with a modified AR-15 inevitable, Defendant Manufacturers continued conducting business as usual.” Courts have typically rejected lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers in other high-profile shooting attacks, citing a 2005 federal law that shields gunmakers from liability in most cases when their products are used in crimes.

Netflix quietly removed dozens of episodes of Chelsea Handler’s failed talk show, ""Chelsea,"" from its archives back in 2017– an unusual move that nobody seemed to notice until a Tuesday New York Times story about widespread talk show issues for the streaming giant. A Netflix spokesperson told the Times that it had removed 66 “Chelsea” episodes in “the only instance of the company’s having scrubbed content that it owned and created,” chalking the decision up to making it easier for viewers to catch up on more recent episodes. Netflix did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. HANDLER NEEDS BREAK FROM 'TOXIC NEWS CYCLE,' WILL STAY INFORMED BY WATCHING JOY REID Political comedian and host of “The No Things Considered” podcast, Tim Young, has a different theory on why Netflix may have vanished the trove of content. “The far-left rules what is politically correct and what is allowed constantly shifts for them, to show just how woke they are,” Young told Fox News. “Handler pushed the envelope to be funny at times, and Netflix may just be trying to cover up her old material to be in line with how woke they want to portray themselves as.” Young said that “what was OK and funny” back in 2016 could suddenly be considered too politically incorrect at any moment, so it’s safer for the streaming service to remove simply old episodes of “Chelsea” before an issue pops up. According to the Times, the episodes were removed prior to the debut of its second season to provide “an easy way for viewers to catch up before the new episodes launched.” But Netflix has not removed episodes of other original programs prior to the release of a new season. CHELSEA HANDLER CALLS FOR TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT FOR SAYING SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS ARE 'ENTERTAINMENT' ""Chelsea” began its run in 2016 as a three-episode-per-week series. After mixed reviews and more politics than her fans were accustomed to, “Chelsea” returned for Season 2 as a weekly one-hour program until it was scrapped altogether. Handler initially said she would focus on political activism but she now hosts a podcast and continues to do stand-up comedy. Handler is constantly mocking President Trump and members of his administration on Twitter. In recent memory she has questioned Sen. Lindsey Graham’s sexuality, mocked former Press Secretary Sarah Sanders’ appearance, blamed a tragic mass shooting on Republicans, attempted to prove Trump has syphilis, poked fun at first lady Melania Trump’s accent and attacked Ivanka Trump on a regular basis.

Raw video: Las Vegas Metro Police Department releases body cam footage as officers make way to Stephen Paddock's room at the Mandalay Bay hotel during the attack as automatic gunfire is heard in background. An armed, veteran police officer who stood idle for several minutes as the Las Vegas gunman slaughtered dozens of concertgoers in 2017 was fired by the department months ago, officials revealed Tuesday. Cordell Hendrex was fired March 20 from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, spokesman Larry Hadfield told the Associated Press. While officials did not reveal additional details on what led to Hendrex's termination, police union president Steve Grammas said the officer was fired because of his actions during the Oct. 1, 2017 mass shooting. LAS VEGAS COP 'TERRIFIED WITH FEAR' AS GUNMAN MURDERED DOZENS, BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE SHOWS Hendrex acknowledged in a police report that he was ""terrified with fear"" as gunman Stephen Paddock -- a floor above him -- killed 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. ""I froze right there in the middle of the hall for how long I can't say,"" he wrote in the report. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Cordell Hendrex, left, was fired in March for his response to the October mass shooting that left 58 people dead.
      (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department) In video footage released by police, Hendrex could be seen leading a police trainee and three Mandalay Bay security guards to the sounds of gunfire coming from the hotel’s 32nd floor, where Paddock set up his sniper post, but not confronting the shooter. In body cam videos, Hendrex is seen directing the group, with their handguns drawn, on the 31st floor. ""Holy s---. That's rapid fire,” Hendrex is heard saying amid the sounds of Paddock unloading his rifle. “Oh my God,” he later says, before letting out an exasperated sigh. Hendrex, who worked with the police department since August 2008, also told police radio he was “inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor, we can hear automatic fire coming from one floor above us.” In a three-page summary of its key findings, the FBI said it cannot determine why gunman Stephen Paddock killed 58 people on Oct. 1, 2017. ""Just be advised it is automatic fire, fully automatic fire from an elevated position,"" he is told in response. “Take cover.” The video footage, captured by the body camera of Las Vegas Officer Elif Varsin, then showed the group standing in the hallway for about two minutes before taking refuge in a stairwell heading up to the 32nd floor for around 15 minutes, at which point the clip ends. LAS VEGAS SHOOTING STILL A MYSTERY AS FBI CLOSES INVESTIGATION Grammas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal, which first reported Hendrex's firing, that the union does not believe the officer should have been fired and is fighting to get him reinstated. The union president said the department only launched an internal affairs investigation after the body camera footage was released and the department received criticism. Dramatic video, released by order of a Las Vegas judge, shows chaos as officers arrived at the Route 91 Music Festival; senior correspondent Adam Housley reports. The actions of Hendrex -- which drew comparisons to those of Scot Peterson, a former school resource officer who failed to act during the 2018 Parkland high school shooting -- came into the spotlight following records releases. Grammas told the Review-Journal the night of the massacre that officers were ""up against something that nobody has been up against before."" “Everybody talks about how they would respond to these things,” he told the paper. “But no one knows until they are up against that evil.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP News of Hendrex's firing comes on the heels of the firing of four police officers in Florida as a result of their inaction to the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people. It is still unknown what caused Stephen Paddock to carry out the Las Vegas shooting.
      (AP) In January, the FBI said it hadn't concluded anything more about Paddock's mysterious motive for the attack than it had the day after the shooting stopped. Despite police finding 23 weapons in Paddock’s room after the shooting, he left no note to explain the chaotic mess he left behind. “It wasn't about MGM, Mandalay Bay or a specific casino or venue,”  Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, said at the time. “It was all about doing the maximum amount of damage and him obtaining some form of infamy.” Fox News Greg Norman, Ryan Gaydos, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Officer Larry Hadfield confirmed Tuesday night that Officer Cordell Hendrex was fired March 20. Hadfield did not offer additional details or answer questions regarding an internal review of the actions of Hendrex and other officers that night. Police union president Steve Grammas told The Associated Press in an email that Hendrex had been fired because of his actions during the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting.

Police body camera video released by the department shows Hendrex, along with a rookie officer and three hotel security officers, waiting in the hallway of the 31st floor in the Mandalay Bay casino-resort for about five minutes before moving to a stairwell leading to the 32nd floor, where the gunman was raining bullets onto the crowd below. They remained in the stairwell for at least 15 minutes, when the video clip ends. A phone call to a publicly listed number for Hendrex was not answered Tuesday night.

36,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/eymCV0UmalE/,"The parents of a victim killed in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against eight gun manufacturers. The suit, which was filed Tuesday, argues the design of the firearms used in the deadly incident caused the death of the plantiffs' daughter and violated state and federal bans on automatic weapons. Specifically, it argues the gunmakers were not only aware that the firearm models could be modified to mimic automatic firing, but knowingly marketed them in that way. It's not the first lawsuit to be filed following the mass shooting, where a man fired at outdoor concert-goers through the window of the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Other victims' relatives have sued MGM Resorts International, which owns the property where the shooting took place. MGM's been in settlement talks over the suits, and expects to pay out up to $800 million. But it is the first related lawsuit to target a gunmaker. As the Associated Press notes, the legal system has generally turned down those cases, citing a 2005 federal law that protects gun manufacturers from liability in mass shooting incidents, with some rare exceptions. The same legal team representing the plaintiffs in the Nevada case are also responsible for a recent related development in Connecticut Supreme Court. Back in March, justices there ruled that gun manufacturer Remington could be sued over how it marketed the rifle model that was used in the deadly 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Earlier this year, the Trump administration enacted a ban on bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire faster. But gun rights advocates argue legislative solutions don't effectively tackle the core issue of violent crime. At least one gun rights advocacy group appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court upheld the ban. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

7.3.2019 4:15 PM A new lawsuit against the manufacturers of guns used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting claims that AR-15-style rifles are illegal because they are compatible with bump stocks, which increase their rate of fire. The plaintiffs, parents of a woman who was murdered in the Las Vegas massacre, argue that bump stocks like the ones used in that attack convert semi-automatic rifles into illegal machine guns—a position that has been endorsed by the Trump administration. Therefore, they argue, AR-15s are themselves illegal, since the federal definition of machine guns includes firearms that ""can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger."" That claim is important, since the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which generally shields gun makers from liability for crimes committed with their products, includes an exception for ""an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product."" And while the complaint (for reasons that will become clear) does not mention the Trump administration's extralegal administrative ban on bump stocks, the logic of that policy reinforces the plaintiffs' central argument. Since 1986 federal law has banned the production and sale of new machine guns, including weapons that can be readily converted into machine guns and parts used for that purpose, for civilian use. During the Obama administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) concluded on several occasions that bump stocks, which facilitate a firing technique in which the rifle moves back and forth, repeatedly resetting the trigger and pushing it against the shooter's stationary finger, do not turn rifles into machine guns. The reason is clear. A rifle equipped with a bump stock does not automatically fire more than one shot for each function of the trigger. It fires one round each time the trigger is activated, and the process is not automatic, since the shooter has to maintain forward pressure on the weapon and keep his finger in position. Notwithstanding that reality, Donald Trump, in response to the Las Vegas massacre, decided he could ban bump stocks by administrative fiat—the approach favored by the National Rifle Association. He instructed the Justice Department, which includes the ATF, to come up with a rationale, which required defining ""function of the trigger"" as ""pull of the trigger,"" defining a trigger pull so as to exclude what happens during bump firing, and treating the shooter as part of the rifle mechanism. The Nevada lawsuit, which was filed in the District Court of Clark County, omits that part of the story, since the fact that the ATF repeatedly said bump stocks were legal before reversing itself under Trump's orders after the Las Vegas attack weakens the case that manufacturers knew before then that they were breaking the law by producing guns that could be equipped with bump stocks. Instead the plaintiffs argue that manufacturers were aware that their guns were compatible with bump stocks and should have recognized that meant they could be readily converted into machine guns, even though the ATF had concluded otherwise. In light of the bureaucratic history that the lawsuit glides over, that argument is highly dubious. But going forward, if you accept the Trump administration's view of bump stocks, it is at least superficially plausible to maintain that AR-15s are now illegal, since they can be readily equipped with such accessories. In an interview with The New York Times, Lawrence Keane, general counsel for the gun industry's National Shooting Sports Foundation, noted that an AR-15 is ""customizable, but the underlying semiautomatic action is not altered."" That's true, but it does not matter under the Trump administration's unilateral redefinition of machine guns. Indeed, the logic of Trump's ban suggests that any semi-automatic rifle is now illegal, since bump firing does not require bump stocks. The ATF concedes that ""individuals wishing to replicate the effects of bump-stock-type devices could also use rubber bands, belt loops, or otherwise train their trigger finger to fire more rapidly."" The implication is that any semi-automatic rifle, if owned by someone who also has rubber bands, belt loops, or fingers, could be considered a machine gun. None of that means this lawsuit will succeed. In addition to the problem of proving that manufacturers knowingly violated the law, based on an interpretation that was explicitly rejected by the federal agency charged with enforcing that law, there is the unexamined assumption that the Las Vegas attack would not have happened, or at least would have been less lethal, had the defendants not sold weapons that were compatible with bump stocks. ""The events of October 1 would not have occurred but for the Defendants' illegal
and wrongful conduct,"" the lawsuit claims. That proposition seems hard to defend, since this was the first time a mass shooter had used bump stocks, and such killers typically use handguns, not AR-15-style rifles. For example, the perpetrator of the 1991 Killeen massacre, which killed 23 people, used pistols, as did the perpetrators of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, which killed 32 people, and the Virginia Beach attack that killed 12 people last May. It's true that the death toll in Las Vegas, which was the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history, was considerably higher, and people tend to assume that bump stocks—as opposed to, say, firing from a height onto a crowd with multiple weapons and lots of ammunition—explain that horrifying achievement. ""It was only a question of when—not if—a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying AR-15s to fire automatically [sic] in order to substantially increase the body count during a mass shooting,"" the lawsuit says. But given the well-known tradeoff between speed and accuracy that bump firing entails, it's possible the perpetrator could have killed as many people without bump stocks. According to the lawsuit, the Las Vegas shooter fired 1,049 rounds in 10 minutes, killing 58 people, or one for every 18 rounds. In the 2018 Parkland shooting, by contrast, the perpetrator fired about 150 rounds in six minutes, killing 17 people, or one for every nine rounds. By that measure, the Las Vegas shooter was half as accurate as the Parkland shooter. Yet the plaintiffs in the Nevada case are implicitly arguing that their daughter would not have died if the Las Vegas shooter had taken the time to aim. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who leads the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, argued shortly after the Las Vegas massacre that bump stocks did not necessarily make the attack more deadly. ""If he had been more clear-thinking and methodical about it,"" Massie said, ""he could have inflicted more casualties by shooting his firearms without bump stocks."" Assuming the Nevada case goes to trial, that issue will be tested in court, along with the claim that gun manufacturers violated a ban that did not exist until Trump decided to rewrite the law.

(sigh)  I think I will go out and buy myself some fingers, rubber-bands, and a belt-loop or two, so my Ruger 10-22 can be called  a machine gun……. The 10/22 is already capable of full semi automatic fire. Isn’t that deadly enough? Yeah, and if I “fan” my .45 Blackhawk it also becomes capable of firing more than one shot with only one pull of the trigger. And a double-action revolver is also semi-automatic, firing one shot with each pull of the trigger. 🙂 full semi automatic DNC footsoldiers mobilized immediately. If Trump was relying on the NRA to argue and defend his response to the Las Vegas shooting come 2020, his bet was poorly timed.  After the fiascoes at the NRA recently, they may not have as much clout anymore. It was probably time for new leadership on the gun rights front anyway.  We can’t trust the ACLU to defend our gun rights in the court of public opinion, and sometimes the NRA’s arguments look like what they’d be if the ACLU did defend gun rights–but the arguments were written by a reluctant, gun-hating intern who could only get the job nobody else wanted. I’m going to switch my donations to the Second Amendment Foundation and gun rights organizations that specialize in litigation. They seem to be doing more for gun rights than the groups that focus on political candidates or the culture war. Well, then my defense would be that the bump stock does nothing in and of itself, the person using it becomes an integral part of the firing reset mechanism. If I were to hold a bump-stocked AR-15 out to the side of my body, and press the trigger (from reaching outward from the body side, not grasping around the grip and pointing my finger in), only one shot would be fired, because the stock would not bump against my body. Therefore, the human body would also be an illegal modification But the democrats say people can’t be illegal! Read the full definition.  The new definition replaces “function” with “pull”.  “The term “machinegun” means any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.” The definition “can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger” was intended to cover what were originally full automatic firearms converted to semi-automatic that could “be readily restored” to full auto often just by filing clearance for movement of a selector switch. The main exception being Reising Model 50 Reising submachineguns that ATF allowed to be converted to Reising Model 60 semi-automatic carbines, which ATF deemed not readily restored to original function. To be restored to shoot full-automatically, it had to have originally been a full-auto. So they purposefully misinterpreted the law to ban automatic firearms? To ban SEMIautomatic firearms. Part of the problem with these discussions is that to military users “automatic” is shorthand for full-automatic or machine gun fire (more than one shot per trigger pull), while to most civilian users “automatic” is shorthand for semi-automatic or autoloading (one shot per trigger pull). I remember back in the 1950s Dad and I took his brother’s Remington Model 1924 “automatic” .22 rifle to the country to shoot tin cans. They were more probably ignorant of the intent of the original law  than purposefully misinterpreting the law. Google is now paying $17000 to $22000 per month for working online from home.

Hence, all semi trucks should be banned. An airliner is designed so that anyone with basic flying skills can fly it into a skyscraper. Any more examples of this idiocy? Just this one; car manufactures are responsible for all drunk driving. They are also responsible for all bank robberies where a car is used for the getaway. Q.E.D I don’t think that this approach is going to get AR-15s banned. First, and foremost, there are just too many of them out in the public in common usage. That is one significant factor in determining whether the government can ban firearm. One or two out of many millions has been misused with what has now, in retrospect, been defined to be a conversion to automatic fire. But banning AR-15s this way opens up a significant challenge to the NFA. The one time that the Supreme Court looked at the constitutionality of the NFA (Miller), they found it Constitutional because the offending firearm was not commonly used by our military (which was factually wrong, but that was the record they had). At that time, fully automatic firearms were not heavily used by our military, at least on an individual basis. That changed dramatically almost 60 years ago, when the M16, based on the civilian AR-15, was introduced, and since then probably most every soldier, marine etc, has been trained on this firearm. It has been their main battle rifle that entire time. So, how do you maintain the federal regulation of M16 machine guns, in light of Miller? The Militia Clause would suggest that it would be the last firearm that they could regulate under the NFA, and subsequently ban new ones. My suggestion is that this regulation/banning of the military’s main battle rifle (and carbine) has survived because the AR-15, its semiautomatic sibling, is legal. They share the same manual of arms, most of their parts, and is very close to the firearm that all former military members under maybe 75 years old, the heart of any militia, were trained with. Bring it on. Wasn’t Miller a *remand*?  The justices said that nothing in the record indicated wether a short-barreled shotgun had any military use, and instructed the lower court to develop that? And the use of full-auto by our troops actually preceded the introduction of the M16; the M14 was also select fire. “Wasn’t Miller a *remand*? The justices said that nothing in the record indicated wether a short-barreled shotgun had any military use, and instructed the lower court to develop that?” Technically yes.  However, no proceedings were ever held on remand.  United States v Miller by the time of the Supreme Court decision, Miller had been killed and Layton made a plea bargain after the decision was handed down, so there were no claimants left to continue legal proceedings. bUt BuMp StOcKs ArE nOt A hIlL wOrTh DyInG fOr Change your name Pat, “Give me liberty or give me death” What makes this so absurd is that the guns were designed that way before bump stocks were a legal product.  Bump stocks weren’t on the market until 2008. John Browning invented his first automatic rifle when he converted a lever action rifle. If the above lawsuit proceeds, no gun that isn’t a single shot or a revolver can exist.

AR-15s are themselves illegal, since the federal definition of machine guns includes firearms that “can be readily RESTORED to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” Yet the most important word here – RESTORED – is totally ignored in this analysis, making it specious if not deliberately deceptive… Exactly. Restored is defined as returning to original condition using original parts.  They are trying to redefine the definition into conversion (which is already illegal) similar to the classic car world’s Restomod which is returning to original looking condition using after market parts not original to the vehicle. The problem with the lawsuit is the phrase “single function of the trigger” means pulling it once and firing multiple rounds.  A bump stock uses inertia to pull the trigger once for each round fired.  That fact the lawsuit also refers to AR platform rifles as “weapons of war” shows the true intent and mindset of those involved.  The lawsuit will go nowhere. They are trying to redefine “restore” to include “conversion” all based on the old, worn out, whining about the cosmetic appearance of the firearm. Hell, I wonder why they haven’t gone after the BB guns used at carnivals. You know, the ones that look like Tommy Guns and fire more than one round per trigger pull.  😉 BB guns are not firearms, and are not subject to firearms laws. That’s why full auto bb guns, airsoft guns and paintball guns are all legal. “New Jersey defines all non-powder guns as firearms, subjecting these guns to all regulations and restrictions applicable to firearms. To obtain a BB or pellet handgun, a person must obtain a permit to purchase a handgun…” “Rhode Island defines all non-powder guns as firearms, ensuring that felons and other persons prohibited from possessing firearms are similarly barred from possessing dangerous non-powder guns….” “Minnesota prohibits the carrying of a BB gun in a public place. Minnesota also prohibits the display, exhibition, brandishing or other use of a BB gun in a threatening manner, if while doing so, the possessor:..” “North Dakota defines “dangerous weapon,” to include “any weapon that will expel, or is readily capable of expelling, a projectile by the action of a spring, compressed air, or compressed gas including any such weapon, loaded or unloaded, commonly referred to as a BB gun, air rifle, or CO[2] gun. Thus, except where otherwise specified, any law in the Criminal or Weapons sections of the North Dakota Century Code that refers to dangerous weapons is applicable to non-powder guns…” etc https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/50-state-summaries/non-powder-guns-state-by-state/ I actually won that game once.

39,"http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/dorothy-van-den-honert-the-only-solution-to-guns,578529"," PITTSFIELD — The words, gun control, are an oxymoron. In case wisps of your high school English have vanished, an oxymoron is a couple of paired words that have opposite meanings, like jumbo shrimp or pretty ugly. Guns have one purpose, and one purpose only and that is to inflict the most dreadful pain possible onto somebody, sometimes to discourage thieves, sometimes to scare somebody into doing something he normally wouldn't think of doing. (Forget hunting. Nobody needs to hunt.) In the hands of some total nutcase, the result can be as vicious as taking revenge on some jealous lover or as mind-boggling as the mass shooting of children in an elementary school. Surely every parent, and most normal people, were appalled at the idea of people losing their little kids. Anguish, sorrow, sympathy, collections of flowers, notes of condolence, appear everywhere. I feel as sorry as the next person every time I read about some other vicious act — until I came upon the recent story about the little seven year old girl who had half of her jaw blown off before another bullet mercifully dispatched her. At that point I got sick. Now everybody is arguing over whether we should reduce gun ownership with background checks and equally worthless devices. Well-meaning people honestly believe that if only the mentally stable owned guns and people kept their weapons locked up where the kids couldn't get at them, that gun violence would somehow disappear. Or that training in handling guns would help. Or that if some sort of psychiatric measure were applied to prospective buyers the violence would go away. There is no way on earth to predict when certain kinds of brains will snap, and if you really believe that psychiatrists can save us from people who go beserk, I have a bridge I would like to sell you. GET RID OF THEM The only way to get rid of gun violence is to get rid of guns. End of story. But, you say, you simply can't get rid of all guns, and that is partly true. It is hard to get totally rid of virtually anything. But there are a lot of ways the mayhem can be reduced to the same level of a few countries that have successfully outlawed guns. We already know some of them. It would take a little time and a lot of money for the government to scoop up all the guns that infest this country, but it is possible. On the other hand, there is simply no way to equate the ""satisfaction"" gun owners get from their ownership with the agony of that child who went to heaven with a bleeding face and half a jaw. Then why don't Americans retrieve the gun, put the resistant owner in the pokey for 10 years and live up to our claim to being a civilized nation that subscribes to the reverence for life that is the basis of all big religions? Well, we do. We have brakes and signal lights and windshield wipers, we have tread on our tires and we have horns. We require a driver's license and adulthood, guns that must ride in the trunk, and sobriety. For Heaven's sake, what does it take? The answer is easy. No guns. It would be expensive for the government to pay gun owners to return their guns, but perhaps it might be less less than paying for healthcare to repair wounds. Aside from the cost, there is one startling fact that knocked me for a loop. Apparently toddlers kill more people than terrorists do! Probably Daddy buys the gun but doesn't store it properly. In any case, I would rather sit on the porch some summer evening sharing an ice cream cone with my next door neighbor's happy little kid than one who has just lost his Daddy.

42,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/04/suspect-in-fatal-trail-knifing-ruled-un/,"Officer who shot black man avoids cell MIAMI -- Former North Miami police officer Jonathon Aledda avoided a prison sentence Wednesday in the 2016 shooting of an unarmed black man who was caring for an autistic man. Police said that at the time of the shooting that the autistic man was playing with a toy truck that resembled a gun. Aledda, who was fired from his job Tuesday, was sentenced to one year of administrative probation, 100 hours of community service and must write a 2,500-word essay on communication and weapon discharges. Judge Alan Fine also ruled to withhold adjudication in the case, meaning Aledda's conviction will not appear on his criminal record. After Aledda's first trial ended with a hung jury, last month a different jury convicted Aledda, 33, of misdemeanor culpable negligence for his role in the nonfatal shooting July 18, 2016, of Charles Kinsey, a behavorial therapist. The jury acquitted him of two felony counts of attempted manslaughter. Aledda was responding to a call of a man attempting suicide with a gun. Police found Arnaldo Rios Soto, then 26, sitting in the street with a silver toy truck. Kinsey, who was recorded on a cellphone lying on the road with his arms up, attempted to tell police that Rios Soto was not a threat. Aledda did not hear him and fired three rounds in Rios Soto's direction, striking Kinsey in the leg. Judge blocks Ohio fetal heartbeat law COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked an Ohio law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, siding with abortion clinics that had argued that the law would effectively end the procedure in the state. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett halts the enforcement starting July 11. A fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant. Ohio is among a dozen states that have considered similar legislation this year, as abortion opponents have pursued a national anti-abortion strategy to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Courts already have blocked substantially similar laws in Kentucky and Mississippi. Abortion providers also have sued in Alabama and Georgia. Barrett said it is his opinion that Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil-rights attorneys that sued to stop the law ""are certain to succeed on the merits of their claim that (the bill) is unconstitutional on its face."" Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the Ohio law in April, after predecessor John Kasich, a fellow Republican, twice vetoed it. His spokesman, Dan Tierney said: ""Gov. DeWine has long believed that this issue would ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court."" Suspect in fatal trail knifing ruled unfit ABINGDON, Va. -- A Massachusetts man accused of fatally stabbing a hiker on the Appalachian Trail has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. James Jordan was returned to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service on Wednesday after U.S. District Magistrate Judge Pamela Meade Sargent found that he is not mentally fit for trial. The 30-year-old Jordan, from West Yarmouth, Mass., is charged with murder and assault with intent to commit murder in the May 11 knife attack on two hikers on the Appalachian Trail in southwestern Virginia. Ronald Sanchez Jr., 43, of Oklahoma, died after being stabbed several times, and a female hiker was seriously hurt. Authorities have not identified the woman. City orders inquiry into mass shooting VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- The Virginia Beach City Council has ordered an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding a recent mass shooting that killed 12 people. News outlets reported that the council unanimously voted Tuesday to have the city auditor hire an independent contractor to investigate gunman DeWayne Craddock. The investigation will analyze Craddock's employment and workplace history, city policies and how to prevent similar violence. The city engineer opened fire in his work building on May 31, the same day he submitted his resignation notice. He killed 12 people and wounded several others before he was gunned down by police. The resolution calls for the inquiry to start as soon as the contract is awarded, which it says will happen no later than Aug. 15.

44,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/X2sIt0vQTXY/,"In 2017, Netflix removed dozens of episodes of Chelsea — one in a lengthening line of failed talk shows on the platform. The disappearance of those episodes was brought into focus when The New York Times published an article titled Netflix Has a Talk Show Problem. According to the streaming giant, this represents “the only instance of the company’s having scrubbed content that it owned and created.” And while Netflix maintains that it was done to provide “an easy way for viewers to catch up before the new episodes launched,” political comedian and No Things Considered podcast host Tim Young is not buying it. As admitted by the company, no other original programming has ever been scrubbed for that (or any other) reason. “The far-left rules what is politically correct and what is allowed constantly shifts for them, to show just how woke they are,” Young told Fox News. “Handler pushed the envelope to be funny at times, and Netflix may just be trying to cover up her old material to be in line with how woke they want to portray themselves as.” According to Young, things that were not widely perceived as offensive in 2016 are vulnerable to causing problems years later. By scrubbing old content, he theorizes that Netflix is trying to avoid any potential future controversy. It is important to note, however, that Young’s allegations are not supported by any conclusive evidence. Handler’s comedy career has shifted hard into political spheres. These days she is best known for her mockery of the Trump administration. According to Fox, “[Handler] has questioned Sen. Lindsey Graham’s sexuality, mocked former Press Secretary Sarah Sanders’ appearance, blamed a tragic mass shooting on Republicans, attempted to prove Trump has syphilis, poked fun at first lady Melania Trump’s accent, and attacked Ivanka Trump on a regular basis.” Handler even advocated for a U.S. military coup in 2017. She did, however, take a break from her righteous fury long enough to excuse former Vice President Joe Biden’s inappropriate conduct with women. And she is nothing if not an ardent fan of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. At least whoever she was mocking in 2016 has been retroactively spared.

Newtown School Shooting Sparks False Postings on Web Dec. 17, 2012 — -- Not even a national tragedy is safe from social media tomfoolery and hoaxes. After the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. on Friday, which left 20 children and six adults dead, most of the people who took to Twitter and Facebook were there to share their sympathies and discuss political action. But some took to creating some online disruption -- they created fake Twitter, YouTube and Facebook profiles appearing to be Adam Lanza, the shooter, and his brother Ryan. Many of the accounts have been disabled by Twitter and other services, but some still exist. For instance, as of Monday afternoon, there were a few Adam Lanza accounts on Twitter. One's description said ""Murder for Hire"" while another said, ""My Name is Adam Lanza and I'm from Newtown, CT. I hate Kids."" MORE: Mass Newtown Shooting Sparks Mass Social Media Action At a press conference Sunday, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance addressed the issue. ""Misinformation is being posted on social media sites,"" Vance said. ""There has been misinformation coming from people posing as the shooter in this case, using other IDs, mimicking this crime, crime scene and criminal activity that took place in this community."" Vance said, ""It is important to note that we have discussed with federal authorities that these issues are crimes, they will be investigated statewide and federally, and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified."" Vance did not specify which accounts were in question and what messages specifically had been shared. Twitter wouldn't comment on which accounts had been taken down, but it did point us to its policy on parody or fan accounts. ""Twitter users are allowed to create parody, commentary, or fan accounts (including role-playing),"" Twitter's policy says, but there are a number of rules. ""In order to avoid impersonation, an account's profile information should make it clear that the creator of the account is not actually the same person or entity as the subject of the parody/commentary."" It also says, ""Accounts with a clear intent to deceive may be permanently suspended."" However, impersonating might not be the crime here. ""There are only a handful of states that have laws against impersonation,"" Brad Shear, a Washington, D.C.-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, told ABC News. Instead, he said, it's the content of those tweets or messages that could very well be considered illegal -- if, for instance, they include a specific online threat, use one's identity for financial gain, or intentionally impeding a police investigation, Shear said. But absent one of those, he concluded, ""it would be difficult for the authorities to prosecute."" In addition to the Adam Lanza impersonators, actor Morgan Freeman was impersonated in a message that went viral on Facebook.  A message attributed to Freeman, which criticized news media for treating past shooters ""like celebrities,"" was circulated on Facebook along with a photo of Freeman. ""Morgan neither wrote, posted or had any knowledge of this whatsoever ever,"" Freeman's rep told ABC News today. The question of why some post and spread fake information on the Internet is a question, perhaps, as old as the Internet. But Pamela Rutledge, a director of the Media Psychology Program at Fielding Graduate University and UCLA Extension, said that in these situations it could have a deeper meaning. ""Even those who used social media to spread false information, we could argue, are using this as a coping method to feel some sort of power or agency in the face of the powerlessness we all feel."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-04 15:33:28.413850,Fake Tweets Surface After Shootings,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News Flash top headlines for July 4 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The parents of a woman killed in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting said Wednesday they would sue the gun manufacturers who advertised their products as easy to modify into semi-automatic weapons, similar to what was used by the shooter in a calamity that left 58 people dead and several hundred wounded. Carrie Parsons was 31 when she was killed along with 57 other people while attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival along the Las Vegas Strip; a gunman opened fire from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay, raining bullets down on the crowd. Parsons' parents are filing a lawsuit against Colt and seven other gun manufacturers as well as gun shops in Nevada and Utah, blaming them for playing a role in their daughter's death. LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICER WHO 'FROZE' DURING 2017 MASSACRE FIRED BY DEPARTMENT The lawsuit alleges that gunmakers advertised their AR-15-style weapons as easily modifiable to make them perform like machine guns and fire continuously. Although federal laws shield gun manufacturers from liability lawsuits, the Parsonses say such branding of the weapons violates both state and federal bans on automatic weapons. ""Someone murdered our daughter,"" the victim's father, James Parsons, told The Associated Press. ""Someone should be held accountable for that."" Still, gun proponents maintain that Stephen Paddock, the lone shooter in the massacre, is solely responsible for the toll from this, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. The lawsuit says the manufacturers showed a ""reckless lack of regard for public safety"" by advertising the firearms ""as military weapons and signaling the weapon's ability to be simply modified."" It alleges there are dozens of videos online showing people how to install bump stocks. Even without the bump stocks -- they are attachments used by the gunman in the Las Vegas shooting that allow for rapid gunfire, and were outlawed by President Trump -- Parsons contends that the guns can be modified to act as veritable machine guns. ""It was only a question of when -- not if -- a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying AR-15s to fire automatically in order to substantially increase the body count,"" the lawsuit states. The Parsons lawsuit is the latest in a slew of over a dozen filed since the shooting on Oct. 1, 2017, although it's the first to target a gun manufacturer. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Other victims have sued MGM Resorts International, which operated the concert venue and owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, along with the concert promoter and others, causing MGM Resorts to countersue hundreds of victims to avoid liability.

50,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/604216106/0/phoenix/nation~Reports-Eric-Swalwell-to-become-first-Democrat-to-drop-out-of-race/,"With Rep. Eric Swalwell announcing Monday that he will be the first 2020 Democratic presidential contender to drop out, the race for the White House is entering a new phase: the culling of the herd. Swalwell made the announcement at his campaign headquarters in Dublin, California, and said he would instead focus on getting reelected to the U.S. House and helping other Democrats win election. The three-term congressman's decision came as questions about the health of his campaign swirled after he abruptly canceled campaign events last week in the early-voting state of New Hampshire. ""We have to be honest about our own candidacy's viability,"" Swalwell said. ""Today ends our presidential campaign, but it is the beginning of an opportunity in Congress with a new perspective shaped by the lives that have touched mine and the campaign throughout these last three months to bring that promise of America to all Americans."" Beyond Swalwell's campaign, this moment marks an inflection point in the 2020 campaign in which many candidates at the back of the crowded field are beginning to reckon with crystallizing truths: The window to emerge as a serious contender is closing and the winnowing of the field is inevitable. ""Some may be hanging on to the hope that if they can just get past the summer doldrums, they can catch voters when they start tuning in come fall,"" said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida. ""But after that, it becomes much, much more difficult especially for some of these candidates who will be facing pressure from party leaders to drop out and get into (another race)."" An interactive guide: Who is running for president in 2020? For many candidates whose campaigns have been lingering in the low single digits or worse, the time is quickly approaching where they must make an honest assessment of not only whether they can run a credible campaign, but also how they're going to approach the next step in their political career, MacManus added. Polls in the aftermath of the first round of debates saw the front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden's lead shrink, Sen. Kamala Harris surge and Sen. Elizabeth Warren solidify her spot as a top candidate. Top-tier candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have watched their poll numbers slip in recent weeks, but they remain among the strongest fundraisers. Meanwhile, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke continue to register in the low single digits in polls. And then there is the rest of the field. None of the more than a dozen bottom-tier candidates managed to deliver a momentum-building moment needed to move beyond also-ran status. ""We need a candidate that is tested, I'll tell you that much,"" Swalwell said. ""Donald Trump is the best political puncher ever in American politics. Whoever we send to that debate stage with President Trump is going to have to be able to take a punch, throw a punch and then unite the country at the end of the campaign."" While Swalwell managed to make the stage for the first round of debates in Miami late last month, he was far from a lock for the next round, which will take place in Detroit July 30 and 31. The crowded contest to just get onto the Detroit debate stage could force the Democratic National Committee to employ a tiebreaker with more than 20 candidates set to meet the threshold. The DNC has capped the debates at 20 participants over two nights and required candidates earn at least 1% in three qualifying polls or contributions from at least 65,000 donors. Three major Democratic party candidates were left out in the first round of debates — Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam — because they did not meet either threshold. Former Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania announced his candidacy last month, and the Atlantic and Politico report that after first declining to run, billionaire entrepreneur Tom Steyer could announce his candidacy this week. DNC officials say they would look to “the total number of polls in which each candidate received 1 percent or more support” as a tiebreaker. Swalwell has broken the 1% margin in three polls, fewer times than several other candidates near the bottom of the polls, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and Bullock. It only gets harder for candidates as summer turns into fall. For debates scheduled for September and October, candidates will have to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors, according to rules set by the DNC. Swalwell said that he was not confident that he was going to meet the higher donor threshold to compete in the fall debates. He said he raised a paltry $850,000 in the second quarter from about 21,000 individual donors. ""We wanted to be honest with ourselves and our supporters,"" he said. ""If there was a viable chance, I would not be standing here today. From day one, I was running to win."" Swalwell, 38, who was seen as a longshot candidate since entering the crowded field in April, had his biggest moment in the campaign less than two weeks ago, when he took on Biden during the first debate. ""I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, 'it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.’ That candidate was then senator Joe Biden,"" Swalwell said. ""Joe Biden was right when he said wit was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He’s still right today.” Biden pushed back, saying he still has ideas to move the country forward. The line captured national headlines for Swalwell, who has hovered at 1% or less in national and early state polls, but it did not spur any momentum for his campaign. Swalwell was one of three candidates – de Blasio and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan were the others – who failed to attract a single supporter in a Suffolk University/USA TODAY survey of voters in the first-in-the-nation caucus of Iowa conducted following the June 28-29 debates. He also failed to register support in post-debate national polls conducted by CNN and Quinnipiac University. Post debate shakeup: Poll: Kamala Harris surges in Iowa as Bernie Sanders suffers after debate The congressman is hardly alone in his struggle to break through with voters. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Sunday acknowledged during a town hall in Perry, Iowa, that some of his staff have urged him to give up on the White House and run for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Cory Gardner, one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in 2020. “I realize I’m at 1% in the polls, and you know some of my own staff said, ‘Run for Senate’! I think Iowa is where that can be changed,” he said. Hickenlooper replied to one voter at the town hall that “you’ve gotta love it to give your life to public service,” and suggested he’d prefer the work of being president to that of being a senator. Several high-ranking aides quit his campaign last week, and Hickenlooper said Sunday that the ""vast majority of the problem with the campaign was me not being as good of a messenger as I need to be."" MacManus, the University of South Florida political scientist, said that Hickenlooper has left himself enough space to be nudged by party leadership into the Senate race. ""I think the way he's handled this has been really smart,"" MacManus said. Swalwell announced his candidacy in April with an appearance on the ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" and has poured much of his time and attention into Iowa, his birth state and a place he argued that he could connect with voters. He made 20 visits to the state between 2016 and his announcement. Congress is in: Eric Swalwell, congressman from California, joins crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field On the stump, Swalwell has been outspoken critic of President Trump, while also seeking to make the case that it was time for voters to give a candidate of a younger generation the opportunity to try to fix problems like gun violence, climate change and rising higher education costs. The father of two young children, Swalwell often brings up that he he still owes more than $100,000 in student loans as he made the case that he personally understands the struggles of many working Americans. He had proposed a pathway for students to attend college debt-free if they participate in work-study programs and commit to community service. Swalwell also invoked the younger generation of activists that emerged following last year's mass shooting at Parkland, Florida, as inspiration for tightening gun laws if he were elected president. Biden took to Twitter Monday after Swalwell announced he's bowing out to praise the congressman for elevating the issue of combating gun violence and his work pushing for tightening election security from his perch in Congress. ""The Democratic Party is lucky to have leaders like Eric, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the pressing issues facing Americans,"" Biden added.",2019-07-08 13:27:40,Reports: Eric Swalwell to become first 2020 Democrat to drop out of race,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

The California Democrat’s repeated attacks on the National Rifle Association (NRA), though cheered by gun control activists, did little to boost his lagging candidacy. “On the issue of gun violence, I am the champion who is saying enough is enough, and that has to be a top priority. We can’t just respond to the last mass shooting. I want to challenge our candidates to make it a priority too,” Swalwell told The Hill in an interview last month. Throughout the course of his short-lived campaign, the congressman also attempted to position himself as a young alternative to ex-Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), urging the former to “pass the torch” during the first round of Democrat debates in Miami, Flordia. “If we are going to solve the issue, pass the torch. If we are going to solve climate chaos, pass the torch. If we want to end gun violence and solve student debt, pass the torch,” said Swalwell to a collective gasp from the audience. A defiant Biden hit back at the lawmaker, declaring: “I’m holding onto that torch. I want to make it clear.” Swalwell will run for re-election for his congressional seat in the 15th District of California but faces a potentially fierce primary fight from Hayward councilmember Aisha Wahab. The lawmaker’s departure from the race comes amid reports that left-wing billionaire and climate change crusader Tom Steyer is readying a campaign of his own.  2020 ElectionClipsPolitics2020 Democratic Presidential PrimaryCaliforniaEric Swalwell .

A responsible and well-trained gun owner should be able to kill twice that many people with just one high-capacity magazine,” said NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, who advised Americans not to take the incidents in Virginia Beach or Poway as an indicator of the lethality of semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles, which are designed to generate far bloodier outcomes. “Gun deaths are a mental health issue; we can’t ignore that the shooters were suffering, therefore they were far less efficient marksmen. Had they been mentally well, they could have exercised better trigger control and framed their targets more clearly in the sights, turning misses into hits and wounded victims into fatalities. The NRA firmly believes the death toll of these past few months does not nearly reflect how deadly these guns should be.” LaPierre noted that the 2016 Orlando shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting far more accurately represented what firearms can really do.",2019-07-08 12:27:00,NRA Insists That Most Recent Mass Shooting Does Not Accurately Reflect Potential Deadliness Of Firearm,,5618,http://www.theonion.com/

Pope condemns New Zealand mass shooting As Pope Francis condemned the mass killing of 50 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques and led a prayer for the victims on Sunday in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, some of the bodies of those slaughtered were being returned to their loved ones for burial. Pope Francis called the mass shooting in Christchurch a ""horrible attack"" and implored people around the world to fight anti-immigrant and white supremacist extremism espoused by the alleged killer. ""I pray for the dead, the injured and their families,"" the pope said. ""I am close to our Muslim brothers and to all that community, and I renew an invitation to join in prayer and gestures of peace to combat hate and violence. Let's pray together in silence for our Muslim brothers who have been killed."" The alleged gunman, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, launched his vicious attack Friday afternoon in Christchurch on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques, where Muslims were gathered for prayer services. In a twisted move, Tarrant allegedly livestreamed the attacks on Facebook live, showing his face on camera and his arsenal of high-powered weapons and ammo clips used in the massacre lying on the passenger side floor of his vehicle. The livestream was broadcast for 17 minutes before Facebook officials took action to end it. Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, allegedly started the attack at the Al Noor mosque, killing 42 people and wounding scores of others before driving three miles to the Linwood mosque and fatally shooting eight victims, New Zealand police said. Tarrant was captured by police when they rammed his car off the road as he tried to flee. The slain victims ranged from age 3 to 77, and included at least four women, officials said. The alleged gunman's grandmother and uncle spoke out against the attack, saying they are as stunned as anyone, saying their relative is ""obviously not of sound mind."" ""It's just so much for everything to take in that somebody in our family would do anything like this,"" the grandmother, Marie Fitzgerald, told 9News in Australia in an exclusive interview. She said her grandson spent most of his time on computers, ""learning all the ins and out"" and playing video games. ""It's only since he traveled overseas, I think that that boy has changed completely [from] the boy we knew,"" the grandmother said. Tarrant's uncle, Terry Fitzgerald, said he couldn't believe his nephew was involved in what New Zealand officials described as the ""worst terrorist attack in New Zealand's history"" until he saw his photo on TV news reports. ""We say sorry, for the families over there, for the dead and the injured. Yeah we just, can't think nothing else, just want to go home and hide,"" Terry Fitzgerald told 9News. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that some of the bodies would be returned to their loved ones on Sunday for burial. Graves were already being dug for the victims even as authorities were still working to identify the victims. Mike Bush, New Zealand's commissioner of police, said authorities are keenly ""aware of the cultural and religious needs"" of victims, whose faith customarily calls for Muslims to be buried within 24 hours of death. Authorities are working as ""quickly and sensitively as possible"" to return the bodies to grieving family members, Bush said Saturday. Investigators said three other people arrested in the aftermath of the attacks apparently were not involved in the massacre and released. Bush said an additional 50 people were wounded in the rampage. He said 36 remained hospitalized, two in critical condition. Tarrant has been charged with murder. In his first court appearance on Saturday, Tarrant briefly flashed hand gestures that some witnesses and officials described as white supremacist signals. In online writings, Tarrant, according to investigators, spewed hatred aimed at non-white people immigrating to Western countries. Tarrant also cited in his online writings the 2015 attack by white supremacist Dylann Roof that left nine African-American worshippers dead at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, according to investigators. He also said in his writings that he was inspired by Anders Breivik, a Norwegian far-right terrorist, who killed 77 people in a rampage in Norway, officials said. He also praised President Donald Trump in his online writings as a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose. On Friday, Trump was asked by ABC News' Terry Moran if he considered white nationalism on the rise across the world. ""I don't, really,"" Trump, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, replied. ""I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems."" FBI statistics show that the number of hate crimes in the United States rose 17 percent from 2016 to 2017. Of the 6,000 suspects who allegedly carried out the crimes on 8,000 victims, 58 percent were motivated by hate and 22 percent by religion, according to the FBI. Lianne Dalziel, the mayor of Christchurch, told ABC News that the mass shooting exposed the rise of extremism in her country, which recorded just 35 murders in all of 2017. Dalziel pointed out that the hatred she has seen locally was imported to inflict damage on a safe city in a safe country. Dalziel said cities across the world need to gather together and unify around diversity. Tom Bossert, the former homeland security adviser to Trump and former deputy homeland security adviser under President George W. Bush, said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that Trump isn't downplaying the hate crimes in the country, but apparently comparing the numbers to atrocities committed to well-organized groups like ISIS. ""Both are morally repugnant and difficult challenges, and so we don't want to downplay it,"" Bossert told ABC News' chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""I think what the president said is it's a smaller threat. I hope he doesn't maintain the position that it's not a threat at all. Some resources are needed. Clearly this is a trend that needs to be addressed."" Bossert also said authorities should consider requiring delays on live broadcasts or live streaming to prevent others bent on committing mass killings from following in the alleged footstep of the Christchurch mass shooter. ""There's no negative or downside to forcing some delay into that broadcast,"" Bossert said. ""It will require some time and money, but I think it's something we should consider."" Jae Johnson, former secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama, said on ""This Week"" that companies that provide social media platforms be required to be more vigilant when it comes to policing hate speech. ""In social media now there are very very few barriers to entry and, frankly, standards of exit,"" Johnson said. Johnson also suggested that voters should require a prerequisite for all candidates running for public office to adopt a more civil tone in what they say publicly and to lower the level of espousing ideas that can be interpreted as condoning acts of extremist hate. ""Americans do listen to their leaders,"" Johnson said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Pope Francis leads prayers for peace over hate at the Vatican,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

          / CBS/AP The Virginia General Assembly voted to adjourn until November, as Republicans rejected Democrats' request to vote on a series of gun control measures. Virginia lawmakers were set to debate and vote on new gun laws after a gunman killed a dozen people in a local government building. Gov. Ralph Northam ordered lawmakers to return to the Capitol and called for passage of a wide range of gun-control measures. The Democrat said people need ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers"" after a Virginia Beach city employee shot and killed 12 people on May 31. But the special session on gun violence got off to a chaotic start Tuesday before ending the same day. Advocates for and against stricter gun laws held rallies at the Virginia Capitol as lawmakers gathered, with Gov. Northam leading gun-control proponents in chants of ""enough is enough."" Northam had proposed legislation that would include expanding background checks in the state and a review of potential restrictions on gun ""silencers,"" or suppressors, like the one used in the latest shooting. Northam slammed his Republican colleagues for bringing an abrupt end to the legislative session. ""It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives. I expected better of them. Virginians expect better of them,"" said Northam in a statement. GOP lawmakers criticized Northam as trying to exploit a tragedy for political gain. And in the leadup to Tuesday's session, Republican leaders who control the legislature signaled they wouldn't pass gun controls, focusing instead on increasing criminal penalties after gun crimes. But Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment filed surprise legislation Monday to broadly ban guns in any government building. During the session, Virginia Senate GOP majority whip Bill Stanley resigned to protest Norment's bill. Norment then apologized to his caucus and moved to reinstate Stanley to his key leadership post. Stanley was the only one of his Republican colleagues to vote against himself. Kris Brown, president of the gun control advocacy group Brady said in a statement, ""Today, Tommy Norment and Kirk Cox revealed themselves as nothing short of cowards."" Brown added, ""If these 'leaders' won't enact solutions that their own constituents are demanding, then we're going to fight tooth and nail for representatives who will.""

                    Sarah Rankin, Associated Press RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia’s special session on gun violence got off to a chaotic start on Tuesday, with the Senate Majority Leader averting a mutiny in the Republican caucus by publicly disavowing a gun-control bill he’d proposed only the day before. Lawmakers were summoned to the Capitol to consider a package of eight gun-control measures proposed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who has called for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers” in response to the killings of a dozen people by a city worker in Virginia Beach. Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment then shocked his fellow Republicans by filing surprise legislation Monday to broadly ban guns in any government building statewide. It prompted ann immediate backlash in the GOP caucus, which controls the chamber by a slim 20-19 advantage. His top vote-counter, Sen. Bill Stanley resigned as majority whip in protest. “Sometimes you just gotta stand for principle, so I resigned,” Stanley said. But the departure didn’t last long: Stanley said Norment apologized during a Senate caucus meeting shortly before the session started, asked Stanley to reconsider his resignation. Stanley said he was the sole vote against himself when the caucus restored him as majority whip. Norment — who is married to a lobbyist for the city of Virginia Beach — then announced he’s spiking his own bill, and won’t support “any measure that restricts the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.” If Republicans remain unified, Northam’s package of bills stands little chance of passage. The GOP holds a wider majority in the House, where Republicans have accused the governor of trying to exploit the tragedy for political gain. Rather than approve gun controls, they signaled a focus on increasing penalties for wrongdoers after gun crimes have been committed. Outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning, Northam led a group of gun-control supporters in chants of “Enough is Enough!” Gun-control supporters began their demonstration on Capitol Square by reading out the names of the state’s recent gun violence victims, including those in Virginia Beach. Northam then led them in the “Enough is Enough!” chant that has become a refrain against gun violence at rallies nationwide in the wake of repeated mass shootings. Others carried signs decrying the killings of children, and shouted “You vote today, we vote in November.” “Hopefully we’ll be heard and the Virginia Legislature will take action to enact sensible gun laws,” said Jeff Wells, 64, his voice hoarse from chanting. WATCH: What makes the Virginia Beach shooting different from other massacres A smaller group of gun rights advocates rallied across the Capitol lawn. They said many others were inside meeting with lawmakers and that a larger rally was planned Tuesday afternoon. Some gun-rights advocates were walking around inside the Capitol with handguns in holsters openly visible, which is permitted. Visitors to the House gallery can keep their guns, and while they’re not permitted on the Senate side, some lawmakers bring guns with them onto the floor. Jim Snyder, a 69-year-old gun owner from northern Virginia, said the Virginia Beach shooting hadn’t moved the needle on gun issues for him one bit. “I haven’t done anything wrong and they want to take guns away from me,” Snyder, vice president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “A lot of people say, ‘Well, we’ve got to find common ground,” which means, ‘We’ve got to find gun control that you’ll accept,'” he said. Snyder speculated that Northam called the special session to divert attention from the scandal he faced over a racist yearbook photo, or perhaps to motivate Democrats hoping to retake control of the legislature in November. Some people carried poster-sized signs of the photo that appeared on Northam’s yearbook page decades ago, showing one person wearing blackface and another the robe and cap of the Ku Klux Klan. Left:

59,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-continues-tweeting-weekend-rant/story?id=61760108&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"Trump's tweets ranged from a closed auto plant to the late Sen. John McCain. President Trump faces backlash over recent comments about John McCain President Donald Trump tweeted six times before noon Monday -- following up on a weekend tweetstorm that sparked widespread criticism. In one of the Monday tweets, he once again attacked the ""Fake News Media"" he said was trying to blame him for Friday's mass shooting that left 50 people dead at two mosques in New Zealand. Over the weekend, he was especially prolific on Twitter, commenting on topics ranging from the late Sen. John McCain to a shuttered auto plant in Ohio to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. On Monday, one of the president’s top White House aides, Kellyanne Conway, defended the president’s weekend tweets, saying that “the president tweeted about a number of things” and accused the media of “cherry-picking” the president’s tweets. Known for his frequent use of his favorite social media platform, the president fired off a flurry of some 50 tweets and retweets over the course of an otherwise quiet weekend spent at the White House, save for a brief outing to attend church on Sunday morning. Days after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution expressing their support for special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to be made public, President Trump tweeted Saturday to claim that he encouraged Republican leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency"" and to ""Play along with the game!"" The president’s tweet stood in contrast to a tweet he sent on Friday in which he argued there should have never been an investigation in the first place and that “there should be no Mueller report.” The president also went after the late Sen. John McCain, who passed away in August, accusing him of “spreading the fake and totally discredited dossier” and of sending it to the FBI and the media “hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election.” But the president’s claim is not accurate. McCain wasn’t made aware of the dossier until after the election when he passed it on to the FBI. On ABC's ""The View"" on Monday, McCain's daughter Meghan fired back at Trump, saying he ""spends his weekend obsessing over great men"" because ""he will never be a great man"" like her father. The president also sent multiple tweets related to a GM auto plant in Ohio that shuttered earlier this month, using his platform on Twitter to urge GM to get the Lordstown plant back up and running. On Sunday, the president said he spoke to the CEO of GM, Mary Barra, and “asked her to sell it or do something quickly.” The president said Barra blamed the workers’ union, to which he said: “I don’t care, I just want it open!”He even went so far as to blast the local union chapter president – by name – and called on him to “get his act together and produce.” The president also tweeted in support of FOX News host Jeanine Pirro, with whom he is friendly, after her usual Saturday night show did not air following controversial comments she made on her previous week’s show in which she questioned whether Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's Islamic religious beliefs are opposed to the U.S. Constitution. Fox News later condemned Pirro’s comments. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,"After weekend rant, Trump says media trying to blame him for New Zealand massacre",,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

(AP) — Less than two hours after beginning a special session called in response to a mass shooting, Virginia lawmakers abruptly adjourned Tuesday without taking any action and postponed any movement on gun control until after the November election.

Jim Snyder, a 69-year-old gun owner from northern Virginia, said the Virginia Beach shooting had not moved the needle on gun issues for him one bit. “I haven’t done anything wrong, and they want to take guns away from me,” Snyder, vice president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “A lot of people say, ‘Well, we’ve got to find common ground,” which means, ‘We’ve got to find gun control that you’ll accept,'” he said. Snyder speculated that Northam called the special session to divert attention from the scandal over a racist yearbook photo, or perhaps to motivate Democrats hoping to retake control of the Legislature in November. Some people carried poster-sized signs of the photo that appeared on Northam’s yearbook page decades ago, showing one person wearing blackface and another the robe and cap of the Ku Klux Klan. Left:

RICHMOND, Va. — Less than two hours after beginning a special session called in response to a mass shooting, Virginia lawmakers abruptly adjourned Tuesday without taking any action and postponed any movement on gun control until after the November election. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam called the Republican-led Legislature to the Capitol to address gun violence in the wake of the May 31 attack that killed a dozen people in Virginia Beach. The meeting got off to a chaotic start, with the Republican Senate majority leader averting a mutiny in the GOP caucus by publicly disavowing a gun-control bill he proposed only a day earlier. Lawmakers were summoned to consider a package of eight gun-control measures put forward by Northam, who called for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers” in response to the Virginia Beach massacre.

Justin Fairfax, left, and Attorney General Mark Herring, right, look on inside the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond, Va. (Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP, File) House Speaker Kirk Cox said the session was premature because the shooting is still being investigated. “The whole thing is just an election-year stunt,” Cox said. Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment shocked his fellow Republicans by filing surprise legislation Monday to broadly ban guns in any government building statewide. That prompted an immediate backlash in the GOP caucus, which controls the chamber by a slim 20-19 advantage. His top vote-counter, Sen. Bill Stanley, resigned as majority whip in protest. “Sometimes you just got to stand for principle,” Stanley said. But the departure did not last long. Stanley said Norment apologized during a Senate caucus meeting shortly before the session started and asked Stanley to reconsider his resignation. Stanley said he was the sole vote against himself when the caucus restored him as majority whip. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE ZERO IN ON SHOOTER'S WEAPONS CACHE AND JOB BACKGROUND Norment — who is married to a lobbyist for the city of Virginia Beach — then announced that he was spiking his own bill and would not support “any measure that restricts the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.” If Republicans had remained unified, Northam’s package of bills stood little chance of passage. The GOP holds a wider majority in the House, where Republicans have accused the governor of trying to exploit the tragedy for political gain. Rather than approve gun controls, they signaled a focus on increasing penalties for wrongdoers after gun crimes have been committed.

(Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP, File) Outside the Capitol, Northam led a group of gun-control supporters chanting “Enough is enough!” It has become a refrain against gun violence at rallies nationwide after repeated mass shootings. Gun-control supporters began their demonstration on Capitol Square by reading out the names of the state’s recent gun violence victims, including those in Virginia Beach. Others carried signs decrying the killings of children and shouted “You vote today, we vote in November.” “Hopefully we’ll be heard and the Virginia Legislature will take action to enact sensible gun laws,” said Jeff Wells, 64, his voice hoarse from chanting. A smaller group of gun-rights advocates rallied across the Capitol lawn. They said many others were inside meeting with lawmakers and that a larger rally was planned Tuesday afternoon.

62,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/gun-control-special-session-virginia.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Campbell Robertson In the grim aftermath of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Gov. Ralph Northam insisted it was time for action. Thoughts and prayers were not enough, he said, as he called for a special session of the Virginia General Assembly to consider a raft of gun control proposals. That special session began on Tuesday around noon. An hour and a half later, it was over. The House and Senate voted along party lines to adjourn until November. An array of proposals had been on the agenda, from universal background checks to limits on handgun purchases. Mr. Northam had insisted that bills be brought to the floor for votes rather than smothered in committees, as they often had been in the past. Many Democrats saw the session at least as a chance to force Republican legislators to put their votes on gun issues on the record, a potentially useful marker in a year when all legislative seats are up for election. But this flyby session did not even produce that. “It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives,” Mr. Northam said in a statement. “I expected better of them. Virginians expect better of them.” Few expected that a state legislature controlled by Republicans — albeit narrowly — would spend July shepherding a host of gun control bills into law. Still, Mr. Northam had spoken from pulpits about the urgency of gun control legislation and on Tuesday had addressed a vigil near the Capitol, where groups on opposite sides of the question had gathered — armed with signs, stickers and guns — in anticipation of an impassioned debate. In a news conference afterward, Kirk Cox, the Republican speaker of the House, called the session “just an election year stunt.” On Tuesday, he and Thomas K. Norment Jr., the Republican Senate majority leader, sent an open letter asking the Virginia State Crime Commission, which studies and makes recommendations on criminal justice matters, to examine the shooting in Virginia Beach, in which 12 were killed at a municipal building, and to review any new legislation proposed. They asked the commission to present a report on Nov. 12 — a week after the elections — after which the legislature would reconvene to consider what to do next. Republican leaders compared this approach to the one taken by Tim Kaine, the former Democratic governor of Virginia and now a United States senator, who in 2007 convened a panel to study and make recommendations after the shootings at Virginia Tech, among the deadliest ever on a school campus. But this was not just a partisan disagreement about process. Republicans said the proposals that were most effective need not touch guns. “Democrats have exclusively focused on gun control bills during this special session,” Mr. Cox said at the news conference, adding that he fundamentally disagreed with that. “There is no focus on mental health or punishing criminals for the crimes they commit.” Indeed, a surprising last-minute proposal by Mr. Norment, which would have banned guns from local government buildings, brought such an intense backlash from his fellow party members that he pulled it just after the short-lived session began. Given this political reality, Democrats who were fuming over the developments on Tuesday had to admit that they had low expectations for the session, even if it had been allowed to proceed as planned. While State Senator Dick Saslaw, a Democrat, called the abrupt adjournment “the most irresponsible act I’ve seen in all my years in the General Assembly,” he acknowledged that he thought “hardly anything” would have come out of the session anyway. “I figured they’d pull something pretty much like that,” he said of the Republicans’ vote to adjourn. “But I thought it might come a little later in the afternoon.” Advertisement",2019-07-09 21:50:06,A Gun-Focused Special Session in Virginia Ends Abruptly,,1,http://nytimes.com

Gun control activists protest outside special session of the General Assembly to consider gun legislation in Virginia.  Steve Helber/AP Tuesday was supposed to be a big day for Virginia legislators to have serious discussions about gun control in the state. Following the mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center in May—which left 12 people dead, one of the state’s deadliest mass shootings in years—Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam called for a special session of the state’s general assembly with the goal of passing stricter gun control laws. But the session ended after just 90 minutes, with the state’s GOP-controlled general assembly adjourning without voting on any of the dozens of gun control bills introduced by members of both parties. The Washington Post reported that the state Senate and House of Delegates voted to adjourn the session until November 18—right after the state’s midterm elections. The move was immediately criticized by Virginia Democrats and gun control advocates, hundreds of whom rallied in front of the state capitol prior to the session. Northam issued a statement after the session, saying that it was “shameful” and “disappointing” that Republicans in the General Assembly didn’t take any action, adding that he “expected better” of GOP legislators. In a phone call with Mother Jones, Virginia Del. Danica Roem, the state’s first transgender representative who has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun control laws in the state, said she didn’t think the Republican members’ actions were acceptable. “The reality here is that this is an issue that is extremely close to home for me and for a lot of my constituents,” she said. Among the legislation that wasn’t voted on today was a Red Flag law, or an extreme protection order law, which allows a judge to issue an order for law enforcement to confiscate an individual’s gun if they’re deemed a risk to themselves or others. It’s an idea that has seen bipartisan support—including from President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr—since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida last year. Roem said that the bill should have been a priority for her GOP general assembly colleagues, as it’s a proven effective way to curb suicide by firearms rates. “I know this one from a very dear friend who survived an attempted hanging,” Roem tells Mother Jones. “And I think about this and I think about how an extreme protection order can be the difference between someone living and someone dying.” With Virginia’s upcoming midterm election in November set to be a pivotal one, the issue of gun control is quickly becoming one of the bigger issues for both the state’s election and for the 2020 presidential election. “We know that more people will die by gun violence between now and November 18,” Roem says. “And the Virginia general assembly will have done nothing, in terms of dealing with it.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

State Republicans Blew the Whole Thing Up.,,1112,http://www.motherjones.com/
64,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/-q2HBhvCq7s/,"Virginia state lawmakers were scheduled to debate gun control legislation Tuesday —  but a special session on the issue ended abruptly without any resolution. Lawmakers in the GOP-controlled legislature adjourned the session less than two hours after it started, deciding not to take immediate action on several proposed gun bills. The push for movement on gun laws came from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who ordered a special legislative session on gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May. Twelve people were killed and four others were injured when a gunman opened fire at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. Northam says he's asked lawmakers to pass tighter gun restrictions in the past, but that they've turned down his request. The public safety laws up for debate include universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and other restrictions. Northam addressed the measures earlier Tuesday. ""We've introduced eight pieces of common-sense legislation. They have been reviewed, and I expect them. Let's have a discussion, a dialogue about those. And then at the end of the day, I want all of our legislators, all of our elected officials, to take a vote on these. People in Virginia need to know that we're here to make Virginia safer, and they need to know where these legislators stand on this issues,"" he said. Republicans in the state have accused Northam's call to action of being politically motivated. As The Associated Press points out, they've floated legislation that focuses on criminal penalties. ""The speed which the governor called the session, the partisan demands for floor votes, the roadshow all demonstrate to me how the whole thing is just an election year stunt,"" said Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox. ""We all share the goal of reducing gun violence in Virginia."" There's also recently been action on gun control issues nationwide. Earlier this year, the Trump administration enacted a ban on bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire faster. But some gun rights advocates argue legislative solutions don't effectively tackle the core issue of violent crime. The Virginia General Assembly postponed any movement on gun control until at least Nov. 18. Additional reporting from Newsy affiliate CNN. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

67,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/07/10/mass-shooting-attackers-secret-service-report/,"Trending: WASHINGTON — One-third of the attackers who terrorized schools, houses of worship or businesses nationwide last year had a history of serious domestic violence, two-thirds had mental health issues, and nearly all had made threatening or concerning communications that worried others before they struck, according to a U.S. Secret Service report on mass attacks. The Secret Service studied 27 incidents where a total of 91 people were killed and 107 more injured in public spaces in 2018. Among them: the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, were 17 people were killed and 17 others injured, and the fatal attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The report analyzed the timing, weapons, locations and stressors of the attacker, plus events that led up to the incident, in an effort to better understand how such attacks unfold and how to prevent them. Members of the Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center, which did the study, briefed police, public safety and school officials at a seminar Tuesday. “We want the community to know prevention is everyone’s responsibility,” said Lina Alathari, the center’s chief. “Not just law enforcement.” Other incidents examined included a man who drove a truck into a Planned Parenthood clinic in New Jersey, injuring three, and a man who killed two at a law firm, and then one at a psychologist’s office in June. Criteria for the study included an incident where three or more people were injured in a public place. Most attackers were male, ranging in age from 15 to 64. The domestic violence history often included serious violence. While 67% had mental health issues, only 44% had a diagnosis or known treatment for the issue. Most of the attacks occurred midweek. Only one was on a Saturday. As for motive, more than half of the attackers had a grievance against a spouse or family member, or a personal or workplace dispute. Also, 22% had no known motive. In nearly half the cases, the attacker apparently selected the target in advance. Alathari and her colleagues want communities to be aware of concerning behavior and these trends so officials have something to look out for. The Secret Service center is tasked with researching, training and sharing information on the prevention of targeted violence, using the agency’s knowledge gleaned from years of watching possible targets that may or may not be out to assassinate the president. Alathari said her team is working on a new report on school shootings and how to prevent them, and investigating averted attacks to try to figure out why someone didn’t follow through. “There is not a single solution,” Alathari said. “The more that we’re out there, training, the more we’re out there with the community … the more we share information … I think it will help really alleviate and hopefully prevent even one incident from happening. One is too many.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2019-07-10 08:00:24,"Most attackers made threats before incident, mass shooting report finds",,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

OBAMACARE DEATH BED? “Federal appeals judges in New Orleans are entertaining the idea of striking some or all of Obamacare, appearing uncertain during oral arguments Tuesday over whether Congress intended to toss the entire healthcare law. … The judges didn’t say when they would rule. Regardless of the outcome, the case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court and could be decided right around the 2020 elections.” (Washington Examiner) REBATE REVAMP: “President Trump promised to reduce Americans’ pharmacy bills — and he’s delivering. His administration will soon finalize a rule that restructures the drug supply chain and ensure that tens of billions of dollars of hidden rebates and discounts flow to patients. The rule affects Medicare Part D, the federal prescription drug benefit for 45 million seniors and people with disabilities.” (InsideSources) DIPLOMATIC MALFEASANCE: “The British ambassador to the U.S. who criticized President Trump has resigned, the U.K. Foreign Office said Wednesday. Ambassador Kim Darroch — in documents leaked in recent days — slammed the Trump administration as ‘diplomatically clumsy and inept,’ and said he doubted it would become ‘substantially more normal.’” (Fox News) THE HALLS OF INJUSTICE: According to the Associated Press “The Justice Department can’t replace nine lawyers so late in the dispute over whether to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census without explaining why it’s doing so, a judge says.” In essence, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman is barring the Trump administration from correcting the so-called issue that Justice John Roberts flagged when ruling against the citizenship question. Talk about having your cake and eating it too. By the way, 55% of Hispanic voters support the citizenship question. A TWITTERIZED MESS: “The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that President Trump cannot block Twitter users from his official account, finding that the practice is discriminatory,” reports The Hill. On the one hand, public officials aren’t necessarily bound by the same set of rules. On the other hand, Twitter is a private company, and this lawsuit should have been directed at Twitter, not the president. Ironically, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also blocked people on Twitter and is consequently being sued for it. MOVING EVER-CLOSER TO AN OVERHAUL: “President Trump’s nomination of Washington, D.C., attorney Daniel Bress to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday on a party-line vote, giving Trump seven appointees to a court he has regularly denounced. … With Bress’ confirmation, the court will have 16 judges appointed by Democratic presidents, 12 by Republicans and one vacancy.

Following Tuesday’s incident in Missouri, the Kansas City Police Department and Platte County Sheriff’s Department took Vanessa Richey into custody, The Kansas City Star reports. Though there were luckily no injuries from the shooting, Richey, 34, was charged with making a terrorist threat with the purpose of frightening 10 or more people, and the unlawful use of a weapon for exhibiting a gun in an angry and threatening manner, according to KMBC News. The terrifying ordeal happened at approximately 11:30 a.m. at the Parkville License Office in Kansas City on Tuesday, the Star reports. Patricia Zick, a witness at the scene, told the outlet that the woman came into the DMV, became very belligerent and started cursing at employees after noticing that the office was packed with people and the wait time would be long. “Something was wrong, I don’t know what it is — drugs, mental or whatever — but she just insisted on getting taken care of immediately,” Zick recalled to the Star. “‘The president’s security was in danger,’ she said.” RELATED: 5 People Killed in Workplace Mass Shooting at Illinois Industrial Building, Shooter Dead A similar account came from Tom Hutsler and DMV Manager Terri Haris, who both also witnessed Richey become increasingly hostile over the large crowd. “It was very crowded in there — a lot of people,” Hustler told the San Antonio Express-News. “She was cussing and upset with the staff there.” Haris, who was behind the DMV counter at the time, recalled Richey walking up and demanding a duplicate ID, the outlet reports. Despite claiming her issue was a matter of natural security and that the president’s life was in danger, Richey was turned down and told to wait, which Haris said she allegedly responded to with, “What do I have to do, grab a gun?” “I checked with the woman behind me and said, ‘Did she say what I thought she said? That doesn’t sound good,'” Hutsler added to the outlet. After about 10 minutes of the altercation, witnesses said Richey stormed outside and Zick and Hutsler reportedly followed to monitor the situation and get her license plate number. RELATED VIDEO: 1 Dead, 3 Injured in Active Shooting Scene Near California Voting Site It was at that moment that Richey allegedly dug into her purse, took out a gun and shot it into the air, the Star reports. “That’s when we all ran,” Zick told the outlet, adding that she was able to escape by entering a dentist’s office in the area. “We all ran into the building, and they were scooting us out the back door. We didn’t know if she was coming back in or she had more ammunition or she had been on the phone calling a friend to come back up or what was going on.” According to Express-News, an off-duty officer who was at the scene confronted Richey while Hutsler tackled her from behind. Authorities eventually showed up and arrested the woman before taking her to a hospital for evaluation, the Star reports. RELATED: 3 Killed, 2 Injured in ‘Random’ Mass Shooting at Cincinnati Office Building As officers continued to gather information from witnesses, Major Erik Holland from the Platte County Sheriff’s Office told the outlet that Richey allegedly fired her gun several times into a mulch bed outside of the DMV, but did not make it into the office. “We’re still early on in the investigation, but it is to my understanding that she didn’t make it into the DMV,” he said. “People saw the gun before she got in. The doors were locked and she fired the shots before she got into the DMV.” ",2019-07-10 21:38:58,"Kansas City Woman Allegedly Opens Fire Outside of DMV After Getting Angry Over the Slow Line

Among 93 recommendations in a newly released department ""after-action review"" are requirements to plan ahead with neighboring police, fire, hospital and coroner officials; to let responding officers remove reflective vests so they're less of a target to a shooter; and to ensure more paramedics and trauma kits are available at large-scale events. ""We hope we never have to use these procedures that we are putting in place,"" said Lombardo, who characterized the report as ""our textbook on our response"" to the October 2017 massacre that killed 58 people at an open-air music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. He said it's now required reading for every Las Vegas police officer above the rank of sergeant. Lombardo noted that report authors Capt. Kelly McMahill and Detective Stephanie Ward studied other mass casualty incidents around the country, and said he hoped the Las Vegas report would help others prepare. The 158-page document acknowledged communications snags similar to those described in a separate August 2018 ""after-action report"" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Clark County Fire Department and Las Vegas police. That 61-page document said communications were overwhelmed by 911 calls, the number of victims, and by false reports of active shooters at other Las Vegas Strip hotel-casinos and nearby McCarran International Airport. Lombardo, the elected head of some 5,000 officers, said the new report focuses on internal department ""preparedness, response and recovery."" It comes almost a year after Las Vegas police closed the criminal investigation with a 187-page criminal investigation report and nearly six months after the FBI issued a three-page summary of its behavioral analysis of gunman Stephen Paddock. Paddock, 64, a former accountant and high-stakes video poker player with homes in Reno and the southern Nevada resort community of Mesquite, killed himself before officers reached his hotel room. The FBI said Paddock sought notoriety but that investigators found no ""single or clear motivating factor"" for the shooting. Investigators said Paddock planned meticulously and acted alone amassing an arsenal of assault-style weapons before opening fire from a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay resort into a crowd of 22,000 country music fans below. Authorities said more than 850 people were wounded or injured fleeing the gunfire. Lombardo noted the NFL's Oakland Raiders plan to move to Las Vegas and begin play in 2020 at a 65,000-seat Las Vegas Stadium being built just off the Las Vegas Strip. He said policing changes will apply to scheduled events drawing at least 15,000 people, and the report listed more than 17 such events: New Year's Eve fireworks on the Strip; conventions including the Consumer Electronics gadget show at the Las Vegas Convention Center; NASCAR races at Las Vegas Speedway; the Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon; uncounted hotel ""day club"" pool parties; and 41 NHL Vegas Golden Knights hockey home games per year at T-Mobile Arena. Lombardo noted that Las Vegas police already make presentations about what the department experienced in October 2017 to law enforcement officials in the U.S. and abroad. He said the department has already implemented 40% of the new report's recommendations. The release comes a week after Las Vegas police confirmed the firing in March of a veteran officer who froze in a hotel hallway one floor below while Paddock rained rapid gunfire into the concert crowd below. Lombardo said an unspecified number of other officers received lesser discipline for turning off or failing to activate body-worn video cameras, and one for accidentally firing a three-round burst of gunfire inside Paddock's suite. Police union executive director Steve Grammas said the dismissed officer, Cordell Hendrex, was one of two officers disciplined following departmental reviews of their actions during the shooting. The union is fighting to get Hendrex reinstated. Grammas said the only other officer he knew of who had been disciplined for actions during the shooting got his job back after an arbitrator reviewed his firing. Grammas declined to identify that officer, but said he had at least seven years on the job. The Las Vegas Police Protective Association official said the officer had been accused of making comments the department deemed unbecoming and of telling a woman to keep moving away from the scene of the shooting instead of investigating her complaint that she had been a victim of a crime. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2019-07-11 01:17:00,Las Vegas police release report on lessons from 2017 mass shooting,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

75,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/07/11/northams_latest_gambit_to_change_the_subject_flops_140753.html,"Do not for one moment allow yourself to believe Tuesday’s action in Richmond had anything to do with gun control. Instead, let’s call the 90-minute special session of the Virginia legislature what it was – a desperate bid by the commonwealth’s top elected Democrats to change the subject, and a steadfast rebuke from the legislature’s majority Republicans. Earlier this year, Gov. Ralph Northam was revealed to have had on his medical school yearbook page a photo of two men, one in blackface, the other in Klan hood and robe. Northam initially apologized for the insensitivity; then, less than 24 hours later, reversed himself and said he was neither man in the photograph – even as he simultaneously acknowledged donning blackface on another occasion. The outrage was palpable. Demands for his immediate resignation came from all over the state and beyond. Interestingly, it wasn’t Republicans who demanded his resignation – it was Virginia Democrats, led by state party Chairwoman Susan Swecker, who issued a statement insisting on Northam’s immediate resignation. She wasn’t the only one: Within 36 hours, she had been joined by the state’s two U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; the state congressional delegation’s senior African American member, Congressman Bobby Scott; former Gov. Terry McAuliffe; and, perhaps most powerfully, former Gov. Doug Wilder, the first African American to be elected governor of Virginia. And it wasn’t just Democrats in the state who call for the governor’s resignation – national Democrat leaders, too, demanded he go. Congresswoman Karen Bass of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, criticized Northam and added, “What he should do is resign.” Democratic Governors Association Chairwoman (and Rhode Island governor) Gina Raimondo and Vice Chairman Phil Murphy (governor of New Jersey) issued a statement calling on Northam to step down, calling the photo “racist and inexcusable.” All seemed to be headed in the direction of Northam’s resignation … until, that is, his presumed successor, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexual assault by not one, but two, credible accusers. And then Attorney General Mark Herring – who would have ascended to the governorship had both Northam and Fairfax vacated their offices – acknowledged that, despite having already joined the calls for Northam’s resignation based on Northam’s acknowledgement of having worn blackface, he, too, had once done the same thing while in college. With all three top Democrats under pressure to step aside, Virginia Democrats’ hypocrisy had nowhere to hide. It was easy to demand that Northam step down, when Democrats were safe in the belief that a fellow party member, Fairfax, would step up. And even when Fairfax came under fire, there was still another Democrat, Herring, in line, and that made calling for Fairfax’s resignation tenable. But when Herring acknowledged he was guilty of the same sin as Northam, and the next guy in line was a … REPUBLICAN … well, that’s when the calls for resignations had to stop. But with all 140 seats in the General Assembly up for election in November, and control of the 2021 redistricting at stake, stopping the calls for resignation wasn't enough. It was a start, but it wasn’t enough. So, in the wake of the May 31 Virginia Beach mass shooting that left 13 dead, Gov. Northam issued a call for a special session to consider gun control measures that either had already failed to pass the legislature or that would have had no effect in preventing the Virginia Beach shooting. Universal background check? The Virginia Beach shooter legally purchased the firearms he used in the attack. “Assault weapons” ban? The Virginia Beach shooter used handguns. “One-gun-a-month purchase” law? The Virginia Beach shooter used two handguns in his attack; he purchased one in 2016 and the other in 2018. None of these proposals – or the others offered by Northam – would have prevented the May mass shooting. That the Republicans who control both houses of the Virginia legislature saw through the governor’s ruse and shut down their special sessions as quickly they did is a good thing for the cause of good government. They should be commended for refusing to allow the governor to distract the public’s attention. Established 400 years ago this month, the Virginia General Assembly is revered as “the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World.” George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison all served in the body before going on to greater service – commanding the Continental Army, writing the Declaration of Independence, co-authoring the Constitution of the United States, leading the new nation as president. To paraphrase Dwight Eisenhower, if they were alive today, they’d roll over in their graves if they saw what Virginia’s Democrats were trying to do at this week’s special session. Congratulations to the Republicans who didn’t let them get away with it. Their refusal to allow the distraction made Tuesday’s events a “special session,” indeed.

77,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/trump-social-media-summit-alternate-list,"The actual list of invitees suggests the event will largely serve as a platform for rightwing conspiracy theorists and bigots Last modified on Wed 6 Jan 2021 23.58 GMT The White House on Thursday will host a meeting of some of the rightwing internet’s loudest voices – and worst trolls. Donald Trump’s so-called “Social Media Summit” was announced in late June amid unsubstantiated but persistent allegations by the president that major social media platforms are biased against members of the Republican party. While the administration has released few details about the meeting, the list of self-identified invitees suggests that the event will largely serve as a platform for rightwing conspiracy theorists, bigots and the professionally aggrieved.  The relentless campaign by Republicans to attribute every content moderation decision to partisan bias has poisoned the well for an actual and much needed discussion of social media censorship. The role that a handful of social media companies should play in policing the boundaries of acceptable speech is a vital and urgent debate; decisions made in Silicon Valley reverberate in societies around the world, with outcomes ranging from the inspirational and emancipatory to the inflammatory and genocidal. A meeting of the minds between Bill Mitchell, a Twitter celebrity known for promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory, and @CarpeDonktum, a Twitter celebrity known for making fawning memes about the president, will not produce any such useful debate. Here’s an alternate invite list for a social media censorship summit that might actually be worth having: In September 2016 Facebook censored Nick Ut’s iconic “napalm girl” photograph of nine-year-old Kim Phúc because it violated the company’s ban on naked images of children. Amid international outcry, and after going so far as to delete a post of the photograph by the prime minister of Norway, Facebook eventually reversed course, acknowledging that the photograph had value due to its “historical importance”. But the controversy was an important inflection point for the public’s understanding of Facebook ‘s power. It provided a chance to consider what it would have meant if Facebook had existed in 1972 and had dictated whether or not an image with the chance to change the course of history would ever be seen – and what images might never gain historical importance because of Facebook’s dominance. One of the nightmarish realities of American society is that the survivors of gun massacres are often victimized twice: first by the shooter and next by the legions of gun-rights activists and conspiracy theorists who reliably launch campaigns of harassment and abuse accusing survivors of being “crisis actors”. Social media platforms have played a key role in facilitating such bullying and abuse; YouTube has repeatedly recommended videos spreading lies about survivors in the aftermath of shootings, and harassers often use Facebook to find and then bully victims. Some targets are forced to close their accounts to stop the torrent of threats and abuse – at the very moment that they need support from family and friends. Those who have been affected don’t all agree on the best approach to dealing with conspiratorial content, which may not violate a platform’s rules but can still have terrible consequences. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of one of the victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, have argued that Facebook should ban attacks on victims of mass shootings and other tragedies. But Cori Langdon, a taxi driver who was hailed as a hero for picking up survivors of the Las Vegas shooting before becoming the target of a harassment campaign, told the Guardian that when Facebook and YouTube took down some of the video that was being used to attack her, the censorship “just fuel[ed] them even more”. Facebook’s ban on full nudity and female nipples has long garnered derision for its ham-fisted censorship of old masters, from nudes by Rubens to Gustave Courbet’s L’Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), the censorship of which touched off a years-long legal battle. But while Rubens’ reputation will endure with or without social media, today’s artists are increasingly reliant on Instagram (which is owned by Facebook and follows the same rules) to build an audience and advertise their works. The site’s strictures on nudity thus have real consequences for their work and livelihoods, creating strong incentives for artists to stop depicting the human body in certain ways. The censorship extends to museums and galleries, which rely on Instagram to draw visitors to exhibits. Canadian artist Kit King, who largely sells her work through Instagram, recently told the Art Newspaper that repeated censorship on the platform has made her question whether she should even “remain an artist in the age of social media censorship”. The people of Myanmar, and especially the persecuted minority the Rohingya, have likely been the greatest victims of Facebook’s failures as a responsible censor. The company for years failed to crack down on political and religious figures who were using its platform to foment hate and eventual genocidal violence against the minority. Civil society groups who had begged Facebook to listen to local experts and be more proactive about censoring incitement to violence were then shocked this February when Facebook banned posts by four ethnic armies engaged in a decades-long struggles for self determination against Myanmar’s army. Many local experts said the decision was inconsistent with international law and could have serious repercussions for civilians who relied on the ethnic armies’s Facebook pages for information. The major social media platforms have long been committed to removing propaganda and recruitment materials by Islamic terrorist groups, and the companies have in recent months begun to take action against other extremist ideologies, including white nationalism and Nazism. But the line between documentation of a hateful organization’s activities and promotion of its ideas is exceedingly difficult to define, and social media platforms have run into a number of quandaries over this. In 2017, for example, YouTube removed thousands of videos that were intended to document war crimes in Syria, prompting concerns that the desire to prevent terrorist groups from spreading their message might be inadvertently responsible for destroying the evidence that could theoretically be used to hold some of them to account. And in June, when YouTube updated its policies to ban “supremacist” ideologies, a journalist who documents the far-right and some history teachers who had uploaded an archival footage of Adolf Hitler were targeted by YouTube’s censors.",2019-07-11 01:00:46,Who Trump should have invited to his 'social media summit',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
78,https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardzimmerman/2019/07/11/an-astronaut--a-rock-star-walk-into-a-venturecrushcrisis-leadership-creativity--sciencea-chat-with-commander-mark-kelly--laura-marling/,"By Ed Zimmerman I had the privilege of interviewing both Laura Marling and Space Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly together at our VentureCrushAV event in New York in October 2017. As explained next, the discussion has renewed relevance right now. Commander Kelly and the author (Ed Zimmerman) on either side of Laura Marling (center) performing ... [+] “Wild Fire” at VentureCrushAV (2017). Marling’s album “Semper Femina” was nominated for the 2018 “Best Folk Album of the Year” Grammy Award. In early 2019, Commander Mark Kelly announced he was running for the United States Senate. Two weeks ago, Politico reported that Commander Kelly’s Senate race “will likely be one of the most expensive and closely watched campaigns of the cycle in an emerging presidential battleground.” That same article also reported that Commander Kelly's Republican opponent was “shaking up her campaign team ahead of her 2020 race, turning the page on her disappointing loss last year as she tries to protect a critical battleground Senate seat…” (June 24, 2019) Separately, Grammy nominee/Brit Award/NME Award-winner Laura Marling has made her own headlines this month because tomorrow (July 12) Bob Dylan and Neil Young are co-headlining an historic concert in London’s Hyde Park, with Marling right beneath that legendary duo on the bill. As her terrific instagram post (below) wryly exclaims: ""Can’t believe I’m so low down the bill... Jk! #bobbles"" Instagram Post Marling clinched a 2018 Grammy nomination for “Best Folk Album of the Year” for her “Semper Femina,” (available to stream on her site). A listen will also demonstrate why the Telegraph (2013) characterized the then-23 year old Marling as “arguably the most profound singer-songwriter of her generation,” and why, five years later, NME felt compelled to remove both the ‘arguably’ and ‘of her generation’ from that assertion, as it entitled a 2018 article: “Laura Marling is Britain’s most important songwriter.” I regretted not recording my discussion with Commander Kelly and Marling, so I was delighted to learn that a VentureCrush attendee, Sergio Marrero, recently posted his own recording of our VentureCrush conversation. VentureCrush is a series of invite-only events for entrepreneurs, musicians, venture capital investors and winemakers. What follows is an annotated transcription of the discussion (slightly edited/cleaned up for clarity, and with some added research and links for backup – please see end note for disclosure). In our discussion, Commander Kelly and Marling reflect on assessing risk, leadership, reacting to globally-watched personal crisis and tragedy, the role of science in government, American’s gun violence epidemic (and its disparate impact on women), the role and absence of women in the creation of music, and much more. At about 31 minutes into our VentureCrush audio, Marling performs a solo acoustic version of “Wild Fire” from that Semper Femina album. Commander Kelly is known for his distinguished military service; he happens to be running for the seat previously held by the late Senator John McCain. Commander Kelly retired (after roughly a quarter century of military service) as a heavily decorated Captain in the Navy, having flown 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm. He garnered international fame, however, as an astronaut and the Commander of the Space Shuttles Endeavor and Discovery on multiple missions into space, as discussed in detail at VentureCrush. Commander Kelly was intensely in the public eye following the assassination attempt on his wife, then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, a traumatic event which the Commander also generously and sensitively discussed with us. The world was drawn to his decision of whether to return to space after the attempt on his wife’s life. As the New York Times reported (Feb. 5, 2011): “He is going. In the continuing real-life drama that surpasses the most audacious soap opera narrative, the astronaut Mark E. Kelly announced Friday that he would honor his commitment to lead a two-week shuttle mission to the International Space Station — 200 miles up, and orbiting the earth at 17,500 miles an hour — while his wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, continues her gradual, uncertain recovery from the grievous head wound she suffered during last month’s deadly rampage by a gunman in Tucson.” We discussed this too. Commander Kelly’s closely watched Senate race makes our discussion even more relevant today, at our VentureCrush event he spoke presciently about the growing aversion to/ignorance of science in government. Commander Kelly is also famously a tireless advocate for stemming our gun epidemic following the shooting at point-blank range of his wife, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. In our discussion, Commander Kelly described the moment his wife was shot: “she was out there standing there talking to her constituents ... and this young guy shows up with a 9 millimeter. Shoots Gaby first. Middle of the left side of her head... all in about 15 seconds. Very, very quick. 20 bodies lying on the ground.” Read on to learn how Commander Kelly handled captaining the Space Shuttle while his wife underwent brain surgery, how he - after an academic start he describes as “unstellar” - became an astronaut and how Laura Marling thinks about the implications of a music industry that has traditionally excluded women from the technical and production aspects of music — and how she created a project in response. As Marling notes: “It’s crazy that the whole time we’ve recorded music, it’s never come from a female dominant space... What does that mean for all of the music that has been made and what gets made and how we listen to it?” Our VentureCrush interview also features cameos from two other musicians: four time Grammy Award winner Keb’ Mo’ and Grammy winner Rob Moose, both of whom appear briefly on the audio and have lent tremendous support to VentureCrush over the years. The interview reveals a Commander Kelly who is strikingly relatable, warm and funny. His parents were both police officers in West Orange, New Jersey, an aspect of his background we also discussed. Commander Kelly is remarkably modest and easy in conversation, especially for an astronaut/war hero/best-selling author who graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with highest honors, earning degrees in marine engineering and nautical science, before earning a masters in aeronautical engineering. And that’s not to mention his many military medals and entrepreneurial endeavors. For a man who has journeyed to space, his feet are planted firmly on the ground. Commander Kelly is also extremely funny. This annotated transcription fails to capture the Commander’s comedic timing and wry humor (for instance, his responses about those who assert that the world is flat). His responses, combined with Laura Marling’s eloquent (often philosophical) insights and thrilling solo acoustic performance (which begins at about the 35 minute mark), make the audio very worth a listen. The Fireside Chat At the start of our conversation, I asked Commander Kelly about saying goodbye to his family before each space launch. He explained that his kids had “grown up in the shadow of the Space Shuttle Columbia.” According to the New York Times, on February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia had “spun out of control and disintegrated,” killing all seven astronauts on board. Commander Kelly told us that his children “got out of school a lot to watch their dad or their uncle” go to space. That “uncle” is Commander Kelly’s twin brother and fellow astronaut/naval Captain, Space Station Commander Scott Kelly, who holds the record for the longest space flight for an American. On being an author: I asked Commander Kelly about his having written half a dozen books: Commander Kelly: Well, written, I think is loosely… EMZ: Your name appears on the cover…? Commander Kelly: It’s hard to write a book. How many people here have written a book without getting help? EMZ: I feel like it’s easier to write a book than go to space? Commander Kelly: No, not really. Parental Wisdom? It’s often said that we all need somebody to believe in us. Commander Kelly’s father displays a healthy ‘skepticism’ of his son’s greatness: Commander Kelly: My dad [who was a police officer in West Orange, New Jersey] at one point, when I was in the ninth grade, said to me that he could get me into the welder’s union. Nothing against welders, but I told him ‘I thought I’d go to college.’ And my dad said ‘really?’ That motivated me. Commander Kelly [underscoring the point]: “Neil Armstrong walked on the moon when I was in kindergarten. When I was in second grade, I told my Dad I wanted to be an astronaut. He replied: ‘Well son, there aren’t many of them and they’re really smart.’ So I didn’t think about it for a while.”... EMZ: It’s nice to have all these people who believed in you. Commander Kelly: Right! (laughter) Don’t believe (or even read) your press: EMZ: : [To Laura Marling] I feel awkward quoting from the Telegraph about you because I know you don’t actually read what’s written about you... This is from several years ago, so it’s several years, albums, nominations, and wins later: “Marling is 23 years old and has already released four hugely acclaimed albums, won a Brit and been nominated three times for the Mercury Prize. She is arguably the most profound singer-songwriter of her generation, with the kind of intuitive exchange between melody and lyric, emotion and ideas that potentially ranks her among the all-time greats, albeit in the intensely serious vein of Joni Mitchell, Tim Buckley or Nick Drake.” [September 25, 2013] EMZ: That’s not the first time you’ve heard that quote, is it? LM: Yes, it is. EMZ: Why is it that you don’t read your press? LM: Because I had a very good piece of advice when I first started. ...I was 16. That was ‘if you read, if you believe the good ones, you have to believe the bad ones.’ That idea traumatized me to the point where I just didn’t bother to read any of them. EMZ: Doesn’t that take an enormous degree of self-discipline? LM: It does. Yeah, it does. ...I see what fans say because they say it right at me. EMZ: Do you wish they wouldn’t? LM: No, they’re alright. I’m pretty uncontroversial. EMZ: You think you’re uncontroversial? LM: I think so. EMZ: That’s kind of interesting...so last week in the Guardian [audience laughs], there was an article about the ‘maleness of the music world’ and they had done some analysis of all of the shows that were happening that night throughout the entire U.K. ... something like 70%... were male only and of the remainder, they almost exclusively had one woman in the act. [Note: Guardian coverage (October 12, 2017): “Tonight, more than two-thirds of the live music acts performing in the UK will feature no women on stage...” “69% of the acts (255) are made up entirely of men, while just 9% (33) are female-only (half of these are solo artists).”] EMZ (continues): There’s a big picture of you and you’re talking about the male- dominated component of the music world...I know it’s only seven days later, but did that spark controversy? LM: Well that has sparked controversy... I did a podcast series called “Reversal of  the Muse” about the lack of female presence in the technical side of making music and other parts of music and that ...got all the twitter people rallied.... But ...that’s not really controversial, actually. No one disagreed with my point. EMZ: What was your point? LM: Just highlighting the imbalance and what effect that might have on the music that we take in. EMZ: In your podcast, which I would encourage everyone to listen to [Note: The Atlantic also favorably reviewed Marling’s podcast], in your first interview, you interviewed Vanessa Parr, a recording engineer in Los Angeles [Parr’s credits]. She had gone to Berklee College of Music, which is one of the leading music schools in America. Her class of engineers [was] about 3% or 4% female, according to what you discussed in that session. And then it got to music producers and how many [female] music producers she had worked with over the decade and how many you had worked with and it was the same number, 0. LM: Zero, yeah. EMZ: Has that changed? LM: I’ve been put in touch with a lot more...Since she [Vanessa Parr] was at Berklee 10 years ago, it’s changed a bit but you can count them on one hand, female music producers. There’s really no reason, no technical reason why that should be. Women aren’t more or less interested in the technical side of music than men are, I don’t think, as far as my investigation has gone. It’s just that it happens to be an environment that was built in a certain structure. It’s based in this thing, the creative industry - the boundary between the personal and the professional is ambiguous. So these environments, studio environments, are masculine hangouts. Now I love to hang out in a masculine hangout every now and again but it’s not my thriving space. My thriving space is my feminine hangout. Or that balance. There is certainly that balance to be struck. I think from that balance comes the origin of all creativity… Masculine and feminine in whatever form they exist creates the universe. It’s crazy that the whole time we’ve recorded music, it’s never come from a female dominant space or a balanced space. What does that mean for all of the music that has been made and what gets made and how we listen to it? [The discussion continued and segued to Commander Kelly’s marriage to Representative Gabby Giffords.] Shuttle Commander Kelly on his wife, Representative Gabby Giffords [The Commander’s team was kind enough to supply some photos. I selected from them and asked the Commander to narrate.] Commander Kelly: That’s my wife before I met her...She was the youngest woman to serve in the Arizona state senate, that’s a record she still holds today [as of the event date in 2017]. Commander Kelly [narrating the next photos on the VentureCrush slides]:  That’s her riding her motorcycle, which is now my motorcycle because after her injury, she can’t ride… from her traumatic brain injury…I ride it just to keep it going. She loves this motorcycle. I told her I wanted to sell it to make extra room in the garage. She told me we would get divorced. EMZ: This was recently? Commander Kelly: Recently! [audience laughs] EMZ: Several years ago, you gave a TED talk in Vancouver. I was in the audience for that TED talk... you talked about — I think you were joking — using velcro to get her right arm on the handlebar. You were joking, right? Commander Kelly: That’s a natural thing for an astronaut, velcro...Yes, we did that, for a while. Now we use duct tape. Commander Kelly [narrating the next photos on the VentureCrush slides]: Wednesday, the day she got sworn in for her last term in Congress. This next picture is [the following] Saturday. Saturday. So she was ... standing there talking to her constituents ... with them lined up... This young guy shows up with a 9 millimeter; shoots Gabby first. Middle of the left side of her head. Kills six of her constituents. Shoots 12 other people all in about 15 seconds. Very, very quick. 20 bodies lying on the ground. Gabby nearly died. Six people that were killed. One was a nine year old girl named Christina Taylor Green - who was born on 9/11. [She] didn’t live to see her 10th birthday, but was there to ask Gabby a question about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. She was standing right next to my wife when she was shot through the heart. She was standing right next to her, but they never even met. She was next in line. She was there to meet my wife and never got to meet her. But she died right next to her. So...So that’s Gabby on Saturday. [Note: Our attendees were visibly moved and the room was somber.] President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama participated in the service for those killed by the gunfire that day. The New York Times (January 12, 2011) reported that President Obama “led an overflow crowd at the evening service at the University of Arizona in eulogizing the six people who died on Saturday and asking for prayers for the wounded, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who the authorities said was the target of an assassination attempt.” In the speech, which President Obama reportedly wrote for himself, he challenged America: “'If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let’s make sure it’s worthy of those we have lost,’ Mr. Obama said. ‘Let’s make sure it’s not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle.’” (NYT Jan. 12, 2011). Commander Kelly [narrating the next slide]: Some vet just left his Purple Heart medal for her. Didn’t leave his name. [Next slide]: That’s a few days later when President Obama came to see her. [Next slide]: The doctor wanted her to remember being in Tucson so they put her on the [hospital’s] roof. On pausing your life when tragedy strikes EMZ: You grabbed headlines because you had a really important decision to make... Commander Kelly: She was in the hospital for six months. I was going to be the last Commander of Space Shuttle Endeavor. While she was in a coma, I quit my job. Then about a month later, I started trying to figure out ‘how do I get it back,’ because you eventually have to figure out how to reclaim some of your former life...It was really complicated for me because with Gabby’s brain injury I couldn’t really even ask her what she thought I should do. She didn’t really understand at the time. That’s how bad her injury was. But I knew some things about my wife. She was the biggest supporter of my career. She was a big fan of NASA, of science in general. When Gabby first went into Congress and they’re handing out the committee assignments, my wife asked for the science committee. Nobody asks to be on the science committee. You’ve got half the members of Congress [who] don’t believe that science is a real thing. EMZ: That’s a relatively new phenomenon. Commander Kelly: What? EMZ: The death of science. Commander Kelly: I believe they’re coming out of the closet...There’s a poll that Quinnipiac did about a year and a half ago: more than half of registered Republicans believe the planet is 5,000 years old…and then there’s this rapper ... B.o.B., he also believes that the planet is flat… [Note: BBC reporting confirms this — that the rapper expressed that view, not that the earth is flat!]. EMZ: And how does it look from way up high? Commander Kelly: It’s not flat. [Audience laughter]. That whole gravity thing doesn’t work really well if the planet is flat. It’s not flat. [Note: I didn’t find the Quinnipiac poll Commander Kelly referenced but did find a comparable Gallup poll and research from the Pew Research Center, reported in the NYTimes in December 2012 (by Charles Blow): “According to a June Gallup report, most Republicans (58 percent) believed that God created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years. Most Democrats and independents did not agree.” From that same article: “a 2009 Pew Research Center report found that only 6 percent of scientists identified as Republican and 9 percent identified as conservative. Furthermore, a 2005 study found that just 11 percent of college professors identified as Republican and 15 percent identified as conservative. Some argue that this simply represents a liberal bias in academia. But just as strong a case could be made that people who absorb facts easily don’t suffer fools gladly.”] Don’t assert that the Moon Landing was faked, or you might get ‘Buzzed’ EMZ: [Can we talk about the] Buzz Aldrin anecdote where he was in his 80s? Commander Kelly: Yeah, this was a while ago. He used to get harassed more than the other Apollo astronauts...maybe because his name was Buzz. There was this guy who used to follow him around to get him to admit that the moon landings were faked. ...Finally the guy actually touched him, poked him. And Buzz punched him right in the face. 80-something years old. [Note: In 2002, the Guardian recounted the story - Aldrin was 72 at the time: “Bart Sibrel has made documentaries called A Funny Thing Happened on the  Way to the Moon and Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land On the Moon? and confronted Aldrin, 72, in a Beverly Hills hotel earlier this week. Sibrel, 37, demanded that Aldrin swear on a Bible that he had really landed on the moon. Aldrin declined to do so, and then his fist really landed on Sibrel's face.”] Commander Kelly: Don’t you think the Soviets would have said something if we faked the lunar landing?...because [we’re] in competition with them. They tracked us all the way to the surface and back. You would have thought they would have said something. EMZ: I feel like that’s just what a fake would say [audience laughter]… The risk of going to space and deciding to restart your life Commander Kelly: The other thing hard about this decision [to return to space] was the risk involved. So Gabby just nearly got assassinated; I’m deciding to go into space for another trip. People often underestimate the risk involved in flying the space shuttle. I was on an airplane the other day and the woman sitting next to me said “hey, isn’t driving in my car down the highway more dangerous than flying in the space shuttle?” And I said “No!” [Audience laughter] Yeah, so it’s tough...being away from my kids...I ultimately realized that my crew members and I were training for that flight for two years and for me not to be the guy in the left seat — it’s more risky for them to have a guy thrown in there at the end. EMZ: For you, the decision was more about duty than opportunity? Commander Kelly: Yeah, I’d say so. I’d flown three flights already. I didn’t have to do that and it was a really hard thing for me because Gabby was in the hospital, she had her final brain surgery while I was in space on the third day of the mission while I am rendezvousing with the space station, which you do a lot by hand. You know, flying two things that are going 17,500 miles per hour and you’ve got to fly ... two inches from each other, and at the same time, Gabby’s in the operating room with a neurosurgeon. You know, complicated time in my life. EMZ: In retrospect, now that Gabby is back to a place where her cognitive skills are strong, does she say ‘I can’t believe that my husband left me and went back into space?’ or ‘That was a great decision, I’m so glad you did that.’? Commander Kelly: Yeah, I knew that she would have been really bummed out if I didn’t. I just know her and she would have been...not only did her getting shot end her career, but it also ended my career. She would not have liked that. That’s [a photo of] Gabby looking at my kids crying — especially my younger daughter, because she’s always scared about me going to space. EMZ: Because it’s dangerous? Commander Kelly: It’s dangerous. It’s about a one-in-50 proposition. [At this point, you can hear audience members gasp/exclaim] Pick one card out of the deck. Pick the ace of spades? You die. If we were to do that in here today, [Commander Kelly points at groups of our VentureCrush attendees in the room] probably two over here, one of you over here, two of you over here, don’t get to go home. That’s the odds that we deal with on each and every space shuttle flight. But we know it, and it’s important. [Narrating the next slide] That’s [a photo of] the space station with the space shuttle on top. The only time a picture like that’s been taken because the Russian spacecraft was leaving. So it was about 3 a.m. for us. I was going to get up and watch this Russian spacecraft leaving. My alarm went off. I was too tired, so I went back to sleep. [Audience laughs] EMZ: Why? Commander Kelly: Why did I go back to sleep? Because I was really tired. [Audience laughs] EMZ: You had a spaceship to fly? Commander Kelly: I had a spaceship to fly! [Audience laughs] His school, her battleship In 2016, the elementary school Commander Kelly and his twin brother, Space Station Commander Scott Kelly, had attended was renamed after Commander Kelly and his brother. As CBS news reported: “The Kellys grew up as New Jersey kids, and went through the public school system before becoming Navy pilots and NASA astronauts. Both their parents served on the police force, and their mother was the town’s first female officer. They became the first twins ever both to go into space.” I asked Commander Kelly about the experience, especially given his earlier comments regarding his academic performance in that very same elementary school: EMZ: [Narrating the next slide] That’s the elementary school where you were ‘an unstellar student’ [quoting Commander Kelly’s earlier self-assessment]... Commander Kelly: That’s the elementary school I used to break into in the summer. Actually, I used to hit golf balls through the window… EMZ: Your parents were both cops? Commander Kelly: Police officers, yes…the United States Navy named a ship after my wife though; combat ship. My wife made the point that her ship could blow up my elementary school. EMZ: It’s a competitive marriage! [Note: “The USS Gabrielle Giffords, the Navy's newest littoral combat ship, was brought to life by her crew before a crowd of nearly 2,500 guests at Pier 21 at the Port of Galveston, Texas, June 10.” (announced in U.S. Department of Defense (June 12, 2017))] Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords with Ed Zimmerman (center) and Commander Mark Kelly at Yankee ... [+] Stadium (September 2015) Laura Marling on her Grammy-nominated album “Semper Femina” [The slides continued with images that either pertained to, or were pictures of, Laura Marling.] LM: [Narrating the slide] That is people doing street art. Painting my album cover over the [public space], which I guess was a promotional thing. EMZ: What’s the title of this album? LM: Semper Femina. It’s from a Virgil quote, the entirety of which is “varium et mutabile semper femina” — “She’s Fickle and changeable always is woman.” I just changed it to “Fickle and changeable, always woman,” not to cause a controversy. [Note: see New York Times review, which explains the Virgil quote (Mar. 8, 2017)]. EMZ: What was the controversy …? LM: Well, fickle and changeable I thought might be debatable... EMZ: Do you feel like this album is a departure for you artistically or an evolution? because it sounds ... different (please don’t ask me why)? LM: That’s probably [my producer, multi-Grammy nominated] Blake Mills and Rob [Moose of YMusic and Bon Iver]… EMZ: Where’s Rob [Moose]...there he is...drinking...always drinking… Note: To clarify, I was not referencing a drinking problem. Mr. Moose is a well-known wine connoisseur, as this New York Times 2015 profile reports: “The light in Rob Moose’s refrigerator won’t turn on. This is intentional: Mr. Moose, a rangy, tumble-haired rock guitarist, violinist and producer who has spent much of the last decade working with the likes of Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens, taped the switch down. ‘So as not to disturb the wine,’ he said.” Blake Mills was profiled in New York Times (Jan. 24, 2018): “‘Sound & Color,’ the second album by Alabama Shakes. For its 2012 debut album,…which Mr. Mills produced with the band, used a far broader and more unpredictable sonic palette, from punk to shoegaze; it won a Grammy for best alternative music album.”… “The albums that earned Blake Mills a Grammy nomination for producer of the year, nonclassical, are all by singer-songwriters. That’s about the only thing they have in common. Among them are John Legend’s “Darkness and Light,” R&B songs informed by blues, jazz and social consciousness; the English songwriter Laura Marling’s sparse, thoughtful “Semper Femina”; and “No Shape” by Perfume Genius (the songwriter Mike Hadreas)...”] [Note: the enormously talented Rob Moose is an extremely generous contributor to and staple at our VentureCrush events. Here he is playing violin at our 2017 VentureCrushParis, in Forbes. Rob performed with Marling at the end of our VentureCrushAV event following the talk.

[+] LLP (law library in background) at VentureCrushAV LM: It’s a bit more of a conceptual record I guess...it’s all about women. EMZ: And male pronouns? LM: No male pronouns. EMZ: Intentionally or unintentionally? LM: Unintentionally, but when someone pointed that out to me I thought … EMZ: How do you write an entire album unintentionally not using male pronouns...? [Note: Jon Pareles, in The New York Times review (Mar. 8, 2017) of the album, noted: “It’s a woman’s world on Laura Marling’s sixth album, “Semper Femina,” her latest set of cozy, folky melodies carrying profoundly enigmatic tidings. The characters in her new songs, from start to finish, are women; men, except for someone’s mean father, are absent, simply irrelevant to her current intentions.”] LM: My life was about...I had just had this year. I was writing a libretto for an opera about the first female psychoanalyst called Lou Andreas-Salomé, and I was infuriated by some of the stories. She was supposed to [have been] one of the most brilliant people who ever lived, and she’s barely mentioned in the biographies of all the men that she knew who were much more famous than her, like Nietzsche and Rilke and Freud. She’s mentioned as a sort of femme fatale. She was an academic equal of them all; she wasn’t a femme fatale… I also read a book called Minor Characters, which is a female perspective on the Beat Generation. I became incredibly enthused with rewriting women’s histories and why women didn’t get the autonomy and authority to write their own biographies until much later. That was what my whole year was about. [Note: Marling is referencing Minor Characters, by Joyce Johnson, a 1983 National Book Critics Circle Award winner. While the book is about her relationship with Jack Kerouac, it is also a story of women of the beat generation, the so- called ""minor characters"" in the title. See also, New York Times review (1983)]. [At this point, the discussion turned to a song. . . Laura Marling had earlier indicated that speaking after Shuttle Commander Kelly was daunting, so…] EMZ: [asked for a song] We’ll make it really hard for Mark to talk after you. LM: [Approximately 31 minutes into the audio, Laura Marling performs a solo acoustic version of “Wild Fire” from her Semper Femina album; here’s an additional link to the song as featured on NPR’s All Songs Considered] [Audience loves it. EMZ thanks Marling and returns to the interview.] Technology in music: Marling’s Black Sabbath Connection EMZ: When you listen to that song [Wild Fire] and your other music, one of the things I wonder about is your Sabbath relationship. [Marling laughs]. I want to talk to you about Sabbath… LM: Black Sabbath? EMZ: Black Sabbath. LM: My dad was a recording engineer, which is why I’m interested in studios. He ran a residential studio, which my sisters were brought up in. Unfortunately, it shut when I was very little...many years before, Black Sabbath and The La’s [Note: according to The Guardian, Apr. 27, 2013, The La’s recorded “their famed anthem, ‘There She Goes’ on site” in 1988]...Phil Collins albums [were] done there. It was all very exciting. EMZ: But your dad’s studio shut? LM: It shut down. Yeah, it was in the first wave...Britain had a good history of residential studios. But it was in the first wave to go. It just got too expensive. EMZ: He didn’t technologize much? LM: He had the best gear money could buy at the time...we sold off the last piece when I was like 18. EMZ: [In this photo,] we’ve got you with the Brit Award in your hand that you won for what? LM: [describing instead how she felt or seemed] Unnatural...uncomfortable. [Note: In 2011, Marling won the Brit Award for Best Female Solo Artist. That year, she also won the NME Award for Best Solo Artist. We briefly mentioned a few other awards Laura Marling won, or for which she was nominated.] EMZ [asking about the next slide]: What’s this painting? Want to talk about that? LM: This painting is the poster for a guitar shop in Nashville called Fanny’s  House of Music, which is where I’ve bought a couple of guitars. It’s run by women and it’s the only guitar shop I’ve ever been to...I’ve been playing guitar since I was 4 years old and it’s the only time I’ve bought a guitar off a woman, especially a woman selling really brilliant vintage guitars. And this poster is just an amazing collection of…[great women guitarists] EMZ: Including Sister Rosetta Tharpe? LM: Yes, Sister Rosetta. [Note: The image is the current header for Fanny’s Twitter account. Also, for more on Sister Rosetta, the Founding Mother of Rock, see “The Legendary Sister Rosetta Tharpe in 5 Songs,” Forbes (Jan 10, 2016), by Ed & Betsy Zimmerman] EMZ: [TURNING TO 4x Grammy Award Winner, Kevin Moore - better known as - Keb’ Mo’ - seated in the front row] You live in Nashville, Kevin.

I stay home a lot… Commander Kelly Discusses Gun Violence Our event was held a few weeks after the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas Shooting, in which “at least 58 people were killed and more than 400 were injured, police say, in what is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.” Washington Post, October 2, 2017.  Commander Kelly has for years been known for the role he’s played “to keep us safe from gun violence” and “as an advocate for commonsense, effective gun laws.” Both quotes are from his web site for his U.S. Senate campaign (on which Commander Kelly also states that “Mark will stand up to the gun lobby and fight to protect Arizona kids and communities from gun violence.”). Having previously hosted/cohosted fundraisers for Giffords, the nonprofit founded by Commander Kelly and his wife Gabby Giffords, it was natural that I asked him about his work in that realm. In fact, Commander Kelly had, earlier in the month, published a powerful OpEd in the Washington Post (in the aftermath of the Las Vegas mass shooting) entitled “Now is exactly the right time to talk about gun politics,” (Oct. 3, 2017). It was subtitled “Demand leadership from our elected leaders.” EMZ: [Introduces the below photo of Commander Kelly with 4x Grammy Winner Rosanne Cash, with the author’s wife Betsy Zimmerman, and the author.] Thanks to our friends Elizabeth & Will Porteous (and I know Elizabeth is in the back [of the room]), we ended up doing a dinner with Rosanne Cash and two weeks ago Rosanne wrote an Op Ed in the New York Times [entitled “Country Musicians, Stand Up to the N.R.A.”]. We were doing a dinner to support an organization that you and Gabby founded. You want to talk about that organization? Multi-Grammy winner/Gun Control Advocate Rosanne Cash with Commander Kelly, Betsy Zimmerman and Ed ... [+] Zimmerman (New York, May 2017) Commander Kelly: So Gabby and I started an organization that’s now actually named after my wife, as of a couple of days ago. We changed the name of it to Giffords Courage To Fight Gun Violence. It was a long time coming, but it was after the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting that Gabby and I just got fed up with the ridiculous level of gun violence in this country. 33,000 people die every year from gunshot wounds. Another 100,000 people get shot and survive. We decided that we wanted to try to do something about it and maybe move this country in a better direction; keep guns out of the hands of criminals and idiots and suspected terrorists and domestic abusers. This is an interesting issue as it affects women, at least here in the United States. I don’t think people realize this, usually more often than not, men are shot by strangers and women are shot and killed by people they know. Way more than 50%. Usually by somebody they’re intimate with, husband, boyfriend, ex-boyfriend...so we’ve been trying to get Congress and state legislatures to pass more common sense gun laws, which is challenging because we’re up against a very formidable gun lobby, the National Rifle Association. And a lot of people out there including the gun lobby and a lot of people we elect to office want us to think that this is normal. That it’s just the price of freedom. We have more kids die in the United States from gun violence...actually 85% of the children that die in the developed world from gun violence, die in the United States. EMZ: So we didn’t actually coordinate on the stats we had in mind, but this has been an issue that I’ve cared about for years, and it’s what brought us together in the first place (which I’ve really appreciated)...but if an abuser owns a gun, then victims, largely women, are 5x more likely to be killed by their abuser - could be as much as 8x - but domestic assaults involving a gun are 12x more likely to result in death. In 2011, almost 2/3rds of women killed with guns were killed by intimate partners. Women in this country were 11x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other high-income countries. So there really is a gender component to this, and that’s another issue that Rosanne talked about. One of the things that Rosanne said — and she said this to Elizabeth and to me last week — was that this was a time that when again, gun violence “came to my office to do this”...meaning they came to country music, a concert, just like at Bataclan in Paris. I don’t know how you as a performer feel about this. And feel about the extent to which maybe there’s exposure or risk. [Note: for a reflection on the November 13, 2015 mass shooting inside the Bataclan, a famous theater in Paris, see Rached Donadio, “What the November 13 Attacks Taught Paris,” The Atlantic (Nov. 13, 2018).] LM: When it first happened at the Bataclan, because that’s an enclosed space as well and [I considered] the responsibility of the performer. I don’t know, because it’s just such a horrific environment. There is no system in place to deal with something like that... EMZ: So it is on us to try and deal with it. Commander Kelly: If you haven’t read Rosanne Cash’s OpEd it’s really, really good. Hers was in the New York Times. I wrote one which was in the Washington Post [“Now is exactly the right time to talk about gun politics,” (Oct. 3, 2017)] the same day. Hers was much better. Marling on women having guitars taken out of their hands EMZ: I would love to hear more from Laura and Rob [Moose], who did strings on your album as well. There are a number of comments in the press about you having the guitar taken out of your hand. There’s an episode of your podcast where a producer talks about how amazing you are as a guitarist and how atypical that is. Maybe we can end with you just talking a little but about having the guitar taken out of your hands, and about being a kick-ass guitarist… LM: ...I’m also English, so I don’t like talking about being good at things [audience laughs]. But I have played guitar for a long time. I think more frequently the assumption is made that perhaps guitar is just a thing that I have with me to write sort of boring, self-indulgent songs. Half of that is true, but I’m a good guitarist and I frequently sort of have to prove that. I feel that on behalf of female musicians who are, like me, a little bit shy or...not particularly garrulous, it’s that much more difficult for women to step up and be virtuosic musicians, especially in the nonclassical world. Though that is still a problem in the classical world as well, to keep hold of their instruments in the first place is hard enough. Crossword Puzzles EMZ: I’m going to show you [introduces a photo of Laura Marling interviewed at  the New Yorker Festival in 2017, with a graphic of her appearing as the answer to a crossword puzzle]...Is that 26 down or 26 across?

According to a report by Campus Reform,  Yale Law School Professor Emily Jane O’Dell praised the quality of life in Soviet Russia in a tweet that was published this week.  O’Dell claims that she has spoken with many people who lived under the Soviet Union and that all of them argue that their quality of life was better than it is now. “Every single person I have I [sic] asked in Central Asia (and Eastern Europe) over the past decade and a half has said life was better under the Soviets — 100 percent,” O’Dell tweeted. The professor, who claims expertise in Islamic law, deactivated her Twitter account this week. Dell also claimed that an Ivy League professor told her that “coming to America was the greatest mistake of her life.” This isn’t the first time that O’Dell has attracted critics on Twitter. O’Dell once argued that all men should be required to attend reeducation camps as a means of preventing the next mass shooting. “Imagine being raised as a white man to have no awareness of (let alone empathy for) others,” O’Dell wrote in a tweet. “Deep down inside they know there’s something fundamental missing–hence all the violence towards others.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Epstein’s seven-story, 21,000-square-foot Upper East Side home near Central Park is reportedly valued at $56 million, and if the home ever hits the market again, the stigma from the financier’s alleged sex-trafficking scandal will likely diminish its worth. “After an event like this occurs, and the public becomes aware of it, all of a sudden the value drops significantly,” real-estate appraiser Orell Anderson, who valued the homes where Nicole Brown Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey were murdered, told MarketWatch. “
        When tragedy or crime occurs at a home, it could take years before it ever sells, even if it’s a high profile residence.
        ” One might find what’s inside the mansion disturbing even without knowing the harrowing acts that occurred inside. The home is reportedly adorned with unsettling decor choices, like a female doll hanging from the chandelier, and a self-portrait Epstein reportedly commissioned of himself portrayed in a prison scene behind barbed wire in the middle of a corrections officer and a guard station, according to The New York Times. All of those adornments, of course, would be removed in lieu of any sale. When tragedy or crime occurs at a home, it could take years before it ever sells, even if it’s a high profile residence. And when it does, the buyer usually gets a discount on it, and the market value could take years to bounce back, if it ever does, Anderson says. Homes where something as extreme as a murder occurs can often decrease a property’s value by 25% because of physical damages to the house like blood stains, or the lingering smell of dead bodies, Anderson explains. Then there’s the stigma of living in a house where someone was killed, or a tragedy happened. After O.J. Simpson’s former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her 26-year-old friend Ron Goldman were found dead outside of her Brentwood home in 1994, Brown Simpson’s family tried to sell it, but no one wanted to buy a home where a double homicide occurred. The house was on the market for two years before it finally sold for a fraction of what Brown Simpson paid for it. She purchased the home for $625,000 and it sold for $525,000, according to Realator.com. And in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered an entire family in the “Amityville Horror House,” it sold for a $250,000 loss in 2017. Don’t miss: You can live in the ‘Amityville Horror’ home for $850,000 “
        ‘The property in the short-term would take a significant hit to what its potential would be.’
        ” New York City-based real-estate appraiser Jonathan Miller says even cursed homes see resiliency. “Whenever there is a tragedy, generally speaking, at least in New York, the property in the short-term would take a significant hit to what its potential would be,” Miller explained. He said Epstein’s Upper East Side mansion is especially unique because there’s only a handful like them on the block near Central Park. “I find that within a few years that generally fades away and even accelerates when you have a unique property or housing shortage.” How to salvage and attempt to sell a cursed property Once the dust settles after a tragedy, there are physical changes that can be made to present the property in a new light. “It’s best to make the house look different from the pictures of it in the media so that people don’t immediately recognize it.” Anderson says, of changing the facade. “Put in more lights or change the color of the walls so there’s a perception that things have changed.” That could mean investing in landscapers to add more plants to the front entrance to make it look more inviting, or changing the color of the home to make it appear brand new so perspective buyers don’t associate the property with it’s dark history. However, real-estate agents are typically obliged to reveal the history of a house, especially if there were serious crimes committed there such as a murder, to a prospective buyer. To boost the value of Brown Simpson’s home, it underwent a massive renovation and an address change so prospective buyers wouldn’t associate the condo with its past. It took more than a decade to bounce back selling for $1.72 million in 2006, according to Realator.com. In the DeFeo murder home, granite counter tops, a heated sun room, fireplace and home sprinkler system were added likely to help boost the value in 2016 before it sold a year later. Homes where tragedies occur can be redeveloped, turned into memorials or destroyed Anderson says another way to restore a property that’s been plagued by crime or violence is to demolish it and rebuild something completely new, like turning a single-family mansion into an apartment building or office space depending on what zoning and land laws permit. “If you had the kind of money, you could tear down the home and make it into something different,” Anderson said.  In other cases, like an act of terrorism or a mass shooting, sometimes homes or the place where a tragedy occurred are destroyed all together, Anderson noted. Some buyers hire energy healers to chase away evil spirits and bad vibes When the DeFeo murder home first sold in 1975 after he was convicted, the buyers reportedly moved out nearly a month after they moved in because they allegedly heard voices telling them to “get out.”  It could be worth getting an energy healer or spiritual leader to come in and cleanse the house, Anderson says, to put potential home owners at ease. “If your market demands it, you could get your local priest or energy healer to come exercise the bad spirits. It might sound ridiculous, but that seems to be calming for people who believe in ghosts, or have superstitions,” Anderson says.

85,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impossible-argue-colorados-safer-law-sen-michael-bennet/story?id=63431713,"The presidential hopeful spoke on ""This Week"" 'I don't think I'm out of step' with Dem Party: 2020 presidential candidate In the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said that the president could make a big difference in the effort to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Twelve people were shot to death in the Virginia Beach municipal building and four others were injured in Friday's rampage, allegedly carried out by an employee. The Democratic presidential hopeful told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week"" Sunday that, ""I think the president can make a difference. The House of Representatives have passed background checks to close the internet loophole. This person bought the guns lawfully as we know. Every single fact pattern will be different. We should pass those background checks. 90% of Americans support it."" He said that in Colorado, people are safer because of the laws that have been passed to close so-called loopholes. ""After Columbine in Colorado, the people of this western state voted to close the gun show loophole and internet loophole,"" he said. ""It's impossible to argue that our state isn't safer because of this law. If McConnell doesn't take this on the floor, the people of America and the people of Kentucky will hold him accountable for that."" Bennet holds a mixed record on gun control. He's voted to ban high-capacity magazines of over 10 bullets; he's also said he opposes restricting the right to bear arms; and, in 2009, he voted to allow Amtrak riders to check bags containing guns. His push for gun control on the campaign trail has not always been widely accepted. According to local news reports, a group of students walked out of an event in May, organized by a local chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, after hearing speeches from members of the community, including activists and elected officials, including Bennet. Both the senator and Rep. Jason Crow, who represents the district where the shooting took place, were invited by the Brady Campaign to speak at the event. They talked about the need to take action in the wake of another tragic school shooting and reform the nation's gun laws. Students from the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado and critics condemned Bennet's remarks, calling it a ""political stunt."" In the 2020 race, Bennet's push to secure his spot on the debate stage has been an uphill climb. The Democratic presidential hopeful has not reached the Democratic National Committee polling criteria, appearing at 1% in two national polls, but still has not reached the 65,000 individual donor threshold needed to lock in his podium at the first debate later this month. ""I only got in the race four weeks ago, so, George, I'm behind and anybody who wants to help, we'd love to have the help.  But I also think – I hope the DNC sort of takes a look at this and reconsiders,"" Bennet told Stephanopoulos. ""I've been in the Senate for 10 years and I think the tragedy for adding voices to the Democracy, if we're basing it just on what people can raise on the internet in just a handful of weeks, I just don't think it makes any sense."" The Colorado senator spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, while his fellow moderate in the Democratic field, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, faced a disruptive crowd in California when he said that ""socialism is not the answer"" to winning the 2020 election. At the California Democratic Convention, Hickenlooper responded to the boos he received by saying, ""you know, if we are not careful we are going to help re-elect the worst president in American history."" On ""This Week,"" Stephanopoulos said, ""You heard those boos right there. You know, at the State of the Union, you applauded President Trump when he said America will never be a socialist country. Are you worried that you and John Hickenlooper are out of step with the base of your party?"" Bennet responded that San Francisco may have been the wrong place to make that statement and that, ""I don't think I'm out of step. I was not applauding Donald Trump, I was applauding the idea that this country will not become a socialist country. I think we have 230 years of being the longest lived democracy on the planet, that's something we need to preserve."" He said it's becoming harder to preserve that ideal, however, because ""we have had 40 years of no economic mobility in the United States, 90 percent of the American people -- 90 percent, George -- have not shared in the economic growth over the last 40 years. For them, those periods of economic growth have acted as a recession and as a result they can't afford the basic components of the middle class life."" Bennet echoed that sentiment while criticizing Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan and advocating for his Medicare X plan, an extension of the Affordable Care Act which would provide Americans with a public option. Bennet said his plan has higher chance of being passed into legislation. ""The Twitter universe in the party is going in another direction, the base of the party that I've been meeting with in New Hampshire, Iowa and -- just yesterday -- in South Carolina, they don't think we would take insurance away from 180 (million) people. And they absolutely categorically do not agree that Bernie is right on that and I don't think Bernie is right on that."" Still, if Sanders does become the Democratic Party's nominee, Bennet said that he would support him, despite disagreeing with his opponent's more left-leaning agenda. ""Well, I think the only way we’re going to lose to Donald Trump is if we disqualify ourselves,"" he said. ""And that’s why -- that’s why these issues around how we approach universal health care, how we approach climate change, we -- as Democrats -- we have to build a broad constituency in the country not just of Democrats but of independents and Republicans to overcome Trump."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,'Impossible' to argue Colorado's not safer because of this law: Sen.

Though current Columbine students weren't born at the time of the massacre, 16-year-old Rachel Hill told reporters she thinks ""it's inspiring"" to be a Columbine student because it ""inspires us to work harder for change."" ""The scale of the walkout is extraordinary,"" Hill said, adding, ""I hope by all of us doing this we can encourage people who can vote to make a difference."" Thousands of students streamed out of schools around the country this morning to call on Congress to pass tighter gun control laws in the wake of the mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people last month. The event, which began at 10 a.m. across every time zone, was officially scheduled to last 17 minutes -- one minute for each of the victims gunned down in the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But many students are rallying for much longer. The Columbine students who walked out at 10 a.m. local time today gathered on the school's soccer fields with red, white and blue balloons, according to The Denver Post. They read names of those lost in the Stoneman Douglas and Columbine shootings. ""There's always the possibility that we'll walk into our schools one day and never walk out,"" one Columbine student told her fellow classmates during the walkout. ""For those who believe we are too young to have opinions on this ... we are a generation who has grown up with mass shootings and we are the ones who have to live through these tragedies. It is up to us to be the change we want to see."" The students also released the balloons for the victims and tied ribbons to a fence at the school. According to the district, students who chose to participate in the walkout would remain on school grounds and then return to class. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-12 22:15:17.277153,Columbine students join in nationwide school walkout,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

88,https://nypost.com/2019/07/13/virginia-beach-staffer-fired-for-threatening-comments-on-mass-shooting/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Associated Press Submit July 13, 2019 | 12:30am VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A Virginia Beach city employee has been fired and charged with disturbing the peace after supervisors say she threatened them during a meeting about the deadly mass shooting that erupted in a city building in May. It’s the second time since the killings that authorities have filed the misdemeanor charge against a city employee who allegedly became hostile toward supervisors. The Virginian-Pilot reported Friday that 48-year-old human services worker Elizabeth Mann told managers that the slayings of 11 city employees and a building contractor could have been prevented. Mann also told supervisor Wendy Swallow that Swallow was the type of person who pushed the shooter to act, according to a partial recording of the June 3 meeting obtained by the newspaper. “You are exactly the same type of supervisor that probably pushed this guy to do that,” Mann told Swallow. On May 31, city engineer DeWayne Craddock opened fire in the municipal building where he worked. He had submitted his resignation the same day. The criminal complaint filed by police against Mann alleged that she used an aggressive tone and that Swallow feared for her safety. Swallow did not respond to the newspaper’s requests for comment. Mann told the newspaper that she never cursed and was sitting throughout the encounter. “I wasn’t comparing myself to the shooter or justifying his actions at all,” she said. City spokeswoman Julie Hill confirmed Mann’s termination.

				Employees at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center returned to work... She also confirmed that mental health services are being offered to employees to help them process the tragedy, but declined to comment further. Mann also faces protective orders from four supervisors, including Swallow. Hill said the supervisors filed the protective orders as private citizens and not in any official capacity. The three other supervisors did not respond to the newspaper’s requests for comment. Earlier this month, The Virginian-Pilot reported that another city employee was charged with disturbing the peace. Jonathan McIvor allegedly raised his voice and showed hostility when his supervisors asked why he wouldn’t return to work in the building where the shooting occurred. Chief technology officer Darrell Riddick and acting operations manager Jamie Weaver alleged that McIvor began yelling, “stood up aggressively” and stormed out, saying he was going to call Human Resources. McIvor’s attorney said in July that the criminal complaint does not accuse McIvor of making any threats: “The man did nothing remotely close to criminal,” Taite Westendorf said. Virginia Beach’s city manager has said nobody would be forced to return to the building. But McIvor’s information technology job apparently requires that he access server equipment in the basement.

89,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845252-wsop-2019-main-event-results-and-prize-money-payouts-ahead-of-final-table," Hossein Ensan holds a sizable chip lead entering the Final Table at the 2019 World Series of Poker Main Event, which will award $10 million to the winner. However, he'll have a talented group of players looking to win the bracelet, including Garry Gates, the senior consultant of player affairs for PokerStars. Here's a look at the official final-table chip counts and payouts, in addition to quick recaps on Ensan and Gates' Day 7 work. You can also review the ongoing attempt from 21-year-old Nick Marchington to become the youngest Main Event winner in the tournament's history. All reports are via WSOP.com.  Chip Counts Entering Final Table First: Hossein Ensan (177,000,000) Second: Garry Gates (99,300,000) Third: Zhen Cai (60,600,000) Fourth: Kevin Maahs (43,000,000) Fifth: Alex Livingston (37,800,000) Sixth: Dario Sammartino (33,400,000) Seventh: Milos Skrbic (23,400,000) Eighth: Timothy Su (20,200,000) Ninth: Nick Marchington (20,100,000)  Prize Money First: $10,000,000 Second: $6,000,000 Third: $4,000,000 Fourth: $3,000,000 Fifth: $2,200,000 Sixth: $1,850,000 Seventh: $1,525,000 Eighth: $1,250,000 Ninth: $1,000,000  Hossein Ensan and Everyone Else Ensan is the favorite heading into the final table after cleaning up on Day 7. The German professional poker player steadily built his chip count throughout the day and had a couple of big wins. First, his AQ was good enough to beat Marcelo Cudos' pocket jacks, giving him a 9,200,000 pot and knocking Cudos out in 23rd ($324,650). Then the hand of the tournament occurred between him and Marchington, who held a sizable lead for much of the day before giving way to Ensan. Ensan flopped two pair, aces and fives. Marchington's 10-2 suited drew blanks, but he kept firing on every street. Following a two on the turn and a six on the river, Ensan earned 40,300,000 more in chips to vault into the lead.  Marchington Maintains Chance to Make History Marchington, a 21-year-old from the United Kingdom playing in his first WSOP Main Event, held a comfortable lead for much of Day 7. He widened the gap between himself in the field thanks largely to a monster hand that eliminated Luke Graham. Marchington put in a cold four-bet to 4.9 million with pocket jacks in the cutoff. Graham responded by shoving all in with AKhh for 11.3 million in the small blind. After it folded back to Marchington, the two went head-to-head for a fat pot. The flop didn't help either player much, but a jack of hearts on the turn gave Marchington trips and Graham a combo draw. The 3h river completed a flush for Graham but gave Marchington a full house. Marchington finished the hand with 64 million in chips, and Graham was sent to the rail in 29th for $261,430. The momentum didn't last, but Marchington is still alive.  Garry Gates Surges into Contention The fan favorite of the Main Event is headed to the final table. Garry Gates has endured tremendous hardship just to make it to the tournament, as he survived the Route 91 concert mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017. He told his story to Lance Bradley of Pocket Fives. The praise for Gates' character can't be missed. Pokernews.com called him ""well-respected in the poker industry for more than a decade,"" and Howard Swain of PokerStars said Gates is one of the ""ultimate good guys."" Big poker names, including 2003 WSOP Main Event winner Chris Moneymaker and Mike McDonald, are in Gates' corner: Can @GarryGates please win the Main Event. I'm not a big believer in karma but my god after so many years of putting up with every single high roller diva in poker my god @GarryGates deserved that ace on the river and 10 million dollars of poker player money that are going to follow! One of Gates' big moments on Day 7 occurred when his A10 beat Mihai Manole's AJ when Manole moved all in preflop after Gates raised, giving him 10,600,000 in chips and eliminating Manole in 18th ($400,000). That cushion helped Gates ride into the final table, and a massive pot versus Ensan helped make him a legit contender for the bracelet when his pocket kings held up against the leader's AK, giving the PokerStars employee 22,400,000 more in chips. He also took 15,400,000 from Timothy Su, who was second before Gates' trip kings won another monster hand. Enjoy our content?

90,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/14/young-voter-money-2020-seth-moulton-has-a-plan-for-your-finances.html," Not every candidate running for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 presidential election makes the debate stage and many good policy ideas miss out on the daily cable news spin cycle — but it is not for a lack of trying. CNBC.com is interviewing presidential candidates this summer to gain insight on their vision and how it can impact the economic outlook for 37% of the 2020 electorate: Millennials and Gen Z. Set to be the first American generations to be worse off than their parents, facing the threat of climate change, and struggling with how to pay for college, money matters matter to young voters in this election. This series is dedicated to giving every single candidate a platform to share their economic vision for America with the voters — and find out whether they prefer Hulu or Netflix. Age: 40 Experience: Current U.S. Congressman for the 6th District of Massachusetts; United States Marine Corps (four tours in Iraq); former managing director of the Texas Central Railway, private high-speed rail company Education: Harvard University, Bachelor of Arts in Physics (2001); Harvard master's degrees in business and public policy; Family: Married (Elizabeth); children (Emmy, almost 1) CNBC: According to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll, 53% of young voters (18-29) believe the government should do more to curb the effects of climate change even if it comes at the expense of the economy. What is one specific way your administration would give a competitive advantage to greener businesses and consumers? Moulton: One of the first things that I would do for climate change is inaugurate my program for Federal Green Corp which would be a climate change national service program and would call on all 33 million young Americans to serve the country and some of them in an AmeriCorps city or other national service programs. But the idea of that Federal Green Corps is that it would put young Americans to work making our country more energy efficient and more climate resilient. That's a great way to bring Americans together and it is one of the best parts of national service. It's a great way to help with education because if you do one to three years of this program, you'll get a federal education guarantee modeled after, after the G.I. Bill. Further, it will help prepare young Americans for the new economy because they'll be working on issues that are critical for the green economy. CNBC: According to Morning Consult, Amazon is Gen Z's fourth-most loved brand. However, politicians from Donald Trump to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have attacked the brand. Is there a disconnect between leaders and young voters surrounding tech companies? Moulton: Well, there's definitely a disconnect when the United States Senate cannot understand how Facebook works. That's one of the reasons why I'm in this race! Tech regulation, the tech economy, it's critical to our future and we can't have a government that's totally out of touch. Specifically for Amazon, I love Amazon, I use Amazon, but I think Amazon should pay more in taxes than I do personally; right now that's not the case. CNBC: The Parkland Students have changed the way Americans discuss gun control. In the wake of mass shooting after mass shooting, would you support a federal buyback program for guns (and if so how would you pay for it)? Moulton: Yes, I support a federal buyback program and in fact I helped implement one in Iraq. I am one of the only candidates in this race who has actual experience, not only having to use guns for my job, but with controlling and implementing gun reform on the ground. There are a lot of ways to to pay for a gun buyback program like this, but the bottom line is it's a good investment for our country because taking guns off the street improves public health. Gun reform is important because guns are a public health issue. Every time there is an instance of gun violence, it costs America a lot of money, not just lives but money. That's how you pay for the program. The program will pay for itself many times over. CNBC: Currently, Americans have $1.5 trillion in outstanding college debt. What is a more realistic option: cancelling student debt or making college tuition free? Moulton: The harsh reality here is that neither is realistic. I know young voters don't like to hear that, but I think young voters deserve the truth. Lack of access to affordable higher education is a real problem in this country and so is the student debt crisis. In my administration, nobody in America will pay more than 10% of their income on student loans, and if you still have loans after 20 years, there'll be forgiven completely. For the families that have the resources to pay for college right now, I don't think all the rest of us should be making their college free with our tax dollars. And we can't forget that 50% of America does not graduate from college. Spending trillions of dollars on free college for the top 50% is not good enough for the whole country. CNBC: According to Gallup, 4/10 Americans embrace some form of socialism. Do you think this is a realistic vision for the future of the American economy? Moulton: No, it's UNAMERICAN. I appreciate the debate and there are some policy lessons to be learned from socialist countries. For example, they generally have better access to health care. However, America's not a socialist country. We're a country that thrives on freedom. We thrive on competition. What we need to do is make sure that we have fair markets that remain free, not markets controlled by the government.

If you were a Gen Z individual entering the workforce, what sector would you enter and why? I would enter the green economy because I think we have a huge opportunity to grow the American economy while also addressing climate change if we are the country that developed all the new technologies to sell to the rest of the world.

92,https://theweek.com/articles/852214/erin-lee-carrs-6-favorite-books,"Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for HBO Erin Lee Carr's new HBO documentary, I Love You, Now Die, revisits a prominent suicide texting case. Her recent memoir, All That You Leave Behind, grapples with the loss of her father and guiding light, former New York Times journalist David Carr. Lit by Mary Karr (2009). I remember reading this profound memoir of alcoholism while I was struggling with substance abuse myself. Because I identified with a lot of Karr's behaviors and thoughts, Lit gave me insight into what was going on inside my brain and body. I loved and hated and appreciated reading it. The Night of the Gun by David Carr (2008). I know I'm biased, but I really believe that The Night of the Gun is a masterpiece of reporting, writing, and portraiture. It's not just an alcoholism and drug memoir; it's also about parenting and a young man becoming an adult and how difficult and painful it is, and what to do when the chips are down. I love how many twists and turns it takes. I don't think anybody knew how to write like my dad. Columbine by Dave Cullen (2009). Cullen's book about the 1999 mass shooting at Colo­rado's Columbine High School is one of the most page-turning reads about mental health you could imagine. The magazine journalist delves into the tragedy and the motivations of the two young men who carried out the deadly assault in their school. I had never read anything like it, and it made me feel differently about how to report and how to be a true-crime storyteller. One of Us by Åsne Seierstad (2013). This is a voluminous but incredible book about the massacre of 77 people in Norway in the summer of 2011. It spends equal time on the victims and the perpetrator, Anders Breivik. Seierstad is so cerebral and yet so empathetic in her rendering of the people who lost their lives. They become individuals, not just victims. Native Son by Richard Wright (1940). I remember zipping through Native Son in college and really being completely undone by all the injustices suffered by the protagonist, a young black man in 1930s Chicago. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë (1847). Brontë's classic novel is a bit of a cliché choice, but Jane Eyre is special to me. And while it's very old-fashioned that marriage is what helps Jane overcome her abusive childhood, the story is really about her coming into herself despite those abuses. You can have complicated feelings about her, but she is a survivor. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

94,https://splinternews.com/a-publisher-apologized-for-running-a-sandy-hook-hoax-bo-1836351184,"The publisher of a book claiming the Sandy Hook shootings were a hoax apologized to Lenny Pozner, the father of one of the victims, several weeks ago, agreed to stop selling the book, and issued a statement saying he believes Pozner’s son Noah did really die in the attack. Shortly after, though, the publisher, Dave Gahary, auctioned off some of the last copies of the book with starting bids at more than twice the normal price. And in a recent conversation with Splinter, Gahary said he still has “questions” about what happened at Sandy Hook. “My views aren’t so set in stone that I can say nobody died at Sandy Hook,” Gahary said. “I just have questions, like everybody else does.” (Most people do not have questions about Sandy Hook, a mass shooting in which 27 people died, 20 of them children, plus the perpetrator.) Pozner, whose son Noah was the youngest victim in the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, won a defamation lawsuit in mid-June against James Fetzer and Mike Palecek, the editors of the book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, which was published by Gahary’s Moon Rock Books. Pozner is the lead plaintiff in at least nine other defamation cases against Sandy Hook hoaxers, according to CBS. Fetzer is an emeritus professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth and a longtime promoter of various conspiracy theories; besides Sandy Hook, he’s called the Holocaust “falsified” and promoted conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination and 9/11. Palecek is a writer in Minnesota who describes himself as a “former federal prisoner for peace.” He’s also so little-known that some news stories about the case misspelled his name. Moon Rock Books publishes conspiracy titles claiming several mass casualty events, including the Parkland shootings and the Boston Marathon bombings, were all false flags. A judge in Wisconsin issued a summary judgment against Fetzer and Palecek in mid-June; at the same time, in a settlement agreement that remains partially confidential, Gahary agreed to stop selling Nobody Died at Sandy Hook after June 30. (In response, Fetzer said that “my day in court did not turn out as expected,” and continued to insist that one of the pieces of evidence in his book was true.) The two sides came to the agreement, Gahary told Splinter, when he traveled to Wisconsin from the Florida Panhandle  to be deposed in the lawsuit (though his deposition ultimately didn’t happen). “I was 100 percent sure [Pozner] wasn’t going to show up,” Gahary said. But Pozner did, and Gahary was in the room to watch his deposition. In the process, he says, something changed for him. “One of the things that struck me was how gracious Lenny was to come there and answer all the questions,” Gahary said. Seeing him for many hours over a period of a few days, he added, “It was easy to come to the conclusion that the odds someone would be lying about this were very low. So I shook his hand, I apologized and said ‘If there’s anything I have done to contribute to your misery, let me know what I can do to minimize that.’” Gahary and Pozner and their lawyers ultimately came to an agreement that Moon Rock Books would stop selling the books on June 30; both sides say that other settlement terms remain confidential. As has been widely reported, Gahary also issued a statement apologizing to the Pozner family, saying in part: “My face-to-face interactions with Mr. Pozner have led me to believe that Mr. Pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son. I extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the Pozner family. As a result, Moon Rock Books has decided to discontinue publishing and selling Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.” (The rest of the statement can be read in full at The Wrap.) The story could’ve tidily ended there, but it didn’t. Those heartfelt and sincere apologies didn’t mean that Moon Rock didn’t rush to sell out what suddenly became a hot, rare commodity. On June 23, they sent out an email blast announcing that slightly damaged copies of the book would be sold for half-price. Then, just before June 30, Gahary and Moon Rock Books auctioned off 10 copies of the first edition of the book, with starting bids at $50. (Gahary said that black-and-white versions of the book ordinary went for $20 and color for $30.) “The $50 [amount] was arrived at arbitrarily,” Gahary said. “We thought that instead of selling it for $100, let’s say, that we would put it out in an auction arena, an auction format and let people decide what the fair market value was of that, and I think they did.” Gahary said he felt fine about the decision to sell the book for as long as possible, despite his conversation with Pozner. “I didn’t have any discomfort selling the book,” he said. “I don’t have any discomfort selling these type of books because I think it’s up to the individual to make the decision. That’s the healthy thing that people should do. If they’re revolted by such a topic, that’s fine, that’s their feeling. If they’re excited about such a topic, that somebody’s talking about it and putting their thoughts down on paper into book form, that’s fine as well. I don’t really have any emotions when it comes to this, other than the emotion that people should never be restricted as to what they should be able to read. And I think that’s the overriding feeling that I have about all this. But it’s not that I ever wanted to hurt anybody’s feelings. That’s what I told him when I met him.” In the end, Gahary said, the books all sold, one for more than $100. “What’s important was that decision was made and the books aren’t being sold anymore,” he said. He added that he wouldn’t sell another Sandy Hook book “because of my interactions with Lenny.” “I would say no,” he said. “When I decide something I don’t change my mind. I’m never going to be compromised. I’m never going to have a lot of money. That’s the way I am. I sleep well at night. I don’t hurt anything. I don’t even kill insects. And I wouldn’t do it because I made him a promise and I’m a man of my word.” But despite his newfound admiration for Pozner, Gahary also indicated to Splinter that he still has “questions” about Sandy Hook and the other parents and families whose children also died. In our conversation, he referenced a YouTube video popular among Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists that supposedly shows a Sandy Hook father “laughing” when he “thought he was off-camera,” as Gahary put it. (The videos are implying the father was an actor.) “I know that many people have the same feeling, that this event in Sandy Hook is rather odd,” he added. “It’s not that I came to the conclusion that nobody died at Sandy Hook or that people did die at Sandy Hook. My position is that I wasn’t there. I don’t have firsthand knowledge. The government and the media have done many things historically, they have lied... That’s just a fact. For anybody to actually believe the government unequivocally and immediately and the mainstream media, they’re idiots. Why would you do that?” Gahary continues to insist he can’t possibly know what really happened at Sandy Hook, not yet. “When I met Lenny I could only make a determination based on him,” he said. “Not the rest of the parents. Maybe if I met the rest of the parents, my views would change.” In a statement, Jacob Zimmerman, Pozner’s lawyer, told Splinter: The Court’s ruling represents a clear and unequivocal victory for the Pozner family and for Noah’s memory. It is also a victory for the other families who lost children at Sandy Hook and that have been harassed for years by these conspiracy theorists. But the decision has much wider implications. It is a victory for the people of Newtown and the surrounding communities that have had to live with hoaxers and their incessant accusations.  Finally, it is a victory for truth in a world that has been overrun by “alternative facts.”  Mr. Pozner’s courage in bringing this case has led to a ruling that affirms the reality of the Sandy Hook tragedy and is a first step in protecting the memory of those that died that day.

95,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/604515972/0/phoenix/nation~Penal-farm-to-produce-farm-music-under-the-sea-News-from-around-our-states/,"Dothan: A sizable increase in a state education fund is allowing local school systems to pay for school resource officers and maintenance projects, among other things. The Dothan Eagle reports the money is available after Gov. Kay Ivey this year signed off on the largest education budget to date, topping $7 billion. The Education Trust Fund Advancement and Technology Fund was appropriated $199 million – far more than last year’s $41 million appropriation. The newspaper reports most of that money is designated for school districts around the state. Anchorage: The state is a tourism destination for a growing number of visitors from China. The Anchorage Daily News reports Alaska received relatively little notice from Chinese travelers until recent years. The number of Chinese visitors has jumped because of social media and increasing interest in winter tourism tied to the Aurora borealis. State figure show an estimated 5,000 Chinese travelers visited Alaska in 2016, compared with 2,000 in 2011. A similar count has not been attempted since then, but travel industry representatives estimate at least 10,000 Chinese travelers visited the state in 2018. Sarah Leonard, executive director of the Alaska Travel Industry Association, says that “China is definitely the emerging market right now.” Minghui Dong, a Beijing nurse and tour guide, says through an interpreter that Alaska left a “beautiful impression” on her. Phoenix: Someone has paid to put up billboards in the city suggesting a possible 2020 Maricopa County sheriff run for Joe Arpaio. But it’s unclear who is behind the signs, and Arpaio, now 87, says he hasn’t decided whether he’ll run – or even which seat he’s considering. But he seemed to tease something on Twitter recently, saying he supported Trump’s “immigration raids,” and “I plan on returning to my fight against crime and immigration. Stay tuned.” In 2016 Arpaio was ousted from his position as sheriff after 24 years. In 2017, he was convicted of criminal contempt of court and then pardoned by President Donald Trump. In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for U.S Senate, losing in the Republican primary. The billboard, which depicts a picture of Arpaio in his uniform, says, “Sheriff Joe One More Time 2020.” Arpaio says he doesn’t know anything about the billboards or who paid for them. Fayetteville: The nonprofit group building and repairing most of the soft-surface trails in the city wants to put more miles of trail at Kessler Mountain, possibly on land designated for conservation. Ozark Off-Road Cyclists, whose volunteers have dedicated thousands of hours to maintain trails throughout northwest Arkansas, is in the middle of a fundraising campaign to expand the trail system. Kessler’s green space features trails for hiking and mountain biking, with soccer and baseball fields at the park side. The group bought 40 acres southwest of the city-owned land in 2017 for $280,000, according to Washington County property records. A grant from the Walton Family Foundation made the purchase possible, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. San Francisco: State regulators say Chevron has not done enough to stop a massive oil spill that dumped about 800,000 gallons of crude oil and water into a Kern County canyon, and they want the company to take further action to halt the flow. The seep out of the ground where Chevron injects steam to extract oil has been happening on and off since May. The state has issued Chevron a notice of violation ordering it to stop steam injections around the area where the seep was occurring. Chevron said the last flow was last Tuesday. KQED reports regulators took a further step Friday by ordering the company to completely stop the flow and prevent any new releases. Chevron said it will review the order and work with involved agencies. Loveland: Wildlife inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats infested with invasive mussels as they try to keep the economically damaging shellfish from entering state waters. The Loveland Reporter-Herald reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife has found 51 boats with mussels so far this season across the state. That’s the same number for all of 2018. Officials say most of the boats were coming from Utah’s Lake Powell. Invasive mussels can quickly spread, displacing native species and damaging water supply and irrigation systems. The shellfish are found in water bodies of surrounding states including Utah, Kansas and Nebraska. Officials urge boat owners to clean and drain their boats before putting them into state waters. Hartford: A man who was among the engineers working at Hamilton Standard in the 1960s developing the lunar module for the Apollo 11 mission is being honored by the Connecticut Science Center. Tuesday’s tribute to Ed O’Connor, a longtime science center volunteer, is one of numerous activities and exhibits planned throughout July at the Hartford attraction to mark the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. O’Connor also developed many life support system technologies while working in the space program. Organizers plan to kick things off Tuesday with the unveiling of a Connecticut state flag that has traveled to the International Space Station aboard the space shuttle Atlantis in September 2000. There will also be an Apollo-era space suit and real moon rock on display in the permanent “Exploring Space” Gallery. Wilmington: Creators of a new urban farm are aiming to provide jobs for former prisoners through the business of growing produce inside empty commercial or industrial buildings. Second Chances Farm plans to sell organic, pesticide-free lettuce, basil, kale and strawberries. The plants will grow hydroponically, under LED lights in rows stacked in a shelflike structure with a closed-loop watering system. The result is higher yields per square foot than traditional farms and a controlled environment to produce year-round fresh greens for local restaurants and supermarkets. CEO Ajit George, a former real estate developer, plans to hire farmers using “the opposite of a background check” – they must be people who have served time in prison. The farm will provide job training, a $15-an-hour wage and the opportunity after one year to gain ownership in the company. Washington: Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton says the first hearing for D.C. statehood has been postponed, WUSA-TV reports. She requested to reschedule the hearing, originally set for July 24, because special counsel Robert Mueller will testify before House committees that day. “Our statehood hearing is essential to move our bill to passage, but it serves another important purpose as well,” Norton said in a press release Saturday. “This hearing will inform people of what most do not know – that the residents of their nation’s capital do not have full voting rights in the House and have no representation in the Senate.” According to Norton, the bill has a record 213 voting co-sponsors, and more than 100 groups have endorsed it. This hearing, now likely to happen in September, will be the first House hearing on D.C. statehood in 26 years. Big Pine Key: Divers and snorkelers gathered underwater over the weekend to listen to music and coral reef protection messages in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The Lower Keys Underwater Music Festival was staged Saturday at Looe Key Reef, an area of the sanctuary about 6 miles south of Big Pine Key. The event encourages environmentally responsible diving and preservation of the world’s coral reefs. Music and public service announcements were featured in the four-hour broadcast by a local radio station that was delivered underwater via speakers suspended beneath boats above the reef. Divers and snorkelers enjoyed ocean-themed songs including the Beatles’ “Yellow Submarine,” Jimmy Buffett’s “Fins” and the theme from “The Little Mermaid.” Atlanta: The Georgia Lottery is reporting record-breaking annual profits used to pay for educational programs. Gov. Brian Kemp’s office says the lottery transferred more than $1.2 billion into the state’s account that funds HOPE scholarships and free pre-kindergarten for 4 year olds. The profits are for the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30. Kemp says it’s the largest transfer of funds for education in the lottery’s 26-year history. The lottery has raised more than $21 billion total for education programs during that time. Kemp says the news marks “a record-breaking investment in our students, workforce and economy.” State officials say it’s the fourth consecutive year that Georgia Lottery profits have exceeded $1 billion. Mauna Kea: Hundreds of demonstrators have been gathering at the base of Hawaii’s tallest mountain to protest the construction of a giant telescope on land that some Native Hawaiians consider sacred. State and local officials sought to close the road to the summit of Mauna Kea on Monday morning to allow trucks carrying construction equipment to make their way to the top. Officials said anyone breaking the law would be prosecuted. Scientists hope the massive telescope they plan for the site – a world-renowned location for astronomy – will help them peer back to the time just after the Big Bang and answer fundamental questions about the universe. But some Native Hawaiians consider the land holy, as a realm of gods and a place of worship. Groups of activists sang and prayed at the base of the mountain Sunday afternoon. Boise: Federal wildland firefighting authorities are increasing mental health resources following an apparent increase in firefighter suicides in recent years. Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise say it’s difficult to track the number of suicides because many federal agencies can’t tally fatalities outside of work hours, and some families don’t want the cause released. But officials say there appears to be a jump in known suicides, so efforts are being boosted to get wildland firefighters help. Experts say the high-intensity camaraderie of the wildfire season can be followed by months of isolation in the offseason and sometimes money concerns without a steady paycheck. Chicago: A transgender woman who just got out of prison says she’ll continue to fight for the rights of other transgender inmates now that she’s free. Deon “Strawberry” Hampton, of Chicago, was released last week from Logan Correctional Center, which houses female inmates outside Lincoln. She was serving a 10-year sentence for burglary. She maintains her innocence. She battled the Illinois Department of Corrections to be moved from a men’s to a women’s prison because she said she faced sexual assault, taunting and beatings in male prisons. She was moved in December to the women’s prison in Logan County. She told the Chicago Sun-Times on Wednesday that she has two ongoing lawsuits against the department. A department spokeswoman says the department can’t comment on Hampton’s allegations because of pending litigation. Indianapolis: Eighteen years ago, the state was a leader in tobacco prevention funding, one of only six to match budget recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Today, Indiana spends about one-tenth of what the CDC recommends on tobacco control. And, some would argue, this has been the result: Indiana maintains the seventh-highest smoking rate in the country, a reality that annually costs Hoosiers an estimated nearly $3 billion in health care costs and more than 10,000 lives. A series of legislative decisions has cut Indiana’s yearly funding for tobacco prevention and cessation more than 78% since 2001. Over that same time, the portion of adults who smoke has only dropped about 6%. Des Moines: The Warren Morrow Latin Music Festival will be held Saturday at the Brenton Skating Plaza downtown. One of the best-known figures in cumbia music, Celso Pina, a Mexican accordion player and singer, will make his Iowa debut at the festival. In 2002, Pina was nominated for two Latin Grammy Awards and for Best Alternative Artist by the MTV Latino Awards. He is known by the nicknames El Rebelde del Acordeon and El Cacique de la Campana. “He’s played all over the world, so to get him booked for our festival is a huge deal,” says Goizane Esain Mullin, a festival organizer. Pina incorporates rhythms from his Mexican roots and sounds he’s heard on his travels throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Even though Pina is from Mexico, cumbia’s roots are Colombian – fitting, as Colombian Independence Day falls on the same day as the festival. Wichita: The Wichita Police Department expects to put Clydesdale horses on patrol for the first time later this summer thanks to two nonprofit civic foundations. The pair of Clydesdales will replace two horses that soon will be retired. The yet-to-be named Clydesdales from a Goddard farm are in training. The Wichita Eagle reports that they’re scheduled to make their public debut Aug. 7 in the farmers market in the historic Old Town district downtown. One horse can provide as much crowd control as 15 officers on foot. Clydesdales are larger and more stable for mounted officers than the quarter horses the department currently uses. They also are calmer and more social. But the police department didn’t have the $40,000 for two new horses and their saddles and kit, requiring private fundraising. Frankfort: Gov. Matt Bevin will call the General Assembly into special session at 8 a.m. Friday to consider his proposal to give relief to local health departments, regional state universities and other quasi-governmental groups from soaring pension costs they are required to pay starting this month. The affected groups saw a nearly 70% increase in their pension costs effective July 1. The General Assembly passed a bill in March giving these groups relief from the increase, but Bevin vetoed it because he said it had an incorrect effective date and contained an illegal provision. Bevin said in April that he would call a special session to pass an improved version of the bill. Bevin released his proposal more than two months ago and has been working since then to secure sufficient votes to assure it passes. Baton Rouge: A 75-year-old woman who founded an African American history museum was discovered dead in the trunk of a car, and police say investigators are working diligently to find those responsible. Baton Rouge police Sgt. L’Jean McKneely said over the weekend that investigators were still waiting for a coroner to determine a cause of death for Sadie Roberts-Joseph after her body was found Friday afternoon. The Advocate reports Roberts-Joseph was the founder and curator of the Baton Rouge African American Museum, which she started in 2001. The museum sits on the campus of New St. Luke Baptist Church, where Roberts-Joseph’s brother is pastor. “Ms. Sadie was a tireless advocate of peace,” the Baton Rouge Police Department posted on its Facebook page. Westbrook: Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill that eliminates the requirement to have a motorcycle license to operate autocycles, a cross between a car and motorcycle. Some potential buyers had been turned off by the prospect of going through the process of getting a motorcycle license to operate something that drives like a car with a steering wheel and foot pedals. States are making progress in regulating autocycles. The National Conference of State Legislatures says more than 40 states now have definitions for them. Centerville: Lawmakers in Queen Anne’s County are considering a bill that would outlaw balloon releases and impose a $250 fine on those who ignore the mandate. The bill wouldn’t penalize accidental releases or those done by government agencies. The Queen Anne’s Conservation Association’s executive director, Jay Falstad, says creatures often mistake nonbiodegradable balloons as food or get fatally trapped and wounded by balloon ribbons. Local farmers say loose balloons also cause problems on their lands, with the items scaring animals and getting wrapped around equipment. Cape Cod: Great white sharks have been spotted at three area beaches. The Cape Cod Times reports that three beaches were briefly closed Saturday after confirmed sightings of great white sharks. Police and fire authorities say the sharks were seen by the Head of the Meadow Beach and Coast Guard Beach in Truro and at Nauset Beach in Orleans. Researchers on Cape Cod launched a study last month focused on the hunting and feeding habits of the region’s great white sharks following last year’s two attacks on humans, including the state’s first fatal one in more than 80 years. Lansing: Health officials are urging people to take precautions to avoid swine flu at county and local fairs across the state. Swine influenza is a respiratory disease in pigs that’s caused by type A influenza viruses. Swine flu viruses don’t usually infect humans, but human infections have been reported. Precautions to help avoid swine flu include refraining from eating or drinking in livestock barns or show rings. Symptoms in people are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever, sore throat and respiratory difficulty. Duluth: A young couple remains hospitalized after surviving a collision with a half-ton bull moose on a dark highway. Amaya Nelson, 17, was behind the wheel July 7 with her boyfriend, Remington Dellinger, 22, in the seat beside her when they crashed into moose with their small car. Amaya’s father, Scott Nelson, tells the Star Tribune his daughter had multiple skull fractures and numerous broken bones in her face, yet managed to crawl up the hill and call 911. He says she has undergone facial reconstruction at a Duluth hospital, where she remains in intensive care. Dellinger is in the same hospital with head, neck and arm injuries. Biloxi: This Gulf Coast city is suing a federal agency that rejected expenses for a Hurricane Katrina recovery project. The Sun Herald reports Biloxi is seeking $15.5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for drainage, water and sewer systems. The lawsuit says FEMA rejected $8.8 million in project management expenses the agency had previously approved and helped develop. FEMA also said it won’t cover $6.7 million the city says it needs for project management. FEMA is rejecting the costs because a 2015 audit concluded Biloxi awarded a $21 million project management contract without considering cost. Biloxi said the project would take four years when design work started in 2008. The lawsuit says work won’t be finished until December 2024 – more than 19 years after Katrina. Springfield: The L-A-D Foundation, one of the state’s largest private landowners, plans to ban feral hog hunting on its property and instead trap large groups of hogs, the Springfield News-Leader reports. The foundation is dedicated to preserving land once logged too aggressively and owns 147,000 acres in southeast Missouri, much of it adjoining the Mark Twain National Forest. The state Department of Conservation once encouraged people to shoot feral hogs on sight but now believes trapping is more effective. Hamilton: Logging work has commenced in a project intended to thin wooded areas that could provide fuel for wildfires. The Ravalli Republic reports loggers have started thinning about 5 square miles of dense forest in the area of the Bitterroot River. The Meadow Vapor project will split the work area, and the timber will be sold in two sales to area mills for various uses. The project focuses on removing diseased and smaller trees and leaving old-growth ponderosa pine and Douglas fir behind. Fires burned large areas of the region in 2000. The Bitterroot Community Wildfire Protection Plan has identified the area with an estimated 255 homes as a high priority for reduction of potential wildfire fuel. Fort Calhoun: A traveling Smithsonian exhibit about the history of Native Americans in the U.S. military is on display at Fort Atkinson State Historical Park. “Patriot Nations: Native Americans in Our Nation’s Armed Forces” tells the story of the American Indian and Alaska Native men and women who served the country in every major U.S. military encounter since the Revolutionary War. “Patriot Nations” will be on display through Sept. 2 in the Harold W. Andersen Visitor Center. Reno: Authorities say strong winds blew an inflatable bounce house with three children inside into power lines, causing electricity to be temporarily cut off to thousands of people. The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office says the bounce house was uplifted about 10 feet and got caught on the lines Sunday afternoon. Deputies and firefighters rescued the children, treating two at the scene and taking the third to a hospital. The child’s condition was not immediately known. NV Energy says about 3,000 people were affected by the outage. Electricity was restored about 2 hours later. Jaffrey: Two towns are considering a plan to share their drinking water. New Hampshire Public Radio reports Peterborough and Jaffrey would buy a 500-acre parcel of land so they can manage a group of wells on the property for their municipal water systems. The towns have received approval from state environmental regulators to pump 577,000 gallons of water each day, far more than the 200,000 gallons they expect to pump. The move comes amid fears the towns might face water shortages. One of the wells in Peterborough has industrial toxins and can’t be used, while Jaffrey is expecting a spike in demand due to the expansion of a pharmaceutical company in town. Peterborough voters have approved money for the project. Jaffrey voters will consider it in March. Teaneck: The Township Council has voted to form an advisory board to address LGBTQ issues and build a culture of acceptance and inclusiveness. The move comes after a long debate last month on whether to raise a pride flag on the municipal green. The flag was not raised; instead, the council issued a proclamation that recognized June as Pride Month and commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The Pride Advisory Board was approved with a first vote last week. A second and final vote is scheduled for next month. Many residents had urged the council to raise the rainbow flag to recognize the contributions of LGBTQ residents and demonstrate Teaneck’s commitment to inclusiveness. But John Shahdanian, the township attorney, had advised officials that raising the flag of one group could expose the township to a lawsuit. Albuquerque: Hundreds of items representing centuries of New Mexico history will be on display as part of a new exhibit at the Albuquerque Museum, from letters written by outlaw Billy the Kid to more contemporary objects that are part of the Palace of the Governors extensive collection. The Albuquerque Museum’s curator of art, Josie Lopez, tells Albuquerque television station KRQE that the exhibit is like a journey through time that starts with the 1700s. The letters by Billy the Kid involve him wanting to testify in exchange for his freedom about a killing he witnessed. Lopez says one letter was written just months before the outlaw wound up killed. Other pieces include an old penny farthing bicycle and classic dresses. The exhibit runs through Oct. 20. Albany: The state has expanded laws against racial bias to include hairstyles and hair texture. The bill aims to ensure no employee can be fired or passed over for a job because of racially biased criticism of their hair. The change to the state’s human rights law, approved by lawmakers this year, was signed into law Friday by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Supporters say minorities often face discrimination that’s couched in criticism of their hair texture or style. Specifically, the change adds to the legal definition of race to say it includes traits historically associated with race, including hair texture and styles. The change would also prohibit racial discrimination by teachers or school employees against a student based on their hair texture or style. Kinston: Local chef Vivian Howard, known for the award-winning PBS series “A Chef’s Life,” is returning to PBS next year. News outlets report Howard will be the host of a show titled “South by Somewhere.” The six-part series will explore the intersection of Southern food with the cuisines of other cultures. During its five seasons on the air, “A Chef’s Life” focused on Howard and the restaurant that she and her husband, Ben Knight, own in Kinston. Williston: The state’s Health Department says an estimated 21,000 gallons of oil-field wastewater have spilled from a pipeline near the city, and some of it entered an unnamed tributary to the Missouri River. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says the spill occurred about 20 miles east of Williston and about a mile from Lake Sakakawea, the largest reservoir on the Missouri River. Suess says it does not appear the spill reached the lake. He says the pipeline has been shut down, and the spill area has been dammed. Port Clinton: Experts are puzzled over the explosion of the walleye population in Lake Erie, but anglers pursuing the state’s most popular fish couldn’t be happier. Fisheries experts at the Ohio Division of Wildlife say the bountiful supply of walleye in recent years is difficult to explain, but the $800 million state sport fishing industry has benefited greatly. The Plain Dealer reports that after a decades-old roller coaster ride with the walleye population, the number caught in the U.S. waters of Lake Erie nearly increased from 417,000 in 2011 to almost 2 million in 2018. Ohio banned commercial walleye fishing in the late 1960s to allow the Lake Erie population to recover. With the popularity and economic value of sport fishing for walleye, it is unlikely that will change. Oklahoma City: Local businesswoman Anna King has been elected president of the National Parent Teacher Association for a term starting in 2021. King co-owns a mobile catering business and has served as president of the Oklahoma PTA, Oklahoma City PTA Council and Douglass Mid-High School PTSA, as well as in several executive positions at the national level. She’s the first national president from Oklahoma since Pat Henry, who served from 1991 to 1993. King has three children and says it takes everybody for schools to be successful. Mount Hood: The region’s wolf population is continuing to grow. Six new wolf pups were born to the White River Pack this year, according to footage from a trail cam put up by biologists with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and shared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The White River Pack is located just southeast of Mount Hood and east of popular Timothy Lake. With five members in 2018, it was one of the few confirmed packs in Western Oregon. Now it appears the pack is growing. “It’s thrilling to hear the call of the wild from these adorable wolf puppies, in a part of Oregon that’s been missing this vibrant sound for more than 70 years,” says Amaroq Weiss, senior West Coast wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney has asked the police department to increase its presence at parks and recreation events following the second mass shooting in a month at a city playground. On Saturday night, two men opened fire at a crowded playground where a cookout and basketball tournament were taking place. Police said seven people were wounded. On Father’s Day weekend, a 24-year-old man was killed and five people were wounded at a playground in another part of the city. Providence: A University of Rhode Island economics professor says the state’s economy has “downshifted into first gear.” Leonard Lardaro says that although seven of 12 indicators he tracks with his Current Conditions Index have shown improvement, none is particularly strong except for retail sales. Lardaro says that after a significant, temporary contraction in February, the state’s economy remains where it has been since March. Lardaro no longer believes the state might be entering an early stage of recession but says its tepid economic performance is cause for concern. Charleston: The Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the Hutchinson House on Edisto Island and the South Carolina African American Heritage Foundation have been selected as recipients of a combined $285,000 in grants by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in an initiative to preserve African American historical sites. Representatives from Emanuel AME and the Hutchinson House say they’ll use the money for big-dollar restoration projects. The Foundation says it’ll develop a five-year sustainability plan with the grant. Founded in 1816, Emmanuel AME is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. It was the site of a 2015 mass shooting of nine black worshippers. The Hutchison house was a post-Civil War gathering space for the black community. Sioux Falls: Dozens of workers were left jobless when a Minnesota-based trucking company with local operations abruptly closed Thursday. When LME Inc. shuttered more than 40 terminals with almost no notice last week, 600 workers in communities across the region were affected. In Sioux Falls, roughly 30 dock workers, truck drivers and clerical workers were affected, says Shawn Mason, a former employee. The closure and layoffs come after LME Inc. was instructed in June by a federal judge to pay out $1.25 million to former employees of Lakeville Motor Express, a company the judge called an “alter ego” of LME Inc., which has the same owners. The judge issued a cease-and-desist order forbidding the owners from creating additional shell companies to avoid responsibilities. Gatlinburg: A mama black bear charged at a man who repeatedly approached her and her cubs at Cades Cove over the weekend, viral video footage shows. The man emerged unharmed but is being excoriated online for coming within feet of the bear family at the popular tourist destination in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. “Honestly I really thought the dude was going to die,” says local Paige Marple, whose cellphone video of the encounter racked up thousands of shares on Facebook. Several visitors lobbed insults at the man, who was nowhere to be found after the encounter, Marple said. It’s unclear whether officials have identified the man or would pursue charges. Park regulations ban tourists from knowingly coming within 50 yards of a bear. The federal misdemeanor charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a $5,000 fine. Houston: Spanish. Vietnamese. French. German. Hungarian, even. The Houston Chronicle reports animal shelters and dog trainers in the area say they’ve encountered pets that respond to commands in these languages and more. The languages to which the animals respond reflect the diversity of Harris County, says Kerry McKeel, a spokesperson for the Harris County Animal Shelter. A 2015 analysis of census data found 145 different languages are spoken in Houston. She says staff members do not have time to retrain the animals in English, so the shelter would likely encourage new pet owners to seek out private trainers for their animals to learn commands in English if needed. Heber City: Signs of new life are appearing in a spot where a wildfire torched more than 100 square miles a year ago. Grasses and flowers are returning to the area in northeastern Utah, with blue and yellow wildflowers blooming around the trunks of trees charred by the blaze, the Daily Herald reports. Aspens with gradient burns along their trunks grew on dark, charred mountainsides speckled with patches of new green growth. “It’s night and day difference,” says Miles Hanberg, the northeast region supervisor for the Utah Department of Natural Resources. A portion of the burn area has been re-seeded, but rest has grown back naturally, fed by seeds that survived the quick-moving blaze. Other vegetation, such as trees and sagebrush, is expected to take longer to fully return. As for wildlife, most animals didn’t leave during the fire, and those that did quickly came back. Montpelier: The city council has rejected a call supported by local businesses for a “no loitering” ordinance designed to move the homeless off the streets. The Times-Argus reports local landlord David Kelley’s call was dismissed by Montpelier City Council last Wednesday. After consulting with police, the council says the call was legally unenforceable unless laws were being broken. Kelley and some local businesses in the area are concerned the homeless are blocking business entrances, engaging in aggressive panhandling and drug dealing. But other local residents and city representatives have spoken in favor of efforts to support the homeless population. The council agreed to take immediate action in establishing a task force that includes the homeless to address the issue. Richmond: The state is trying to protect its longest river by launching a new program to plant 900 acres of trees, shrubs and other vegetation along waterways. Gov. Ralph Northam has announced an initiative to plant forested buffers in the James River watershed between Lynchburg and Richmond. The Virginia Department of Forestry is partnering with the James River Association on the project, which is part of a $15 million, multiyear plan to improve the river’s quality. The buffers slow flood water, filter runoff, and provide shade and shelter to wildlife. The 340-mile-long James is fed by 15,000 miles of tributaries. Eligible property owners can apply online for free buffers and installation. Bremerton: A dilapidated fishing dock and deteriorating boat launch will be replaced under a $1.6 million facelift planned for Kitsap Lake Park. The facilities have outlived their life expectancy, says Jeff Elevado, Bremerton Parks and Recreation director. Other improvements to the park will include upgrades to the restroom, seating improvements along the lake, improvements in parkways and pathways that will make the park more accessible to people with disabilities, a new picnic shelter, and more. The improvements will be paid for in part with two grants from the state Recreation and Conservation Funding Board totaling $994,400. That money will be matched with other local and state funding. Logan: A state parks initiative is creating habitat for monarch butterflies. Chief Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole told the Charleston Gazette-Mail she has spent the past two years trying to make the park a more attractive place for butterflies, honeybees and other desirable insects. The Pollinator Habitat Expansion Initiative involves mowing less and planting varieties of milkweed, clover, ironweed, wingstem, columbine, joe pye weed and two-leaved toothwort. Cole says the first spring after planting, there were monarchs and caterpillars using the milkweed, and this year there are “plenty of monarchs.” Greenville: A ram that has been spotted ambling through rural Outagamie County the past several days is no longer on the run. The Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office said in a Thursday Facebook post that the animal is safe, and a local zoo has stepped forward to give him a home. Mackville resident Debbie Reed says she was surprised by the ram at her home Tuesday afternoon when she was going to get clothespins and saw the animal standing in her garage. Gillette: Cloud Peak Energy says it has hired some of the miners put out of work by Blackjewel’s bankruptcy proceedings. Cloud Peak said Friday that it has hired about 60 Blackjewel workers who will start work Tuesday at its Cordero Rojo and Antelope mines in northeastern Wyoming. Cloud Peak filed for bankruptcy itself in May, but its Wyoming mines and its Spring Creek mine in Montana have remained open.

Radio New Zealand said some residents living near the proposed site were upset at the prospect of the 300 sq metres (3,229 sq ft) store, which opens in August.  “I don’t think many people will be very comfortable to have guns around their homes in a residential area,” said one of the residents, Harry Singh. Gun City did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The location is just over half a mile from the racetrack where New Zealand held its first firearms buyback on Saturday, four months after the country’s worst peacetime mass shooting. The accused gunman bought four weapons and ammunition between December 2017 and March 2018, the Gun City owner, David Tipple, said in March. There is no suggestion there was anything improper about the sale. Brenton Tarrant, who is to stand trial in May, has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges related to the attacks, including New Zealand’s first terrorism charge. Tipple told Radio New Zealand he was sorry some people were concerned about the new store, but the chain was “willing and happy to introduce those persons to the positives of firearms”. A gun reform law passed in April bars the circulation and use of most semi-automatic weapons, parts to convert firearms into semi-automatics, magazines over a certain capacity and some shotguns. The government has allotted NZ$208m (£112m) for buybacks nationwide to compensate gunowners who surrender banned weapons. Police took in 224 firearms on Saturday, with 22 similar events scheduled this week. With a population of just under 5 million and an estimated 1.5m firearms, New Zealand ranks 17th in the world civilian gun ownership per capita, the Small Arms Survey shows.",2019-07-17 05:57:50,Plan to open gun megastore in Christchurch prompts concern,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
98,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/1854740?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"In response to Joe Biden entering the presidential race by coming directly at Donald Trump with an attack on his shitty-ass response to the white supremacist riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, and his “very fine people” crack, Trump has come up with a brand new attempt at alt-reality, claiming that not only was there nothing wrong with what he said in response, but that what he said was just perfect. “If you look at what I said, you will see that question was answered perfectly,” Trump said outside the White House before heading to Indiana for a National Rifle Association event. “And I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general.” “Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals,” Trump continued. “I’ve spoken to many generals here right at the White House, and many people thought of the generals, they think he was maybe their favorite general. People were there protesting the taking down of the monument of Robert E. Lee. Everybody knows that.” Daughter-in-law Lara Trump has taken this argument so far as to claim that it’s Joe Biden who was “race-baiting.” Lara Trump denounced the[Biden] announcement as simple ""race-baiting"" with little substance or proposals for Americans. Though Biden will inarguably present himself as the most electable, most moderate, Lara Trump says he is now radicalized like Bernie Sanders. ""When you look at things like Bernie Sanders running on socialism … when he claims that the Boston Marathon bombers should have the right to vote — that is so far outside what I think most Americans can back."" There were actual live, breathing neo-Nazis marching in the streets, beating people and running them down with their cars, and this silly woman says that it’s Joe Biden who is race-baiting? On top of this nonsense, you’ve had Kellyanne the Conjobber slap even more delusion grease on the wood pile. WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR Kellyanne Conway defended President Donald Trump's controversial remarks about the 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Va., as Conway argued that Trump's comments have been distorted and misunderstood. She told CNN Sunday that Trump ""condemned white nationalism and neo-Nazis and the KKK during the Charlottesville incident."" Conway conceded that Trump said there were ""very fine people on both sides."" But she argued that the president ""was talking about the debate over removing statues,"" notably a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Conway said, ""When President Trump condemned racism, bigotry, evil violence, and then took it many steps further and called out neo-Nazis, white supremacists, KKK--that is darn near perfection."" In addition to Conway’s “darn near perfection” claims, Real Clear Politics has decided to defend Trump’s statement as well by claiming that he wasn’t calling the “neo-Nazis” the “very fine people.” He was supposedly talking about someone else, somewhere. My colleagues seem prepared to dispute our own network’s correct contemporaneous reporting and the very clear transcripts of the now-infamous Trump Tower presser on the tragic events of Charlottesville.  Here are the unambiguous actual words of President Trump: “Excuse me, they didn’t put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group.  But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.  You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures you did.  You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.” After another question at that press conference, Trump became even more explicit:   Exactly where were the “not-Nazis” during this event who were the “fine people?” Everyone not wearing one of these uniforms during the event was essentially a counter-protester. If you weren’t in proper garb, the neo-Nazis knew you weren’t on their side, and that’s how they knew who to attack.   Besides Heather Heyer and other protesters who were injured, there was a “tiki torch parade” the night before the main protest, and a librarian on the University of Virginia staff was beaten with torches until he suffered a stroke. University of Virginia employee Tyler Magill, 46, was hit in the neck when he rushed to join students who were surrounded by torch-wielding white nationalists Friday — and suffered a stroke due to blunt force trauma on Tuesday, the Chronicle of Higher Education reports. Magill, who works at the university library, locked arms with students at a statue of Thomas Jefferson on campus Friday night to protest the marchers chanting racist slogans. “I was just thinking, be with them,” he said in an interview before the stroke. “I linked arms with them and they were on us, frothing … liquid splashed on us and then torches.” So, were the ones who beat Tyler Magill the “very fine people”? It may have happened two whole years ago, but for the sake of retaining some semblance of sanity, I also have to stop and point out that these people may be correct in noting that Trump did eventually condemn “neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others.” But he actually didn’t do that until his third try. Trump’s first try, on the day after the attack, was basically delivered as a virtual hostage video where he stood stone-faced and read a prepared statement that didn't even mention neo-Nazis at all. Instead, he said there was violence “on many sides, many sides.”  At a podium, Trump read a statement rebuking the violence, but without specifically mentioning or faulting the role of white nationalists. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides – on many sides,” Trump said. He also took the occasion to boast about declining unemployment and new corporate investment in the United States. Afterwards, he ignored shouted questions from reporters as to whether he would denounce white supremacism and whether the car incident constituted terrorism. So was that the “damn near perfect” statement? Former Bush speechwriter David Gershon trashed this statement at the time. Trump’s reaction to events in Charlottesville was alternately trite (‘come together as one’), infantile (‘very, very sad’) and meaningless (‘we want to study it’). ‘There are so many great things happening in our country,’ he said, on a day when racial violence took a life,” he continued. “Ultimately this was not merely the failure of rhetoric or context, but of moral judgment. The president could not bring himself initially to directly acknowledge the victims or distinguish between the instigators and the dead. He could not focus on the provocations of the side marching under a Nazi flag,” Gerson added. “Is this because he did not want to repudiate some of his strongest supporters? This would indicate that Trump views loyalty to himself as mitigation for nearly any crime or prejudice. Or is the president truly convinced of the moral equivalence of the sides in Charlottesville? This is to diagnose an ethical sickness for which there is no cure.” Or was the “perfect” statement made two days later, when he made another bloodless hostage video and finally mentioned the neo-Nazis? But then he turned around and attacked the media for criticizing his first lame statement, which the AP reported he made so slowly only because he was “loathe to admit a mistake.”   ...Donald Trump was attacked as the moments ticked by while he avoided making a statement blaming white supremacists and Nazis for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. The reason, according to an Associated Press report, was Trump’s pride. “Loath to appear to be admitting a mistake, Trump was reluctant to adjust his remarks,” the AP wrote Tuesday. That same day he retweeted an alt-right conspiracy theorist activist name Jack Posobiec, and when CNN’s Jim Acosta grilled him over his response and original failure to condemn hate groups, Trump attacked and called him “fake news.” “They’ve been condemned. They have been condemned,” Trump replied. “And why are we not having a press conference today? You said on Friday we would have a press conference?” Acosta asked. “We just had a press conference,” Trump said. “Can we ask you some more questions?” Acosta wondered. “It doesn’t bother me at all, but you know I like real news, not fake news,” Trump remarked. “You’re fake news.” This prompted two of the survivors of that attack that killed Heather Heyer to ask: What took him so long? Both Blair and Martin went on CNN to discuss the ordeal, and host Chris Cuomo asked them to evaluate Trump’s response to this weekend’s violent protests by white nationalists. Blair immediately questioned Trump’s sincerity in his belated condemnation of white supremacists, which only occurred two days after Fields plowed his car into a group of demonstrators, killing protester Heather Heyer and injuring several more people. “What took you so long to do it?” she asked of Trump. “And now he’s blaming the media for starting the controversy. It was clear that that was an act of terror, an act of hate, it was done to scare the people of my city, scare the people of the world. And it’s like he needed his advisers or he needed someone else to say, ‘You need to do this.'” And then on his third try on Tuesday, after making excuses for the slowness and weakness of his first and second attempts, Trump refused to say the attack was terrorism, then said a whole lot more than that, which was just plain wacko. “The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement but you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,” Trump said. “It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don’t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. So I don’t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. “When I make a statement, I like to be correct,” he continued. “I want the facts.” Trump later refused to call James Fields Jr.—the white nationalist who allegedly drove his car into a group of counter protesters—a terrorist, calling him a murderer and “a disgrace to himself, his family and this country.” “Is it terrorism?” he asked. “Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. What he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing” Remember, this is the guy who accused Barack Obama of being weak for not repeatedly saying the magic words “global Islamic terrorism.” But when Trump had a chance to say “white supremacist terrorism,” he choked—totally. Then he reversed the argument and began attacking the people who actually lived in Charlottesville and were merely trying to protect themselves from the invading neo-Nazis. “What about the alt-left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right?” Trump later asked. “Do they have any assemblage of guilt? What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do.” “I’m not finished, fake news,” Trump said as members of the media pressed him on his moral equivalency. “If you were honest reporters, which in many cases, you are not, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,” Trump later said. “This week, it is Robert E. Lee … is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” One issue that Trump and the proponents of Confederate monuments tend to ignore is the fact that most of them were not built following the Civil War to commemorate the veterans of that conflict. Instead, they were created years later as part of the rise of the KKK and as tools of intimidation and terrorism against the civil rights movement. The Confederate monuments in New Orleans; Charlottesville, Virginia; Durham, North Carolina, and elsewhere did not organically pop up like mushrooms. The installation of the 1,000-plus memorials across the US was the result of the orchestrated efforts of white Southerners and a few Northerners with clear political objectives: They tended to be erected at times when the South was fighting to resist political rights for black citizens. The preservation of these monuments has likewise reflected a clear political agenda. [...] The pursuit of white cultural unity through Confederate commemoration went hand-in-hand with the promotion of white supremacy. The Confederate monuments themselves were sometimes explicitly linked to the cause of white supremacy by the notables who spoke at their dedication. For instance, at the 1913 dedication of an on-campus monument honoring University of North Carolina students who fought for the Confederacy, white industrialist Julian Carr unambiguously urged his audience to devote themselves to the maintenance of white supremacy with the same vigor that their Confederate ancestors had defended slavery. During the dedication speech, Carr praised Confederate soldiers not just for their wartime valor but also for their defense “of the Anglo Saxon race during the four years after the war” when “their courage and steadfastness saved the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South.” The “four years after the war” was a clear reference to the period in which the Ku Klux Klan, a white paramilitary organization terrorized blacks and white Republicans who threatened the traditional white hierarchy in the state. Then he boasted that “one hundred yards from where we stand” — and within months of Lee’s 1865 surrender — “I horse whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds because she had maligned and insulted a Southern lady.” Although some of our founding fathers were slave-holders, like Washington and Jefferson, they are not specifically known for being part of the Southern rebellion, nor are they icons of the KKK or neo-Nazis.  Monuments to them are not symbols of the racial terrorism that was implemented in America in the years following the Civil War. I’m sure there are people that don’t fully understand that profound distinction and may continue to support keeping these types of monuments on public land rather than on private areas, but the key point is that having them in public spaces, at public schools, courthouses, and state houses is a not-very-subtle ongoing endorsement for bigotry, racism, and violence. Ignorance of that reality is no excuse. These monuments are not symbols of the “glory of the South.” They are symbols of the Klan. But Trump is apparently unaware of this, as shown in his third response. The president later insisted his ability to bring in good jobs will “have a tremendous positive impact on race relations.” “I think there is blame on both sides,” Trump later restated. “You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides. I have no doubt about it. You don’t have doubt about it either. If you reported it accurately, you would say that.” The actual “alt-left” that Trump was talking about here were actually given credit by members of an interfaith clergy group that included Dr. Cornell West for saving their lives during some of the violence that day.  Clergy have blocked one of entrances to Emancipation Park #DefemdCVille #CvilleClergyCall pic.twitter.com/16DRYr6tuv Religious protesters who spoke to ThinkProgress were mostly spiritually devoted to nonviolence, and some expressed ambivalence about the tactics of other demonstrators, such as the black-clad Antifa, whose members often challenge racism with their fists. There appeared to be little coordination between the two groups over the weekend: At one point, Whispelwey said, Antifa protesters mistakenly thought clergy were trying to protect the white supremacists (who had no known faith presence). It took a rapid-fire conversation to set things right. But the groups found a way to work together eventually. As tensions mounted on Saturday morning, some clergy broke away to stage an even more dramatic—and far more dangerous—protest. A faction that included professor West, Smith, and Wispelwey formed a line across the entrance of the park and linked arms, blocking white supremacists from entering. [...] “A group of white supremacists broke through our line with shields,” Wispelwey said. “Some of them were screaming and spitting slurs [as they] physically shoved clergy aside with their shields.” Clergy rearranged their positions to try and hold off another wave of white nationalists. But when the “the alt-right instigated their violence” down the street against counter-protesters, a group of Antifa intervened. The clergy took moment as a chance to disperse. “That’s when Antifa saved our lives,” he said. But of course, Trump was again clueless of any of that and instead failed to make a condolence call to Heather Heyer’s mother. And not long after that, the Daily Stormer sent protesters to harass those attending her funeral. One year later, Trump hosted neo-Nazi bikers at the White House on the anniversary of Heather Heyer’s death.  Bro was also bothered by Trump meeting with bikers, some of whom had racist tattoos, at the White House on the anniversary of her death. “On the anniversary of her death I believe he had a large crowd of bikers come to the White House, and I have nothing against bikers, in general, except for the ones that are proudly displaying their Nazi slogans and tattoos, many of whom were at the White House, and again, he was delighted with the crowd,” she said. “I took that as a dog whistle.” This would not seem to be the act of someone who really meant it when he supposedly “condemned Neo-Nazis.” At the time of the rally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded by saying “There are no good neo-Nazis,” and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan said “You can’t be a very fine person and a white supremacist.” So are they “race baiters” like Joe Biden, too? But on the other hand, then-Trump adviser Steve Bannon praised Trump’s speech at the time because it “fully abandoned the globalists.” “Steve was proud of how [Trump] stood up to the braying mob of reporters” at President Trump’s circus-like press conference, Axios reports. Before joining the Trump campaign, Bannon was chief executive at Breitbart.com, which he described as a “platform” for the so-called Alt-Right. “Both Trump and Bannon are of one mind, and, within the White House at least, theirs is a minority view. They saw the backlash to Charlottesville as an example of political correctness run amok and instinctively searched for ‘their’ people in that group of protesters,” Axios said. “Bannon has told associates that Trump, on Tuesday afternoon, took it to the next level for the country by asking where does it end?” I believe we can judge the seriousness of Trump’s comments at the time by looking at what’s he’s done and said since then. For example, according to famed journalist Bob Woodward, after making his second set of comments condemning neo-Nazis at Charlottesville, Trump said it was “the biggest fucking mistake I’ve made.” According to a leaked excerpt obtained by the Washington Post, Trump deeply resented being forced to come out and specifically condemn white nationalists after being advised by aides that he needed to do so to make clear that he was opposed to racism. “That was the biggest f*cking mistake I’ve made,” Trump told advisers shortly after giving a speech that condemned Nazis, according to Woodward’s sources, who also say Trump called the speech “the worst” he’d ever given. And when Trump and his people later claimed he really didn’t mean that some of the “fine people"" were in the KKK, according to author Michael Wolff he was “desperate to say something nice about white supremacists.” “This is a little insight into how he felt about the KKK” Camerota said before reading an excerpt from the book. “‘Privately, he kept trying to rationalize why someone would be a member of the KKK – that is, they might not actually believe what the KKK believes, and the KKK probably does not believe what it used to believe, who really knows what the KKK believes now?'” “Why else would you join the KKK? Do they have good benefits? Is there an insurance plan that goes along with it?” co-host Chris Cuomo asked as his guests — Daily Beast editor John Avlon and RealClear Politics correspondent A.B. Stoddard  — began laughing. “Why else would you join?” Cuomo asked again. “This is insightful, A.B.,” Camerota chimed in. “He wanted to be able to say there are good people on both sides, so he’s is ruminating ‘surely they’re not as bad as we all heard. Maybe there’s something in it for everybody?'” Let’s also recall that Trump went out of his way to call protesting black football players “sons of bitches,” but he didn’t say anything like that about any of the neo-Nazis at Charlottesville. “Trump used harsher language to describe Kaepernick than he used for the Neo-Nazi who killed Heather Heyer,” Christiana Mbakwe‏, a writer for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” tweeted. “Colin Kaepernick is a real patriot and a fantastic human being,” another user wrote. “Donald Trump is a tool and a traitor.” It should also be noted that Trump refused to condemn Roseanne Barr’s comments when she called former Obama adviser Valerie Jarret a cross between the “Muslim Brotherhood and a monkey.” “Racism occurs, people look to the White House — leader of the country — for response,” [CNN Host Kate] Bolduan explained. “And [Trump] seems to go out of his way to just not call it out: David Duke, Charlottesville, Roseanne Barr’s tweet. Why can’t he get this right?” “Of course he should condemn it,” [Gov] Kasich agreed. “I couldn’t believe the stuff that was in that tweet.” “It’s ridiculous,” the governor said of Trump’s refusal to rebuke Barr. “I went through this [after the white supremacist rally] in Charlottesville. Of course it should be condemned. But I also want us to think about the way we behave.” Some GOP reps claimed that Charlottesville was part of a plot organized by George Soros and an Obama sympathizer, and there was another GOPer who claims that the rally was staged by Obama. Republican lawmaker in Idaho recently shared a conspiracy theory on Facebook that claims former President Barack Obama may have orchestrated the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. “I’m not saying it is true, but I am suggesting that it is completely plausible,” Idaho Falls Rep. Bryan Zollinger wrote on Facebook, according to the Idaho Falls Post Register. His post linked to an article published at the American Thinker that claimed the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville could have been staged by Obama, with the help of the mayor of Charlottesville and billionaire George Soros. In the wake of the attack, there was a South African white nationalist who marched at Charlottesville who told CNN that Trump was his “ray of hope.” Although Roche denies being a racist or a neo-Nazi, CNN reveals that he demonstrated alongside neo-Nazis at the infamous Charlottesville riots, and he had nothing but praise for the demonstrators who chanted “Jews will not replace us.” “The guys did a superb job,” Roche said in a voice message to his followers in South Africa after the Charlottesville demonstrations. “The people behaved themselves respectfully and decently.” Roche tells CNN that he was particularly heartened by a Trump tweet this summer that ordered an investigation into the treatment of white South African farmers shortly after a segment about white South Africans aired on Tucker Carlson’s program on Fox News. “We saw a ray of hope,” he says of Trump’s tweet. “Maybe there are people out there who know and care and have power and influence. Only time will tell how much is smoke and mirrors — shadows and dust.” Former FBI agent Erroll Southers linked bombs sent to Democrats to an ”uptick” in white supremacist recruiting since Charlottesville. An ex-FBI agent who specializes in domestic extremism explained to MSNBC Wednesday the link between an “uptick” in white supremacist and white nationalists groups recruiting since Charlottesville and the bombs that were mailed to prominent Democrats and CNN earlier in the day. “We have a politically inspired organization or individual that’s targeted prominent officials” from the Obama administration,” Erroll Southers, author of “Homegrown Violent Extremism,” told host Ari Melber and a panel of intelligence officials. “We’ve had an uptick in the last 14 months since Charlottesville of organizations working together and being more overt in what they are doing,” the ex-FBI SWAT team member said. “We are seeing lectures on college campuses and recruitment efforts in the way of flyers.” Nearly a year after Charlottesville, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also refused to condemn white nationalists and played the same “both sides” game as Trump. When asked about Trump's comment that there were ""fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, Sec. Nielsen seemingly doubled down. ""it's not that one side was right and one side was wrong"" #AspenSecurity  Are white nationalists a top priority for the Trump administration? @PeterAlexander speaks with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at the #AspenSecurity Forum. pic.twitter.com/vAxou4BCDU Under Nielsen, the Department of Homeland Security disbanded its Domestic Terrorism Unit, even though our greatest current global terrorism threat now comes from white supremacists. The recent massacre of 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand is the latest confirmation that white supremacy is a danger to democratic societies across the globe. Despite President Donald Trump’s suggestion that white nationalist terrorism is not a major problem, recent data from the United Nations, University of Chicago and other sources show the opposite. As more people embrace a xenophobic and anti-immigrant worldview, it is fueling hostility and violence toward those deemed “outsiders” – whether because of their religion, skin color or national origin. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has reacted with outrage to the idea that Trump’s rhetoric has contributed to any of this violence. When asked about conservative commentator Matt Dowd’s remarks over the weekend — that President Trump needs to understand how his rhetoric “inflame a part of what is going on in America” — Sanders called the insinuation “outrageous.” “I don’t think anything could be further from the truth,” she said. “The President has condemned not only this act, but all acts of evil and hatred and racism and bigotry and we will continue to do that. And again, this is an outrageous statement and something that is a complete misrepresentation of who the President is. He has said the words, reluctantly, but the question is does he mean them—and do the racists believe it? We’ve since learned that the Tree of Life synagogue shooter was clearly responding to allegations that Jews are paying for the immigrant caravans. Before he opened fire in a mass shooting that killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, witnesses say the gunman shouted, “All Jews must die.” But the particular moment he (allegedly) chose for his massacre, and the place he chose to do it, show that what radicalized the assailant to the point of violence was a specific manifestation of anti-Semitism: blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race. His last post on the pro-hate-speech social-media site Gab, posted minutes before the synagogue massacre, spells it out — with a reference to HIAS, the Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees in the United States: This view exactly matches a claim by Trump and Fox News programs about—you guessed it—George Soros: Also, the Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque shooter specifically named-checked Trump in his manifesto: The Australian-born suspect who shot and killed dozens of Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, has published a manifesto praising US President Donald Trump and Anders Breivik, the Norwegian white supremacist who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011. The 74-page dossier, which has been described by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as a ""work of hate"", hailed Trump as ""a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose"". I think Trump may reluctantly say the “right” words, but he doesn’t mean them, and these vicious murdering white power terrorists know he doesn't mean them. It doesn’t matter whether he convinces us of anything. What he needs to do is convince some of them that they aren’t the “fine people” he’s been talking about. Frankly, I don't think he’s capable of it—not if he thinks condemning the racists at Charlottesville was the “biggest fucking mistake he’s made”. Joe Biden has every reason to go after Trump over this. In fact, Biden should be far from alone. ",,"Just who, exactly, were these 'very fine people' Trump spoke of?",,115,http://www.dailykos.com

Beto O' Rourke talks guns, racism and immigration with Texas voters Democratic presidential candidates are both renewing their gun control proposals and pushing for more progressive plans in the wake of recent mass shootings in Odessa, Texas, El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left more than 30 victims dead. Here are the current and former candidates who have put out proposals so far and what we know about the candidates who have yet to do so. The list doesn't include every Democratic candidate, but highlights candidates who have significant positions or experiences that set them apart -- whether they were the first to support a policy, switched positions over the years, held office at the time a mass shooting occurred or have experience with guns through military service. Former candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., carved out one of the most ambitious paths in the gun policy debate ahead of 2020 -- a plan he called ""the most comprehensive gun violence prevention plan of any candidate for president in decades."" Booker's policy, announced in May, would have required all gun owners to acquire a license through the federal government. Currently, 16 states have similar laws to varying degrees. His plan ultimately pushed federal licensing into the conversation for Democrats, prompting Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke to echo their support for a national gun licensing program or include it in their own policy announcements. O'Rourke, who also ultimately ended his bid,  demanded banks and credit card companies to stop processing assault weapons sales and firearm transactions without a background check. O’Rourke’s plan was to drum up public pressure by calling on these financial institutions to deny services to all gun and ammunition manufacturers that produce or sell assault weapons. This call appears to be the first of its kind among the Democratic candidates. Some have also issued support for buyback programs, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Biden, who authored the 1994 assault weapons ban, is in favor of universal background checks and renewing a ban on assault weapons. However, he has yet to release a detailed plan on gun control reform. Another candidate who is no longer in the race, Castro, who unveiled a gun policy after the El Paso shooting, also came out in support of buybacks. In the past, Castro has described buybacks as having ""had mixed success,"" but as being ""good policy"" in some circumstances. Warren, who did not include support for buybacks in her gun policy announced in the wake of the El Paso and Dayton shootings, described her focus on reducing the power of the NRA, putting $100 million annually toward gun safety research and reducing gun deaths in the country by 80%. ""Historically, when Congress works to address big national issues, we don't simply pass one law and cross our fingers. Instead, we continue the research -- into new policies and around the consequences of our existing policies -- and then come back on a regular basis to update the law,"" she wrote in her plan. ""We don't do this with guns."" ""This ends when I'm president,"" Warren said. Warren, who was born and raised in Oklahoma and has said that she values the rights of ""law-abiding citizens"" to own guns, was one of the last front-runner candidates to unveil a gun policy, despite her efforts to be out in front of a host of other 2020 issues by dominating the arena of plans. Before announcing her policy, Warren had gained support of gun control advocates for her work in the Senate. After the deadly 2017 shooting in Parkland, Florida, Warren wrote letters to several major companies that invested with gun manufacturers and asked them to pressure the industry to change. ""I encourage you to take action to ensure that the gun companies in which you invest are taking steps to reduce gun violence,"" Warren wrote to Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and others. In her presidential plan, Warren echoed Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in pledging to act on gun control within her first 100 days through executive action. Harris, too, has since ended her presidential bid. Harris, who announced her plan in April, said she would also require near-universal background checks to be run by people selling more than five guns in a year and revoke the licenses of gun manufacturers and dealers that break the law. She has also talked about renewing the 1994 law that banned assault weapons but expired in 2004 -- an idea with near universal support among Democratic candidates. For Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., judging gun control legislation is about what would ""hurt [her] Uncle Dick in the deer stand,"" a perspective that comes from her state's value of the outdoors, including hunting and fishing, Klobuchar said in a CNN town hall in February. ""And so I come at it from a little different place than some of my colleagues running for this office,"" she said. But those factors don't keep her from supporting universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons, she said. In the past, Klobuchar has applied the same rule about her Uncle Dick to other laws, like preventing people on a terrorist watch list from buying guns. ""Would closing off the loophole in the terrorist watch list hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand? Not at all,"" Klobuchar said in 2016. Much like Klobuchar, Sanders has many constituents who hunt. According to Vermont's Department of Fish and Wildlife, there are 66,000 residents who hunt and the state rakes in nearly $4 million in hunting license revenue each year. In the past, the rural connection has led to criticism by some progressives that Sanders was too moderate on gun control, especially in his early career. The Vermont senator has made a point since kicking off his 2020 campaign to show he's evolved. During the 2016 battle for the Democratic candidacy, Sanders frequently was attacked for repeatedly voting against a 1993 law that established federal background checks. At the time, Sanders told a local newspaper that he supported background checks but was opposed to the federally mandated waiting period that came along with it because it might affect local gun shop sales. Sanders often brings up his lengthy record to prove a different point: He has consistently voted since the 1980s to ban semi-automatic assault weapons. Only one of the nearly two dozen major Democratic presidential candidates has not seen a mass shooting take place in their state while in office: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. For the purpose of this analysis, ABC News defined a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooter. Harris, for example, who has made gun control a key part of her 2020 platform, held office in California when two of the state's most deadly mass shootings in recent history took place: 14 people were killed in San Bernardino in 2015 and 12 people were killed in a shooting at a college bar in Thousand Oaks in 2018. Colorado has also seen some of the most notable mass shootings in the country and there were two candidates in the race from the state: Sen. Michael Bennet and former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 15 and later announced that he would run for a Colorado Senate seat in 2020. After a shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2012 claimed 12 lives, Hickenlooper signed gun control measures that required background checks for private and online gun sales and banned high-capacity magazines. Bennet also voted to ban high-capacity magazines, but in 2010 voted to oppose restricting the right to bear arms and in 2009 voted to allow Amtrak riders to check bags containing guns. During Biden's nearly five decades in public office, there were dozens of mass shootings, which has in turn made Biden a longtime advocate for gun control. As a U.S. senator, he introduced the assault weapons ban, which was signed into law in 1994. And after the deaths of 20 first-grade students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, then-Vice President Biden led a new task force on gun violence. Four months after the tragedy in Connecticut, Biden's modest measure on background checks passed the House, but didn't make it out of the Senate. For O'Rourke, a minor switch came just a few months into the 2020 cycle, after Booker announced his proposed plan, and again after the shooting in El Paso shattered his hometown. Asked about establishing federal gun licensing in May, O'Rourke initially told reporters on the campaign trail that it went ""too far."" But after a night of reflection, he changed his mind. ""What I think Sen. Booker has done is to push us past that to seek to do even more, and I'm grateful that he's done that and I, you know, as I've thought about it, I really think that we should be looking at everything,"" O'Rourke said the next day on the trail. After the shooting in El Paso, O'Rourke also came out in support of a buyback program. For the former governor of Colorado, the evolution on guns was a longer, more-complicated process. ""This wasn't a Colorado problem. This is a human problem,"" Hickenlooper told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in 2012, in the wake of the Aurora shooting. ""Even if he didn't have access to guns, this guy was diabolical. … He would have done something to create this horror."" Since then, Hickenlooper has adapted his tone, and more than once. Colorado has passed measures expanding background checks and limiting magazine sizes to 15 rounds, despite backlash from gun rights groups. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 28, has also evolved, tumbling from an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association to an ""F"" -- a point of pride, she's said. ""I didn't have much of an understanding about what gun violence actually looks like in a community,"" Gillibrand said in a 2016 podcast about her past pro-gun stance, when she represented a rural upstate New York district. She was changed by conversations with families who'd been devastated by gun violence in cities, she said. Gillibrand was joined by fellow former presidential hopeful Rep. Tim Ryan, of Ohio, who was also formerly given an ""A"" rating from the NRA. Ryan shifted his stance more recently than Gillibrand, speaking out after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. He has since donated roughly $20,000 to gun control organizations. There were three candidates in the race who were trained to use guns in combat. Even though their legislative records differ, all three support a ban on military-style assault rifles. After 49 people were killed at Pulse, a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, Marine veteran and current Rep. Seth Moulton tweeted a photo of himself in uniform holding a military-grade rifle, saying, ""I know assault rifles. I carried one in Iraq. They have no place on America's streets."" The rifle the Massachusetts congressman was holding is not available to civilians and was not the same gun that was used in the nightclub shooting. Moulton, who dropped out of the presidential race on Aug. 23, also authored bipartisan legislation to ban bump stocks, an accessory that increases the firing rate, after the device was used in the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people in 2017. ""There are common sense reforms, there are common sense laws that we can pass, that are respectful of gun rights but still will reduce this public health crisis in America,"" he said in an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" with co-anchor Martha Raddatz after the Las Vegas shooting. Also after the shooting in Las Vegas, Buttigieg, a U.S. Navy Reserve veteran who was deployed to Afghanistan, similarly denounced AR-style rifles. ""I did not carry an assault weapon around a foreign country so I could come home and see them used to massacre my countrymen,"" he tweeted. Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has come under criticism for not sponsoring gun control measures that are widely supported by other Democrats in the House. But she has voted to ban assault weapons, and, shortly after the deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, killed 17, Gabbard added her name as a co-sponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",,Here's how the 2020 Democrats differ on gun control,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

          / CBS News J.T. Lewis was just 12 years old when his younger brother, Jesse Lewis, stood up to a gunman who had entered his first-grade classroom, before shooting and killing 20 innocent young children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Jesse screamed for his classmates to run while the gunman reloaded his weapon, standing beside his teacher the whole time. Jesse's heroic actions on December 14, 2012 helped saved nine of his classmates before he lost his own life, an act of bravery J.T. says has since inspired him to run to try and unseat a three-term incumbent in the Connecticut State Senate. I am running for Connecticut State Senate! #JT4CT pic.twitter.com/2rmXv1gd9m ""I believe that inside every single one of us is that same sense of innate courage that we never knew we had to do something extraordinary,"" Lewis, who is running as a Republican, said in a campaign video. ""And to honor Jesse, I've decided to be courageous enough to run for state Senate in my home state of Connecticut."" The now 19-year-old launched his candidacy on social media on Tuesday, saying his run against the GOP incumbent Tony Hwang of Connecticut's 28th state senate district is a personal one. In his campaign launch video, Lewis recalled making a phone call to Hwang's office in the wake of the mass shooting, imploring his senator to prevent future tragedies from happening. That call, he said, was never returned. ""The little boy who just wanted someone to hear his mom's calls for help has grown up,"" said Lewis. ""I'm entering the fray because it is only with real leadership that Connecticut will see change that it is so desperate for."" Lewis told CBS News that his personal connection to the country's gun issues and being a young Republican makes him ""uniquely positioned to bring both sides of the isle together."" ""We all, Republicans and Democrats, want to see kids safe at school. We're just coming at it from different angles,"" said Lewis. He said that if elected, he has a three-pronged approach to tackling the issue of school violence, addressing ""mental health, gun legislation, and securing schools."" Lewis, a student at the University of Connecticut, has taken his advocacy for gun safety to the White House and was invited to participate in a round-table discussion with President Trump last December. Lewis has praised the Trump administration for taking more proactive steps to preventing mass shooting events than his predecessors. ""We've met with governors; we've met with senators.  We met with the previous administration — the President and the Secretary of Education. And everyone wanted to focus on a certain issue...And I won't say it, but they didn't want to focus on school safety, which is the most important thing,"" Lewis told Mr. Trump at the White House last year. ""As I learn going back to school in Newtown — Sandy Hook — the schools become infinitely safer the day after the shooting.  They implement all of this stuff, and you feel completely safe in this school that just had a shooting yesterday. So this needs to get into the schools before something like that happens,"" Lewis said, advocating for enhanced security measures in schools. The Trump White House has endorsed some efforts to curb gun violence, including The Fix NICS Act, which strengthens background checks for firearm purchases, as well as the STOP School Violence Act, which provides grants to schools to improve safety. Hwang, who's served in the state senate since 2014, has supported other efforts to address school safety in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. In 2016, he introduced legislation in Connecticut to increase criminal penalties if a threat involves a preschool, K-12 school or an institution of higher education. Asked about his challenge in 2020, Hwang told CBS News: ""I appreciate and respect anyone's desire to run for public office. I love representing the people of the 28th District. My experience, record of accomplishments and engaged representation of our communities speaks for itself."" He added, ""I do my best every day to work for and represent all of the residents of the 28th District. I am honored and privileged to serve as the State Senator and will continue to do all I can to be a voice our constituents can be proud of."" Lewis, meanwhile, vowed that he would do his best to bridge a divided political world,"" should he win. He will face Hwang in the August primary in 2020.

The teen's brother, Jesse Lewis, was a 6-year-old first grader on Dec. 14, 2012, when a 20-year-old gunman burst into Sandy Hook Elementary and started shooting.

103,https://www.foxsports.com/other/story/ensan-55-becomes-oldest-world-poker-champion-in-20-years-071719,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Germany's Hossein Ensan outlasted Italy's Dario Sammartino and Canada's Alex Livingston to claim the $10 million title early Wednesday at the 50th World Series of Poker Main Event in Las Vegas. The 55-year-old native of Iran who immigrated to Germany 30 years ago became the oldest world poker champion in 20 years when he won the 301st hand at the final table to finish off Sammartino after nearly eight hours of play. It's the first time since 2014 the winner has come from outside the United States and third time ever the title has gone to an Iranian-born competitor. ""Unbelievable,"" said Ensan, who now lives in Greven, Germany. He was making his first appearance in the Main Event with a previous total of $2.67 million in career earnings. ""I am so happy. I thank my fans at home in Germany, also in Iran and my fans, my buddies here. This is the best feeling in my life,"" he said after claiming the winning hand when Sammartino pushed his chips all in at 1:24 a.m. Wednesday at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Ensan, wearing a white crew neck T-shirt with poker sponsor patches, and Sammartino in a black tuxedo exchanged numerous smiles and a congratulatory fist bump at one point in the good-natured contest down the stretch. Sammartino, 32, who is originally from Naples and now lives in Vienna, Austria, won $6 million for second place in the 11-day tournament that began July 3 with a field of 8,569 — the second largest field in the 50-year history of the event. He was bidding to become its first Italian-born champion and now has won more than $8 million in his professional poker career. Livingston, 32, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, pocketed $4 million for third. The former chess champion who studied economics at Tufts University outside Boston finished 13th in the 2013 World Series of Poker and now has $4.65 million in career earnings in the event. Garry Gates of Henderson, Nevada, a survivor of the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, took home $3 million for finishing fourth the night before. Kevin Maahs of Chicago got $2.2 million for fifth. Ensan, who also won a diamond-encrusted gold bracelet, entered the final night with a commanding lead holding 60% of the chips in play among the three international finalists. Sammartino took the lead briefly for the first time late Tuesday more than three hours into the final round — bringing his fans in ""Super Dario"" T-shirts to their feet — and Livingston was eliminated about 15 minutes later. But Esan stormed back to take the lead about 90 minutes later and never looked back on his way to becoming the oldest champion since Noel Furlong won the title in 1999 at age 62. It was the first time in 27 years a native Iranian has won.

Sports By Chris Perez Submit July 18, 2019 | 12:15am Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said the GOP “has sold its soul” to President Trump and called on Democrats to make things “right in 2020.” The former NBA star made the assertion on Twitter on Wednesday night — marking the second time this week that he’s tweeted about the president. “I believe the vast majority of Americans want a unifying, moral leader,” Kerr said. “The GOP has sold its soul to Trump, so the Dems have to get this right in 2020. Make this about jobs and unification. Period.” The ex-Bull has been a vocal critic of Trump in the past. He most recently called on Congress to label the president’s “go back” to your country tweets that he lobbied at the female Democratic lawmakers known as “The Squad” as racist — and has retweeted countless others who wanted the same. “Come on members of Congress, call out the president for his racist tweets,” Kerr tweeted on Sunday night. “Show some leadership. It’s the job you were elected to do.” On Wednesday, Kerr included a link in his tweet to a New York Times opinion piece titled “Trump’s Going to Get Re-elected, Isn’t He?” — which discussed the possibility of a Trump win in 2020. The Warriors coach wore a “Vote For Our Lives” shirt before Game 2 of the NBA Finals this year following a mass shooting in Virginia. “The shirt is a reminder that the only way we can get out of this mess is to actually vote,” he told reporters, “and to vote for people who are going to be willing to create some change in our gun laws in our country.” Read Next Injured Yankees keep getting rare good news Share Selection  THE BEST INSIGHTS FROM THE ULTIMATE INSIDERS Jalen Rose: Renaissance Man

106,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/18/agencies-dial-in-on-lr-crime-20190718/,"Police leaders touted regional and national cooperation efforts to decrease crime and announced a plan for an in-house ballistics testing unit during a multiagency meeting Wednesday in Little Rock. The Public Safety Summit, the first of its kind in Arkansas' capital city, gathered representatives from federal and local agencies to discuss current crime-reduction tactics at the Little Rock Police Department. Mayor Frank Scott Jr., who earlier this month declared July ""Public Safety Month,"" said Wednesday's event would help people better understand what the department is doing to lower violent crime. ""We all understand if you have a safe city, you'll have a more economically vibrant city,"" Scott said. Among the attendees were representatives from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Arkansas State Police, the Crime Laboratory, U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Arkansas, North Little Rock Police Department, Pulaski County sheriff's office, Arkansas Community Correction and the Department of Justice. [Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSxq2KfLF8] Capt. Ken Temple, who leads the Little Rock Police Department's special investigations division, said his department intends to create a Regional Gun Crimes Intelligence Center, where police could test ballistics in-house to more quickly solve violent crimes. The Little Rock department currently uses the state Crime Lab's ballistics testing to record bullets used in violent crimes with the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a national registry of bullets data. Bullets from crime scenes carry data points that police can use to make a ""fingerprint"" for the firearm and use the registry to possibly connect that weapon with other crimes. Every ""match,"" Temple said, is a lead. Over the past three years, the Little Rock department has more than tripled the number of bullet ""matches"" through the network, Temple said. There were 61 matches in 2017; 184 in 2018; and, as of Tuesday afternoon, 150 matches so far this year. The state Crime Lab is not open outside of business hours, on weekends or on some holidays, meaning investigators often must delay testing the projectiles, Temple said. The lab also runs ballistics tests for most police departments in the state. The department already has National Integrated Ballistic Information Network-certified detectives who can use the ballistics equipment and register new bullets, Assistant Police Chief Wayne Bewley said. Those investigators run the Little Rock tests at the Crime Lab. ""We feel we've come to the point with the education and training and our ability to enter these leads ... that we need our own system,"" Bewley said. ""With that, we will become a center for the central Arkansas area. They'll be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week."" The department has applied for an $800,000 grant through the U.S. Department of Justice to purchase the equipment and will find out in October if it will receive the funds. At Wednesday's meeting, Police Chief Keith Humphrey also focused heavily on community involvement and cooperation among federal, state and local police agencies. After a mass shooting at a Little Rock nightclub in 2017 in which 28 people were injured, Humphrey said the department strengthened partnerships with the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the FBI, the DEA and several local agencies to address growing violent crime in the city. Little Rock police Capt. Russell King, who leads the violent crimes unit, said the city has since seen a decrease in violent crime. Though there has been a rise in homicides and rapes in the past two years -- increases of 10% and 13%, respectively -- King pointed to a 39% drop in robberies, a 5% drop in aggravated assault and an 11% decline in overall violent crime as proof of the department's success. ""It means we're doing something right,"" King said. A part of that effort was acquiring two new technologies: ShotSpotter and the IBM Analyst's Notebook, both of which were purchased using a Technology Innovation for Public Safety grant from the Department of Justice. The department has reapplied for the technology grant, and Humphrey and Scott agreed that the technologies were too important to the department's work to lose. ""Whatever it takes, even if the mayor has to pay that out of his own pocket,"" Humphrey said, smiling at a news conference after the meeting. ""That's where I'm going to step in,"" Scott said. ""I think anyone who knows me knows how committed I am to the funding of the Little Rock Police Department."" The department has also applied for grants to aid in the purchase of body-worn cameras and expanded victims services. Little Rock grants manager Caran Curry said many of the grants are highly competitive and the department won't know if it will receive the funds for several months.

107,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/democratic-candidate-john-delaney-wants-to-pay-you-a-carbon-dividend.html," Many good policy ideas miss out on the daily cable news spin cycle — but it is not for a lack of trying. CNBC.com is interviewing presidential candidates this summer to gain insight on their vision and how it can impact the economic outlook for 37% of the 2020 electorate: millennials and Gen Z. Set to be the first American generations to be worse off than their parents, facing the threat of climate change and struggling to pay for college, money matters matter to young voters in this election. This series is dedicated to giving every single candidate a platform to share their economic vision for America with the voters — and find out whether they prefer Hulu or Netflix. Age: 56 Experience: Former congressman from Maryland's 6th District (2013–19); co-founder of Health Care Financial Partners; founder of CapitalSource Education: Columbia University, bachelor's degree (1985); Georgetown Law, JD (1988) Family: Married (April), four daughters CNBC: According to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll, 53% of young voters (18–29) believe the government should do more to curb the effects of climate change even if it comes at the expense of the economy. What is one specific way your administration would give a competitive advantage to greener businesses and consumers? Delaney: My proposal is to create a carbon fee and dividend, which is modeled after the legislation that I introduced in Congress. It was the only bipartisan bill on climate change in Congress, by the way. This puts a fee on carbon, which makes fossil fuels more expensive and less attractive, and it takes all the money generated from these fees, $3 trillion over 10 years, and gives it back to the American people in the form of a dividend. So in many ways it increases energy costs related to fossil fuels, which makes us use less fossil fuels. It takes all the money associated with those increases in energy cost and it gives it right back to the American people. So it goes out one pocket and in another. And what's good about that is as a market mechanism to address climate change, which has been proven to work in Columbia University's model, this proposal would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 92%. CNBC: According to Morning Consult, Amazon is Gen Z's fourth most-loved brand. However, politicians from Donald Trump to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have attacked the brand. Is there a disconnect between leaders and young voters surrounding tech companies? Delaney: Yes, I think the problem with politics these days is, people just want to make villains as opposed to solving problems. Obviously, we're off in a world where these technology companies have been allowed to go around things in society that they don't like. For a lot of young voters, these technology companies have been enabling a way of communicating and way of interacting and a way of doing commerce that is very important to them. A lot of out-of-step politicians seem to think that these technology companies are all bad. There are definitely problems with technology companies, mostly around privacy, in my opinion, and the fact that they don't protect our privacy and we haven't passed privacy laws. But I think politicians underestimate how these companies have fundamentally changed people's lives in ways that are pretty extraordinary. I think younger voters really only grew up in a world where they knew these things. I think there's a disconnect between political leaders and young voters around a lot of things related to the private sector. For example, a lot of politicians continue to attack big banks. While I'm not a defender of big banks, my sense is younger voters have had generally pretty good experiences with banks. They've invested heavily in technology platforms, and they're pretty easy to use. Most young voters have had no bad experience with big banks related to their day-to-day banking services. So there's another example.CNBC: The Parkland Students have changed the way Americans discuss gun control. In the wake of mass shooting after mass shooting, would you support a federal buyback program for guns (and if so, how would you pay for it)? Delaney: I'm not against the buyback program, but I think the best thing we can do in the short term to make a difference is to have universal background checks. We should put limitations on high-powered assault weapons and also pass more red flag laws which allow law enforcement and the judicial system to actually take guns from people with mental illnesses who have posed a significant threat to themselves or society. CNBC: Currently, Americans have $1.5 trillion in outstanding college debt. What is a more realistic option: canceling student debt or making college tuition free? Delaney: Well, the more realistic option of those two is to make public tuition free as part of a national service program. So I think there's a potential to make tuition free at public universities as part as young people doing national service. I think that is the most realistic option. CNBC: According to Gallup, 4 in 10 Americans embrace some form of socialism. Do you think this is a realistic vision for the future of the American economy? Delaney: No, in its pure form, absolutely not, but I also think these terms don't mean much to most Americans, because the truth of the matter is, we're a free market economy that has strong social programs, and that's really the model of the United States of America. I don't think we need to throw out that model. I think we need to reaffirm it, updated for the world we live in. Netflix or Hulu: Netflix Apple Music or Spotify: Apple Music Who is on your music playlist? Bruce Springsteen What was your first job? Landscaper What was your college major? Double major in biology and English Favorite TV show: Star Trek What is the best financial advice you have ever received from your parents? Save a little bit every week. If you were a Gen Z individual entering the workforce, what sector would you enter? Energy Should marijuana be legalized nationally? Yes or no only! I think the federal government should remove it from Schedule 1 and then the legalization question is up to the states.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that spurred his supporters to chant ""send her back"" at a rally Wednesday night, have increased urgent calls for her to have more security. Rep. Bennie Thompson, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote a letter Thursday evening requesting the Capitol Police Board hold an ""emergency meeting"" to examine increased security for lawmakers targeted by the president and his supporters, explaining that ""the President's attacks on Members of Congress have emboldened people to pursue acts of violence."" ""Since last night's Trump campaign rally, the hashtag #SendHerBack is trending on Twitter with tweets referring to Rep. Omar as a terrorist sympathizer and calls for her deportation despite being a U.S. citizen,"" Thompson wrote to the Senate's Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger. The letter was the second of two Thompson sent this week to Stenger, who serves as chairman of the police board and oversees security for the Capitol. On Monday, Thompson sent a letter highlighting security concerns after Trump sent a series of racist tweets attacking ""the Squad"" — Reps. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — all freshmen lawmakers and women of color who are critical of his administration. More: Donald Trump blames supporters for 'send her back' taunts against black lawmaker 'Disgusted.': How Republicans are reacting to 'send her back' chants at Donald Trump's rally Trump suggested that the group should ""go back"" to where they came from and kept up his attacks throughout the week, accusing the four of ""hating America,"" -- all despite widespread backlash and a resolution in the House that condemned his original tweets as racist. During his Wednesday night rally, Trump again brought up the group and suggested they ""hate our country"" and if ""they don't like it, let them leave."" His supporters chanted ""send her back"" as he mentioned Omar — who was born in Somalia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen who arrived in the country as a refugee at age 12. On Thursday, the president distanced himself from the chants by blaming supporters and telling reporters that he ""wasn't happy with that message."" ""I disagree with it,"" Trump said of the chants. Thompson in his Monday letter cited previous politically motivated attacks, including the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and Trump critics in October and man arrested who planned a mass shooting targeting lawmakers. Thompson said these new attacks from the president ""should not be taken lightly"" and said, ""being proactive in this instance is vital to the safety of not only these targeted Members, but all Members of Congress."" More: What we know about the 'send her back' chants that erupted at Trump's rally In April, Trump and other conservatives targeted Omar over her controversial comments about the 9/11 terror attacks, when she said the attacks were ""something"" done by ""some people."" Trump tweeted out a video that included Omar's remarks repeated along with ominous music, all played over images of the World Trade Center engulfed in flames with New Yorkers running for safety. Fact Check: Trump’s false claims about Rep. Ilhan Omar In the aftermath, several people were arrested on federal charges after allegedly threatening to kill her. Throughout the day Thursday, lawmakers expressed worries about Omar's safety and the president's rhetoric. ""His rhetoric is endangering lots of people,"" Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said. ""It’s not just about threats to individual members in office but is about creating this whole environment."" She said that Trump’s ""violent rhetoric"" puts ""anyone like Ilhan, anyone who believes in the rights of all people, in danger and I think he has a responsibility for preventing that."" Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., told Politico that he was worried. ""It’s crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger,"" he said. ""He has threatened the safety of a member of Congress. That takes this to a whole different level."" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries also suggested more security for those being attacked by the president, telling Politico, ""we need to make sure that every single member of the House Democratic caucus, particularly those who have been viciously targeted by Donald Trump, including at the rally last night, are safe and have the protection that they need.""",2019-07-18 20:01:41,&apos;Send her back&apos; Trump rally chant heightens calls for increased security for Rep.

Jewher Ilham was one of those who met with Trump and she shared the plight of her father, a Uighur scholar sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for speaking out against the Chinese communist government. She also spoke with the president about the estimated 1 million or more Uighur Muslims that the regime has rounded up and put in “re-education camps” where evidence exists of torture and organ harvesting. “That’s tough stuff,” Trump said on Wednesday in response to Ilham’s account about the camps and her jailed father, Ilham Tohti. “Americans will never tire in our efforts to defend and promote religious freedom,” Trump said. “I don’t think any president’s taken it as seriously as me.” Breitbart News reported on Ilham’s remarks at the ministerial on Tuesday where she spoke about the freedoms she has enjoyed since coming to the United States, including freedom of speech and freedom to practice Islam openly. “There was no such freedom for Uighurs in China — not at the school where my father was a professor, not in public, not even in a private house,” Ilham said. “Instead there are signs on the street reminding Uighurs that they are not allowed to be visibly Muslim.” Ilham now lives in the United States and recently graduated from Indiana University. Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback also attended the meeting and noted the United States is leading the way in pursuing religious liberty around the world under Trump’s leadership. “The president also heard accounts from Yuhua Zhang, a practitioner of the spiritual movement Falun Gong whose husband is detained in China, and Nyima Lhamo, a Tibetan Buddhist whose uncle died while imprisoned in Sichuan,” the South China Morning Post reported. “Also at the gathering was a survivor of March’s mass shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad, a member of the Iraqi Yazidi minority who survived months of captivity by Islamic State in 2014,” the Post reported. “The Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom brings together leaders from around the world to discuss the challenges facing religious freedom, identify means to address religious persecution and discrimination worldwide, and promote greater respect and preservation of religious liberty for all,” the ministerial website states. “This event focuses on concrete outcomes that reaffirm international commitments to promote religious freedom and produce real, positive change.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaconcentration campsIlham TohtiJewher IhamMuslimUighurs .

CNN’s New Day ventured into preposterous territory on Friday morning when co-host Alisyn Camerota pinned the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting on Donald Trump. Camerota comments may be a new low even for CNN as she ignored this key point: The shooter went out of his way to say how much he DISLIKED the President. The co-host was adamant that Trump was responsible for inciting both the attempted bombings of various news outlets and Democratic congress members, as well as the mass shooting carried out at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue:    I understand, but I just want to remind people that the guy in the van that was festooned with all the Trump stickers, sent bombs that he thought were active. This wasn't a false alarm. He meant to send bombs that would go off to news organizations and to leading Democrats, and the guy at the Tree of Life Synagogue, the mass shooter used the same terminology that the President had used and talked about how much he liked that. Camerota’s ignorant, but typical of CNN’s cheap attempts to blame everything on Donald Trump. Regarding the President and this shooter, The Intelligencer wrote in October of last year: Some have laid blame for the shooting at the feet of President Trump and his constant stoking of racial division. [The shooter] went out of his way on Gab to say he was no Trump booster. Despite Trump’s own embrace of the “nationalist” label, [the shooter] wrote on Gab that “Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist.” He also declared in May that he didn’t vote for Trump and had never “owned, worn, or even touched” a Make America Great Again hat. The panel began the sickening segment by bashing GOP members of Congress for their unwillingness to break off from the President and denounce him as a racist. CNN law enforcement analyst Josh Campbell then went on to say that the President could potentially incite violence if he continued to use this rhetoric. Campbell wrapped up by falsely claiming that the President “tells people it's okay to hate people”: Can I also just say, and see things not politically but through the lens of public safety and I think that’s one aspect of this as well that we should probably talk more about as a country, and that is, you know, the nature of the President's words and how that might incite people to violence. Our colleague Sarah Schneider had a great piece this week, talking about how, you know, there are people out there using the President's own words to discriminate against people. And we know in the past that's potentially an issue, when you have the commander in chief that tells people it's okay to hate people, you know, listen to my own words and use them, that could be dangerous in this country. Talking heads on CNN regularly complain about the animosity in American politics in the Trump era. Their attempts to paint Trump as a villainous dictator who has caused rise of hatred and bigotry is partly to blame for the animosity itself. The liberal media’s rhetoric and disdain for conservatives gave birth to the Trump movement they despise so much. Here is the complete transcript from the segment:  CNN New Day
		07/19/2019
		8:09 AM

		JOHN BERMAN: Does it show that, you know, we always hear Republicans feel like they can't do anything, the President tweets what he tweets and we just have to watch it, but does this show there are times if they band together, if they speak up that they can get him to back off?

		KRISTEN POWERS [CNN POLITICAL ANALYST]: Yes. But the point is I think they're much more interested in getting themselves re-elected, and they're not as offended by this as I frankly think that they should be. Right, I think there's so many things he does that are so problematic separate from the race issue. I mean, t's the authoritarianism, cozying up with authoritarians all around the world, all the different things that he does, and they just decide what’s more important is basically not pushing back against the President, what's important is me getting re-elected.

		JOSH CAMPBELL [CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST]: Can I also just say, and see things not politically but through the lens of public safety and I think that’s one aspect of this as well that we should probably talk more about as a country, and that is, you know, the nature of the President's words and how that might incite people to violence. Our colleague Sarah Schneider had a great piece this week, talking about how, you know, there are people out there using the President's own words to discriminate against people. And we know in the past that's potentially an issue, when you have the commander in chief that tells people it's okay to hate people, you know, listen to my own words and use them, that could be dangerous in this country.

		ALISYN CAMEROTA: We've already seen it. We’ve seen it!

		CAMPBELL: We have. But we have to keep talking about it.

		CAMEROTA: I understand, but I just want to remind people that the guy in the van that was festooned with all the Trump stickers, sent bombs that he thought were active. This wasn't a false alarm. He meant to send bombs that would go off to news organizations and to leading Democrats, and the guy at the Tree of Life synagogue, the mass shooter used the same terminology that the President had used and talked about how much he liked that.

		CAMPBELL: Right, and after this happens the President will back down just a little bit for maybe a day or week so, and then goes right back to it.

		POWERS: It's also not that much of a back down, right? It’s not – I mean the damage is done, and he's not apologizing. He's not saying that this was wrong, ""I shouldn't have said that, I was in a bad mood and did some bad tweets, and actually this is un-American, and of course this is their home, and America belongs to everybody."" That's not what he did. He just sort of pretended like: What? They were chanting? I didn't really hear that.

		ANNA PALMER [SENIOR DC CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO]: This is strategy he's done several times, though. I mean, wrote a story up on Politico today about this is not the first time the President goes really far and then kinda gets some heat and then takes a little step back.

		BERMAN: And it’s not the first time that he takes a step back and then un-steps the step back. He's on Twitter right now sort of equivocating on the whole thing. People can go look for themselves.

		CAMPBELL: But the more this happens, he makes the job of law enforcement harder. He makes the job of the Capital Police harder, who have to protect these members of Congress that are now in his verbal cross hairs, hoping, God forbid, that doesn't turn into reality.

		CAMEROTA: Such a great point, thank you very much Josh. And ladies, thank you also for the all the perspective.   The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

111,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/donald-trump-ilhan-omar-racism-repubulicans-intention.html?via=rss,"Mens rea: It’s a legal concept you learn the first week of law school. Mens rea means, simply, criminal intent: the capability of forming the mental inclination to do wrong, as distinct from the act of doing wrong. Translated from the Latin, it means “a guilty mind,” and the idea, for our purposes, is that if one cannot formulate the mental intent behind the bad thing, it is hard to say you are fully culpable. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously illustrated the concept of intent when he posited that “even a dog knows the difference between being stumbled over and being kicked.” Donald Trump’s most ardent defenders are attempting to invoke this concept when they try to argue that he isn’t a racist when he says racist things. This week, when Trump referenced Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and lied about her support of al-Qaida at one of his rallies, the crowd chanted, “Send her back. Send her back.” House Democrats warn, perhaps unnecessarily, that as a result of this race-baiting and fearmongering, her life is now in danger. But if it is, Donald Trump enthusiasts disagree that Trump had anything to do with this. They want us to know that he is not a nationalist bigot fomenting racism. They know this because they think he is either not capable of forming the intent to say the words he says or because he has good nonracist bones. Witness born-again Donald Trump enthusiast Lindsey Graham, who asserted forcefully on Wednesday that Trump cannot possibly be a racist because he is too much of a narcissist: ”I really do believe that if you’re a Somali refugee who likes Trump, he’s not gonna say, ‘Go back to Somalia.’ A racist says, ‘Go back to Somalia’ because you’re Somali or Muslim or whatever. That’s just the way he is. It’s more narcissism than anything else.” In other words, Trump’s hate for four congresswomen of color is not because he hates them, or because he hates people of color, but because they hate him, and he hates anyone who hates him. Also, he’s too mentally incapacitated by his stunning need for approval to form an actual racist thought. (This is, again, a form of the insanity defense, being applied to the sitting president.) Witness, too, the backup defense of Trump himself, who didn’t chant, but stood by while the bad chanters chanted. Sen. Thom Tillis, who attended the president’s rally Wednesday night, said, “A group of people chanted. He didn’t ask them to chant it. You can’t control that any more than you can control the reaction at a rock concert.” He added, during an appearance on Fox News Thursday morning, “Any time you get into a crowd like that and you’ve got a lot of supporters, they’re going to say what they want to say.” On Fox & Friends, apologists further emphasized that it was Trump’s supporters—not him—who initiated the chant. “On their own, yes, it was unsolicited,” Ainsley Earhardt said. Recall that Trump was describing Omar—and drawing out her foreign-sounding name—as an al-Qaida apologist when the crowd began chanting. But even that assumed too much intentionality on the part of real people, so Trump defenders quickly settled on the new argument that it was neither Trump nor his chanting supporters who were racist, but the chants themselves that were the racists. At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer insisted there was “no place” for the “send her back” rhetoric, but also repeated the new article of faith that the president does not have a “racist bone” in his body. Others expressed a similar sentiment: The “send her back” chants were wrong, vile, and don’t  reflect who we are as Americans.  I strongly oppose @IlhanMN views and policies  but those chants have no place in our society. Bad stupid chants. Walking around chanting themselves! Someone should punish them for being free-range chants. It’s a good thing nobody had the intent to say racist stuff. This leads to the next-level claims that even the chants weren’t to blame, because the chants didn’t mean what the words meant—they were simply a perfectly valid reaction that meant to say something else. Here is Sean Hannity saying—no, seriously—“I don’t think they were chanting, ‘Send her back’ so much as they’re saying, ‘These views are repugnant.’ ” Here are those views, hastily summarized: Though it was brief, I struggled with the “send her back” chant tonight referencing Rep. Omar.  Her history, words & actions reveal her great disdain for both America & Israel. That should be our focus and not phrasing that’s painful to our friends in the minority communities. The purpose here is just to establish that there can be no mens rea, no bad intent because the actual words that emanated from all of their mouths were not what we all heard them to be—they meant something else. Really, you can just choose your own ending. On Thursday morning, Donald Trump himself claimed that the chants were bad, bad chants and pointed out that he didn’t endorse them, much less cause them, and even that he tried to stop them, though there was no evidence at all that he did anything of the sort. If you were willing to stick around for the recap, it goes something like this: The president didn’t mean to say the racist thing, the crowd said the racist thing, but also, the racist thing the crowd said was itself to blame, rather than being the crowd’s fault, and plus, the president tried valiantly to stop it. Imagine if your best defense at a trial for doing something bad was “I didn’t steal the can of Spaghettios, it stole itself while I tried to stop the can from being stolen. Plus, I don’t have a Spaghettios-stealing bone in my body.” The mere fact that a man who never walks back a thing walked back “send them back” is his tell: He knows he crossed a line. It should go without saying that one does not have to intend to be racist to say and do racist things. But the fixation on absolving the president because he didn’t really mean it or didn’t know what would happen is particularly absurd, because we have been here before. After the Tree of Life mass shooting, I asked that we all stop trying to parse the president’s intention when he spews his hateful rhetoric. It is futile, as he continues to lie about what he has said and why he’s said it (perhaps because he does not know). I suggested that instead, we listen to what people believe they have heard. And here is what they have heard this time: Mitch McConnell says the president is “on to something” with his racist attacks on the congresswomen. Sen. Josh Hawley says, “It’s time we ended this cosmopolitan experiment and recovered the promise of our republic. Let’s start with this: America is not going to become the rest of the world, and the rest of the world is not going to become America.” White Supremacist Andrew Anglin wrote on his Daily Stormer site, “Man, President Trump’s Twitter account has been pure fire lately. This might be the funniest thing he’s ever tweeted. This is the kind of WHITE NATIONALISM we elected him for … And we’re obviously seeing it only because there’s another election coming up. But I’ll tell you, even knowing that, it still feels so good.” White supremacist Richard Spencer laments only that the racist tweets are not racist enough. Commenters on 8chan praised Trump’s words as an “essential first step” in normalizing the idea that individuals can choose not to exist alongside people they don’t like because of their skin color or where they come from. Violent white supremacists don’t need to listen for dog whistles because the president is saying it out loud. To paraphrase Andrew Gillum, I don’t much care if the president intends to be a racist. I care that millions of those who intend to be racists believe that he really, emphatically is one. The president stirs up racial fury in his followers. He blames it on the targets themselves, the media, and the Democrats, but he is the one doing it. Now, whipping up racist crowds to chant racist things isn’t a crime (though threatening to send people “home” does, in fact, appear to violate federal anti-discrimination laws). But the point is that millions of people admire Trump when he says explicitly racist things. His polling numbers rise, as they did this week. Which is why, even though he wants to (occasionally) claim he didn’t mean to, Trump is dead set on egging them on. His supporters’ intentions have never been more clear. They want to engage in a war over race, immigration, and intolerance. And Donald Trump is not stumbling. He’s taking deliberate shots.

Olivier Douliery/CNP via ZUMA Wire On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump offered yet another defense of the racist chants that broke out at his recent rally in North Carolina, by promoting a video of the event from the British political commentator Katie Hopkins: As you can see, I did nothing to lead people on, nor was I particularly happy with their chant. Just a very big and patriotic crowd. They love the USA! https://t.co/6IVKEffNnq — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2019  There’s a lot that’s wrong about Trump’s tweet. The crowd was following Trump’s cues—he really did tell Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to leave the country, and he paused for 13 seconds to let the chanting build. And perhaps more importantly, a mob of people chanting for a refugee-turned-American-citizen-turned-member-of-Congress to be deported to Somalia does not really love America that much. Trump wants credit for distancing himself from the crowd at the same time he’s enveloping them in the highest praise. But wait a second, who’s Katie Hopkins? Per Todd Schulte, the president of the immigration advocacy group FWD.US, she’s an anti-Muslim pundit who called for a “final solution” for Muslims in her country following a 2017 terrorist attack: Katie Hopkins, who the President quote tweets here, has said Jews were to blame for the Pittsburgh massacre because they supported immigration and called for a “final solution” for Muslims in the UK. See this: https://t.co/9s66qv8vmq and https://t.co/0s4FepsqqK https://t.co/szlqIvp3jK — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) July 20, 2019  Per that Guardian piece, Hopkins also “wrote a column for the Sun in which she compared migrants to cockroaches and suggested Europe should use gunboats to stop them crossing the Mediterranean.” Back in 2016, after a truck drove into a crowd in Nice killing dozens, Hopkins said, “I am not Islamophobic. Islam disgusts me. This is entirely rational.” Oh. Amplifying Hopkins’ voice is significant because Trump’s criticism of Omar is ostensibly that he believes she’s anti-semitic (because of her criticism of the Israeli government). But it was Hopkins who blamed last year’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Jewish leaders’ support for migrants. So where does Trump even find these people? Per the BBC, “Katie Hopkins first came under the public gaze when she was a contestant on the BBC TV series The Apprentice in 2007.” Of course.

113,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/opinion/sunday/tinder-bumble-okcupid-drama.html,"Advertisement Supported by Online, that’s what men say they want from women. Do they know nothing about life? By Laura Hilgers Ms. Hilgers writes about addiction, love and other topics. I was recently on the dating app Bumble when I came across the profile of an attractive middle-aged man, a few years younger than I am. He was born on the East Coast and had a big dog, which I liked. But then I read that he was “100 percent drama-free” and demanded that any dates be the same way. I thought, “Here’s somebody who probably won’t listen if I’m having a bad day” and swiped left to indicate my lack of interest. This guy was far from unusual. A surprisingly large number of men say they’re looking for “no drama” or something “drama-free” in their profiles, and I swipe left every time. Women write it too. But according to Tinder, which looked at the profiles of its American users earlier this year, heterosexual men were three times more likely to use these phrases than heterosexual women. Profiles of gay and lesbian users included the phrases much less often. Another dating app, OkCupid, examined the 2018 profiles of all its users in the United States without separating for sexual orientation  and found that men over all were 10 percent more likely to say this than women. They also found that 47 percent of millennial men said they were looking for no drama or something drama-free in their profiles, as did 25 percent of Gen X and 12 percent of baby boomer men. I understand that people want joy, laughter and happiness in their relationships. I want that too. But when heterosexual men say they’re looking for something “drama-free,” I suspect they want something that doesn’t exist: a problem-free partnership with someone who has no life experience. Are they looking for a woman who never gets angry or afraid or sad, who never worries about her family or struggles in her job? Who would want to be with such a person? One man I came across online even wrote, “No drama given or allowed.” Aside from questionable grammar, this implies an ability to control life that none of us possess. Life is full of drama. I know. I’ve experienced it. Although I’m an even-keeled person and daily meditator, I’ve still had to face challenges over the last eight years that I never saw coming and required all my strength to endure. After 23 years of marriage, I went through an unexpected and painful divorce. Several people I love deeply suffered from addiction and found their way to recovery (a sentence that doesn’t begin to capture nearly four years of hell). I had to sell our family home and move to a rental. Then I lost my beloved dog, Spike — which, weirdly, felt the worst, coming on top of everything else. Life got messy. But I know many people, including men, who have suffered far worse. It’s hard to live for any time without facing something difficult, whether it’s financial problems, illness, divorce or death. Some people call this “drama.” I call it life. Because I didn’t quite understand what men meant when they said they were looking for “no drama,” I spoke with Jessica Carbino, a sociologist in Los Angeles who specializes in online dating and who used to work for Bumble. She told me that when men in their 20s and 30s say they want something drama-free, they’re looking for women who are “lower maintenance.” When middle-aged men use it, they’re trying to avoid the entanglements that come with former spouses and family. “They could have just gone through a terrible divorce,” Dr. Carbino told me. “They could have presumably been dealing with a lot of issues with their own families, with their children, with their ex-spouses, and they want something that doesn’t present any type of problem or issue.” Vanessa Valenti, co-founder of the feminist website Feministing, had a different take. “I think it’s pretty sexist,” she told me. “You might as well say ‘no humans,’ you know? But sexist behavior exists offline, just like it does on dating apps. This is simply another medium.” She added, “I think there are unrealistic expectations put on women to be accommodating at all times in their relationships.” Ms. Valenti said that when men say they want no drama, “they’re signaling to others that they’re someone who’s incapable of witnessing and honoring another person’s feelings.” She also expressed concern that the numbers are higher, at least on OkCupid, the younger the men get. “It makes me wonder if it’s become more like online dating app lingo, which actually makes the ‘no drama’ potentially more dangerous because the more it’s used, the more it’s normalized as a common characteristic of a desirable partner and what a desirable partner should be,” she said. “Are we setting a precedent of the emotionless partner who has no needs? In my opinion, that would create a culture of pretty disastrous relationships.” Wouldn’t it make more sense for men and women in the dating world to look inward and develop compassion for themselves, rather than try to control the drama outside them? “When you’ve suffered in these serious ways,” Dr. Mark Epstein, a New York City psychiatrist and Buddhist author, told me, “it lets you see the suffering everywhere, if you’re not pretending that it’s not happening to you.” He said that the growth that results from looking honestly at your challenges and problems — in other words, from being vulnerable — also makes people better partners. “You might actually be more available, more open, more able to be with someone else as a result of this,” Dr. Epstein said. I also wonder if people mean it when they say they’re looking for “no drama.” Imagine “Romeo and Juliet” without the feuding future in-laws and “Brokeback Mountain” without society’s resistance to two men in love. Or “Casablanca” without the return of Ilsa’s husband, not to mention the Nazis who frequented Rick’s bar. Sometimes, love grows sweeter in contrast to the hardships. Perhaps we’re simply all on drama overload, and online profiles reflect what we’re experiencing in the world. We live on a planet whose climate is warming rapidly. We wait in fear of the next mass shooting. We have a president whose tweets elevate our heart rates daily. In a 2018 American Psychological Association survey, 69 percent of respondents reported that the future of the nation caused them stress — six percentage points higher than the year before. This precariousness seems like all the more reason to find a partner who can face the challenges and roll with them. There are days when you accidentally sideswipe your neighbor’s car or you have to check someone you love into rehab. Other days are steeped in joy. The kind of partner I’d like shows up for it all.

114,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/trump-send-her-back.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael Crowley BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Trump on Saturday extended the debate over a chant of “send her back!” at his campaign rally in North Carolina this week when he retweeted a right-wing British commentator who has drawn repeated condemnation over a long history of anti-Muslim remarks and for casting blame on a Jewish leader for provoking a synagogue shooting. Sending fresh mixed signals about his view of the chant directed at a Democratic lawmaker, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Mr. Trump shared video of the episode posted by the commentator, Katie Hopkins, who has said “Islam disgusts me” and who last year appeared to link a rabbi’s pro-migrant work to the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Ms. Hopkins was celebrating the moment in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday, suggesting that the crowd’s chant could be a new slogan for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. “Send her back is the new lock her up,” she wrote, referring to a refrain from the 2016 campaign directed at Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. “Well done to #TeamTrump,” she added. Mr. Trump, who has shifted his account of how he responded to the chant about Ms. Omar, posted Ms. Hopkins’s tweet on his own feed while adding commentary that placed some distance between himself and his supporters that night in Greenville. “As you can see, I did nothing to lead people on, nor was I particularly happy with their chant. Just a very big and patriotic crowd. They love the USA!” Mr. Trump wrote early Saturday from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The chant followed Mr. Trump’s attack on Ms. Omar and three of her fellow Democratic congresswomen of color — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — in which the president called on the lawmakers to “go back” to their countries. All of them are American citizens, and all but Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee, were born in the United States. A day after the Greenville rally, Mr. Trump, under pressure from congressional Republicans and even his own daughter, falsely claimed that he had tried to interrupt the chant, something clearly disproved by the video. Speaking to reporters on Friday, he declined an opportunity to criticize the chant, calling his supporters “incredible patriots” and saying he was unhappy that Ms. Omar “can hate our country.” It is unclear whether Mr. Trump was aware of the background of Ms. Hopkins, who is a notorious right-wing agitator and former columnist for The Daily Mail whose attacks on Muslims in particular have largely exiled her from the mainstream news media. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has often amplified, through retweets, the voices of white nationalists, fierce critics of Islam, conspiracy theorists and other activists and commentators from the far right. In May, Mr. Trump retweeted a conspiracy-theory account under the handle Deep State Exposed — whose Twitter profile claims 10 retweets by the president in all — that declared: “The ‘elite’ proclaim America must submit to Islam or else!!! #Trump2020.” That month he also retweeted a message ending with an A-O.K. emoji, which has become a symbol of the white nationalist movement. After a terrorist attack in May 2017 at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, Ms. Hopkins tweeted, “We need a final solution Manchester.” Soon after that, she left a job as a talk-show host with LBC radio in London. After a Tunisian man living in France killed 86 people in 2016 by driving a truck through a crowd in Nice, France, Ms. Hopkins incited another backlash by calling for mass deportations of Muslims. “I am not Islamophobic,” she wrote. “Islam disgusts me. This is entirely rational.” After the mass shooting last year at the Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 people dead, Ms. Hopkins suggested that the killer, who expressed fury online over a Jewish charity’s support for Muslim immigrants, had been provoked. “Look to the Chief Rabbi and his support for mass migration across the Med,” she wrote. “There you will find your truths.” It was unclear to whom Ms Hopkins was referring, but Britain’s most senior rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has advocated welcoming immigrants from south of the Mediterranean Sea. In response to an online uproar Saturday over the president’s retweet of her post, Ms. Hopkins followed up with another message. “Call me what you wish. Islamophobe. Bigot. Racist. Vile. It matters not,” she wrote. “What matters is the fight back for our Christian culture we desperately need to defend.” Advertisement",2019-07-20 19:41:18,Trump Sends New Mixed Signals on ‘Send Her Back’ Chant,,1,http://nytimes.com
115,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/20/i-was-a-hostage-at-the-2018-trader-joes-shooting-heres-what-i-know-now-about-trauma/,"For the viewers at home, most hostage stories end with the captives released and the suspect taken away in cuffs. The music soars, the credits roll, and news anchors return us to regular programming. Rarely do we see what happens next — that for many, it’s just the beginning of a new hell. Trauma is humbling — it took me nearly a year of resistance, setbacks and shame for me to finally accept that. Yes, the trapped miners are now free, but some now sleep with the light on. Some soldiers avoid Veteran’s Day parades — the uniforms alone are triggers. Me? I don’t shop at Trader Joe’s. On July 21, 2018, at 3:15 p.m., I was finishing up a quick trip to the store when a man fleeing police slammed his car into a pole outside the Trader Joe’s in the Silver Lake neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. The gunman ran for the entrance of the store, opening fire on the police. They shot back; an assistant manager was killed. You might have heard about it. It was a slow news day and most of the LAPD turned out. I'm told CNN carried it live, and the scene looked like a war zone. The view inside the store looked entirely different. About 75 shoppers and employees hid around the Trader’ Joes, but I only knew about us —  a small group kept near the gunman as he and one of the hostages tried to negotiate his surrender. A wounded, scared, frustrated young man, and 15 other people, sitting on the floor surrounded by a trail of blood. The situation dragged on in tense, elongated minutes, then hours. He threatened to kill us more than once. Terrified but furious, I resolved that — no matter what — I wasn’t going to die in a damn grocery store. But I also feared my legs wouldn’t work if I did try to flee. Would he shoot me in the back if I made a run for it? I sat there so long, I saw the blood begin to dry. It transformed from the bright, glistening Kubrick red to a duller rust color around the edges. Would my blood spill here too? The experience remains terrifying, heartbreaking and stupid beyond measure. Everyone responds differently to big events. That’s also true with trauma in general. Perhaps that’s why both individually and collectively, Americans know so little about the obvious consequences of our violent culture. I worked in TV news for decades where I watched and occasionally interviewed endless survivors of every imaginable horror, but I had no real understanding of what trauma can do to a person until it happened to me. And like countless others before me, I first assumed I was inoculated. “I’m strong. I won’t have PTSD.” I thought. “Sure, I’m rattled, but I’ll take a few weeks off, let the news cycle move on and that’ll be it.” To my complete surprise, the experience left me shattered. A simplified rundown of what happens in the body under extreme stress: When the fight or flight response fires, cortisol and adrenaline release. Non-essential functions are suppressed, including the immune system. When this goes on for a year or more, the body isn’t killing off cancer cells or fighting off other diseases. This is why stress can be a killer. A year later, I still have elevated cortisol levels. The tough don’t get traumatized — that’s the common belief. We assume we can predict how people will respond by their character and backbone, but it turns out those are wholly irrelevant yardsticks. Instead, reactions to trauma — including war, car crashes, rape, hurricanes, abusive relationships, alcoholic or otherwise unstable caregivers, assholes who hold people hostage inside stores, all other imaginable scenarios ad infinitum — impact some profoundly, while others who experience the same event bounce right back. We don’t know why. Evidence does show previous trauma, especially in childhood, can make one more vulnerable to post-traumatic stress and other health issues. Ongoing trauma, or a single extended event like mine, can do more damage than shorter “give me your wallet” scenarios, but that’s not a universal rule. After the standoff ended, dozens of well-meaning friends and co-workers all said roughly the same thing to me: “You’re so strong. You’ll be fine.” I agreed. After all, we tend to praise survivors for their courage even as their knuckles turn white from barely hanging on. We know that’s not what you want to see, so we hide it. When I was clearly impacted from the very beginning, I resisted admitting so. I feared that if the tears started, they might never stop. To prove to myself that I wasn’t defeated, I even returned to work in the hyper-violent daily news cycle. I needed the stability and to be doing something I’m good at. (Don’t underestimate the value of routine and feeling competent after a knockdown.) And it was OK — until it wasn’t. It’s not constant crying and panic attacks, after all. I was still functional. I did my shtick; I cracked jokes. I acted like everything was normal. I took my crying breaks then tried to shake it off. I felt ashamed every time symptoms flared, and beat myself up for not bouncing back sooner. Working in news after you’ve been news is like boiling a frog, only the frog is you. Anxiety builds cumulatively. A police pursuit Monday, a SWAT situation Tuesday, another pursuit Wednesday — by the time Thursday’s mass shooting, tornado or vivid security video footage of an armed robbery rolls around, I’d be hiding in an edit bay sobbing. The weekend isn’t enough time to recover when a breakdown looms. The barrier I once had that allowed me to do this gig got blown out in Trader Joe’s, and now I feel it all, and I see new trauma victims in every frame. Do they have help? Do they know what they’re in for? The people around me treated pursuits like sporting events. I did too, before. Now, the horrible knowledge I have stops me: Is some innocent person about to die? I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to get off the firing line. Getting back on the horse works in many life situations. Facing your fears does allow people to move past difficult experiences but in the case of post-traumatic stress, exposure therapy can prove counter-productive. One fellow hostage was told by his family just one week after the incident, “Aren’t you over that yet?” He was just coming out of the shock and beginning to feel the impact of that terrifying day. A second was forced by police to go back into the Trader Joe’s right after the event to speak with detectives and retrieve his stuff, and his supportive friends were told to wait outside. He told me this was one of the most damaging moments of the entire experience. Another hostage was pushed by family to shop at that same store within a couple weeks of the shooting — again, to “help him get over it” — even as he begged not to. Back when I covered crime, I remember interviewing a teenage girl and her family after she had been shot while riding an MTA bus. Her mother and brother said, in front of her, “She’s such a baby,” rolling their eyes, “she needs to get over it.” I have no idea if she ever received help for the likely trauma she suffered, or the additional wound her family inflicted by dismissing a terrifying, life-threatening event. My family was and is loving and patient. In my case, I was the bully to myself. Operating on an old, wrong idea that “if it hurts, it must be good for you,” I refused to accept I couldn’t just pick up where I left off. Once I decided, spontaneously, to walk into a different Trader Joe’s in order to face the tiger and pick up some arugula. Within 60 seconds of passing the flowers by the front door, a sea of Hawaiian shirts swam before me, blocking my path. Sounds went hollow, my vision distorted, and I couldn’t breathe. The anxiety attack forced me to put down the whip and slow down. Some experiences truly are life-changing: Trader Joe’s left me with a new, unfamiliar fragility and vulnerability that took time to accept. It would be many months before I slept through the night and dreamed about anything else. Simple things can sometimes overwhelm me now — any confrontation, encounter with sketchy people, or dealing with health insurance. I had to leave a café once because I couldn’t breathe. And I’m sure it’s not just me. Right after the event, one person after another grabbed my elbow, leaned in and quietly confessed. “I was robbed once. I can still see the black gun.” “I got jumped as a teenager and it took me a long time to be able to walk down a street alone.” “I was in a terrible car crash years ago. I still get scared driving down hills.” My doctor shared she was carjacked. So many stories. There is a basic human need to be heard, for these experiences to be recognized. I suspect they also wanted me to know I wasn’t alone. There is a club, mostly anonymous, filled with survivors. We are the members. You don’t get to decide whether you’ll have post-traumatic stress or if you’ll be spared. Whether you get it immediately or 20 years after the event, though, know it is not a disorder. In fact, it’s the natural order of things. These reactions and feelings are how the nervous system instinctively responds to abnormal events. In fact, I’ve got plenty of company in thinking the “D” in PTSD needs to go. That one little letter does tremendous damage. This was first pointed out to me by a friend from film school. Reluctantly — groups can sometimes be challenging now — I went to a gathering and had the fortune to be seated across from screenwriter Pete Chiarelli. Not only is he a wonderful writer, he’s also a thoroughly decent and compassionate human. He hadn’t known I was involved in the Trader Joe’s standoff until he saw me on the episode of “48 Hours.” Pete told me the “D” in PTSD is bullshit. I was so relieved to hear someone say that. I realized because of that letter — the “disorder” designation — I’d felt damaged. Broken. Labeled. Othered. Then he told me about his dad. General Peter Chiarelli Sr. served nearly 40 years before he retired, leading troops into battle and serving as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, among other distinguished positions. He’s also spent years working to help soldiers with both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTS, so I called him to talk about it. He describes the “D” as “a barrier to treatment” that he’s battled to get rid of. “I had these 24-year-old kids who came to me and said that they did not want to be told they had a disorder, so they wouldn’t go in and get help,” he said. “They didn’t want that on their medical record... so, they had to find a way to help themselves. What did they do? They drank. They took drugs. They looked for ways to self-medicate.” Self-medication makes the problem far worse. A warrior can’t tolerate being blasted by feelings; a warrior must conquer the enemy. But when the enemy is your own instinctive reaction that cannot be beaten with force, failure is the only perceived outcome. We all know about the horrific suicide rate among veterans. How many deaths can be linked back in part to the shame and stigma of this condition being labeled a disorder? The general went after the issue head-on, asking for the ""D"" to be dropped from PTSD. “I went before the American Psychiatric Association before they were getting ready to publish DSM V. I asked, would you please change the name? Would you please . . . drop the ‘D’?,” Chiarelli said. It didn’t work. Thanks to Chiarelli’s efforts, the armed forces have largely dropped the “D,” but the medical community yet to follow suit officially. Some psychiatrists have proposed the term ""post-traumatic stress injury"" instead. Yes, please. Since we can’t agree on the name, it’s not surprising that we know relatively little about post-traumatic stress. The only diagnostic testing is cognitive. There’s no blood test or other biological marker to determine the presence of anxiety, depression, PTS or other related conditions. Talk therapy helps a great deal, but trauma lives in the body. EMDR uses eye movements (or other bilateral stimulation) to desensitize and reprocess traumatic memories. Multiple studies show it’s highly effective, especially on short, one-time traumatic events such as a car crash or a hold-up, but it can occasionally be re-traumatizing. Ask me how I know. Somatic experiencing provides a gentler approach to the same process, but it takes time. Not to mention that these treatments, and therapy in general, can be expensive, and specialists can be difficult to find outside of metropolitan areas. Fortunately, there’s movement toward helping the youngest victims. Drawing from the ACE (adverse childhood experiences) study out of San Diego that shows the relationship between toxic stress in childhood and disease in adults, the House Oversight and Reform Committee recently held its first hearing on identifying, preventing, and treating childhood trauma. California’s Surgeon General is focused on addressing toxic stress in children across the state. I hope we’ll start talking seriously about not just trauma, but the acute stress so many of us live with. To the body it’s all the same. A year after my hostage experience, meditation, frequent exercise and trauma and talk therapy, along with regular connection time with friends and family are helping me find my new normal. I avoid unnecessary activation. I love David Fincher, but I won’t be watching “Mindhunter” — or for that matter, “Killing Eve” or “Homeland.” Suspense and violence are no longer entertaining to me. Shortly after the shooting, my darling friend, a musician and dancer, sat on my sofa and told me her story. It’s harrowing, horrifying, and haunting — and hers to tell, not mine. I wept with her. She said that now I also understand what it means to be powerless in a way most don’t, and if I could dive into it, to really own the vastness and the deep truth of that powerlessness, it offers a profound spiritual knowledge. Then it becomes your superpower. Mass shootings will continue. This is certain. There are too many guns and too many people in need of help who don’t get it. Trauma is the great untold story of America now. Since we are clearly unable to stop the endless violence, we must do better to help those suffering from the natural impact of these unnatural events. We also have to care more — about everyone. From what I have read in the court documents and elsewhere about the perpetrator in the Trader Joe’s standoff, it sounds like he too has untreated trauma. He even told one of the hostages that day that he just needed someone to talk to. Can we please start listening?

116,https://pjmedia.com/faith/victory-for-religious-freedom-gov-greg-abbott-signs-save-chick-fil-a-bill/,"On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) signed S.B. 1978, the “Save Chick-fil-A” bill, into law, on a table with Chick-fil-A chicken sandwiches, cups, and a little cow with the words “Eat Mor Chickin.” The bill will prevent Texas government actors from discriminating against religious groups or those associated with them. It followed the San Antonio airport’s ban on Chick-fil-A, citing “a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior” and calling the fast food chain “a symbol of hate.” That action may or may not be blatantly unconstitutional, but on Thursday it became illegal, as well. “Discrimination is not tolerated in Texas,” Abbott said in signing the legislation. “No business should be discriminated against simply because its owners gave to a church or to the Salvation Army or to any other religious organization. No business should lose a government contract because of their religious beliefs.” Today I signed the ⁦@ChickfilA⁩ law in Texas. And, had a great lunch. No business should be discriminated against simply because its owners donate to a church, the Salvation Army, or other religious organization. Texas protects religious liberty. pic.twitter.com/1QwSTuoWu0 — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 19, 2019  Indeed, liberals have slammed Chick-fil-A as hateful or discriminatory to LGBT people because it contributes to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army. As Vox noted, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes requires its employees to refrain from “homosexual acts,” since the Bible clearly condemns such acts as sinful. The Salvation Army also upholds the biblical understanding of sexuality. It turned down $3.5 million in San Francisco city contracts due to requirements that city contractors provide spousal benefits to same-sex partners of employees. These current contributions pale in comparison to Chick-fil-A’s recent history, however. When CEO Dan Cathy expressed support for traditional marriage in 2012, outrage ensued and liberal outlets reported far more “scandalous” contributions. Cathy said the U.S. was “inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and we say we know better than you what constitutes a marriage.” Strong words, but in keeping with traditional religious teaching, be it Jewish, Christian, or Islamic. This infuriated LGBT activists, who also discovered that the WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded in 1984 by Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, donated money to socially conservative charities such as Eagle Forum, Focus on the Family, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Family Research Council (FRC), Exodus International, and the Marriage & Family Legacy Fund. Activists denounced this funding as contributions to “anti-gay groups,” and indeed such organizations support the traditional Bible definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. These organizations have been demonized, with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) accusing FRC of being a “hate group” — an accusation that inspired a terrorist to attempt a mass shooting in 2012. After a nationwide boycott — and a conservative rush to buy at Chick-fil-A called “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,” led by former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) — the company apologized for its comments and the WinShape Foundation stopped funding the “anti-gay” organizations. In 2018, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to apologize after eating Chick-fil-A during June, the designated LGBT Pride Month. The relentless cultural onslaught against traditional understandings of marriage and the family may be the most powerful semi-political form of bigotry in America today. When Abbott signed the bill, David Badash at The New Civil Rights Movement slammed Abbott’s previous tweet defending traditional marriage as “anti-gay hate.” Marriage was defined by God. No man can redefine it. We will defend our religious liberties. #tcot — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) June 26, 2015  Worse, Badash accused Chick-fil-A of continuing to fund organizations it is no longer supporting. “Chick-fil-A’s owners didn’t just give to a church, the Salvation Army, or to a religious organization, they have donated millions of dollars to actively anti-LGBT organizations and donated to at least one anti-gay hate group,” he wrote. “By funding groups that work to oppose and oppress LGBT people and same-sex marriage Chick-fil-A is harming people in America. It is contributing to a world view that demonizes loving relationships. And in a time in which hate crimes are on the rise Chick-fil-A is helping to fund the seeds of hate.” Not only did Badash endorse the vile accusation that FRC is a “hate group” — again, an accusation that inspired a terrorist attack — but he also falsely accused Chick-fil-A of continuing to fund groups it stopped funding years ago. There was nothing wrong with the company contributing to these groups — after all, liberal companies routinely give to LGBT activist groups like the SPLC or the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which demonize their opponents as hateful bigots. The SPLC’s rhetoric has actually resulted in incitement and violence — something these groups cannot say about FRC. Disagreements about hot-button issues like same-sex marriage are no excuse for discrimination or incitement against dissenters. In the case of Chick-fil-A, accusations of anti-LGBT “hate” are extremely misplaced. Not only has the chicken joint never turned away a gay customer for his or her sexual orientation, but Chick-fil-A went out of its way to provide free food in solidarity with the victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. The company even opened on a Sunday — a one-time exception to its unique practice of closing every Lord’s Day — in order to serve those who contributed in a blood drive to help the victims of the shooting at a gay nightclub. Thankfully, the attacks on Chick-fil-A seem far outweighed by the restaurant’s excellent service and delicious food. According to National Restaurant News, Chick-fil-A was the fastest-growing restaurant chain in America for the past year. The chicken joint took third place among U.S. restaurants in sales — with $10.46 billion. So many activists in America hate Chick-fil-A, but the recent turn of positive events may suggest that somebody higher up likes them — and I’m not talking about Greg Abbott.

A half dozen people packed inside but despite the heat, most wore long pants and boots, and several sported black hoodies. The atmosphere was subdued, except for the occasional joke. It wasn’t so much tension as seriousness – there was work to be done. The people in the van are members of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club (PSJBGC). Their stated aim is to fight white supremacy and build community defense in America’s Pacific north-west, and their presence has become a fixture of protests in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, where the group is often invited to provide security against rightwing aggression.  The night before, several of them had been called to a library in nearby Renton, Washington, where a Drag Story Time Hour, an event series in which a local drag queen or drag king reads to children in a library or bookstore, was being disrupted by rightwing protesters. The protesters, who opposed the event as “immoral”, held up signs equating drag with pedophilia, and screamed “Shame! Shame!” at parents and their kids. Among them were members of the Proud Boys, a violent rightwing street gang, and Three Percenters militia, who were open-carrying firearms. The north-west has been at the center of tense political clashes over the last two years. The area is an adopted home base for far-right groups like Patriot Prayer, Identity Evropa/American Identity Movement and the Proud Boys, who have organized numerous marches that have ended in violence. In response, a range of leftist groups have organized self defence groups and, in doing so, present gun ownership as a way to protect themselves and others. Now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was en route to Seattle’s Trans Pride March. In the weeks prior, word spread that a number of white supremacist groups had planned to disrupt the celebration. Hearing this, the club reached out to the organizers of the event, the Gender Justice League, and offered to assist with security or to provide escorts. Brooke Wylie, the head of security for the Gender Justice League in charge of overseeing the 101-person security detail for the event, did some research on the club. She told them the event had a policy of having no open carry (that is, no visible weapon), which they were fine with. She accepted their offer. Police were also present, but many marginalized groups do not trust them to provide protection at public events, especially when far-right groups are involved. Each member showed up with a concealed handgun. “We do our actions proportional to the threat, so when other people are out with rifles, we’ll be out with rifles,” Nick, the group’s de facto spokesperson, explained. “In this case, we don’t want to appear threatening for the people that we’re trying to protect and support; we want this to be a happy atmosphere, especially for a population that may have faced gun violence on the street just for being who they are.” This scenario – in which armed community groups are working together to patrol a Pride event and protect it from other malicious and potentially armed groups – is becoming more and more common. There are more guns than people in America – approximately 393 million in a country of 328 million people. An average of 34,501 people died each year from firearms; in 2018, 992 of those deaths were the result of police shootings. And the memory of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, when 49 people were killed at a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida, is still hanging heavily over the LGBTQ community. Throughout the day, Puget Sound members stood watch oversections of the park, staying connected via walkie-talkies. “Thank you for being here!” was a common refrain from march-goers, as were inquiries on how to join (the group has a several-month long vetting process and probationary period for prospective recruits.) Unlike some of the other masked antifascist groups at the march that day, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club consider themselves to be an “aboveground” organization, and choose not to cover their faces. “Part of the reason we don’t cover our faces is that we don’t want to present as though we are a militia,” Fozz, a longtime member, explained. “We are not. We want to build relationships with people in our community, we want to appear approachable.” While the group has not used deadly force, a former member of the group, Willem Van Spronsen, recently made headlines when he was killed by police after trying to set fire to Ice vehicles in a parking lot outside the Northwest Detention Center In Tacoma, Washington, a private immigration detainment facility. Gun control advocates are quick to point out that more guns often means more violence, no matter the intent behind them. A recent Stanford University study challenged the longstanding conservative view that more guns equals less crime, finding that states that adopted “right-to-carry” laws (which legalized concealed carry) saw a 13% increase in violent crime over 10 years. Washington state’s relatively loose gun laws mean that even those with minimal training are able to show up to public events armed, which has potentially lethal implications. At a Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of Washington in 2017, an antifascist protester was shot in the stomach by a Trump supporter named Elizabeth Hokoana, who then claimed self-defense; if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison. This is the context in which an armed community defense group has been invited to protect a trans pride event. The thinking goes that, since there are already guns everywhere, and the people who want to hurt minority groups are often heavily armed, their side may as well have guns, too. When asked about how they would react if a survivor of gun violence came up and confronted them about their decision to bring guns into a public protest space, the Puget Sound Club members say that they would approach the situation with empathy. A member named Seraphiad pointed to their own history with gun violence as a starting point. “The reason some people decide to carry is because they too have been victims of gun violence and other forms of violence,” they explained. “I would relate to them based on my own experience with violence and share my choice to protect myself.” For many other left-leaning organizations, guns remain a difficult topic. The second amendment has attained almost religious significance to some conservative gun owners, while gun control has become a defining issue for centrists and liberals, the opinions of those on the more radical left vary. The Democratic Socialists of America, for example, responded to an interview request for this piece by saying, “the DSA has no comment on gun controls or the second amendment. Our members represent a diversity of viewpoints on this topic.” Others have been more forthcoming. Patrick Blanchfield, the author of a forthcoming book on guns and the left called Gunpower, doesn’t specifically oppose the idea of armed self-defense, but he sees it as a potential danger to both the individual as well as a broader group or community, referencing the government’s brutal assaults on the Black Panthers as a historical example. Blanchfield also sees an issue in the way armed groups have the potential to inadvertently replicate existing oppressive structures. “You don’t want to be the antifa cop,” he explains. “For example, I would need some convincing that armed leftists didn’t shoot partners at a rate substantially lower than non-leftists.” The Puget Sound chapter is part of a long American leftist tradition of armed groups, from the Black Panthers to current groups like Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association, Trigger Warning Queer & Trans Gun Club, and the Los Angeles Black Coyote Collective. Twenty-one members turned up that day. Nick, Fozz and a member who goes by Reverend were joined by Cat, a diminutive, self-described “soccer mom”; quiet, serious Vixen, with strawberry blonde hair and orange knee socks; Duke, the group’s stocky, bearded founder; and Shannon, a civil rights attorney and constitutional law professor. There are plenty of anarchists among their ranks, but there are also people like Shannon who feel strongly about the second amendment and who are more interested in working within existing frameworks than tearing them down. “There’s power in knowledge of the constitution,” she explains. “It’s OK to be a knowledgeable person whose politics are left of center, and be willing to understand and fight back within the legal framework.” Duke, a lifelong anarchist who founded the Seattle chapter in 2017, describes himself as having retired from activism following the birth of his son in 2012. He did “normal progressive Seattle dad” things like taking his family to Black Lives Matter and Fight for 15 rallies until 2017, when he was inspired to act following the election of Donald Trump – and more specifically, by the proliferation of hate crimes that plagued Seattle during its lead-up. According to the Seattle Times, hate crimes increased in Washington by 32% between 2016 and 2017, and Duke, who is Jewish, had a front-row seat. “I really got active in John Brown Gun Club because there were swastikas in my kid’s park,” he says. “I knew a lot of people at that point who were organizing with Redneck Revolt across the country, so I was like, this is something I can do. So I formed this chapter, and members started flocking to us.” The rise of white supremacist violence since 2016 served as a flashpoint for many members’ decisions to arm themselves. Fozz, who is Jewish, told a story about sitting down with his wife after Trump’s election and deciding which of them was going to learn how to use a gun, “because we’re going to need it.” For others, it was the shock of violence at the fatal 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that sparked their interest in armed self-defense. “After Charlottesville, there was this recognition that there has to be somebody who’s not on the right who is willing to be in places that law enforcement either isn’t willing to be, or where law enforcement is supporting fascists,” Shannon explains. “When you see law enforcement escorting Nazi groups to parades [in places like DC or Detroit] you realize there’s a space to be filled by people who are confident in their skill as gun owners but whose bigger mission is community defense and protection.” For Vixen, the decision to join came from the threats rightwing extremism poses to her identity. A trans woman who grew up shooting guns off her front porch in Indiana, she spoke about the toxic culture she had encountered at many gun ranges, and of the obligation she felt to protect her queer community. “Today, I’m a trans woman at Trans Pride, so I feel like I’m personally able to step in front and put myself in front of people who are being attacked or harassed and just try to de-escalate the situation – which is always the goal,” she said. “Obviously, you don’t ever want to celebrate having to use force on someone, but completely throwing it away as an option is really self-defeating.” So far, none of the members have had to use their weapons in this context, and the hope expressed is that they never will. The day after the march, Cat, Nick, Duke, Reverend and Fozz gathered at a coffee shop to debrief. The club views gun control through a specifically leftist political lens. As Duke sees it, the root cause of American violence isn’t the guns themselves; it’s inequality. “It comes out of not wanting to arm former slaves and people in poverty who are struggling and organizing, and so when we talk about gun control in America, what we really should be talking about is capital control. If you read the Dred Scott decision, there’s a line in there that says ‘We don’t want to grant citizenship because Black people might get guns,’ and I think that says an awful lot about America and gun control.” White privilege is something that is repeatedly brought up throughout the weekend (while there are people of color in the organization, the membership is majority white). Shannon says that, due to her “middle-aged white lady veneer,” she knows she will be treated differently by police when she open carries at a protest. In a recent appearance on W Kamau Bell’s United Shades of America, a documentary series for CNN in which he travels America to explore race-based subcultures, Duke and several other members sat down with the comedian and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza to talk guns and race; the episode was shown on CNN, and netted the group a significant amount of attention – some positive, some less so from the rightwing trolls who targeted them on social media. It was a reminder, they say, that public exposure brings risks. Members face serious potential repercussions in both their personal and professional lives, as well as constant threats from rightwing extremists. Fozz, a union organizer by trade, has been on suspension for the past four months after his involvement with the PSJBCG during his off hours was made the subject of an investigation at work. His supervisors identified a photo of him open-carrying at a protest; according to Fozz, the suspension was framed as a workplace safety issue because his bosses believe that he is capable of violence. “It’s very disappointing as well as deeply concerning that an organization like a labor union would actually be critical of someone that takes the time and resources and expenses to stand up to people that would attack its membership,” he says. “I asked them the question, why do you guys have such a problem with a Jew standing up to neo-Nazis that are threatening his neighborhood?” That weekend, none of the Proud Boys or other fascist provocateurs did show up to Trans Pride. For now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was off the clock.",2019-07-22 01:00:16,"‘If others have rifles, we’ll have rifles’: why leftist groups are taking up arms",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit July 22, 2019 | 12:46pm				| Updated July 22, 2019 | 12:53pm A former Democratic hopeful for Florida’s House of Representatives confessed to making up claims that she removed 77 bullets from Pulse nightclub victims, flatly admitting to state investigators that she lied about her dramatic response to the mass shooting. Elizabeth McCarthy, 50, confessed to the Florida Department of Health that she lied about removing the bullets from nearly three dozen victims after the June 2016 nightclub shooting that killed 49 people and wounded 53 others, according to a charging affidavit obtained by FloridaPolitics.com. “I lied,” McCarthy told an investigator, according to documents released by the agency Wednesday. “It is a false statement.” McCarthy was introduced in late March as a physician by US Rep. Darren Soto while speaking during a gun safety town hall in Orlando, where she was joined by a Pulse survivor and a sheriff, video shows. “It’s probably one of the hardest things of my career to work through,” McCarthy said. “I personally removed 77 bullets from 32 victims … It was like an assembly line.” McCarthy later withdrew from the race for Florida’s House District 28 after the website investigated her claims and found no record with state health officials of her being a doctor — or any physician who worked at Orlando Regional Medical Center by that name. “I wanted to be somebody in the community, and I’m sorry,” McCarthy told a Florida Department of Health investigator. “I’m sorry that I gave any impersonation. I knew it was wrong and I should have stopped – by no means did I ever mean to put anybody in jeopardy.” McCarthy, of Sanford, could not be reached for comment Monday. She’s now facing a fine of $3,094 for lying about being a doctor and is barred from telling anyone else that she is a physician, FloridaPolitics.com reports. The Seminole County Democratic Party had previously called on McCarthy to drop out of the race unless she provided proof of her medical background. State health records show she was a registered nurse in Florida until 2005 when her license expired. She then ran a company called Medical Concierge from 2009 through 2014, FloridaPolitics.com reports.

          / CBS News A former Democratic candidate for Florida's House of Representatives admitted to lying about being a doctor and treating victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Elizabeth McCarthy, who dropped out of the race last month, said to a state investigator, ""I lied."" ""I'm sorry that I gave any impersonation,"" McCarthy told the investigator, according to Florida Department of Health documents obtained by CBS News. ""I knew it was wrong and I should have stopped, by no means did I ever mean to put anybody in jeopardy."" McCarthy, 50, was running in a district that includes suburban Orlando. She had claimed on the campaign trail that she is a medical doctor who treated victims of the 2016 shooting at Pulse, which left 49 people dead and 53 injured. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. ""Yes, I was working that night,"" McCarthy said, according to the documents. ""I removed 77 bullets out of 32 people and helped with the triage."" She told the story at a gun safety town hall in March, with Democratic Rep. Darren Soto and a Pulse shooting survivor in attendance. McCarthy, who is gay, gave an emotional speech about having to treat victims from the LGBTQ club. ""That night, because I'm gay, it struck me even harder,"" she said at the town hall. ""Because these were my people."" She filed to run for the Florida House days later. Her claims were called into question after Florida Politics reported that it could not verify that she was a doctor, treated Pulse victims or attended several schools where she claimed to have had medical training. McCarthy had once worked as a register nurse, but publicly presented herself as a doctor for years. McCarthy initially fired back at the report, writing in a Facebook post that it was a ""campaign smearing."" ""I did think about shutting down my campaign after this attack I was not ready for. I am not going to do that,"" McCarthy wrote in the post, which has since been deleted. ""I have a passion for legislation, apparently not up to snuff on campaigning but I am learning. I am MOVING FORWARD."" But the local Democratic Party withdrew support for her and Pulse survivors demanded she drop out. ""Elizabeth told our community for 3yrs that she, a doctor, removed bullets from patients after Pulse,"" Brandon Wolf, a Pulse survivor, wrote on Twitter. ""She was called a hero.  Elizabeth is not a doctor & wasn't on staff that night. I don't know why she lied and used our grief for her gain. But she needs to withdraw & let us heal."" McCarthy later announced her exit from the race, citing ""thoughtful contemplation"" and ""professional obligations."" Her statement about dropping out made no mention of her fabrications. The Florida Department of Health charged McCarthy with violating a state law by lying about being a doctor. She will have to pay a $1,000 fine and additional investigative costs. She also received a cease-and-desist letter saying she can no longer tell anyone she is a doctor. McCarthy told CBS News that, due to the cease-and-desist letter, she was ""unable to speak to anyone regarding this matter."" First published on July 22, 2019 / 4:41 PM © 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris (D-Ca) used the seventh anniversary of “the mass shooting at the Aurora movie theater in Colorado” to lament that “Congress hasn’t done enough” on gun control. Harris is right, but not for the reasons that she thinks. Neither Congress nor Colorado is passing any bills that would have stopped mass public shootings. She says that she is frustrated, but I am frustrated that she and other Democrats aren’t proposing anything useful to stop these attacks. Like virtually all these killers, the Aurora shooter sought out a gun-free zone to attack. Harris’s push for background checks on the private transfer of guns wouldn’t have made a difference in the Aurora attack. Her proposed ban on assault weapons wouldn’t have mattered. In addition to his semi-automatic rifle, the killer also had a semi-automatic handgun and a shotgun. Harris’s twist on the debate is that she will use executive action if she can’t get Congress to institute these new gun controls. But she ignores why the killer picked the target that he did. You might think that it was the one closest to the killer’s apartment. Or, that it was the one with the largest audience. Yet, neither explanation is right. Instead, out of all the movie theaters within 20 minutes of the killer’s apartment showing the new Batman movie that night, it was the only one where guns were banned. In Colorado, individuals with permits can carry a concealed handgun in most malls, stores, movie theaters, and restaurants. However, private businesses can determine whether permit holders can carry guns on their private property. Most movie theaters allow permit holders carrying guns. The Cinemark movie theater was the only one with a sign posted at the theater’s entrance. A simple web search and some telephone calls reveal how easily one can find out how Cinemark compared to other movie theaters. According to mapquest.com and movies.com, seven movie theaters were showing “The Dark Knight Rises” on July 20th within 20 minutes of the killer’s apartment at 1690 Paris St, Aurora, Colorado. At 4 miles and an 8-minute car ride, the Cinemark’s Century Theater wasn’t the closest. Another theater was only 1.2 miles (3 minutes) away. There was also a theater just slightly further away, 10 minutes. It is the ""home of Colorado's largest auditorium,"" according to their movie hotline greeting message. The potentially huge audience ought to have been attractive to someone trying to kill as many people as possible. Four other theaters were 18 minutes, two at 19 minutes, and 20 minutes away. But all of those theaters allowed permitted concealed handguns. So why would a mass shooter pick a place that bans guns? The answer should be obvious, though it apparently is not clear to the media – disarming law-abiding citizens leaves them as sitting ducks. Concealed carry is much more frequent than many people believe. With over 4 percent of the adult population in Colorado having concealed handgun permits at that time, a couple hundred adults in Cinemark’s movie theater #9 means that there is an extremely high probability that at least one adult would have a permitted concealed handgun. Unfortunately, some have still not figured this out. A manager at the Harkins Northfield 18 five miles from the killer’s apartment told me, the theater changed its policy and started banning concealed handguns following the Cinemark attack. The diary of the Batman movie theater killer made it clear that he was considering both attacking an airport and a movie theater.  But he turned down the airport option because he was concerned about their “substantial security.” Colorado was by no means the only time that killers targeted gun-free zones. Just this year we have seen all the attacks in gun-free zones: in a public employee-only area of a Virginia Beach municipal building; a business in Aurora, Illinois; and a Florida bank. Just seven mass public shootings since 1950 took place where at least four people died in an area where general civilians are allowed to have guns, and it was not part of some other crime. And remember the 1999 Columbine attack in Colorado. Few appreciate that Dylan Klebold, one of the two Columbine killers, was following Colorado legislation that would have let citizens carry a concealed handgun. Presumably, he feared someone with a weapon stopping his attack. The day of the attack was not by accident. The Columbine attack occurred the same day the state legislature planned final passage of the concealed handgun bill. Gun-free zones are a magnet for those who want to kill many people quickly. Even the most ardent gun control advocate would never put “Gun-Free Zone” signs on their home. Let’s stop finally putting them elsewhere. John R.

124,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/bill-barr-tells-tech-to-open-encrypted-messages-for-investigations.html," U.S. Attorney General William Barr warned technology companies on Tuesday that they need to immediately start working with law enforcement, helping agencies gain access to encrypted messages during critical investigations. In a keynote address at the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York, Barr said that the inability for law enforcement to tap into communication among dangerous actors is a major threat to public safety and national security. ""Obviously, the Department would like to engage with the private sector in exploring solutions that will provide lawful access,"" Barr said, according to his prepared remarks. ""While we remain open to a cooperative approach, the time to achieve that may be limited."" His message touched on a key source of conflict between law enforcement officials and tech executives. While investigators argue that access to encrypted messages can be critical to national security, tech companies warn that providing a backdoor into encrypted services is a slippery slope. The attorney general didn't call out Apple by name, but his address sounds familiar to anyone who followed the aftermath of the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernadino, California, which left 14 people dead.  During the investigation, a federal judge asked Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone belonging to the alleged shooter. But Apple denied the request, with CEO Tim Cook saying it would require the company to write code that would be ""a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks."" While the Department of Justice ultimately said it managed to access the phone's data on its own, Barr made clear that the agency doesn't want to deal with such technical hurdles in the future. Barr cited other terrorist incidents and referenced drug cartels, who are using encrypted platforms to hide their communication. One example he included was a Mexican cartel trafficking large amounts of fentanyl from Asia to Mexico and then the U.S. He said the cartel was using Facebook's WhatsApp messaging system, making it impossible for U.S. law enforcement to conduct wiretaps. ""Warrant-proof encryption is also seriously impairing our ability to monitor and combat domestic and foreign terrorists,"" Barr said. ""As with drug cartels, we are seeing terrorist organizations moving their communications to encrypted platforms designed to block lawful access. Even smaller terrorist groups and 'lone wolf' actors have turned increasingly to encryption."" Rather than providing prescriptive solutions, Barr said it's up to the private sector to develop methods of access and dismissed claims that those measures are impossible. ""[T] here have been enough dogmatic pronouncements that lawful access simply cannot be done,"" Barr said. ""It can be, and it must be."" Barr's speech comes as Facebook is preparing to bake in more encryption into its messaging services. The company said earlier this year it plans to integrate and encrypt its three messaging platforms — Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push for a more ""privacy-focused"" internet. Facebook is already facing scrutiny related to antitrust concerns and could now face another obstacle in pursuing its strategy. ""The rest of the world has woken up to this threat,"" Barr said.

(What 1980s anti-apartheid campaigner would have predicted that?) The recent case of two gay women beaten up on a London bus is a reminder that this is not a matter of “identity politics”: it is about real prejudice and real violence against real people. Joiner’s film is a fierce reminder of that, and we hear from a number of witnesses, including Lisa Power, Michael Cashman, Chris Smith and the heroic veteran Peter Tatchell.  Yet, like love, the course of LGBT rights campaigning does not always run smooth and the film gives an extensive, but incomplete history of internal disagreements. It falls to Tatchell to point out that, while campaigners were justifiably enraged by the 2016 mass shooting in Orlando, political correctness precluded interest in the Islamist massacres of gay people in Africa and the Middle East. The film boldly includes a spokesperson for Black Pride who suggests that the LGBT movement has too often been a white movement in which black people are marginalised – although the film does not address the contention that some lesbians now feel alienated. As for the obvious problem involved in opposing Islamophobia and homophobia at the same time, well, Islam is hardly the only religion or ideology officially antipathetic to gay people, and there has to be room for reformation and evolutionary growth.

128,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/25/online-extremists-shake-the-internet-economy-1617531,"Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, said the technological illiteracy of some members of Congress could be a challenge in effectively regulating online extremism. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo Global Translations POLITICO’s latest Global Translations podcast examines growing global pressure to regulate political neutrality, hate speech and extremist online content By LUIZA CH. SAVAGE and NANCY SCOLA 07/25/2019 05:02 AM EDT Updated 07/25/2019 08:07 AM EDT A top Twitter adviser has a stern warning for governments considering new ways to rein in disinformation and hateful speech online: Such rules threaten to cleave the global internet at the expense of democracy. “If you lose this global open internet — and start having a more fragmented internet — then that’s going to be colossally damaging not just for speech around the world but also for open democratic norms,” said Nick Pickles, Twitter’s senior strategist for global policy. And even if the U.S. government does try to act, Congress might not be up to the task because of the technological illiteracy of some of its members, according to Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) The myriad challenges in how to deal with disinformation and hateful speech on the internet emerged in interviews by Pickles, Khanna and others with POLITICO’s Global Translations podcast. It comes as lawmakers, regulators and anti-violence advocates have argued that bad actors ranging from online bullies to terrorist organizations have embraced social media. They say digital platforms haven’t done enough on their own to combat the threat. And while government efforts to compel action in the U.S. have been limited, political leaders around the world are growing less restrained. That has platforms on the defensive. “We’re at the dawn of this century that’s going to be defined by three or four big global powers that are going to be using the internet as a massive extension of their geopolitical power,” Pickles told the podcast. “Right now, whenever I go to a government, they say, ‘How do we recreate Silicon Valley? How do we have the next company like yours in our country?’ And I see people [in the U.S.] talking about losing the regulatory framework that gave you that — when the rest of the world is begging for a little bit of that kind of magic.” A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Regulation could also stifle the creation of new start-ups and preempt competition, he warned, locking in the dominance of the existing tech companies that many politicians already say are too powerful — and should be broken up for the sake of promoting competition. “Social media is barely 15 years old. We’re just at the beginning of the information century. And depending on the regulatory steps you take now, you [could] pull the ladder up and basically you’re left with the companies you have now. That’s it,” he said. “The risk is that if you if you throw the baby out with the bathwater, you lose that competition.” Pickles said the company is addressing the influx of harmful online content by, among other things, spotting and removing bad actors through both artificial intelligence and human review, sharing best practices with other online platforms and being more transparent about its rules and decision-making process. Twitter recently began labeling tweets that violate its terms of service but remain on the platform because of their news value — a move widely interpreted as aimed at President Donald Trump. Twitter is among the social media platforms that have joined the Christchurch Call, a voluntary agreement put together by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron in the wake of a March mass shooting in New Zealand, video of which spread on social networks. Under the arrangement, the platforms agree to take ""transparent, specific measures"" to combat the spread of terrorist and violent extremist content. In Washington, Republicans have demanded that the social platforms refrain from what they see, citing minimal evidence, as the sites' tendencies to discriminate against conservative voices. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, has proposed legislation that would require companies like Twitter and Facebook to be certified as ""politically neutral"" before they can enjoy decades-old limits on their liability for the content users post to them. Silicon Valley’s congressman, Ro Khanna, told the podcast that Congress is ill-equipped to regulate social media — citing the ill-informed questions some senators asked Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing in April. “You don't need to be a doctor to regulate health care but you do have to have basic curiosity and a basic understanding of expertise,” he said. “And so if someone was testifying as a doctor and people were asking them, ‘Well, is my heart located in my feet?‘ people would laugh. And that's the level of sophistication that many members of Congress showed. It's not that they were required to have computer science degrees. It's that they didn't know what apps were. They didn't know that Apple made the iPhone and not Google. They didn't know that Facebook sold ads. Most junior high school students have a greater knowledge of technology than many of the members of Congress.” In the place of government intervention, Khanna argued social media companies should form a consortium to remove certain kinds of content. “I would argue that these tech companies should form a consortium to come up with some basic guidelines. They should have a review of the material that tags information that has excessive hate speech or that is targeting minorities. And then they need to have human review once the initial tag has been placed to see whether it's a news item or whether it's something that isn't a news item. And if it's not a news item and it's hateful speech they should remove it,” he said. Meanwhile, Europe has begun passing or contemplating a range of laws addressing online hate speech. Germany, for example, has adopted a rule requiring sites to pull down illegal content within a day of being notified of it; France and the UK are considering similar proposals. Many experts say those rules are incompatible with American constitutional protections on free speech. Khanna said there are other reasons the U.S. should not follow the European example. “Europe is pretty irrelevant when it comes to innovation and new technology. I would argue the United States has succeeded — and then China has because of state-based capitalism and propping up companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent — but Europe has been very stagnant in the new economy so I'm not sure I would look to Europe as a model,” he said. Věra Jourová, European commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, told the podcast that given its history of ethnic wars, Europe cannot afford to tolerate hate speech. Social media “woke up the old demons,” she said. Those demons include homophobia and anti-Semitism as well as hatred of Roma people, Muslims and other religious groups, she said. “Each country has its own demons,” she told the podcast. “That's why we want Facebook and other companies which agreed to cooperate in the fight against hate speech. That's why we want them to be active in all the member states to understand the nature of the hate threat.” A turning point for politicians in Brussels was the influx of refugees into Europe in 2016 that “increased incredibly the level of hate speech online in almost all the member states,” she said. Europe responded by instituting a voluntary code of conduct that requires social media companies to remove hate speech quickly after its posting. “We came with our European solution. We had to do it. We had to be quick and efficient because too much was at stake — millions of people were endangered because in 2016,” she said, online violence was close to jumping to the real world. Jourová says that today she stays off of social media. “I have real friends. I read good books. I am able to smell the beauty of the real world. I'm really happy. I was able to resist it in spite of the fact that many told me as a politician you are dead, because you need Facebook to keep alive in the world of political marketing. I don't believe it.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

133,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/minister-gun-violence-church.html,"Advertisement Supported by The saying “has been co-opted by the gun lobby to keep the church from taking action,” the Rev. Deanna Hollas said. By Adeel Hassan To the strains of the hymn “If We Just Talk of Thoughts and Prayers,” the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States ordained The Rev. Deanna Hollas as its first minister of gun violence prevention this month. Ms. Hollas is believed to be the first person in the country to be given a national ecclesiastical role of this kind. And the choice of the hymn was a deliberate underlining of what she sees as a desperate need: to do more than react to the latest mass shooting with an offer of benedictions. That, she said, is not sufficient in a country where 40,000 people are killed by guns each year. “The saying ‘thoughts and prayers’ has been co-opted by the gun lobby to keep the church from taking action so they can increase their profits,” Ms. Hollas, who was installed in her new role by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) earlier this month, said in a recent interview. “While all that we do as Christians should be rooted in worship and prayer, it should not stay there. It is like breathing — worship and prayer is the in-breath, and action is the out-breath.” A Texas native who describes herself as “no stranger” to gun culture, Ms. Hollas, 52, said she was committed to ensuring that Americans from all sides of the gun debate stop talking past one another. “No matter where you fall on this issue,” she said, “the important thing is that we remain in conversation with one another.” From her place of ministry, Retreat House Spirituality Center in Richardson, Tex., Ms. Hollas will oversee about 800 supporters of gun violence prevention in all 50 states. We asked her about her role, and what she hoped to accomplish. The conversation has been edited and condensed. What is your background? And what makes you ready for this role? I grew up in Plainview, Tex., where guns and hunting are part of the culture. My father owns multiple guns and property specifically for family hunting trips. My in-laws live on a farm in South Texas where shooting guns would often happen on a weekend trip. This background is what enables me to connect to gun owners. I first went to seminary because I felt called to the ministry of spiritual direction, which is a ministry of listening. I feel this is what is needed most right now. We have lost our ability to listen to one another, to our bodies and, therefore, to God. Violence is the result of this separation. Spiritual practices can heal, repair and restore us to right relationship and thus lead us away from violence and toward peace and love. What exactly will you do in your new role? My role is to encourage the church at every level to become informed and active in preventing gun violence, to provide pastoral care for victims and survivors, and to seek a spiritual response to resist violence and seek Christ. I serve as a resource and an encourager and connector for pastors, elders and others in the church so they are empowered to prevent gun violence. I have the best role, as I spend my days talking to so many different people all across the country who are committed to ending gun violence Do you expect to face resistance? I expect resistance because when you talk about guns, you are tapping into the part of the brain that protects one’s identity. Guns and identity are linked for many people; that is why I have developed a spiritual practice that helps us shift our bodies from fight-or-flight mode and teaches us to welcome and hold with compassion all the sensations that arise in our bodies. When we connect with one another on the level of personal experience, it leads to empathy. Establishing empathy is key in peacemaking. Do you feel daunted at all? The church has always been political — Jesus was executed by the government for speaking against its violence and against the religious authorities that aligned themselves with this unjust system. That is still the role of the church today: to speak a word of peace into a world of violence. I live in Texas, and I became involved in this movement because of the passing of a law that allowed guns on college campuses. My daughter was a student at Texas Tech at the time and I saw how her friends and roommates viewed the law as an invitation to become armed. Being familiar with guns, I knew from what they were saying that they did not have a realistic understanding of how a gun worked. They basically assumed that having a gun would turn them into Jason Bourne, ready to defeat any bad guy that came their way, but the reality is having a gun increases one’s chance of being shot. And while legislation is an important part of the work, it is not what gets me up in the morning. I am more interested in creating the cultural change that is needed along with legislation. What can other church congregations do? There are so many churches that are doing great things that it is hard to pick just one. The one that is most on my heart today is one I am working with in Texas, St. Barnabas Presbyterian Church in Richardson. It is a congregation that has both far-left liberals and gun-loving Trump supporters worshiping together on Sunday mornings. Starting in September, this congregation will engage in a five-week study. Each week’s lesson will be led by a different member of the congregation so that a variety of folks will feel comfortable participating, and to ensure that no one person’s individual agenda dominates the discussion. When we can move beyond the rhetoric, we find that no Christian is a proponent of gun violence. Churches have been afraid to talk about gun violence because they are worried it will cause people to leave, but we are called to shine light into darkness. Mainline denominations are in a unique position to be leaders in bringing conversations about gun violence out of the shadows, as our congregations are one of the few places where people of different political persuasions still gather together voluntarily. And I know of no congregation that is not touched by gun violence. Often, these folks feel they must grieve in silence. When people think gun violence prevention, they think about legislation, criminal activity, and mass shootings, but most gun deaths are suicides. I also think there is lots to learn about white Americans’ obsession with guns and how that is impacting the violence in communities of color. It is our responsibility, as a mostly white church, to be actively engaged in dismantling white supremacy and creating racial equity. Why do you remain hopeful? I entered seminary thinking I would just take two classes and get my diploma in the art of spiritual direction and that would be it. But God kept leading me toward ordained ministry, which didn’t make much sense at the time as I didn’t feel called to lead a congregation. In fact, I was thinking about withdrawing my candidacy for ordination when the N.R.A. came to Dallas last year for their annual convention. I was blessed to be part of a prayer vigil hosted by a group of interfaith leaders, which ran from the beginning of the convention to the end. It was during this vigil, on the steps of Dallas City Hall, that I gained clarity on my call to speak the word of God into the violence of the world.

134,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/Mnfp2rCjF_o/,"At least one gunman opened fire at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, on Sunday at about 5:30 p.m., with initial reports claiming that there have been 11 victims of the mass shooting, according to a report by local NBC News affiliate KNTV. Gilroy is located about 30 miles south of San Jose, California, and is known for its agricultural production of garlic, and the annual Garlic Festival which is one of the country's largest food festivals. At least three people were killed in the shooting with another 12 injured, Gilroy City Council member Dian Bracco said, as quoted by The New York Times. One gunman was described as a white male in his 20s, according to a report by BNO News. An unconfirmed report from a local firefighter posted via Twitter said that the shooter, who remained at large, was wearing ""camo"" clothing. ""I watched him walk up, he raised his gun and started spraying rounds all around,"" witness Ryan Walace told NBC News, in a quote posted via Twitter. ""He was walking like he wanted to get stuff done. It was horrifying. He was ready to do some damage."" One law enforcement official said that a shooter remained at large more than a full hour after the shooting incident began at about 5:30 p.m. PT on Sunday, according to a San Francisco Chronicle report. Details of the shooting remained hard to come by by 7 p.m. on Sunday. When a reporter for the San Jose Mercury News called the Gilroy Police Department, a dispatcher ""said an inquiry about the reports was 'inappropriate' and sent a caller to voicemail."" But the Mercury News reported that police were on the scene.Incident at Gilroy Garlic Festival in California is still being treated as an active shooter situation; the total number of victims is not yet known https://t.co/BvAkiTvQml pic.twitter.com/yEPmdXCb55— BNO News (@BNONews) July 29, 2019""A dozen ambulance and fire department units,"" responded the the shooting report, according to The San Francisco Chronicle, which also reported that private ambulances were being told not to respond to the shooting because they ""lacked tactical gear"" — which suggested that the shooter was still active as of 6:49 p.m., according to the publication. Incident at Gilroy Garlic Festival in California is still being treated as an active shooter situation; the total number of victims is not yet known https://t.co/BvAkiTvQml pic.twitter.com/yEPmdXCb55 One witness, Maximo Rocha, told NBC News that he ""saw many people on the ground,"" but was unsure how many of those individuals were shooting victims, and how many had simply hit the ground to take cover as the bullets flew. But Rocha told NBC News that he had personal knowledge of ""quite a few"" shooting victims, because he helped those individuals. The shooting took place on the festival's third and final day at Christmas Hill Park in Gilroy, according to local Fox affiliate KTVU. A live stream of local news coverage of the shootings aftermath is available online from BNO News. Unconfirmed reports posted via Twitter at about 7:05 p.m. claimed that the shooter remained active, and that there may have been more than one gunman involved in the shooting, with one shooter ""down."" A video posted to YouTube appeared to show at lease one bloodied, wounded victim of the shooting. Even the New York Police Department said that it was ""closely monitoring"" the incident, in the event that the shooting was an act of political terrorism.We are closely monitoring reports of an active shooter incident at a festival in Gilroy, California. pic.twitter.com/Go9c6cls10— NYPDCounterterrorism (@NYPDCT) July 29, 2019The population of Gilroy is more than 60 percent Hispanic, according to The Statistical Atlas.

138,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/gilroy-garlic-festival-california-mass-shooting.html?via=rss,"The Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, was the site of a shooting on Sunday afternoon in which at least four people were killed including the gunman, the Los Angeles Times reports. At least 15 people were injured in the shooting. The festival, a celebration of California-grown garlic that has been held annually since 1979, was in its third and final day when a shooter opened fire on the crowd at approximately 5:41 p.m. local time. According to police Chief Scot Smithee, a suspect was shot and killed by Gilroy police shortly after gunfire broke out. Some witnesses reported a second shooter or confederate, and dozens of law enforcement agencies were investigating, but at publication time, no one else was in custody. Witnesses described the gunman as a white man in his 30s wearing camouflage pants and some sort of vest. Julissa Contreras told NBC that the shooter was able to achieve a firing rate of “three to four shots per second.” It was just rapid firing. I could see him shooting in just every direction. He wasn’t aiming at anyone specifically. It was just left to right, right to left. … He definitely was prepared for what he was doing. Gilroy is in Santa Clara County, south of San Jose, and the annual festival draws tens of thousands of people. This year’s festival featured three stages of musical entertainment, garlic-laden refreshments in “Gourmet Alley,” a cook-off stage with live cooking demonstrations, and the usual assortment of festival vendors and souvenir booths. One attendee captured the moment shots rang out: yo somebody was shooting at the gilroy garlic festival. be safe pic.twitter.com/B39ZIYe8wr Multiple witnesses described the initial sounds as resembling firecrackers; attendees ran and hid as they realized it was gunfire. Members of a band performing onstage during the shooting told NBC that they took cover under their stage. Attendee Vivian Zhang described the thoughts running through her head as she fled to the Los Angeles Times: “I am surviving a mass shooting right now, but I’m not even sure if that will be true in a moment.” The president urged attendees to be careful and safe: Law Enforcement is at the scene of shootings in Gilroy, California. Reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended. Be careful and safe! California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Kamala Harris expressed their horror at the catastrophe on Twitter: Simply horrific. I'm grateful to the first responders who are on the scene in Gilroy, and my thoughts are with that community tonight. Our country has a gun violence epidemic that we cannot tolerate. https://t.co/WqWNxGAQnA This is nothing short of horrific.  Tonight, CA stands with the Gilroy community. My office is monitoring the situation closely. Grateful for the law enforcement’s efforts and their continued work as this situation develops. https://t.co/GrtHjtCEz7 “This is one of those press conferences that you never want to have to give in your community,” Smithee told the media late Sunday night. The Gilroy Police Department has set up a witness line and family reunification line at (408) 846-0583 and are directing those separated from family members to a reunification center at Gavilan College. Further details about the incident are expected at a press conference to be held Monday morning.

The cartoonist and vocal supporter of Donald Trump took to Twitter in the immediate wake of the mass shooting and told those who witnessed the shooting to access WhenHub, an app he co-founded that compiles and presents information. The tweet was met with immediate backlash, with many calling out Adams for trying to use the mass shooting to promote his own company. ""Grifting ghoulishly, or ghoulishly grifting, amirite?"" one person wrote under his Twitter post. Others noted that police in California had said the shooting was still active at the time Adams published his post, with victims being taken to hospitals at a time when he was encouraging them to download his app. ""So instead of calling the police or fleeing during a still ACTIVE shooting you propose they download your app (thus clogging network and other people's legit needs to contact rescue), go through some name your price exercise, and then wait for ZERO news folks taking them up?"" another commenter added. As Adams explained in a blog on the company's website, WhenHub is a way to create interactive displays that tell stories. Users can share these visualizations on social media or on the company's website. The company posts tweets promoting it as a way for members of the media to connect with self-professed experts on various topics, including bagpipes and HVAC.Dilbert guy Scott Adams is using the garlic festival shooting to direct market mass shooting survivors (at a time when public info on this was that the shooter was still at large) on his app pic.twitter.com/9EgGfSGkuz— Tom McKay reviewed a $500 space toilet for cats (@thetomzone) July 29, 2019After first gaining fame as the creator of the office culture critiquing comic strip Dilbert, Adams has earned a reputation for being among the most vocal and dedicated supporters of Donald Trump, often finding controversy because of it. As Bloomberg reported in 2017, Adams coined the term ""three-dimensional chess"" to describe what he sees as Trump's long-term strategic plans.

Four people, including the gunman, were killed when a shooter opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California on Sunday. The shooter, who police say entered by cutting a hole in a perimeter fence to avoid event security, open fire on the crowds, apparently at random. Gilroy Police Department said they shot him dead. Officers also said in an incident report that 12 people were injured, with some now in a critical condition. The investigation is ongoing, and the police have not yet formally identified the victims, though we do have some details. Here is what we know about the victims of the shooting so far:  Alberto Romero, Steven's father, told NBC Bay Area that his son had been killed at the festival. ""My son had his whole life to live, and he was only 6,"" he said. ""That's all I can say."" Read more: 4 dead, including a suspect, in shooting at California garlic festival  Trevor Irby, 25, who studied biology at Keuka College, which is located 70 miles from Syracuse New York, was one of the victims, SF Gate reported. Irby graduated in 2017. Irby was attending the festival with his girlfiend and fellow Keuka College alumna Sarah Warner, who was not injured in the shooting. ""Our hearts go out to Trevor's family and loved ones,"" Keuka College President Amy Storey wrote in a statement. ""We are shocked that this latest episode of senseless gun violence resulted in the loss of one of our recent graduates—graduates in whom we place so much hope because of their potential to create a brighter tomorrow.""  Keyla Salazar was identified as a victim late Monday by Santa Clara County Coroner's Office, numerous outlets reported. The Associated Press reported that she may have lost her life when she stayed behind to help a relative who uses a cane escape the festival. Her aunt, Katiuska Vargas told the AP that she was hit by a bullet that may have otherwise hit the unnamed relative. Salazar's stepfather was also injured when he went back to find to find her, Vargas told the AP. ""Any time a life is lost, it's a tragedy,"" Gilroy Police Chief Scott Smithee said at a news conference Monday. ""But when it's young people, it's even worse. It's very difficult."" Police identified the gunman as 19-year-old Santino William Legan, according to CBS News. One witness described him to police as a tall, thin man wearing camouflage prior to identifying him. Another witness told The Associated Press that he saw a man in a green shirt using what looked like an assault rifle. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said that police have yet to identify a motive, but witnesses said that the gunman appeared to be shooting randomly into the crowd. Smithee also told reporters that the officers are also looking for a possible second suspect.  Maribel Romero, the grandmother of six-year-old Steven Romero, told ABC7 News that Steven's mother and his other grandmother were also shot. His mother was shot in her stomach and her hand and his grandmother was shot in the neck, , Maribel said.

It is unclear if the people shown in the video were brought to hospital, or are included in the police's figure.  The Associated Press reported that those who were injured were brought to a number of different hospitals, and that some were in a fair condition while others were critical. Police said that some injuries came from gunshots while others may have been related to the rush to escape the area, Reuters reported.

Some of them were bloody because they got shot. … Police from every neighboring city were coming through, so I was pretty much having to direct traffic and help people the best I could,” John Luc Chesson, a 17-year-old law enforcement explorer working security at the perimeter of the festival, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a phone interview Monday. One of the victims was 6-year-old Steven Romerowho. His mother and and grandmother were also hurt, reported NBC News.

(Updated: 1:50 PM) Topline: While police confirmed an “AK-47-type assault rifle” used in the California garlic festival shooting was legally purchased July 9 in Nevada, and that the suspect is 19-year-old Santino William Legan, the motive for the mass casualty event remains unclear.   In a video uploaded to Twitter, festival attendees are seen running after gunshots broke out: CNN reported an Instagram account allegedly bearing the suspect's name had posts showing people walking around the garlic festival, right before the shooting began. The posts also allegedly mentioned a white supremacist book. Facebook, Instagram's parent company, released the following statement through a spokesperson: “Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. Content that praises, supports or represents the shooting or anyone responsible violates our Community Guidelines and we will continue to remove as soon as we identify it.” Gilroy, California, is home to 60,000 people and a large producer of garlic, according to the New York Times, and the Gilroy Garlic Festival is a top fundraiser for the city.

And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported nearly 40,000 Americans died from gunshot wounds in 2017, an all-time high. (Suicide was found to be the driver behind the increase in gunshot deaths.) Mass shooting deaths account for about 1% of gunshot deaths annually.

149,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/gilroy-garlic-festival-shooting.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Jill Cowan [Sign-up for California Today, delivered to your inbox.] When the nation’s latest mass shooting shook another community, this time at a festival in Northern California on Sunday afternoon, the police were already on site. The police chief said Monday that officers staved off greater bloodshed by responding in under a minute, with one of them delivering a fatal shot to the gunman almost immediately. Here’s what we know and don’t know about the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival about 30 miles southeast of San Jose. We’ll continue to update this with new developments. transcript Witness: “What’s going on? What’s going on? Is there a fire? Oh, they shooting — oh, [expletive].” “My son was the first one to get notified where they were. And I went from hospital to hospital looking for him, but my son told me that he was over there and we came over. But when I got here, he was already dead.” “It appears as if though they had come into the festival via the creek, which borders a parking area. And they used some sort of a tool to cut through the fence to be able to gain access through the secure fence line.” “People were running out screaming and yelling. And I just told the family, ‘Let’s get in the car and go. We got to get out of here.’” • As the 41st annual Gilroy Garlic Festival wound down, gunshots rang out, sending festival goers fleeing. The police said three people were killed and 12 people were wounded. The gunman was also killed by the police, the authorities said. • Those killed by the gunman were a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s. The boy’s mother and his grandmother were also wounded by gunfire. [Read about the 6-year-old boy who was shot in the back.] • The gunman, identified by the authorities as Santino William Legan, 19, was carrying a semiautomatic rifle when he was shot and killed by the police. He appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the festival, the Gilroy Police Department said. • Chief Scot Smithee of the Gilroy Police Department said that the gunman had purchased the weapon legally in Nevada this month. • There would have been more bloodshed had three officers not responded in under a minute, with one of them fatally shooting the gunman, Chief Smithee said. Thousands of people were still at the festival. • The officers were wearing body cameras. • Witnesses described a chaotic scene. Video shows people scattering and trying to hide. One festival attendee, Olivia Chiu, said gunshots seemed to come from a central area near food and merchandise vendors. “Everyone was in a state of panic and trying to escape out of the festival to a safer area,” she said. • President Trump tweeted about the shooting, and other California officials weighed in. Senator Kamala Harris on Twitter described the shooting as “horrific,” adding that, “Our country has a gun violence epidemic that we cannot tolerate.” By The New York Times • The identities of the 13-year-old female victim and the man in his 20s who was killed. • It also was not clear whether a second person was involved, as witnesses indicated to the authorities on Sunday night. The authorities have heard contradictory accounts from eyewitnesses. • Any possible motivation for the attack. The Gilroy Garlic Festival was founded in 1979 by Rudolph J. Melone, who had moved to Gilroy several years earlier as president of Gavilan Community College. He started the event after reading about a similar celebration in France, according to The Times’s obituary for Mr. Melone. In the decades since, the festival has become an internationally known destination, drawing roughly 100,000 visitors each year. But it has not lost its importance for locals. “It’s like a second high school reunion for a lot of people,” said Emilia Chavez, 34, who grew up in Gilroy, a small city in the midst of verdant farmland southeast of San Jose. “It’s hard to go and not see someone you recognize.” She and her husband left this year’s event just a few hours before shots were fired, she said Sunday evening. The festival is also a crucial fund-raising opportunity for local charities, and a staple of local students’ community service résumés. While in middle school, Ms. Chavez said she sold lemonade to raise money for a scholarship federation. In high school, she sold Pepsi for the choir. Ms. Chavez said she never questioned the safety of the community’s biggest event. “The biggest problem had been just people sneaking in,” she said. The shooting in Gilroy took place days after four people were killed and two people were injured in a rampage through the San Fernando Valley that the authorities said started when a man first shot his parents and brother, then shot an acquaintance a few miles away before opening fire on a bus, The Los Angeles Times reported. In April, a shooting at a synagogue in Poway prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to push for new funding for security for religious organizations. At the time, Mark Baldassare, president and survey director for the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said that high-profile shootings have a kind of cumulative effect on public opinion. Even in California, which already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, there’s strong support for more controls. ————————————— California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

150,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/605004784/0/phoenix/nation~aposItaposs-breaking-my-heartapos-How-Greenville-NC-is-wrestling-with-the-fallout-of-Donald-Trumpaposs-rally/,"GREENVILLE, N.C. – “Welcome to Greenville,” the Rev. Bob Hudak wrote in an open letter to Donald Trump before the president's visit this month to his North Carolina home. The reverend extolled Greenville as a “growing city with an extraordinarily diverse population of citizens.” He pointed to East Carolina University, where Trump was to hold his campaign rally July 17, and to Vidant Medical Center, which serves a 29-county region. Both institutions, he wanted the president to know, were among the reasons the community of nearly 100,000 attracted so many immigrants. Hudak, who has worked with interfaith leaders to build a sense of  inclusiveness, was distraught when Trump used his rally to continue his attacks on four congresswomen of color who, the president tweeted, should return to the countries “from which they came.” Chants of “Send her back!” erupted in the arena of East Carolina University after Trump singled out Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. 'Send her back': Outrage, expressions of support for Rep. Ilhan Omar after chant at Trump rally Recounting the events that put Greenville in the national spotlight, Hudak placed his hand over his chest during an interview with USA TODAY last week. “It’s breaking my heart,” the 71-year-old retired Episcopal priest said. “Things not only don’t seem to be getting better, but people are more entrenched, and racism is a card that’s being played whether people want to admit it or not.” More than a week after the rally, the chants continued to reverberate throughout Greenville. City leaders were eager to show that the sentiments are not reflective of the community. Although the university did not sponsor the event, officials responded to angry alumni threatening to withhold donations and reassured parents that a hijab-wearing daughter or dark-skinned son would be safe on campus. Although the city's mayor is among the Trump supporters who denounced the chants, others who attended the rally are stunned by the backlash. “I thought it was ridiculous,” said Diane Rufino, a founder of the local tea party organization. “They see racism where it doesn’t exist.” Trump assails Baltimore: President calls city ""a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" Trump ignited another controversy with a tweet Saturday criticizing Baltimore – a majority-black city – as a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess "" where ""no human being would want to live."" The comments were part of a tirade against the city's black congressman, Elijah Cummings. As Trump's words roil Baltimore and as Greenville wrestles with the aftermath of his rally, the president plans to hold his next campaign event Thursday in Cincinnati, a city that exploded in riots in 2001 after a police officer shot an unarmed African American man. Greenville, once a leading tobacco marketing and warehouse center, is slightly more than half white, 38% black and 5% Hispanic. Unemployment is less than 5%. On the grounds of the Pitt County Courthouse is a monument to “our Confederate dead."" A petition to remove the statue was circulated in 2017, sparking a counter petition to protect the monument. At the first stoplight in Greenville, visitors are greeted by a welcome sign that boasts, “We are building an inclusive community.” 'This was his best shot'?: Baltimore reels from Donald Trump's attacks, then punches back The city has grown 50% since 2000, and signs of the expansion are everywhere. There’s a new transportation hub, a new cancer center and a $30 million new road connecting the Vidant Medical Center and the university, two of the area's major employers – along with companies that make boats, forklifts, pharmaceuticals and hammocks. A billboard marks the future site of a $90 million life sciences and biotechnology building that ECU is constructing. The school’s new student center opened this year. ECU owns a swath of old tobacco warehouses waiting to be repurposed. “If we want to continue to grow, we want to have a great image,” Mayor P.J. Connelly said, promoting what the city has to offer but expressing concern about possible damage from the rally. On the banks of the Tar River in the Town Common is a new ""inclusive playground"" where children in wheelchairs can roll into a swing. At the park’s other end, a memorial is being constructed to the former Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. A plaza area will tell the story of a former tightknit African American community that was moved out of the 20-acre public space through an urban renewal program decades ago over which there are lingering hard feelings. The nearby uptown has a budding arts area, brew pubs and the Scullery, a coffee house that hosts a monthly drag brunch to raise money for a local organization that helps people living with HIV/AIDS. “If you see Greenville on the map or you hear about it, you might imagine it to be a small town in North Carolina, and you might imagine it to be full of conservative people who wouldn’t support a drag show,” owner Matt Scully said. “It always sells out.” He and his wife chose a different charity to support on the day of Trump’s rally, announcing that all the proceeds the shop earned would be donated to the American Immigration Council. “I didn’t want to do anything that would offend or further divide people,” said Scully, 38. “I really wanted to do something to celebrate our community, to bring people together.” Samar Badwan, the head of Greenville’s Human Relations Council, has never had a problem walking around the city she’s lived in for 30 years wearing her hijab. But not wanting to provoke a reaction if she joined friends protesting the rally, Badwan decided to stay home. “I knew that it wasn’t going to be pretty,” the 45-year-old teacher and Arabic interpreter said. “I do a lot of praying. I was praying that maybe a miracle would happen and he would only stick to issues facing this country.” Ilhan Omar: 'Send her back' Trump rally chant heightens calls to boost security for congresswoman 'Disgusted': How Republicans are reacting to 'send her back' chants at Donald Trump's rally The events represented a turning point in the 2020 campaign for president, injecting race and racism as issues candidates will have to confront, along with the economy, health care and foreign policy. The Democratic candidates hoping to unseat Trump have embraced subtly different approaches to racial inequality. “I would like to see the standard bearer of the Democratic Party take on the issue of race very, very aggressively,” said Keith Cooper, 53, former president of the Pitt County Southern Christian Leadership Conference. “What we are going to need when President Trump leaves is healing.” Political operatives in North Carolina and elsewhere predict racial inequality will be front and center when the Democrats take the stage in Detroit Tuesday and Wednesday for their second series of debates. “You’re going to see candidates be very vocal, be very aggressive about attacking the president in that they'll call it racist and divisive,” said Morgan Jackson, a veteran Democratic strategist based in Raleigh. “It gins up the Democratic base. and I think it sends a signal to a lot of Republicans.” 'I promise you, you're wrong': Fox News' Wallace shuts down Mulvaney claim Mueller vindicated Trump 'Race card': Trying to turn the tables, Trump accuses Democrats of playing 'race card' Jackson stressed that Democrats need to be careful, particularly as they look toward the general election, to not let Trump dictate the direction of the race. ""This is the fight that Trump wants to have. He wants to divide people. He wants it to be about race,” Jackson said. “Democrats have to be careful.” Trump, who has repeatedly said that if the four lawmakers “hate” the USA so much, they should leave, said he didn’t support the rally crowd's comments, but he called the chanters “incredible patriots.” The mayor, who had greeted Trump at the airport before attending the rally that drew participants from beyond Greenville, said there was “so much energy” in the arena that “I do not remember even hearing that chant.” By the next day, it was quite clear the nation had. As the former professional baseball player fielded calls and emails from around the country – including from those who said they would never visit his city – Connelly issued a statement saying he was “extremely disappointed and disheartened,” and “hate will never have a place in our community.” “It’s incumbent upon us as city leaders to tell the whole story of our city, not let it be narrated that the city is something that it’s not. We’ll continue to do that,” Connelly, a Republican elected to a nonpartisan position, told USA TODAY.  “At the end of the day, this is our home. This is where we raise our families.” Rufino, the local tea party leader, dismissed the mayor's comments as pandering for the fall election. She said the chants were not a response to Omar’s origins but to the Somali-born lawmaker's criticisms of the United States. The chants were meant to suggest that if Omar didn't like the USA, she should go elsewhere. “You can’t say if we oppose her, it’s because of her color when it’s really about what she’s saying. And we’re not able to separate that anymore in this country,” the 59-year-old lawyer said. “It just so happens that the most vile-speaking members of Congress these days are people of color or people of different origins.” Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2016, but Barack Obama's 2008 victory there underscored that it's one of the Southern states that is winnable for Democrats. Greenville backed Hillary Clinton, and she beat Trump by 8 percentage points in Pitt County. The Trump supporters in Greenville include Shonda Edwards, 46, an African American, who said she was not bothered by the chants. “I saw how she felt about America,” Edwards said of Omar. “She hates America.” Edwards, who works at a rehabilitation center while studying for degrees in nursing and business administration, didn’t attend the rally but voted for Trump in 2016 – for “a change” – and expects to vote for him again. Calvin Henderson, 81, leader of the local NAACP chapter, called Trump’s visit devastating. Henderson, who grew up in the suburbs of Greenville where he saw “white only” signs, calls himself  “a product of Jim Crow.” He said he thought the nation had gotten a step above that. “Are we beginning the fight all over again that we thought we had overcome?” Henderson asked. The city’s efforts to repair divisions and fulfill its trademarked tagline – “Find yourself in good company” – include the work of the Human Relations Council that Badwan chairs. After the terrorist attacks at mosques in New Zealand in March, Badwan pulled together a vigil at which the mayor, chief of police, a rabbi and others spoke. The Trump rally chants had extra resonance for Badwan because, like Omar, she’s a Muslim American. “But that’s not a reflection of what our community is about,” Badwan said of the remarks. “This community is portrayed as a racist community. From my experience here, that is not true.” The morning after the rally, the city manager reached out to her to make sure there had been no threats against the mosque where Badwan worships or against community members. There hadn’t been. Dan Gerlach, interim chancellor of East Carolina University, took calls from parents concerned about the safety of their minority children on campus. In response to criticism over renting the school's arena to the Trump campaign, Gerlach said he would have done that for any presidential candidate. Engulfed in controversy after only a few months on the job, Gerlach has been whipsawed between responding to those who wanted the university to issue a stronger condemnation of the rally and dealing with Trump supporters accusing him of wimping out for not personally welcoming the president to the campus and handing him a purple ECU Pirates shirt. What struck Gerlach most, he said, was the reaction of some faculty members, natives of other countries, who wondered if they’re considered part of the community. “I’m like, 'Y’all! Y’all!' "" an exasperated Gerlach, a native of Ohio, said. “ 'Some of you have been here a decade.' This fleeting moment does not define this community, this university or anything else.” Emma Arndt, 21, a senior and head of ECU’s College Republicans, said the chants are “always going to come up in conversations about this rally” – even though many attendees, like her, declined to participate in the taunts. Arndt said she found the chants disturbing. “For me, as soon as I heard it, I was disappointed,” she said. “It touched a lot of people in a bad way.” When students return, the school will hold a town-hall-style meeting to discuss the event. Similar “Cupola Conversations” – named after a free-standing dome in the middle of campus that's a symbol of the school – were held after the mass shooting in 2016 inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and after the white nationalist rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va. Last Wednesday, a week after the Trump rally, Gerlach had one of his better moments on his new job, he said. He attended a naturalization ceremony that the school’s Office of Global Affairs hosted for 39 people from 21 countries. Gerlach told the new citizens that although he counts among his ancestors a Revolutionary War soldier, they’re equals. “Today, you have the same rights and responsibilities that I have, even though my people have lived in America for hundreds of years,” he said he told them. “We’re glad you’re here because you make us better.”",2019-07-29 10:05:45,"&apos;It&apos;s breaking my heart&apos;: How Greenville, N.C. is wrestling with the fallout of Donald Trump&apos;s rally",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
151,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/local-emergency-proclamation-after-3-killed-and-12-wounded-at-gilroy-garlic-festival/,"Trending:  The man who inexplicably killed three people, including two children, by firing a rifle into a crowd at the Gilroy Garlic Festival died in a fierce gun battle with three officers, the city’s police chief said, as more details about the shooter’s life and background came into focus. Santino William Legan was the man who opened fire with an assault-type rifle at Sunday’s close of the three-day festival before three Gilroy police officers, armed with handguns, exchanged gunfire with the shooter and killed him. He was the 19-year-old grandson of former Santa Clara County Supervisor Tom Legan, who died last year. The three people killed were 6-year-old Stephen Romero and 13-year-old Keyla Salazar, both of San Jose, and 25-year-old Trevor Irby, of the town of Romulus in upstate New York. “When the call came in our closest team of officers responded immediately and engaged the suspect in less than a minute,” Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said. “The suspect was armed with an assault-type rifle. He fired at the officers with the rifle and three officers engaged the suspect. And despite being outgunned — they were using handguns against his rifle — they were able to fatally wound the suspect.” Smithee added that the quick action by his officers prevented a tragedy that could “have been so much worse so fast.” The chief said the gun used was what he described as an SKS AK-47 style assault rifle “that had been purchased legally in Nevada on July 9.” The District Attorney’s Office in Mineral County, Nevada confirmed that FBI agents early Monday raided a unit in a triplex in Walker Lake that Legan was believed to have used “during the days prior” to the Gilroy shootings. Around the same time, officers and agents from multiple law-enforcement agencies searched the Gilroy home of Santino Legan’s family Monday morning. Legan grew up in Gilroy, although it’s unclear when he moved to Nevada and when he returned, Smithee said. He would have likely had to have been a resident of Nevada to purchase the gun legally. At a news conference Monday afternoon, Smithee said police were “no closer to determining whether there was or was not a second shooter, and if there was, what involvement they may have had.” However, a law enforcement source told this news organization that Santino Legan is believed to be the only shooter. Court records show no adult criminal history for Santino Legan in Santa Clara County. County health system spokesperson Joy Alexiou confirmed that 19 people from the festival were sent to two county hospitals, St. Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy and Valley Medical Center in San Jose. Of the three fatal gunshot victims, one died at St. Louise. Five patients remain at VMC, with one in critical condition, one in serious condition and one in fair condition. The other two requested privacy about their conditions. The patients taken to VMC ranged in age from 12 to 69. One patient has been discharged from VMC, and three people with gunshot wounds have been discharged from St. Louise. Eight other patients went to St. Louise with non-gunshot injuries and were treated and released. Hospital officials said Monday that many of the surviving shooting victims have improved since being admitted. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited victims at the San Jose hospital Monday to offer comfort, and in remarks to reporters afterward characterized his conversations with them. “Nothing I can say can change what’s happened. I don’t know what I can possibly say to make you feel better except, God bless you, and I’m so sorry, not only what’s happened to you, but what’s happening in this country, in this state, in this nation of ours,” he said. “We’re here for you.” At Monday’s press conference, Craig Fair, deputy special agent in charge at the FBI’s San Francisco office, said he had a team of 30 people in the field gathering evidence. He said the team was looking for “motivation, ideological leanings” of the suspect and whether he had been “affiliated with anyone or any group.” “That still has to be ruled out or determined at this point,” Fair said. Fair said witness photos and videos can be uploaded for the FBI’s review at fbi.gov/gilroy. Information about the shooter can be relayed to Gilroy police at 408-846-0583. In a post on his Instagram page days before the shooting, a user identified as Santino William Legan told followers to “Read Might is Right by Ragnar Redbeard,” an apparent reference to the racist manifesto “Might is Right or The Survival of the Fittest,” written in 1890. The work, written under a pseudonym, has become a key part of the modern white supremacist and Neo-Nazi canon, and is frequently mentioned on extremist websites. In his Instagram post, which has since been taken down, Legan also used racial and misogynistic slurs to describe “hordes” of Silicon Valley workers and people of mixed race origin “overcrowding” towns. The post was accompanied by a photo of a Smokey Bear sign warning of high fire danger. In a post dated Sunday, Legan referenced the Gilroy festival.“Ayyy garlic festival,” the post read. “Come get wasted on overpriced shit.” When asked if Legan targeted any particular group of people at the festival, Smithee said, “The descriptions that have been given to me, it appeared as though it was random, but I think we’re still too early in the investigation to say that definitively.” The suspect’s grandfather, Tom Legan, was a county supervisor in the 1980s. During his second term, Tom Legan was charged with molesting a female relative, but was acquitted of the charges in 1988. Days later, he lost his bid for re-election.

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)  Gilroy Mayor Roland Velasco proclaimed a local emergency Monday morning. “I would ask for the thoughts and prayers of the community as our officers continue to investigate this tragic and senseless crime,” he said. The shooting sent hundreds of panicked festival-goers running for cover. Among the dead was Stephen, whose mother and grandmother were also shot and were being treated at Valley Medical Center in San Jose. The Romeros, including Stephen, are cousins of San Jose City Councilmember Maya Esparza, according to a Facebook post she wrote Monday morning. “Heartache and prayers for my cousins who were wounded yesterday and losing my little cousin, only 6 years old,” Esparza wrote. “And I’m angry, so angry. This violence has to stop. How do some people have such little regard for life.” A GoFundMe campaign for the Romero family has been launched by the South County Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Fiat in Gilroy. Kueka College, located in New York State west of where Irby lived, confirmed in a statement Monday that the 2017 biology graduate died in the shooting. The school also stated that when Irby was wounded, he was attending the festival with a woman who also attended the college and that a campus vigil was planned for the near future. A family assistance center will be hosted at Rucker Elementary School, 325 Santa Clara Ave. in Gilroy, through at least Friday for those affected by the Gilroy Garlic Festival shootings. The American Red Cross, the District Attorney’s Office Victim Services Unit, and county behavioral health services will offer grief counseling, help filing claims for state funds to help pay medical and counseling bills and for other assistance, and referrals to medical, counseling and other assistance providers. Starting Monday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., the center will be open Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and could be extended after that as needed. For more information, call 408-209-8356. Witnesses reported that the gunman appeared to be firing at random after suddenly appearing from behind a stage on the final evening of the three-day event that draws 100,000 people each year. Natalie Martinez, a longtime Gilroy resident, said she had gone to get food and was separated from her two daughters when the shooting began. “I ran to find the girls … and we basically ran into each other,” she said. “I thought, we’re open prey. It was awful.” Some witnesses said the gunman quietly and calmly went about his shooting spree. “He didn’t say anything,” Candace Marquez told KTVU, describing how the shooter began loading what looked like a ammunition clip into his weapon. “He was very quiet. If we would have said a word, he would have shot us.” Leslie Andres, 12, was shot in the leg while at the festival with several friends and family, her sister Yasmin Medellin said, while on her way to visit her at Valley Medical Center in Monday. “The bullet went in and out,” she said, adding that Leslie is expected to be released Tuesday. “We tried asking her what happened but she’s not saying much.” Los Altos resident Troy Towner started a GoFundMe page for his sister, Wendy, who along with her husband, Francisco Aguilera, was wounded by the shooter’s gunfire. On the page, Towner said his sister was out of surgery “but will have long term nerve and muscle damage to her leg. Her husband had more severe damage to his femoral artery,” but “with many surgeries and amazing doctors we have some good results. It will be a long road ahead in PT, skin grafts and plastic surgery for both.” He shared how his sister described the attack: “A man was climbing over the fence in the last hour of a 3 day HOT Garlic festival. My sister, her husband and son were sitting down to catch their breath after a long weekend. She was at the festival selling Habanero and Garlic Honey for her business, The Honey Ladies. Wendy, told the gunman, ‘No, you can’t do that!’ as she saw him climb the fence with a gun.” The man “opened fire on them, hitting both her and her husband. Their 3 year old son was dragged under the table by a brave 10 year old girl, that probably saved his life,” Towner wrote. “He wanted to run to Mommy and Daddy. The shooter then approached closer, and said ‘are you alright?’ ” He said his sister Wendy was shot once in the leg while her husband sustained bullet wounds to his shoulder, femoral artery and lower leg. News of the shooting, and particularly the young age of the victims, shocked a country that has been dealing with mass shootings on an almost regular basis in recent years. Social-media outlets overflowed with reactions, not just condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attack, but also praise for the police officers who quickly stopped the attack as well as political commentary from both sides on gun violence and how to stem it. “The shooter, reportedly dressed in military garb and carrying an assault-type rifle, is the result of a gun industry that embraces militarization and heightened lethality in the design, production, and marketing of its products,” said Violence Policy Center Executive Director Josh Sugarmann in a statement. “Until the gun industry is held fully accountable for its dangerous actions, these horrific attacks will continue unabated.” Several presidential candidates spoke out about the shooting, a tragedy that could be discussed in this week’s Democratic debate on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. We’re still waiting on all the details from Gilroy, but my heart is already breaking for the victims and their families and the survivors. The gun violence epidemic in this country is out of control. Please be safe and take care of one another. https://t.co/lrOA0gh6VD — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) July 29, 2019  At a press conference Sunday evening, Brian Bowe, the festival’s executive director, described Gilroy as “an amazing, tightly-knit community. We are family. We have had the wonderful opportunity in this community to celebrate our family through our Garlic Festival, and for over four decades that festival has been our annual family reunion. It’s such a sad, just horribly upsetting circumstance that this happened on the third and final day of this year’s festival.” Andrew Sanchez, 19, lives in a home behind the suspect’s house in Gilroy and said he can see their yard from his. He told this news organization that while he didn’t know the man or his family, the home seemed quiet. “Thankfully we went to see a baseball game” on Sunday, Sanchez said. “Otherwise we most likely would’ve been” at the festival. He said his mother was still very shaken. “She’s very scared,” he said. “It makes everyone sick.” Sanchez said he thinks that despite the tragedy, the “festival will come back and be bigger than ever. The garlic festival means so much to so many people.” Staff writers Emily DeRuy, Thy Vo, Leonardo Castañeda, Joseph Geha, Jason Green, Maggie Angst and Casey Tolan contributed to this report.

                    Gretchen Frazee At least three people were killed and more than a dozen were injured Sunday when a person opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in northern California. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said at a news conference Sunday night that the gunman was shot and killed by police at the festival. Some witnesses have reported there might have been a second suspect, but law enforcement has not confirmed whether that suspect exists or what role that person might have played. Police say the investigation into the shooting is ongoing and plan to update the public as more information becomes available. Here’s what we know. At 5:41 p.m. PST, there were reports of gunfire on the north side of the Gilroy Garlic Festival, a three-day event that has been held annually since 1979 and draws in about 100,000 people each year. Sunday was the last day of the three-day event held in the city of Gilroy, which has a population of about 58,000 and is located 30 miles southeast of San Jose. Police said it appears the suspect was shooting at random. Officers were in the area and responded to reports of the shooting within a minute, police said. Upon seeing the officers, the main suspect began shooting at three police officers who then returned fire, killing the man. Emergency personnel work at the scene of a mass shooting during the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, July 28, 2019.  Photo by Chris Smead/Reuters First responders and emergency management officials from 20 different agencies across Santa Clara and Monterrey County came to the scene after the Gilroy Police Department put out a call for help. The three victims were six-year-old Stephen Romero, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar, and 25-year-old Trevor Irby. One of the victims died after being transferred to St. Louise Regional Hospital. The two others appeared to have died at the scene. The father of the 6-year-old boy confirmed to the media Monday that his son was one of the victims. “My son had his whole life to live and he was only six. That’s all I can say,” the boy’s father Alberto Romero, told NBC Bay Area news. The Santa Clara County Coroners Office identified Salazar as being from San Jose, California. Friends described her as a “caring person.” Keuka College confirmed Monday that Irby was a biology major and 2017 graduate of the school located in New York state. “We are shocked that this latest episode of senseless gun violence resulted in the loss of one of our recent graduates—graduates in whom we place so much hope because of their potential to create a brighter tomorrow,” Keuka College President Amy Storey wrote in a letter. The school plans to hold a campus vigil for Irby “when the timing is appropriate.” The wounded, who ranged in age from six to 12 years old, were taken to nearby hospitals, including Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and St. Louise Regional Hospital. A spokesperson from the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center told reporters Monday that 11 people total were treated for gunshot wounds. Another eight were treated for other injuries that appeared to be sustained when they were fleeing. St. Louise transferred two of its patients to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and discharged all others that were admitted. Some patients were treated but never admitted to the hospital. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center is still treating five patients. One of the patients is currently in critical condition, one is in serious condition and one is in fair condition, spokesperson said. The two other patients do not want their information to be made public. Gilroy police identified the main suspect, who was killed, as 19-year old Santino William Legan. Police said he used an imported variant of an AK-47 assault rifle that he purchased legally July 9 in the state of Nevada. His motive is not known. Multiple media outlets have reported that Legan had posted on Instagram shortly before the shooting. The now deleted account included only three posts. A photo of Smokey the Bear next to a sign that said “Fire danger high today!” Legan wrote in the caption that people should read “Might is Right,” a book by Ragnar Redbeard that was published in the 1800s and argues moral authority is stablished by force rather than by inherent human rights. The caption spoke disparagingly about “mestizos” and white people. A second post showed a photo of the garlic festival that said “Ayy garlic festival time.” Police said at a news conference Monday afternoon that they have located the suspect’s car and served a search warrant for his residence. Law enforcement officers are looking into the possibility of second suspect based on witnesses’ accounts. “We’ve gotten multiple reports that there may have been another person with him. Different people give different versions so we really don’t know at this point,” Smithee said at a news conference Monday. He added that, even with the unknowns, the area was “very secure.” There was a significant police presence at the festival, including a bag inspection and metal detection using wands. “We have very tight security for getting into the festival,” Smithee said at a news conference Sunday. But police said the suspect appeared to bypass the security by cutting through a fence that was near a creek and a parking area. Police were stationed in various areas throughout the festival grounds, which Smithee said allowed officers to respond to the shooting quickly. The police set up an area where families could meet if they were separated during the incident.

The Gilroy Unified School District is offering counseling for students, staff and community members affected by the shooting. The district attorney’s office, along with other agencies, is also opening up a family assistance center for victims and their families. The FBI has joined local police to investigate the shooting. The FBI deputy special agent in charge, Craig Fair, said the crime scene spans “many acres” so the investigation will take some time. Gilroy police typically wear body cameras, but it is unclear how many officers were wearing them at the time of the shooting or whether they were recording. Law enforcement is encouraging any witnesses who have not talked to the police to call 408-846-0583 and provide a statement. Gilroy Mayor Roland Velasco said he and the city council will be meeting with community leaders to assess what more needs to be done and emphasized that the city will be providing whatever assistance is needed in “the days and weeks ahead.” “The Gilroy community will mourn but we will get through it,” he said.

Bob Hudak wrote in an open letter to Donald Trump before the president's visit this month to his North Carolina home. The reverend extolled Greenville as a “growing city with an extraordinarily diverse population of citizens.” He pointed to East Carolina University, where Trump was to hold his campaign rally July 17, and to Vidant Medical Center, which serves a 29-county region. Both institutions, he wanted the president to know, were among the reasons the community of nearly 100,000 attracted so many immigrants. Hudak, who has worked with interfaith leaders to build a sense of  inclusiveness, was distraught when Trump used his rally to continue his attacks on four congresswomen of color who, the president tweeted, should return to the countries “from which they came.” Chants of “Send her back!” erupted in the arena of East Carolina University after Trump singled out Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. 'Send her back': Outrage, expressions of support for Rep. Ilhan Omar after chant at Trump rally Recounting the events that put Greenville in the national spotlight, Hudak placed his hand over his chest during an interview with USA TODAY last week. “It’s breaking my heart,” the 71-year-old retired Episcopal priest said. “Things not only don’t seem to be getting better, but people are more entrenched, and racism is a card that’s being played whether people want to admit it or not.” More than a week after the rally, the chants continued to reverberate throughout Greenville. City leaders were eager to show that the sentiments are not reflective of the community. Although the university did not sponsor the event, officials responded to angry alumni threatening to withhold donations and reassured parents that a hijab-wearing daughter or dark-skinned son would be safe on campus. Although the city's mayor is among the Trump supporters who denounced the chants, others who attended the rally are stunned by the backlash. “I thought it was ridiculous,” said Diane Rufino, a founder of the local tea party organization. “They see racism where it doesn’t exist.” Trump assails Baltimore: President calls city ""a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" Trump ignited another controversy with a tweet Saturday criticizing Baltimore – a majority-black city – as a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess "" where ""no human being would want to live."" The comments were part of a tirade against the city's black congressman, Elijah Cummings. As Trump's words roil Baltimore and as Greenville wrestles with the aftermath of his rally, the president plans to hold his next campaign event Thursday in Cincinnati, a city that exploded in riots in 2001 after a police officer shot an unarmed African American man. Greenville, once a leading tobacco marketing and warehouse center, is slightly more than half white, 38% black and 5% Hispanic. Unemployment is less than 5%. On the grounds of the Pitt County Courthouse is a monument to “our Confederate dead."" A petition to remove the statue was circulated in 2017, sparking a counter petition to protect the monument. At the first stoplight in Greenville, visitors are greeted by a welcome sign that boasts, “We are building an inclusive community.” 'This was his best shot'?: Baltimore reels from Donald Trump's attacks, then punches back The city has grown 50% since 2000, and signs of the expansion are everywhere. There’s a new transportation hub, a new cancer center and a $30 million new road connecting the Vidant Medical Center and the university, two of the area's major employers – along with companies that make boats, forklifts, pharmaceuticals and hammocks. A billboard marks the future site of a $90 million life sciences and biotechnology building that ECU is constructing. The school’s new student center opened this year. ECU owns a swath of old tobacco warehouses waiting to be repurposed. “If we want to continue to grow, we want to have a great image,” Mayor P.J. Connelly said, promoting what the city has to offer but expressing concern about possible damage from the rally. On the banks of the Tar River in the Town Common is a new ""inclusive playground"" where children in wheelchairs can roll into a swing. At the park’s other end, a memorial is being constructed to the former Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. A plaza area will tell the story of a former tightknit African American community that was moved out of the 20-acre public space through an urban renewal program decades ago over which there are lingering hard feelings. The nearby uptown has a budding arts area, brew pubs and the Scullery, a coffee house that hosts a monthly drag brunch to raise money for a local organization that helps people living with HIV/AIDS. “If you see Greenville on the map or you hear about it, you might imagine it to be a small town in North Carolina, and you might imagine it to be full of conservative people who wouldn’t support a drag show,” owner Matt Scully said. “It always sells out.” He and his wife chose a different charity to support on the day of Trump’s rally, announcing that all the proceeds the shop earned would be donated to the American Immigration Council. “I didn’t want to do anything that would offend or further divide people,” said Scully, 38. “I really wanted to do something to celebrate our community, to bring people together.” Samar Badwan, the head of Greenville’s Human Relations Council, has never had a problem walking around the city she’s lived in for 30 years wearing her hijab. But not wanting to provoke a reaction if she joined friends protesting the rally, Badwan decided to stay home. “I knew that it wasn’t going to be pretty,” the 45-year-old teacher and Arabic interpreter said. “I do a lot of praying. I was praying that maybe a miracle would happen and he would only stick to issues facing this country.” Ilhan Omar: 'Send her back' Trump rally chant heightens calls to boost security for congresswoman 'Disgusted': How Republicans are reacting to 'send her back' chants at Donald Trump's rally The events represented a turning point in the 2020 campaign for president, injecting race and racism as issues candidates will have to confront, along with the economy, health care and foreign policy. The Democratic candidates hoping to unseat Trump have embraced subtly different approaches to racial inequality. “I would like to see the standard bearer of the Democratic Party take on the issue of race very, very aggressively,” said Keith Cooper, 53, former president of the Pitt County Southern Christian Leadership Conference. “What we are going to need when President Trump leaves is healing.” Political operatives in North Carolina and elsewhere predict racial inequality will be front and center when the Democrats take the stage in Detroit Tuesday and Wednesday for their second series of debates. “You’re going to see candidates be very vocal, be very aggressive about attacking the president in that they'll call it racist and divisive,” said Morgan Jackson, a veteran Democratic strategist based in Raleigh. “It gins up the Democratic base. and I think it sends a signal to a lot of Republicans.” 'I promise you, you're wrong': Fox News' Wallace shuts down Mulvaney claim Mueller vindicated Trump 'Race card': Trying to turn the tables, Trump accuses Democrats of playing 'race card' Jackson stressed that Democrats need to be careful, particularly as they look toward the general election, to not let Trump dictate the direction of the race. ""This is the fight that Trump wants to have. He wants to divide people. He wants it to be about race,” Jackson said. “Democrats have to be careful.” Trump, who has repeatedly said that if the four lawmakers “hate” the USA so much, they should leave, said he didn’t support the rally crowd's comments, but he called the chanters “incredible patriots.” The mayor, who had greeted Trump at the airport before attending the rally that drew participants from beyond Greenville, said there was “so much energy” in the arena that “I do not remember even hearing that chant.” By the next day, it was quite clear the nation had. As the former professional baseball player fielded calls and emails from around the country – including from those who said they would never visit his city – Connelly issued a statement saying he was “extremely disappointed and disheartened,” and “hate will never have a place in our community.” “It’s incumbent upon us as city leaders to tell the whole story of our city, not let it be narrated that the city is something that it’s not. We’ll continue to do that,” Connelly, a Republican elected to a nonpartisan position, told USA TODAY.  “At the end of the day, this is our home. This is where we raise our families.” Rufino, the local tea party leader, dismissed the mayor's comments as pandering for the fall election. She said the chants were not a response to Omar’s origins but to the Somali-born lawmaker's criticisms of the United States. The chants were meant to suggest that if Omar didn't like the USA, she should go elsewhere. “You can’t say if we oppose her, it’s because of her color when it’s really about what she’s saying. And we’re not able to separate that anymore in this country,” the 59-year-old lawyer said. “It just so happens that the most vile-speaking members of Congress these days are people of color or people of different origins.” Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2016, but Barack Obama's 2008 victory there underscored that it's one of the Southern states that is winnable for Democrats. Greenville backed Hillary Clinton, and she beat Trump by 8 percentage points in Pitt County. The Trump supporters in Greenville include Shonda Edwards, 46, an African American, who said she was not bothered by the chants. “I saw how she felt about America,” Edwards said of Omar. “She hates America.” Edwards, who works at a rehabilitation center while studying for degrees in nursing and business administration, didn’t attend the rally but voted for Trump in 2016 – for “a change” – and expects to vote for him again. Calvin Henderson, 81, leader of the local NAACP chapter, called Trump’s visit devastating. Henderson, who grew up in the suburbs of Greenville where he saw “white only” signs, calls himself  “a product of Jim Crow.” He said he thought the nation had gotten a step above that. “Are we beginning the fight all over again that we thought we had overcome?” Henderson asked. The city’s efforts to repair divisions and fulfill its trademarked tagline – “Find yourself in good company” – include the work of the Human Relations Council that Badwan chairs. After the terrorist attacks at mosques in New Zealand in March, Badwan pulled together a vigil at which the mayor, chief of police, a rabbi and others spoke. The Trump rally chants had extra resonance for Badwan because, like Omar, she’s a Muslim American. “But that’s not a reflection of what our community is about,” Badwan said of the remarks. “This community is portrayed as a racist community. From my experience here, that is not true.” The morning after the rally, the city manager reached out to her to make sure there had been no threats against the mosque where Badwan worships or against community members. There hadn’t been. Dan Gerlach, interim chancellor of East Carolina University, took calls from parents concerned about the safety of their minority children on campus. In response to criticism over renting the school's arena to the Trump campaign, Gerlach said he would have done that for any presidential candidate. Engulfed in controversy after only a few months on the job, Gerlach has been whipsawed between responding to those who wanted the university to issue a stronger condemnation of the rally and dealing with Trump supporters accusing him of wimping out for not personally welcoming the president to the campus and handing him a purple ECU Pirates shirt. What struck Gerlach most, he said, was the reaction of some faculty members, natives of other countries, who wondered if they’re considered part of the community. “I’m like, 'Y’all! Y’all!' "" an exasperated Gerlach, a native of Ohio, said. “ 'Some of you have been here a decade.' This fleeting moment does not define this community, this university or anything else.” Emma Arndt, 21, a senior and head of ECU’s College Republicans, said the chants are “always going to come up in conversations about this rally” – even though many attendees, like her, declined to participate in the taunts. Arndt said she found the chants disturbing. “For me, as soon as I heard it, I was disappointed,” she said. “It touched a lot of people in a bad way.” When students return, the school will hold a town-hall-style meeting to discuss the event. Similar “Cupola Conversations” – named after a free-standing dome in the middle of campus that's a symbol of the school – were held after the mass shooting in 2016 inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and after the white nationalist rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va. Last Wednesday, a week after the Trump rally, Gerlach had one of his better moments on his new job, he said. He attended a naturalization ceremony that the school’s Office of Global Affairs hosted for 39 people from 21 countries. Gerlach told the new citizens that although he counts among his ancestors a Revolutionary War soldier, they’re equals. “Today, you have the same rights and responsibilities that I have, even though my people have lived in America for hundreds of years,” he said he told them. “We’re glad you’re here because you make us better.”",2019-07-29 10:53:44,"&apos;It&apos;s breaking my heart&apos;: How Greenville, N.C. is wrestling with the fallout of Donald Trump&apos;s rally",,85390,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider

157,https://gizmodo.com/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-uses-gilroy-mass-shooting-t-1836781947,"When a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, on Sunday evening, killing at least three people, including a 6-year-old boy, and wounding 12 others, Dilbert creator Scott Adams apparently saw a juicy marketing opportunity for his blockchain app. Adams is best known for creating Dilbert, a comic strip satirizing soulless corporate culture and the grueling punishment dished out on its eponymous engineer by idiot co-workers and clueless management. But he also moonlights. In addition to punditry on topics ranging from fifth-dimensional chess analyses proclaiming Donald Trump a genius Pavlovian manipulator to tortured theological treatises, to questioning the specifics of the Holocaust’s atrocities, Adams is the co-founder of app company WhenHub. WhenHub is similar to Cameo, the app that allows everyday people to pay celebrities to create customized videos, except instead of pre-recorded messages from movie stars and rappers, it offers live chats with a range of subject-matter experts. (It’s also on the blockchain for some reason that definitely is not just capitalizing on the initial coin offering craze, a loosely regulated funding model in which investors receive digital “tokens” instead of equity.) The man behind Twitter’s “Retweet” button—which is pretty much the foundation of the whole site—now Adams seems to have concluded the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting was an ideal time to direct-market this app to witnesses—who, as he made quite clear on Twitter, he believed could cash in on their traumatic experience by selling interviews to news organizations via WhenHub. According to the Los Angeles Times, the gunman opened fire sometime around 5:30 p.m. PT on Sunday when the festival was nearing its conclusion. Less than three hours later, at 8:21 p.m. PT, about 13 minutes after President Trump advised locals to exercise caution because reports indicated the shooter was still at large, Adams began pitching the survivors on signing up for, and charging for, interviews with media outlets via WhenHub. “If you were a witness to the #GilroyGarlicFestivalshooting please sign on to Interface by WhenHub (free app) and you can set your price to take calls. Use keyword Gilroy,” Adams tweeted. Roughly 23 minutes later, Adams had some advice for critics who correctly identified this as shameless opportunism aiming to capitalize off an atrocity: Grow up and stop it with the “fake outrage.” “It’s a news gathering tool, like CNN and FOXNEws (among other uses),” Adams wrote at 8:44 p.m. PDT. “No fake outrage necessary. This is one of its intended purposes.” Adams doubled down in subsequent tweets. Later in the evening, in response to a Twitter user who wrote, “Monetizing a massacre? Disgusting. WTF?” the cartoonist wrote, “You said that on Twitter, which monetizes every news story. As does CNN. Interface is just another tool.” Adams also wrote that “no one needs to charge for anything” on WhenHub, which lets users set an hourly rate. But it is obvious that the potential to make money off the Gilroy tragedy was on Adam’s mind. When challenged by another Twitter user as to why other media outlets such as CNN weren’t offering to pay mass shooting survivors for quotes, he responded, “How do they make money?” In another response to outraged Twitter users, Adams wrote that their concerns were “fake unless you are bitching about CNN interviewing witnesses as we speak,” and he asked, “Do you scream at all the news platforms or just this one?” Adams did not immediately respond to our request for comment, although he did respond to the controversy in a livestream Monday morning on Periscope, where he continued to stand by his promotion efforts and blamed the controversy on socialism. The difference between how news organizations gather information and what Adams proposed is vast. Reputable news sources generally do not pay sources (although, there are rare situations in which specific pieces of information are unlikely to emerge any other way). More specifically, they do not try to grease the wheels when trying to quickly obtain eyewitness accounts of mass shootings—not just because waving wallets at people who were just shot at is obscene, but because crises unfolding in realtime demand careful editorial discernment and tend to be accompanied by panic and misinformation. Adams’ characterization of WhenHub’s utility as a “news gathering tool” in the wake of a mass shooting also appears to be absurdly generous, given that all WhenHub offers in this situation is the prospect of cashing in on the situation. There’s also the whole thing in which the shooter was, as of that time, reported to not be in custody. To put it another way, Dilbert guy did a Pointy-Haired Boss thing. Except the Pointy-Haired Boss is supposedly an amusing caricature of out-of-touch management, while Adams was trying to convince survivors of a massacre that happened just hours before that they were leaving cash on the table. As of early Monday morning, a search for the “Gilroy” keyword on WhenHub’s Android app found just one person took Adams up on his offer: someone falsely posting under the name and photograph of Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz and listing expertise on “Gilroy, Scott Adams being vile, journalism basics, Blockchain scams.” Gizmodo has reached out to WhenHub and its chief technical officer, Nik Kalyani, as well as Dilbert syndication firm Andrews McMeel Syndication, for comment. We’ll update this post if we hear back. What the hell happened to this man? The freakin’ Pointy-Haired Boss would have enough sense not to dive into a literal massacre for self-promotion. I have to assume he’s always been a complete dickhead, and it’s just the magic of social media that’s enabled him to put it on display for the world to see.",2019-07-29 11:29:00,Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Uses Gilroy Mass Shooting to Promote His App,,22389,http://deadspin.com
158,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/29/gilroy-gunman-posted-ominous-instagram-messages-prior-to-mass-shooting_partner/,"This article originally appeared on Raw Story On Monday, Heavy reported that the suspected gunman at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California made ominous Instagram posts in the hours prior to the massacre, which left four people dead including six-year-old Steven Romero. “Read Might Is Right by Ragnar Redbeard. Why overcrowd towns and pave more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos and Silicon Valley white twats?” wrote 19-year-old Santino William Legan next to a picture of a Smokey Bear sign on fire safety. “Might is Right” is a white supremacist, anti-Semitic manifesto authored under a pseudonym by an anarchist activist in 1890 which, among other things, advocates for women as property. He also appears to have posted an image from the festival just before the shooting, captioned with “Ayyy garlic festival time. Come get wasted on overpriced sh*t.” Legan was reportedly killed at the scene. It remains unclear what his motivation was, but one onlooker said that he proclaimed he was “really angry” as he opened fire.

159,https://www.bustle.com/p/teresa-giudice-responded-to-the-gilroy-garlic-festival-shooting-after-attending-the-event-herself-18363538,"Entertainment  The Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California was the location of a tragic mass shooting on Sunday, July 28, which left at least four people dead, including the suspected gunman, and 15 others injured. The suspect was ultimately shot and killed by police, and the investigation is ongoing. Many people have responded to the news, including a former Real Housewife who had attended the event. Teresa Giudice reacted to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting on Instagram, sending her love to the entire community late Sunday night. The Real Housewives of New Jersey star appeared in Gilroy on Saturday, July 27, a day prior to the shooting, where Giudice prepared some of her favorite garlicky dishes live on stage for attendees, as reported by Us Weekly. And if her response to the shooting was any indication, she had a fabulous time before the tragic events transpired, making them even more heartbreaking. âIâm truly heartbroken hearing the events that have taken place at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, CA,â she wrote on Instagram on Sunday. âI was at the festival yesterday with wonderful staff, volunteers and many many families & Iâm flooded with thoughts of them now as they navigate this tragic situation. Prayers and love to the community of Gilroy tonight.â As reported by Bustle, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said in a press conference that the suspect cut a fence to gain access to the festival. In an official Facebook post, the Public Information Office of the City of Gilroy stated that gunman was carrying an ""assault-style rifle."" Police engaged the suspect just less than a minute after reports of gunfire first emerged, and he was immediately shot and killed once found, per various reports. A 6-year-old boy, Steven Romero, was one of the four victims who died in the tragedy, as confirmed by family members. ""My son had his whole life to live and he was only 6,"" Alberto Romero, Steven's father, told NBC News. ""That's all I can say."" An investigation of the shooting is underway, according to Gilroy Police Chief Smithee. ""It's sort of a nightmare that you hope you never have to live in reality, but unfortunately we find ourselves in circumstances where we have to live this today,"" he said at the press conference. âItâs incredibly sad and disheartening that an event that does so much good for our community has to suffer from a tragedy like this."" Smithee also confirmed that police were looking into the possibility of a second suspect in the incident, which was reported by multiple witnesses at the scene, though police were unable to confirm this at press time. âWe believe based on witness statements that there was a second individual involved in some way. We just donât know in what way,â he said. Giudice was not the only celebrity to react to the tragic shooting. George Takei paid tribute to the victims on Twitter and pleaded for gun control measures to prevent more lives being lost. ""There are at least three dead, 15 wounded. One killed was a six year old boy who 'had his whole life still ahead of him,' said his dad,"" Takei wrote. ""We have failed him and all victims of gun violence."" No doubt more will follow Takei and Giudice's lead and wish the community of Gilroy well as they recover.

Politics Reporter Editor at Large As police in Gilroy, California, processed the crime scene at a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday that left three people dead, Dilbert comic strip creator Scott Adams decided to make some money off the tragedy. In a message to his more than 300,000 Twitter followers, Adams urged any Gilroy shooting witnesses to make an account on an app he co-founded that allows experts to make money by discussing issues over video calls. By signing up for the app, “Interface by WhenHub,” Adams claimed, witnesses could “set your price” and make money by selling interviews about the mass murder, while Adams’ company took a 20 percent cut. “If you were a witness to the #GilroyGarlicFestivalshooting please sign on to Interface by WhenHub (free app) and you can set your price to take calls,” Adams tweeted. “Use keyword Gilroy.” Adams soon faced an online backlash, with Republican pollster Frank Luntz and others accusing Adams, who has rebranded himself as pro-Trump internet personality, of using the shooting to promote his app. No actual Gilroy survivors appear to have taken Adams up on his offer. As of this writing, the only avowed “expert” for the search term “Gilroy” available on the site appears to be a troll who lists his other topics as “Scott Adams being vile” and “journalism basics.” He’s willing to talk about any of those issues for $50 an hour. During a Periscope livestream that Adams posted Monday, he announced that his cut of any payments would have been 20 percent, but claimed that he expected that most witnesses using  the WhenHub app would set the price at zero, with his potential earnings only “in the 5 to 10 dollar range.” That appears to contradict Adams’s earlier tweet, in which he encouraged shooting survivors to “set your price.” Adams didn’t respond to a request for an interview, and instead mocked the Daily Beast’s attempt to reach out to him on Twitter. Noting that he had been contacted by The Daily Beast, Adams exhorted his Twitter followers: “Let’s talk about the fake outrage trolls.” “That's really cynical—really, really cynical,” Lucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College of Journalism, told The Daily Beast. “I imagine there are some people who are going to do it, but I also imagine news media are going to use good old-fashioned methods to find these witnesses, just like they would for any other story.” Dalglish added: “There's a reason why media cover these events, and as a reader and a viewer and a citizen, I'm disturbed by the thought that presumably this guy is going to make money. If I'm a witness, my goal in life is not going to be to make money off of this horrible, horrible incident. That doesn't make anybody look good, does it? And I used to like that cartoon.” During his Periscope video, Adams claimed many of his critics on social media were just taking part in an organized campaign against him, saying that critics frequently calling him a “grifter” and a “ghoul” amounted to proof that his detractors were acting in concert. “What this is about is Trump,” said Adams, who has frequently supported and defended President Donald Trump on social media and elsewhere. “The pushback I'm getting is fueled by the intense hatred of Trump and of anybody who's ever said anything good about Trump.” Adams, who describes himself as a WhenHub’s chief strategy officer, did concede that he was using the shooting to promote his app. “For those of you who are saying, ‘Scott, you grifter, you’re using this to get attention for your app,’” Adams said. “Well, obviously, yes.” This isn’t Adams’s first bizarre attempt to promote WhenHub, which he envisioned in 2018 as a place where experts could share advice from topics ranging from “buying a horse” to “shy bladder recovery methods.” After a helicopter pilot was killed in June after his helicopter crashed into a New York City building, Adams offered $500 to any witness who would talk about the crash on his app. None appeared to have taken the offer. Anyone who signed up to discuss the shooting could also have been paid in the WHEN Token, a cryptocurrency Adams has used to fund his app that is currently worth slightly more than one cent. Shortly before Adams announced WhenHub’s cryptocurrency aspect in 2017, Dilbert watchers noticed that the characters in the comic, who are typically suspicious of poorly understood business crazes like blockchain, were suddenly running straightforward explanations of blockchain in an apparent effort to drum up interest in Adams’s cryptocurrency. Dalglish, meanwhile, said beyond the ugly spectacle of someone trying to make money from tragedy, Adams’ pitch raises ethical issues. “If you consider him [Scott Adams] to be a journalist,  and we consider most cartoonists to be journalists, there is an ethical problem here,” she said. “It's an ethical standard that we don't pay sources—at least in this country—and that's what's happening here. Sources are being paid.” Dalglish predicted that Adams' app and his promoting it for coverage of a mass shooting will be a case study taught this fall in her journalism school's ethics classes. Adams, for his part, responded defiantly to his critics. “I do plan to do the same thing again in the future,” he said on his Periscope livestream, “Now if it’s a mass shooting, I might think twice.” And then he laughed.",2019-07-29 12:29:02,‘Dilbert’ Creator Scott Adams Tries to Sell Interviews With Gilroy Garlic Festival Shooting Survivors,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

In the post, Legan — or whoever posted to the account under his name prior to the shooting — implored people to read the book Might is Right, a book first published in 1889 and attributed to an anonymous author using the pseudonym ""Ragnar Redbeard,"" according to a Google Books summary. The book ""claims the Anglo-Saxon race is superior and that women are the property of men,"" according to an account by Newsweek. The white supremacist site Counter-Currents praised the book in a 2010 review, saying that it contained a message for ""Whites in the West."" ""Anyone happily waiting for other races and ethnies (sic) to treat us 'equally' or even well, once they take over (very soon) as majorities in the US and Europe, is an illusion,"" wrote the white supremacist site. ""With the votes they will simply run our countries as they see fit and to hell with us."" The Instagram post was spotted by writer Amanda Duarte, who posted a screenshot of the now-deleted post on her Twitter account.""I'm not saying the shooting was racially motivated- I think this guy just hated everyone. But this is a fact worth knowing,"" Duarte wrote in a separate Twitter post. The caption to the post on the Legan account reads, ""Why overcrowd towns and pave more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos and Silicon Valley white t***s?"" according to The Washington Examiner. The word ""mestizos"" refers to Latin Americans of ""mixed race"" identity, according to Pew Research, which described the term as ""generally used throughout Latin America to describe people of mixed ancestry with a white European and an indigenous background."" Gilroy Police Chief Scott Smithee on Monday morning confirmed that the shooter was 19-years-old and used an AK-47 rifle in the shooting, a rifle that had been purchased legally in Nevada, according to an account by BuzzFeed News reporter Tom Namako via Twitter. But Smithee also said that police had not established a motive for the shooting, according to Namako's account. As The Inquisitr reported, statistics show that the population of Gilroy, California, is about 60 percent Hispanic, and nearly 25 percent of Gilroy residents were born outside the United States.",2019-07-29 13:29:56,"Gilroy Shooter Santino Legan Was Fan Of White Supremacist Book &#8216;Might Is Right,&#8217; Ranted Against &#8216;Mestizos&#8217;",,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com
164,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/07/29/gilroy-garlic-festival-shooter-identified-santino-william-legan/,"Trending: The man who killed three people at the Gilroy Garlic Festival has been identified, according to two news organizations. Santino William Legan was the man who opened fire with an assault-type rifle at the close of the three-day festival before Gilroy police reportedly shot and killed him, according to CBS and NBC. CBS reported Legan was 19 years old. NBC cited a federal source for the shooter’s identity. KTVU was reporting Monday morning that agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were searching a Gilroy home in connection with the shooting. Police on Sunday night said they believed a second person may have been involved in the shooting but by Monday morning had not said anything more about that suspect. Late Sunday, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee told reporters that officers from his department engaged the suspect within a minute after the gunman suddenly started firing into the crowd at around 5:30 p.m. at Christmas Hill Park. We will pause social media updates as our investigation continues throughout the night with multiple agencies on scene assisting. A press briefing will be scheduled tomorrow. #GilroyActiveShooter — Gilroy Police (@GilroyPD) July 29, 2019  Gilroy Mayor Roland Velasco declared a proclamation of a local emergency early Monday morning, as the investigation into the shooting continues. Gilroy City Council member Dion Bracco and a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told NBC News that three people had been pronounced dead. “I would ask for the thoughts and prayers of the community as our officers continue to investigate this tragic and senseless crime,” Velasco said. At a press conference Monday morning, the mayor said that the ‘’people of Gilroy are strong and resilient,’’ saying “we’ll mourn but we’ll get through it.’’ We ‘’never imagined something like this could happen here.’’ He said that the shock and sorrow were amplied by the fact that the shooting took place in the midst of an annual festival beloved by the entire Bay Area and how terrible it was to have ‘’an event like this happen.’’ The shooting brought chaos to the storied annual event south of San Jose, sending hundreds of panicked festival-goers running for cover. Among the dead was Stephen Romero, a 6-year-old San Jose boy, whose mother and grandmother were also shot and being treated at Valley Medical Center in San Jose but expected to survive. The other two people killed have not yet been publicly identified. A spokeswoman for Santa Clara Valley Medical Center said one of the shooting victims died at Saint Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy. Three shooting victims remain at SLRH in serious condition, while two other patients were transferred from the Gilroy hospital to Valley Med, according to Valley Med spokeswoman Joy Alexiou. In addition, five gunshot victims, ranging in condition from critical to fair, were transported directly to Valley Med from the scene. Investigators on Monday were still looking a possible motive in the attack. Witnesses told CBS News the gunman appeared to be firing at random. Some witnesses said he suddenly appeared from behind a stage before beginning to shoot on the final evening of the three-day event that draws 100,000 people each year. “It’s just incredibly sad and disheartening that an event that does so much good for our community has to suffer from a tragedy like this,” Smithee added. Witnesses described to KTVU a horrifying evening after the shooter, dressed in khaki shorts, cut through a perimeter fence Sunday to evade security and then opened fire at the annual family-focused festival held the last weekend in July. The Associated Press reported that the band TinMan was starting an encore when the shooting started. Singer Jack van Breen said he saw a man wearing a green shirt and grayish handkerchief around his neck fire into the food area with what looked like an assault rifle, according to the AP. He said he and other members of the band dove under the stage. Van Breen, who is from Santa Clara, told the wire service that he heard someone shout: “Why are you doing this?” and the reply: “Because I’m really angry.” The audience began screaming and running, and the five members of the band and others dove under the stage. Bandmate Vlad Malinovsky told the AP that e heard a number of shots before it stopped. Police later came by and told everyone hiding to come out with their hands up. “I still can’t believe this happened,” Candace Marquez told the station, adding that her boss at Honey Ladies was shot in the calf by the gunman. “It’s so scary. Especially here in Gilroy.” Marquez said she was going to the bathroom around 5:40 p.m. when she came outside and heard what sounded like fireworks. She told KTVU that she turned and saw a man with a rifle, dressed in khaki shorts, a green vest and a brown hat. She described him as white and possibly in his 30s. “It’s sort of a nightmare you hope you never have to live in reality,” Smithee said at a news conference late Sunday. Smithee said the suspect appeared to be firing “somewhat randomly,” and that investigators had no information on a possible motive, according to NBC News. Smithee added that police believed a second person may have been involved but that they didn’t know in what way. The shooting began as the festival was winding down, and a band was playing their last act on a festival stage. Shawn Viaggi was working near the stage when he heard loud pops and saw bullets hit the ground. “I called out, ‘It’s a real gun, let’s get out of here,’” said Viaggi, who hid under the stage with other members of the crew for several minutes before seeing police arrive. Natalie Martinez, a longtime Gilroy resident, had gone to get food and was separated from her two daughters when the shooting began. “I ran to find the girls … and we basically ran into each other.” “I thought, we’re open prey. It was awful.” Some witnesses said the gunman quietly and calmly went about his shooting spree. “He didn’t say anything,” Marquez told KTVU, describing how the shooter began loading what looked like a ammunition clip into his weapon. “He was very quiet. If we would have said a word, he would have shot us.” Another witness, 13-year-old Eveny Reyes of Gilroy, told the station that she was about to flee the area after the shots rang out when “we saw a guy with a bandana wrapped around his leg because he got shot. And there were people on the ground, crying.  There was a little kid hurt on the ground. People were throwing tables and cutting fences to get out.” Several witnesses, including Reyes, thought at first that the shots were fireworks, but then they continued. “It started going for five minutes, maybe three,” she told KTVU. “It was like the movies — everyone was crying, people were screaming.” Miquita Price, a 42-year-old Vallejo woman who arrived at the fair at 12:30 Sunday, told the Sacramento Bee that she was eating when “we heard a pop, pop noise and then we heard it again, pop, pop, pop.  And then my husband said, ‘It’s shooting,’ and he pushed me down. The pop sounds were clear, and when he stopped shooting I got up and ran for cover over to an Enterprise truck. Me, my husband and a lady and her daughter all ran for cover and as we were running the gunman started back up.” Price said the woman running with her was hit in the neck by one of the gunman’s bullets. “We see that she’s bleeding and she’s freaking out. I’m freaking out. We are all hiding under this truck and I told my husband, ’We’re safe.’ And he said, ‘No, we’re not safe. The sheriff can’t save us.’” One festival-goer told the Gilroy Dispatch that he saw the shooter dead with his hands handcuffed behind his back near the slide in the Kids Play area. “I saw them carrying kids out, ladies shot,” said the man, who did not give his name. In a statement, the event’s organizers said the “Gilroy Garlic Festival Association and the entire community of Gilroy are devastated by the shooting yesterday afternoon on the last day of the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and everyone affected by this horrific event.” At a press conference Sunday evening, Brian Bowe, the festival’s executive director,  described Gilroy as “an amazing, tightly-knitcommunity. We are family. We have had the wonderful opportunity in this community to celebrate our family through our Garlic Festival, and forover four decades that festival has been our annual family reunion. It’s such a sad, just horribly upsetting circumstance that this happened onthe third and final day of this year’s festival. News of the shooting, and particularly the death of a child, shocked a nation that has been dealing with mass shootings on an almost regular basis in recent years. Social-media outlets filled with reaction, not just condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attack, but also praise for the police officers who quickly stopped the attack as well as political commentary from both sides on gun violence and how to stem it. Several presidential candidates spoke out about the shooting, a tragedy that could be discussed in this week’s Democratic debate on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. We’re still waiting on all the details from Gilroy, but my heart is already breaking for the victims and their families and the survivors. The gun violence epidemic in this country is out of control. Please be safe and take care of one another. https://t.co/lrOA0gh6VD — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) July 29, 2019  “Yet another public event designed to bring people together has been destroyed by gunfire, claiming innocent lives and changing families and a community forever,” said Violence Policy Center Executive Director Josh Sugarmann in a statement. “The shooter, reportedly dressed in military garb and carrying an assault-type rifle, is the result of a gun industry that embraces militarization and heightened lethality in the design, production, and marketing of its products. Until the gun industry is held fully accountable for its dangerous actions, these horrific attacks will continue unabated.” A GoFundMe campaign for the Romero family has been launched by the  South County Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Fiat in Gilroy.

I was at the Gilroy Garlic Festival for four hours on Saturday with my wife, my daughter and her boyfriend. We spent most of our time at the northern end of the park, sampling the garlic-laden food, taking in a bit of a cooking show and exploring the various booths. That’s right: If the shooter who killed three and injured 12 on Sunday had chosen to come to the park a day earlier, we could have been in the middle of the tragedy. Like many of you, I spent the night trying to make sense of it all. I found that impossible because it’s such a senseless act. Who turns a rifle on a crowd of people? Who randomly kills a 6-year-old boy or a 13-year-old girl? Who decides to make a mass shooting his life legacy? What would have happened if we had been there? I thought about security as we entered the festival on Saturday. There were guards with metal-detecting wands checking people before they entered. One examined my wife’s bag and asked me if I had any knives or sharp objects. But he didn’t use a wand to verify that I wasn’t carrying a weapon. He took my word for it. I remember being troubled by that. But I also recall thinking that anyone who wants to do anyone real harm will likely find a way to elude security precautions. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said Sunday night that’s exactly what happened. The 19-year-old shooter, identified as Santino William Legan, reportedly entered the festival by cutting a fence and crossing Uvas Creek. We all owe the Gilroy police officers on duty a debt of gratitude for responding within a minute of the shooting and killing the gunman. My brother is a former deputy sheriff in the state of Washington, and we’ve talked about the incredible courage it takes to run toward a shooting when every bone in your body is screaming at you to do the opposite. Dozens are likely still alive today because of the Gilroy officers’ actions. But now what? We’ve attended the Garlic Festival every year for the past five years. We love the food. We love the family atmosphere, and we especially love that all the money goes to charity. It’s simply one of America’s great food festivals. Will we go again? I don’t know about you, but I’m planning to attend in 2020. And I’m hoping you will, too. I refuse to be a part of letting fear destroy an event that has raised nearly $12 million for worthy charity groups and non-profits groups that do so much good for the community. And I plan to redouble my efforts to do something about the number of available assault weapons in California and across the country. I hope you will, too. California already prohibits anyone from possessing an assault weapon unless he or she possessed the firearm prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon and registered the firearm with the California Department of Justice. But that still leaves too many assault weapons out there, in this state and across the nation. In this case, the shooter bought the gun 19 days earlier in Nevada. It’s time to address this problem on a national scale. I’m not anti-gun. I grew up going hunting regularly with my dad, who taught me the importance of gun safety. My high school had mandatory ROTC for sophomore boys. We we were taught to disassemble and reassemble a rifle and went to the rifle range for target practice. I have always found hunters to be among the most environmentally and safety-conscious people I know. I respect people’s right to own guns — as long as they do so in a responsible fashion. But assault rifles are another matter. I don’t believe that our founding fathers would have advocated that people be able to own assault rifles any more than they would have sanctioned people possessing any weapon of mass destruction. They would have been horrified at what happened in Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland — and now Gilroy.

Others, from Brooklyn to Ohio, barely register in a nation raining bullets—many of them on kids. Special Correspondent For the first time in the annual Garlic Festival’s 41 years, the ever present danger of a mass shooting prompted the organizers have a security team at the entrance check bags and wand all adult attendees with a metal detector. But the gunman in Gilroy, California seems to have simply cut a hole in the far side of what the police later described as a “secure fence line.” He raised an assault rifle and needed just a minute to kill three and wound fifteen. The dead included 6-year-old Stephen Romero. His mother, Barbara Aquirre, was shot in the stomach and leg but managed to call her husband. “They shot him,” she reportedly told him. In the ensuing confusion, police said a second suspect might still be at large. What was immediately clear and undeniable was that all the added security and precautions had not not prevented exactly what the organizers hoped to deter. “Be careful and safe,” President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday night. Trump had tweeted nothing at all after the mass shooting at another annual event in his own home town on Saturday. Maybe the one dead and 11 injured in that other event as not a high enough body count to warrant Trump's attention. Surely he did not ignore the mass shooting at Old Timers Day because it was in Brownsville, a minority, largely ungentrified neighborhood in Brooklyn. As in Gilroy, the carnage in Brownsville erupted just at the event was wrapping up. Two gunmen opened fire as the crowd was singing “Family Reunion.” That is the traditional closing song at this gathering celebrating those who survived the many dangers of growing up and living in that neighborhood. A 38-year-old man will not be among those who attend next year’s celebration. Among many Americans who will not reach old-timerhood at all is 3-year-old Sa’Raija Watson of Seutbenville, Ohio. Sa’Raija was in a car driven by her mother on September 24 when a gunman opened fire on them for no apparent reason. The child was shot in the head. Her mother, Mahogany Luke, was shot in the stomach and leg, just as little Stephen’s mother later was in Gilroy. Sa’Raija was deemed to be in grave condition and flown by helicopter to a children's hospital 40 miles away in Pittsburgh. The mother was taken to a local facility, but soon after signed herself out against medical advice and made her way to her daughter. “It was kind of bad,” the mother recalled of her own wounds in an interview with The Daily Beast. “I still stood by her side.” Sa’Raija lay in a mass of tubes and monitor wires. “I couldn’t hold her,” the mother remembered. “She had too much stuff attached to her.” The child survived, but went from speaking in full sentences to being unable to speak at all. She also could no longer walk; a toddler unable to toddle. “She was like a new baby,” the mother told The Daily Beast. Sa’Raija still brightened when she saw her mother. And after a while she was doing something else. “She would smile,” the mother reported. In January, the doctors decided Sa’Raija could go home. “To me, it seems like she was getting better,” the mother later said of the months that followed. “She was moving her arms a little bit more, moving her legs a little bit more.” She could still not talk, but she would smile and delight in watching the Trolls on television. She awoke the household each morning with sounds announcing that she was ready for a new day. On the morning of June 22, Luke slept late and wondered why Sa’Raija had not roused her as usual. The mother went into her daughter's room. “She was not breathing,” Luke recalled. Nine months after being shot, months during which she turned 3-years-old, Sa’Raija was pronounced dead. By then, 18-year-old Brylee West had been charged with the shooting. He had not long before been released from prison after serving four years for a shooting committed when he was 14. He pleaded not guilty in this new case. As the charge in Sa’Raija’s case threatened to go from attempted murder to murder, West’s attorneys sought an autopsy in addition to the one requested by the Jefferson County prosecutor’s office. The coroner has in the meantime refused to release the body to the mother, who has been forced to put any funeral plans on hold for more than a month. The prosecutor, Jane Hanlin, did not respond to a query from The Daily Beast regarding when Luke might get her daughter back to bury. During the long wait, Luke has noted news reports of one young child after another who had also fallen victim to gunfire. On July 2, Ivory West, age 2, of Spring, Texas was fatally shot in a robbery. July 6, Alberto Rios Navarrette, age 5, of Winston-Salem, North Carolina was killed in a drive-by. July 13, Brooklyn Harris, age 3, of Milwaukee was killed in a road rage incident. On July 18, Karon Brown, age 11, of Washington, D.C., was killed by a stray round. On July 21, Eddie Hill, age 10, of North Saint Louis, Missouri was also killed by a stay round. Kid after kid was being killed in a country that seemed barely to notice beyond the immediate community of the latest death. “It's crazy how many kids are shot and killed,” Luke told the Daily Beast early last week. “It’s heartbreaking.” And then, on Sunday, 6-year-old Stephen Romero was killed in the mass shooting in Gilroy along with a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s. This latest carnage despite a secure fence line and a big search and metal detectors and cops and every possible protection save perhaps meaningful gun control that might have kept an assault rifle out of the hands of a “really angry” 19-year-old. Luke knew from her own experience that Stephen’s mother would have barely noticed the wounds to her stomach and leg. “I was never really worried about myself,” Luke told The Daily Beast on Monday. “When you’re a parent, you don’t really think about yourself.” An hour later, our president stood in the Rose Garden at the White House and spoke of the mass shooting in Gilroy. “We reaffirm our national will to answer violence with the courage, determination, and resolve of one American family,” Trump declared. “We will continue to work together as communities and as citizens to stop evil, prevent violence, and protect the safety of all Americans.” Trump had still not said a word about the mass shooting in his hometown or about the deaths of one young child after another after another.

(Reuters) - Police on Monday identified a 19-year-old California man as the gunman who opened fire with an assault rifle at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and wounding about a dozen. Santino William Legan, 19, cut through a fence at the festival on Sunday evening and shot people, seemingly at random, with an “AK-47-style” assault rifle, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee told reporters. Legan was fatally shot within about a minute by police. “It could have gone so much worse so fast,” Smithee said, noting that the festival, which takes place about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Silicon Valley, is attended by thousands of visitors. Police and FBI agents were trying to determine a motive for the shooting and investigating unconfirmed reports by witnesses that Legan may have had an accomplice. Smithee said that search warrants had been obtained for a home in Gilroy associated with the suspect and a car that police believe he drove to the festival. Legan killed a six-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s, Smithee said. Police believe Legan, who was originally from Gilroy, purchased the rifle legally on July 9 in Nevada, where he had recently been living. At least 11 people were treated for wounds, a spokesman for the Santa Clara Health System said late on Monday. Of those shot, five remained at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center Monday night, he said. Three of those were in serious or fair condition and two wished to have no information released, he said. Early police reports said that one person was in critical condition on Sunday. Another 10 people received other, non-life threatening injuries, the hospital spokesman said, and were treated at St. Louise Regional Hospital. Seven of the victims ranged in age between 12 and 69, officials said. Police had initially said that 15 people were wounded. ‘WICKED MURDERER’ President Donald Trump described the gunman as a “wicked murderer” during an event at the White House and asked Americans to pray for the victims. “We grieve for their families, and we ask that God will comfort them with his overflowing mercy and grace,” Trump said. The gunman was believed to have cut through the fence in order to evade metal detectors and other security measures at the entrance, police said. Legan appeared to post a photograph from the festival on his Instagram account shortly before the shooting, with captions expressing his disdain for the event. “Ayyy garlic festival time,” he wrote beneath a picture of people walking through the festival grounds. “Come get wasted on overpriced shit.” Another photograph posted on Sunday showed a sign warning of a high danger of forest fires. Its caption urged people to read “Might is Right,” a racist and sexist treatise written in the 19th century. “Why overcrowd towns and pave more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos and Silicon Valley white twats?” the caption said, referring to people of mixed race. The account was only a few days old, and was deactivated on Monday. Police said they had determined that a 20-year-old man who posted on social media on Monday that he had “just shot up the G-festival” was not involved in the incident and was just seeking attention. Footage uploaded to social media showed festival attendees scattering in fear and confusion as loud popping sounds could be heard in the background. Police declined to name the shooting victims on Monday but the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner identified them as Stephen Romero, six, and Keyla Salazar, 13, of San Jose, and Trevor Deon Irby, 25, of Romulus, New York. The boy’s grandmother, Maribel Romero, described Stephen as a loving boy who was “always kind, happy and ... playful.” His mother and his other grandmother were also shot and were being treated in hospital, Maribel Romero told media. A vigil was scheduled in Gilroy for the victims on Monday evening. Founded in 1979, the Gilroy Garlic Festival is an annual event run by volunteers and held outdoors at Christmas Hill Park. The agricultural community bills itself as the “Garlic Capital of the World.” Weapons of any kind are prohibited, according to the event’s website, which also said anyone wearing clothing or paraphernalia indicating membership in a gang, including a motorcycle club, would be refused entry.

By JAKE SHERMAN, ANNA PALMER, GARRETT ROSS and ELI OKUN 07/29/2019 12:27 PM EDT Presented by Some Joe Biden allies are worrying that he needs to perform well at this week‘s presidential debate. | Bill Pugliano/Getty Images PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP this morning condemned the mass shooting in California as a “wicked murder” and said “we’re praying for those who are recovering right now in the hospital. … We will continue to work together as communities ... to stop evil,” per pooler Francesca Chambers of the Daily Mail. -- ON 9/11: “I was down there also, but I’m not considering myself a first responder.” Trump was signing the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund bill. NO DEMOCRATIC elected officials were at the event, per the pool report. The following Republicans were there: Sen. Deb Fischer (Neb.) and Reps. Mark Meadows (N.C.), Chris Collins (N.Y.), Peter King (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), John Joyce (Pa.), Dan Meuser (Pa.) and Michael Burgess (Texas). WAPO’S @seungminkim: “Schumer did get a White House invite to 9/11 event, received 12:25 a.m. on July 27, per office. He has previous commitment in upstate New York. Have yet to hear back from Gillibrand’s folks.” THE WHITE HOUSE told us that every member of Congress was invited to this event. Invites were sent Saturday morning. Of course, the House is in recess, and the Senate doesn’t vote until this afternoon, so not many people are in town. TALKER … NYT’S KATIE GLUECK and JONATHAN MARTIN: “Why Joe Biden’s Age Worries Some Democratic Allies and Voters”: “As aides and allies watched Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s first debate performance last month, their initial optimism about his abilities turned to alarm as Senator Kamala Harris laced into him over race and busing. “It wasn’t just Mr. Biden’s halting answers that worried some of them. They thought he was showing his age — that, at 76, he appeared slow off the mark, uncertain about how to counterpunch as he allowed Ms. Harris to land clean hits without interruption. … “‘It felt like he was a step slow,” said Mike Lux, a Democratic strategist who was a top Iowa staffer for Mr. Biden during his 1988 presidential campaign and is so far neutral this cycle. ‘If Joe comes back strong in the next few debates, I think it’ll be fine. But I do think he looked kind of old in this debate.’ … “‘Vice President Biden is in excellent physical condition,’ said Dr. [Kevin] O’Connor, a retired Army colonel, who served as a White House physician and was named physician to the vice president in 2009. ‘He is more than capable of handling the rigors of the campaign and the office for which he is running.’” NYT MEMO FROM RAHM … “A Memo to Our Democratic Presidential Candidates: Don’t make Detroit’s debates a repeat of Miami”: “Let’s start with the basics. If you’re going to evict Donald Trump from the White House and secure the country’s future, you have to replicate what the last two Democratic presidents did so successfully on their campaigns. You need to unite all primary voters. “There’s a reason Trump gleefully tweeted ‘That’s the end of that race!’ during the first debate: Too often, you succumbed to chasing plaudits on Twitter, which closed the door on swing voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. If you win the nomination in a way that forecloses a path to victory in the general election, we will lose, and your name will go down in infamy. “This time, don’t fall into the traps that had many of us shaking our heads during the debates in Miami. Before our party promises health care coverage to undocumented immigrants — a position not even Ted Kennedy took — let’s help the more than 30 million Americans who are a single illness away from financial ruin. Before we start worrying about whether the Boston Marathon bomber can vote, let’s stop states that are actively trying to curtail voting rights of citizens. And before we promise a guaranteed minimum income to healthy adults who prefer to stay home and play video games, let’s increase the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit to benefit the millions of people who work hard and still live near poverty.” Medium IMMIGRATION FILES -- BUZZFEED’S @ZoeTillman: “New immigration law decision from AG Barr — finding that being part of a nuclear family targeted by a gang doesn’t qualify as ‘membership in a particular social group’ for asylum purposes.

So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next, Reverend Al will show up to complain & protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!” … at 7:04 a.m.: “If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left ‘Squad’ and King Elijah’s Baltimore Fail, it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!” … at 7:26 a.m.: “Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events.

ON THE FED … @realDonaldTrump at 7:48 a.m.: “The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems, making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime, and with very low inflation, our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!” … at 9:18 a.m.: “The Fed ‘raised’ way too early and way too much.

We are competing with other.....” “....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That’s actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China, until now, the U.S. has been ‘easy pickens.’ The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough, but we will win anyway!” -- WAPO’S HEATHER LONG: “The Federal Reserve this week is all but certain to cut interest rates despite unemployment being at historic lows, a highly unusual action that is shaping up to be the biggest gamble of Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell’s brief tenure as leader of the world’s most powerful economic institution. Many economists say the Fed is acting prudently to prolong the economic expansion, which this month became the longest in U.S. history. Yet the support is far from unanimous.” WaPo THE NEXT CONFIRMATION FIGHT -- “Dem senators slam Ratcliffe’s nomination for intel chief,” by Quint Forgey: “‘I’ll certainly do my own evaluation, but it strikes me as a very inappropriate choice for the job in a moment when we are trying to lift intelligence out of the political soup,’ [Sen. Chris] Murphy said, accusing [Rep. John] Ratcliffe of acting as ‘one of the president's accomplices in trying to politicize intelligence.’ “Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) on Monday also predicted broad Democratic resistance to the administration’s efforts to confirm Ratcliffe.” POLITICO PAGING ROBERT LIGHTHIZER -- “China’s Cybersecurity Regulations Rattle U.S. Businesses,” by WSJ’s Yoko Kubota in Beijing: “The new draft rules and standards, released over the past two months with little fanfare, flesh out an existing cybersecurity law that the U.S. and many foreign businesses already consider draconian. … “The timing suggests Beijing is using them to show Washington it has options to punish U.S. businesses, experts said.” WSJ TRADE WARS -- WSJ’S SHAYNDI RAICE in Williamsburg, Mich.: “Cherry Capital of the U.S. Faces Threat From Turkish Imports”: “Dorance Amos pulls handfuls of tart red cherries out of large tanks filled with cold water, looking for blemishes. ‘These will grade well,’ he says. The apparent bounty hides a grim reality: He hasn’t made a profit in three years. “Mr. Amos is one of many Michigan tart-cherry farmers struggling amid a flood of low-price dried cherries from Turkey. The industry petitioned the U.S. government to impose duties on the imports, claiming Turkish importers underprice the fruit and the Turkish government unfairly subsidizes the industry. The U.S. government said in June that there was enough evidence to proceed with an investigation.” WSJ 2020 WATCH -- MAGGIE SEVERNS and ZACH MONTELLARO: “How Democratic debate rules are forcing a billionaire to plead for pennies”: “[Tom] Steyer launched his 2020 campaign a little over two weeks ago and plans to self-fund his White House run with $100 million of his own money. But he still needs 130,000 people to donate to him by August 28 (and get at least 2 percent in four polls) to qualify for the third primary debate … “The bars imposed by the DNC pose a major test of whether Steyer’s message and his millions can actually attract enough support for a viable presidential campaign — and fast. Just days out of the gate, Steyer’s campaign has no grassroots fundraising base of its own and is competing for votes with candidates who have been in the race for months. So Steyer is flooding Facebook and Google with ads — at least $927,000 worth so far — trying to buy up new donors and airing over $4.3 million on TV spots that could give him a boost in the polls.” POLITICO THE POLICY PRIMARY -- “Kamala Harris’ new health plan: Medicare for all — with private insurers,” by Dan Diamond and Chris Cadelago: “Sen. Kamala Harris on Monday unveiled a plan to achieve universal coverage by growing Medicare with the help of private insurers, an effort that splits the difference with her chief Democratic presidential rivals and finally equips the California Democrat with her own signature health proposal ahead of this week’s debates. … “Under so-called KamalaCare, which establishes a phase-in period of a decade, Harris has at last settled on a way to keep private health insurers in the fold after seesawing on the question … But Harris’ proposal skimps on myriad details, including the plan’s cost. … Harris’ new plan breaks with her rivals who occupy the opposite poles of the debate by effectively proposing ‘Medicare Advantage for all’ — permitting private insurers to continue selling plans, akin to the two-decade-old offshoot of Medicare — in addition to letting Americans immediately buy into the traditional Medicare program and adding new benefits.” POLITICO … Medium post -- ALEX THOMPSON and ADAM BEHSUDI: “Warren moves to outflank Trump on trade”: “Elizabeth Warren released a trade plan Monday that’s closer to Donald Trump’s agenda than Barack Obama’s. … Warren’s plans lists nine separate criteria a country has to meet before negotiating a trade deal with the U.S. Those standards include upholding and enforcing the labor rights laid out by the International Labour Organization, eliminating all domestic fossil fuel subsidies, fulfilling commitments from the Paris Climate Agreement, not running afoul of the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights, and not being on the Treasury Department’s monitoring list for manipulative currency practices. “The requirements would apply not only to new trade deals but to existing treaties that Warren pledges to renegotiate. Taken together, Warren's mandates would fundamentally change American trade policy.” POLITICO … Medium post THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- WSJ’S SARAH CHANEY: “The Labor Department released a final rule to make it easier for small businesses to band together to create joint 401(k) retirement plans for workers.

172,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-defends-urging-witnesses-to-make-money-off-gilroy-shooting/,"Trending: “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams is blaming critics of Donald Trump and gun control advocates for whipping up the social media firestorm he encountered Sunday when he urged survivors of the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting to use an app he co-founded to sell their stories to the news media — with him taking a cut. In a video posted to Twitter, the Pleasanton cartoonist also denounced “trolls’ for “showboating fake outrage” by suggesting he lacked empathy for the two children and one adult who were killed and the dozen who were injured in the Sunday night mass shooting at the festival, which Adams pointed out is “very close to home.” In the video, Adams said he was simply trying to let his followers know about “a tool” that could quickly disseminate information about such a major news event. “We’re all feeling very very bad for the people who experienced it,” Adams said in his video. Attempts to reach Adams for further comments were unsuccessful. His phone voicemail box was full and he did not respond to a tweet seeking comment. Adams gained worldwide fame and acclaim through his cartoon “Dilbert,” which debuted in 1989, but in recent years has become known for his controversial expressions of admiration for President Trump. He claims that’s why he’s getting attacked now. “What this is about is Trump,” said Adams in the Twitter video. “All of the pushback I’m getting is fueled by an intense hatred of Trump, or therefore for anyone who has ever said anything good about Trump. It also is about gun control, and it’s about people feeling helpless to be able to do something about it.” On Sunday night, Adams shared a message with his more than 300,000 Twitter followers about his “Interface by WhenHub” app. The WhenHub app allows experts or anyone else with unique knowledge of a situation, including witnesses to a high-profile crime, to discuss what they know over a video call. Adams told people they could “set their price” and make money talking about what they experienced during the shooting. As the app works, Adams’ company would take a 20-percent cut. If you were a witness to the #GilroyGarlicFestivalshooting please sign on to Interface by WhenHub (free app) and you can set your price to take calls. Use keyword Gilroy. https://t.co/ilASD9kVAt — Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) July 29, 2019  The condemnation for Adams’ tweet was swift, with people accusing him of being a “ghoul” and a “grifter.” “Not many people would see the upside to a mass shooting and the death of a six year old as clearly as you have, much less promote their business to benefit directly from it as you have,” tweeted a user, who identifies himself as a mobile series reliability engineer from San Jose. “Unforgettable.” “Hard to imagine tweeting this,” wrote Bill Dallman, a TV journalist in Seattle. In his video, Adams pushed back against critics, saying he was simply trying to get people with information about a major news event in contact with reporters as quickly as possible. He said his app is another “news gathering tool” and agreed the public “has a legitimate need to know” about a mass shooting in their town or region. Adams added that in such a situation, he wouldn’t expect a witness to charge for sharing their story. The witness would “set their price at zero,” which means his company wouldn’t benefit financially. But if a witness chose to charge for an interview, a news organization would have the option “to not pay if it doesn’t feel right.” Most news organizations, including the Mercury News and East Bay Times, do not pay news sources for interviews or information. Certain tabloid news companies, such as TMZ or American Media, the owner of the National Enquirer, have sparked debate for their willingness to pay news sources. Adams said he could also see a witness initially giving a free interview to CNN or Fox News as a service to inform the public. But then the person could charge for the time involved in giving additional interviews. “That feels legitimate to me,” Adams said. “That doesn’t feel dirty.” Adams said people are failing to understand that the situation isn’t “two-dimensional.” “Here’s my take on this. As you know, I don’t live in the 2-D world,” he explained. “In the 2-D world, things are exactly like they look on the surface. If you live in the 2-D world, there is a horrible tragedy, and somebody offers something a commercial product in the midst of it. Therefore: Evil, bad, we must attack him.” Adams said he believes the outrage is “political,” but also stems from people feeling angry and helpless. He noted that he similarly promoted the app in June, when he encouraged people to weigh in if they saw a helicopter crash into a New York City highrise. The crash killed the pilot. Adams said no one raised concerns that he was trying to exploit that tragedy, probably because it wasn’t politically loaded. Adams said people’s target is guns, “and anybody who is in favor or guns, which makes them think of Republicans, which makes them think of Trump, which makes them think about anyone who has ever said anything good about Trump in their lifetime. Which brings it to me.” Adams specifically called out Republican pollster Frank Luntz who excoriated him for touting his app on Sunday night. Luntz tweeted, “You’re really using an in-progress mass-shooting to promote your app, Scott?” Luntz further chided Adams by saying that the only number witnesses should call is the police. Adams said people should, of course, call police first. He accused Luntz of trying to promote his own “brand” by moving to take the moral high ground. “Is (this) really about me? Is is about the victims?” Adams said. “In this case, it probably wasn’t even about Trump. It was about (Luntz) displaying his goodness in relationship to my horrible badness.” As for other entities trying to claim the moral high ground, Adams called out news organizations, from which most people learned about the shooting. He pointed out that most TV, online or print news organizations are for-profit entities that need viewers or readers to stay in business. “Anyone who knows about the Gilroy tragedy all heard it from a news organization that charges money, in a sense, through advertising,” Adams added. “So in a sense there is no such thing as a news platform that isn’t about making money.” As of Monday afternoon, no Gilroy survivors had taken Adams up on his offer. The only person offering up himself up as an “expert” was someone named Jeff Horwitz who appeared to want to troll Adams, by saying he was willing to talk to anyone for $50 an hour about “Scott Adams being vile” and “journalism basics.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2019-07-29 17:58:52,&#8216;Dilbert&#8217; creator Scott Adams defends urging witnesses to make money off Gilroy shooting,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

Gavin Newsom, were reeling Monday, the day after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. A gunman killed three people and wounded at least 12 people on the last day of the annual event that attracts thousands of visitors, authorities said. Newsom called the survivors the ""true heroes"" after visiting some of the injured at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, noting that families comforted him and not the other way around. One woman was concerned about her hospitalized daughter, Newsom told reporters, but trying also to mourn the death of her 6-year-old grandson. “Any time a life is lost it’s a tragedy,” said Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee at a news conference Monday. “But when it’s young people, it’s even worse. It’s very difficult.” Stephen Romero, 6, was at the event with his mother and grandmother, who were also shot. They’re expected to survive. ""My son had his whole life to live and he was only 6,"" his father, Alberto Romero, told NBC Bay Area. “That's all I can say."" 'They shot my son': 6-year-old Stephen Romero is among victims of California shooting rampage Romero posted a picture of Stephen at LegoLand California Theme Park shortly after the shooting asking for anyone with information to contact police. A GoFundMe campaign has been established to help with the cost of funeral expenses. Trevor Irby, 25, was attending the festival with his girlfriend. Irby graduated from Keuka College in New York in 2017. He majored in biology. The president of the upstate New York college issued a statement confirming Irby’s death Monday: “Our hearts go out to Trevor’s family and loved ones. We are shocked that this latest episode of senseless gun violence resulted in the loss of one of our recent graduates – graduates in whom we place so much hope because of their potential to create a brighter tomorrow.” Irby’s aunt, Tamara Williams, also confirmed his death on Facebook. Her post was accompanied by a photo of Irby wearing a cap and gown at his college graduation. He’s smiling and standing next to this grandfather, who died last month, in the photo. Ibry’s cousin, Hayley Walborm, wrote that Irby was planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend. “One person decided to take all of that away. 25 years, and you lived them to the fullest,” she wrote in an extended Facebook post. “I’m envious of the adventures you have gone on and the life you have lived to the absolute fullest in the past 25 years. I pray you’re at peace and I pray that grandpa protected you as best as he could. You are now reunited with grandpa Ralph, Tyler, and Simba amongst others you’ve lost. It’s humbling to see and to know how many lives you have touched, but I already knew this. You were everyone’s friend. You always tried to make people smile and laugh. I vow to live life to the fullest in your honor and to be a friend to everyone I come into contact with, like you. And I vow to watch every Steelers’ game that I can for you.” The Santa Clara Coroner's Office confirmed that 13-year-old Keyla Salazar was among the dead. At 9:30 p.m. Sunday, Keyla’s mother, Lorena Pimentel Vargas, posted a photo of her two daughters on Facebook asking anyone who knew of her whereabouts to contact her. “The one in blue is my daughter there was gunshots and I don’t know where she is I’ve been trying to call and see where my daughter is please if you have information please let me know please,” she wrote in Spanish. A mother, father and their 3-year-old daughter were among the families Newsom said he met Monday at the hospital. The girl acted bravely, Newsom said the mother recounted, and just wanted to go in the same ambulance with her parents. Another child with a gunshot wound in her leg told Newsom she was jumping in a bounce house when the shooting began. ""There was a 12-year-old shot who smiled when I walked into the room,"" Newsom said. ""I said, 'How are you smiling after you were shot?' She starts describing the courage as she was shot and kept running. And here she is comforting the governor.""

(Reuters) - Police on Monday identified a 19-year-old California man as the gunman who opened fire with an assault rifle at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and wounding about a dozen. Santino William Legan, 19, cut through a fence at the festival on Sunday evening and shot people, seemingly at random, with an “AK-47-style” assault rifle, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee told reporters. Legan was fatally shot within about a minute by police. “It could have gone so much worse so fast,” Smithee said, noting that the festival, which takes place about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Silicon Valley, is attended by thousands of visitors. Police and FBI agents were trying to determine a motive for the shooting and investigating unconfirmed reports by witnesses that Legan may have had an accomplice. Smithee said that search warrants had been obtained for a home in Gilroy associated with the suspect and a car that police believe he drove to the festival. Legan killed a six-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s, Smithee said. Police believe Legan, who was originally from Gilroy, purchased the rifle legally on July 9 in Nevada, where he had recently been living. At least 11 people were treated for wounds, a spokesman for the Santa Clara Health System said late on Monday. Of those shot, five remained at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center Monday night, he said. Three of those were in serious or fair condition and two wished to have no information released, he said. Early police reports said that one person was in critical condition on Sunday. Another 10 people received other, non-life threatening injuries, the hospital spokesman said, and were treated at St. Louise Regional Hospital. Seven of the victims ranged in age between 12 and 69, officials said. Police had initially said that 15 people were wounded. ‘WICKED MURDERER’ President Donald Trump described the gunman as a “wicked murderer” during an event at the White House and asked Americans to pray for the victims. “We grieve for their families, and we ask that God will comfort them with his overflowing mercy and grace,” Trump said. The gunman was believed to have cut through the fence in order to evade metal detectors and other security measures at the entrance, police said. Legan appeared to post a photograph from the festival on his Instagram account shortly before the shooting, with captions expressing his disdain for the event. “Ayyy garlic festival time,” he wrote beneath a picture of people walking through the festival grounds. “Come get wasted on overpriced shit.” Another photograph posted on Sunday showed a sign warning of a high danger of forest fires. Its caption urged people to read “Might is Right,” a racist and sexist treatise written in the 19th century. “Why overcrowd towns and pave more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos and Silicon Valley white twats?” the caption said, referring to people of mixed race. The account was only a few days old, and was deactivated on Monday. Police said they had determined that a 20-year-old man who posted on social media on Monday that he had “just shot up the G-festival” was not involved in the incident and was just seeking attention. Footage uploaded to social media showed festival attendees scattering in fear and confusion as loud popping sounds could be heard in the background. Police declined to name the shooting victims on Monday but the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner identified them as Stephen Romero, six, and Keyla Salazar, 13, of San Jose, and Trevor Deon Irby, 25, of Romulus, New York. The boy’s grandmother, Maribel Romero, described Stephen as a loving boy who was “always kind, happy and ... playful.” His mother and his other grandmother were also shot and were being treated in hospital, Maribel Romero told media. A vigil was scheduled in Gilroy for the victims on Monday evening. Founded in 1979, the Gilroy Garlic Festival is an annual event run by volunteers and held outdoors at Christmas Hill Park. The agricultural community bills itself as the “Garlic Capital of the World.” Weapons of any kind are prohibited, according to the event’s website, which also said anyone wearing clothing or paraphernalia indicating membership in a gang, including a motorcycle club, would be refused entry.

177,https://nypost.com/2019/07/29/angry-young-men-continue-to-be-americas-greatest-threat/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Opinion By Maureen Callahan Submit July 29, 2019 | 10:15pm				| Updated July 29, 2019 | 10:27pm Less than 24 hours after yet another mass shooting in America, the youngest fatalities a 6-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, authorities said they were still seeking a motive. It seems the 19-year-old shooter gave us one. “Why are you doing this?” a witness heard someone shout. The response: “Because I’m really angry.” From those mass shooters who have attacked the innocent before, we know it’s a specific strain of anger — deep, repressed, biblically vengeful — felt most commonly by young men, almost always white, who report feeling alienated, dispossessed, misunderstood, victimized and all too often rejected by women. Their chosen outlet is the mass slaughter of innocents, carnage at places the rest of us once deemed safe — schools, hospitals, places of work and worship, concerts, carnivals — all meant to hold us hostage, in fear of the next reprisal we’re not responsible for and won’t see coming. Little is known yet about this shooter’s history — and I refrain from using his name, since infamy is part of what these shooters seek — but so far, he fits the profile of those who’ve come before, the rage-induced young men we first encountered through Columbine and later Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, Virginia Beach, the STEM school shooting in Colorado, Charlotte, the Poway synagogue shooting in California, the Louisiana shootings in two parishes, the Sebring shootings in Florida (those last six this year alone), the Mercy Hospital shooting, the Thousand Oaks shooting, the Tallahassee yoga studio shooting, the Jacksonville Landing shooting, the Art All Night shooting in New Jersey, the Santa Fe HS (Texas) shooting, the Nashville Waffle House shooting, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS shooting — and far too many more to mention, but all with one thing in common. The ever-incubating mass shooter, these young men nurturing their anger through first-person shooter games, violent pornography, through racism and a fascination with guns and violence, is our greatest, most stubborn and pressing threat — more so, I would argue, than Islamic terrorism or Russian hacking or immigration or trade wars. America is in the throes of a decades-long epidemic that we have come to regard as we do AIDS or some forms of cancer, somehow tolerating it in our body politic rather than trying to solve it, or even address it. Yes, we have a president who may be our angriest ever, who unleashes daily a fusillade of threats and name-calling and sexist remarks and racist dog whistles. But it would be facile to say Trump is the cause of this rage, which existed long before he got here, long before 9/11, long before the tech bubble or the Great Recession. Wittingly or not, this collective anger is something Trump has tapped into and continues to ride, while the rest of us shout and argue over gun control or access to mental health or the culpability of parents and teachers. All of those things are relevant, of course, but they are not the cause. It is anger, stoked to malignancy by a culture in which it’s become acceptable to isolate yourself and talk, online only, to people who think and blame and rage like you do. And that way of life has somehow become almost normal. Last week, the nation celebrated one of humanity’s greatest triumphs — the moon landing, something once commonly believed couldn’t be done. Perhaps our next moon shot should, paradoxically, be more earthbound: a collective dedication, from the White House on down, to figuring out why young men in the world’s greatest, most prosperous country are so goddamn angry.

They responded to Sunday’s assault within a minute and neutralized the shooter despite being outgunned. And yet they couldn’t prevent a tragedy – three deaths and at least 12 people injured. The attack illustrates the difficult of protecting an outdoor event in a large venue, especially when weapons that can kill multiple people in a matter of seconds are easily accessible. Police in the Northern California town of Gilroy, about 80 miles southeast of San Francisco, said the gunman cut through a back fence and used an assault-type rifle legally purchased in Nevada to gun down visitors at the popular festival’s final day. “The unique thing about a festival-type environment is the planners have to walk a very fine line,’’ said Jason Porter, vice president of operations for the security firm Pinkerton. “Obviously they’re responsible for providing a secure and safe environment, but they also have to have an open environment to draw the crowd. It’s increasingly a challenge, especially in an outdoor-type event.’’ 'A tragedy': California mourns victims of Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting The yearly garlic festival, which raises money for local charities and nonprofits, draws crowds of 80,000 to 100,000. Chicago’s Lollapalooza, a four-day series of concerts that this year begins Thursday, is expected to attract four times that many. In the wake of Sunday’s attack in California, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city would have a “robust security plan’’ in place for the music festival. Still, industry experts acknowledge no plan is foolproof, and outdoor events are more difficult to secure because they lack the built-in protections of solid structures and because the crowds are harder to control. Porter said the top four security priorities, in order, are to deter, then delay, detect and finally respond to attacks. By all accounts, the Gilroy police officers performed admirably. Three of them confronted Legan with their handguns, exchanged gunfire and killed him, thereby preventing worse carnage. “Law enforcement, they weren’t good, they were great,’’ said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who visited some of the injured in a hospital. “Law enforcement, the brave. They deserve so much credit. They have your back.’’ And according to Mike Susong, senior vice president for global risk service at the risk-management firm WorldAware, the officers took the correct preventive steps, based on 40 previous years of such festivals. Susong, who used to be based in San Francisco, compared security preparations to what he saw this year in Washington, D.C. “I was in downtown for the Fourth of July in D.C., and I would say Gilroy used a lot of the best practices they had there,’’ Susong said, mentioning the 6-foot perimeter fences, bag searches and metal detectors at the entrance, along with a police command center on the premises. “Police did a lot of good things.’’ But Susong acknowledged that the suspect likely avoided metal detectors and gained access using a tool that can be easily purchased at a hardware store for $40, highlighting a vulnerability that may need to be addressed at this and other events. “That does become an area that now maybe needs to be more vigilantly monitored,’’ Susong said. “But I’m not in any way second-guessing the job the Gilroy law enforcement did.’’ Bought in Nevada: Firearms dealer in Nevada says it sold rifle used in Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting Industry insiders say there have been several advancements in security since the October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman positioned in a room at the Mandalay Bay hotel killed 58 concertgoers and wounded hundreds at an outdoor festival in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Coordination between law enforcement agencies is much better now, experts said, and high-tech tools like artificial intelligence and facial recognition have improved their chances of keeping crowds safe. But the task remains challenging. “Anything we do in the security industry is constantly changing and evolving because threats are constantly changing and evolving,’’ Porter said. “We really like to look at it as, the top threat that exists today didn’t exist two years ago. The top threat two years from now probably doesn’t exist today.’’ Contributing: Elizabeth Weise in Gilroy, California",2019-07-29 22:36:10,The Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting is proof: It&apos;s &apos;increasingly a challenge&apos; to secure outdoor events,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
179,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/r62EpWM39o0/,"In a normal world, the Democratic presidential candidates would spend their second round of debates this week talking about the big news. A mass shooting in California. An alarming spike in temperatures across Europe. The prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. But this isn’t a normal world; this is Donald Trump’s world. And in this world, the President of the United States spent his weekend writing racist tweets about Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings — who as chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been investigating Trump — and his majority-black Baltimore district, just weeks after he unleashed a series of racist tweets attacking female lawmakers of color. As much as Democrats may have wanted to talk up their plans for healthcare or education or climate change in the second round of Democratic debates Tuesday and Wednesday in Detroit, Trump’s tweets have reset the narrative. Which leaves the candidates with a difficult choice: Should they spend their precious moments of airtime condemning Trump’s racism, or outlining their policies to try to address racial inequality? Should they make a moral case against Trump, or a case for themselves? “Every time he has a temper tantrum like this, he gets all of the attention, he sucks all the air out, and then we don’t have time to talk about the real problems,” says Nina Turner, a national co-chair on Senator Bernie Sanders’ campaign. “I’m sure that all of the Democratic candidates…would like to talk about more issues than just the fact that we have a pure unadulterated bigot, [a] racist in the White House.” Most major Democratic candidates have sought to avoid making Trump the focus of their campaigns thus far. There’s a good reason for that. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time arguing that Trump’s racism was disqualifying, and famously called some of his supporters “deplorables.” Clinton lost, and the lesson many Democrats took away from that race was to run on how the party would help voters, not on why Trump is unfit for office. In 2018, Democrats won the House of Representatives largely by focusing on health care and other kitchen-table issues. The 2020 contenders have tried to follow the same blueprint. But this is a desperation point for many of them. This week’s debates will be the last before the polling and fundraising thresholds to qualify for future debates get steeper, making this a do-or-die moment for candidates on the cusp. The time to find a winning strategy is running out, and going after Trump could drive fundraising and buzz. Already many candidates have condemned Trump in the aftermath of the tweets. Senator Elizabeth Warren called Trump’s tweets “ugly and racist;” Senator Kamala Harris called his attack “disgraceful;” Sanders called Trump a “racist president;” and former Vice President Joe Biden called the rant “despicable.” Still, many Democrats warn that arguing with Trump about race is playing on the incumbent’s turf. The core of his campaign strategy, from his rallies to his ad buys, is oriented around provoking outrage. Even Trump’s digital strategy is rooted on outrage clicks: the campaign uses algorithms to place digital ad buys whenever Trump causes an online scandal, then the ads urge supporters to text the campaign or buy bumper stickers, which then helps them harvest more voter contact data. “I want them to talk about racism every day,” Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon once said. “If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.” Which may explain why Trump seems increasingly intent on swirling up anger in his base. The attack on Cummings comes after a series of broadsides against Democratic freshman lawmakers of color. Just weeks ago, he also targeted freshmen Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib, prompting his supporters to chant “send her back” when he mentioned Omar at a rally. (Omar is an American citizen.) The Democrats gathered in Detroit will be debating against this backdrop. And given the way the contest has unfolded, there seems little question that they’ll be focused on Trump’s tweets. Many of the candidates have made racial justice a significant policy priority in their own campaigns. Warren has plans to reduce black maternal mortality, close the racial wealth gap and give $50 billion to historically black colleges and universities. Harris has a $100 billion plan to help black homeowners buy houses in historically red-lined communities. Sanders has plans to address voting rights, criminal justice and income inequality in black communities. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced the Douglass Plan, which addresses everything from housing to health care in an attempt to reduce the systematic disparities facing black Americans. Even as they condemn Trump’s tweets, Democrats are working hard to walk the walk in addressing racial inequality in their own party. A top staffer at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which serves as House Democrats’ campaign branch, resigned Monday over backlash that she had not hired more diverse staffers. Candidates have also been forced to recognize their inherent white privilege. Former Representative Beto O’Rourke recently wrote about his discovery that he and his wife descended from slave owners, and how those advantages trickled down to him through the generations. Tensions between the candidates over racial issues are increasingly defining the primary. Biden, the contest’s front-runner, has been on the receiving end of attacks from Harris and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker for his record on race. During the first set of debates in June, Harris and Biden clashed over his former opposition to federally mandated school busing, and Booker has repeatedly called Biden out for his language around race. (Biden has retained strong support among black voters.) The three of them will share the stage on the second night of debates, and Biden’s team has already put out preemptive attacks on Harris and Booker. Any Democratic nominee will have to figure out a way to condemn Trump’s racist attitudes without letting him dominate the narrative. This week’s debate will be their first big test.

Attorney General Ashley Moody asked the state Supreme Court on Friday to block the ballot initiative, which is being pushed by Miami-based Ban Assault Weapons Now, a group that wants to ban most semiautomatic rifles. The group has gathered more than 99,000 certified signatures so far, enough to trigger an automatic legal review of the amendment by the state's highest court. If organizers succeed in getting a gun control question on the ballot, it will inject another hot-button issue into what already is shaping up to be a turbocharged election in the crucial battleground state. President Donald Trump's key to victory in Florida, whose legislature and governor’s office are controlled by Republicans, includes winning the state's 29 electoral votes again this time. The amendment also could test the strength of the gun lobby in Florida, which had largely been successful pushing gun-rights legislation until the Parkland massacre led to the state's first significant gun restrictions in decades. In a notice filed with the court, Moody said that the proposal as worded would ban ""the possession of virtually every semi-automatic long-gun. To be included on the ballot, the sprawling practical effect must be revealed in the ballot language."" Moody also said that a provision that would grandfather existing owners of semiautomatic weapons is misleading because it requires owners to register their guns within a year. She called the amendment language ""deficient"" and said it would mislead voters. ""Regardless of your position on gun restrictions, this proposed ballot language is a trick,"" Moody spokesperson Lauren Schenone told POLITICO. ""The drafters of this proposal have confused voters by creating a misleading definition of 'assault weapons' which would include a majority of the most popular hunting rifles and shotguns."" Florida has suffered several mass shootings in recent years. In 2016, a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Less than a year later, five people were killed when a man opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Moody, a former judge who was elected last November, has largely avoided contentious issues during her first six months in office. She opposed gun restrictions while on the campaign trail last year and opposed new age restrictions adopted by the Florida Legislature in the wake of the killings at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The National Rifle Association has filed a lawsuit challenging a provision of the law that raised the age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21. Moody's opposition to the amendment drew the scorn of activists who are pushing the proposal. ""It's not surprising that the attorney general is now openly opposing measures to protect families, playing politics with Floridians' lives in order to appease the NRA,"" said Gail Schwartz, chairwoman of Ban Assault Weapons Now and aunt of Alex Schachter, one of the Parkland victims. ""Year after year, elected officials like Ashley Moody have done nothing on this issue, as more and more families like my own are forced to reckon with the loss of our loved ones due to military-grade assault weapons at Parkland, at Pulse, or at the next mass shooting,"" Schwartz said. Citizen groups seeking to put constitutional amendments on the ballot must gather nearly 800,000 voter signatures from around the state. The state Supreme Court is responsible for deciding whether the amendment addresses a single subject, as required, and whether or not the ballot title and summary are misleading. The high court currently is reviewing six different proposals seeking to make the 2020 ballot. Moody has registered opposition to two of the measures so far. © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2019-07-29 17:18:03,Florida attorney general moves to block proposed ban on semiautomatic rifles,,18268,https://www.politico.com/

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group)  GILROY – Hearts heavy with grief, hundreds of people gathered outside Gilroy City Hall on Monday night to remember the three young lives lost in Sunday’s mass shooting at the annual Garlic Festival – and to send a message that while the terrible tragedy was a defining moment, it would not define the South Santa Clara County town. “We cannot let the bastard that did this tear us down,” a defiant Mayor Roland Velasco said to cheers from the crowd. Eileen Stillwell, a fifth-generation resident of Gilroy, came to the vigil to both offer and seek solace. “I’m hoping that it never happens again,” the 60-year-old said. “It just hurts. And it felt like if I came tonight I would get some healing. I wanted to do something, even if it’s just hugging a new person.” Stillwell, a past festival volunteer, found two new people to hug – Ron Esparza and Leeanne Christensen. All three live within a mile of one another but Monday was their first time meeting. “My heart is broken,” said Christensen, 54, fighting back tears. “Completely broken.” Esparza said he was angry, not sad. “This is a rough summer for us,” the 61-year-old said, referring to the shooting at the Ford dealership in Morgan Hill on June 25. He still had the candle he held at a vigil for those victims. “I couldn’t throw it away,” he said. “It’s been in my car. I didn’t think I’d need it so soon.” Morgan Hill Mayor Pro Tem Rene Spring also recalled the shooting at the dealership. “Things like that don’t happen in Gilroy. They don’t happen in Morgan Hill. But they do,” he told the crowd. “You have a lot of friends in Morgan Hill and they will come down over and over to be with you.” Spring was among a number of speakers who spoke during the vigil. The overarching message was one of hope and recovery, but at least two speakers called for gun reform. “Courage is defined by this: friends, families and strangers coming together in face of a tragedy,” said Hina Moheyuddin, 25. “When will this tragedy end? I appeal to our elected officials. I ask, just as a human, when is enough enough? Policy makers need to start taking action.” Santino William Legan, 19, of Gilroy, killed three people with an AK-47-style assault rifle before being fatally shot by officers armed with handguns, according to authorities. The victims have been identified as 6-year-old Stephen Romero of San Jose, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar of San Jose and 25-year-old Trevor Irby, of Romulus, New York. Susan Freiburg, 62, retired from Gilroy High School last year. She didn’t know Legan, who graduated in 2017, but she taught Lesley Sanchez, 15, who was shot in the hip and airlifted to Stanford Hospital. “Waiting for the list of names to be released was absolute dread,” Freiburg said. “I knew I would know someone and I did.” Justin Bates, 24, of Hollister, was among the dozen-plus festival goers who were hit by gunfire and survived. Freshly released from the hospital and leaning on a single crutch, he said he attended the vigil to give his condolences to families who lost loved ones. “Everyone is coming together and showing so much love for everyone,” he said. “It’s really beautiful how the community is handling the most terrible situation that could have happened.” Bates is already making plans to attend next year’s festival. “You’ve gotta be strong and gotta pray,” he said. “Depending on how the security is next year, I’m not going to let this guy (Legan) get the better of me. I hope Gilroy doesn’t let this guy get the better of them.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2019-07-30 01:43:02,Hundreds attend vigil for Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting victims,,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/

Before opening fire at a food festival in Northern California, the shooter promoted a white supremacist manifesto often shared online by neo-Nazis, according to multiple reports. Santino William Legan, 19, was identified as the shooter at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday. Witnesses said he appeared to fire indiscriminately into the crowd, not appearing to target anyone in particular. Three people were killed. The police said they shot Legan dead almost immediately. ""It could have gone so much worse so fast,"" Scot Smithee, the chief of the Gilroy Police Department, told reporters, according to Reuters. Legan shared posts on an Instagram account on Sunday including one that promoted a white supremacist text, NBC News and The Daily Beast reported. He first wrote ""Ayyy garlic festival time. Come get wasted on overpriced shit,"" the outlets reported. Read more: These are the victims of the mass shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California He then shared a picture with a caption that said ""Read Might is Right by Ragnar Redbeard."" The text, a racist manifesto from the 1890s written under a pseudonym, argues that the white race is biologically superior to others and includes anti-Semitic and misogynistic language and argues in favor of racial violence. According to NBC News, Legan ""then used a slurs against mixed-race people and misogynistic descriptions of white Silicon Valley workers, complaining about 'hordes' of them 'overcrowding' towns."" Keegan Hankes, a senior analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, told Rolling Stone that the text was ""widely popular and present among ethnocentric white nationalists of all levels, from suit-and-tie white supremacists to neo-Nazis."" Instagram on Monday said it had removed an account with the same name as the shooter, The Hill reported. Such material has been embraced by those behind other mass shootings and terrorist attacks. The suspect in the New Zealand mosque attack, in which 51 people were killed, is thought to have shared links to a white nationalist manifesto on his Facebook page before the attack. The document argued that white people were being replaced in a ""genocide."" Read more: A white nationalist conspiracy theory was at the heart of the New Zealand shooting. This isn't the first time it's been associated with terror attacks. One witness described hearing someone ask the shooter on Sunday ""Why are you doing this?"" and heard the reply, ""Because I'm really angry."" The three people killed by the shooter were Steven Romero, 6; Trevor Irby, 25; and Keyla Salazar, 13. The police on Sunday said they did not know what the shooter's motive was. The police said he used an assault-style rifle that he purchased legally in Nevada earlier this month. They said the weapon ""could not be sold in California,"" which has stricter gun laws. The police have said that they are still looking for a second person after witnesses said the shooter had an accomplice but that they do not know what role the second person would have played.

If you're a political junkie, it doesn't get much better than this. To see if there is a repeat of last month's heated exchange between former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the nomination, and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, we'll have to wait until Wednesday night. But Tuesday promises fireworks as well as candidates at or near the top — namely Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — try to solidify or improve upon their standing while those behind look for a viral moment that can spark some movement in the polls and fundraising. [Want more political news? Sign up for our free elections newsletter here to stay informed.] Joining them on stage Tuesday will be Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend., Ind.; former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland; former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper; U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and author Marianne Williamson. Here's some of what we're expecting to see on Tuesday night: Over the weekend, President Donald Trump repeatedly bashed a majority-black major U.S. city —Baltimore — as dangerous, dirty and rat infested, at one point saying, ""No human being would want to live there."" Trump was attempting to attack a critic, U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., but it won't be lost on any of the debaters that he went after a city that struggles with many of the same problems as Detroit has had with crime and poverty, and instead of offering any solutions, Trump suggested it was someone else's fault. This — along with Trump's racist tweet suggesting that four women of color in Congress, including Detroit's own U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib ""go back"" to their countries (when all four are U.S. citizens and Tlaib and two of the others were born in the U.S.) will likely lead to calls for civility amid repeated statements that Trump isn't fit for office and is seeking to stoke racial tensions. Sanders and Warren are, according to national polling, running second and third in the early going of the race, behind Biden. But Tuesday night will give us one of our first chances to see whether they try to go after each other. Sanders and Warren are friendly to each other and are largely seen as being part of the most progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But as such, they are also competing largely for the same group of voters — a group that seems split between them for now — and sooner or later, each is going to have to try to get a leg up on the other. This may or may not be the place for that to happen — there is still plenty of time and neither wants to make a misstep that could hurt himself or herself more than the other. But expect both to try to individualize themselves, rather than being looked on as a pair. When Sanders and Warren aren't talking, though, this debate stage is going to look like it was almost made for more moderate candidates to define themselves before a national audience, in contrast to those among the front-runners with more progressive policies. Buttigieg is running on his Midwestern roots and pragmatism and is likely to try to find ways to distinguish himself from Sanders and Warren. O'Rourke of Texas and Klobuchar of Minnesota — neither of whom has been doing particularly well in the polls in recent months — are almost certain to try to find a way to kick-start their candidacies in a state that swung to Trump in 2016. And Bullock, a Democrat in a Republican state, is making the debate stage for the first time. As such, expect them to try to hit bread-and-butter issues such as health care, the environment, immigration and education, but in ways they hope can satisfy moderates and progressives alike. They may be challenged, however, by one other issue likely to come up — gun control — especially with the most recent mass shooting in California leaving three dead and 12 wounded over the weekend. Trump may have won a narrow victory in Michigan in 2016 — by less than 11,000 votes, or about 0.3% — but the results of the 2018 midterms may mean a lot more to this crowd. In that election, Michigan elected a woman governor, secretary of state and attorney general; re-elected a woman U.S. senator, and flipped two Republican-held congressional districts with, you guessed it, Democratic women. Expect Warren, Klobuchar and Williamson — making the debate stage for a second time — to bring up gender differences and capitalize on what could potentially be another huge political cycle for women. Michigan is Ground Zero for these candidates Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Three years ago, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, treated it as though it were in the bag and there was reason for her to do so: Michigan hadn't backed a Republican nominee since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Then Trump won, toppling what was supposed to be a blue wall in the Upper Midwest. On Tuesday, candidates will try to start putting that blue wall back together, talking up local issues (Great Lakes, autos, union protections) and promising to take Michigan (and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania) seriously or otherwise face the consequences. The messages may sound much the same among them but this will be an important coming-out party for some of them in terms of making themselves known in a key swing state. If any of these 10 on Tuesday wind up being the nominee, they need to know that Trump has said he plans to fight to keep Michigan in his column. So if they expect to win, they better start working on it now.

More strange new respect for religion in Monday’s New York Times, for “America’s First Gun Violence Minister.” What sounds like an idea for a satirical Babylon Bee story is in fact a prominently placed interview in the lead National section of the paper of record: Reporter Adeel Hassan, whose work “focuses on identity and discrimination,” reporting from Texas for “A Ministry Pushing Beyond ‘Thoughts and Prayers.’” The headline itself is a jab at a popular religious response to national tragedy, and so is the online deck of headlines: “‘Thoughts and Prayers’ Aren’t Enough, America’s First Gun Violence Minister Says. The saying 'has been co-opted by the gun lobby to keep the church from taking action,” the Rev. Deanna Hollas said.'"" [Photo credit: New York Times] When the topic is gun control, you know there will be no journalistic pushback from the paper at all, not even a “left-wing” or “liberal” label to be found from the reporter: To the strains of the hymn “If We Just Talk of Thoughts and Prayers,” the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States ordained The Rev. Deanna Hollas as its first minister of gun violence prevention this month. (Ah yes, that classic hymn, penned in the ancient time, 2017.) Ms. Hollas is believed to be the first person in the country to be given a national ecclesiastical role of this kind. And the choice of the hymn was a deliberate underlining of what she sees as a desperate need: to do more than react to the latest mass shooting with an offer of benedictions. That, she said, is not sufficient in a country where 40,000 people are killed by guns each year. “The saying ‘thoughts and prayers’ has been co-opted by the gun lobby to keep the church from taking action so they can increase their profits,” Ms. Hollas, who was installed in her new role by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) earlier this month, said in a recent interview.... A Texas native who describes herself as “no stranger” to gun culture, Ms. Hollas, 52, said she was committed to ensuring that Americans from all sides of the gun debate stop talking past one another. “No matter where you fall on this issue,” she said, “the important thing is that we remain in conversation with one another.” .... We asked her about her role, and what she hoped to accomplish... There was nothing remotely resembling a challenging question in this whole full-page interview, which could have been easily served up by a gun-control website (and kind of was a couple of days ago). All the while, Hollas made confident claims that she could connect to gun owners and knew gun culture well, all the while demonizing the National Rifle Association. Hassan's questions, in bold: What is your background? And what makes you ready for this role? What exactly will you do in your new role? Do you expect to face resistance? Do you feel daunted at all? Hollas answered that last question, in part: The church has always been political -- Jesus was executed by the government for speaking against its violence and against the religious authorities that aligned themselves with this unjust system. That is still the role of the church today: to speak a word of peace into a world of violence. What can other church congregations do? And finally: Why do you remain hopeful? Hollas responded to that last question, in part: I entered seminary thinking I would just take two classes and get my diploma in the art of spiritual direction and that would be it. But God kept leading me toward ordained ministry, which didn’t make much sense at the time as I didn’t feel called to lead a congregation. In fact, I was thinking about withdrawing my candidacy for ordination when the N.R.A. came to Dallas last year for their annual convention.... It’s hard to imagine the Times taking at face value a conservative figure who claimed that God had led him or her to be an activist on, say, preventing abortion.

197,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/30/editorial-trumps-post-gilroy-condolences-lack-any-credibility/,"Trending: The mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival was yet another slaughter of innocent Americans made possible by congressional and presidential indifference to assault weapons. And it could have been much, much worse. It’s horrifying enough that three innocent people were killed and 12 others injured when 19-year-old Santino William Legan opened fire with what police describe as an AK-47-style weapon. But there could have been many more fatalities. Like the 17 students killed in Parkland, Fla. The 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The 14 people at a conference center in San Bernardino and 12 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Or the 58 gunned down and hundreds wounded in Las Vegas. Fortunately, in Gilroy, there was already a significant police presence at the very popular festival. Less than a minute after the call came in, officers had responded and were firing at Legan. Otherwise, “There absolutely would have been more bloodshed, I believe, with the number of people and the small area they’re in,” said Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee. Credit good planning. And credit bravery. Three cops with sidearms fatally wounded Legan even though they were, in the word of the chief, “outgunned.” How many more times will this nation go through this before mostly Republican members of Congress and President Donald Trump stop genuflecting to the National Rifle Association? Rather than even hint at any meaningful reform, Trump fell back on his expression of “deepest sadness and sorrow.” It was similar to his response after the Florida school shooting and the Las Vegas massacre. On this issue, his condolences have lost all credibility. “We reaffirm our national will to answer violence with the courage, determination and resolve of one American family,” Trump said Monday morning at the White House. Courage? Oh, please. Courage would require having the “resolve” to stand up to the gun lobby. To recognize that, when claiming gun rights, there’s a legitimate difference between a hunting rifle and an assault weapon. To support reinstatement of the assault-weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire, and universal background checks that passed in the Democratic-controlled House, but stalled in Republican-led Senate. To top it all off, Trump went on, “We thank the brave members of law enforcement — they never let us down — who swiftly killed the shooter.” You bet they were brave — running toward someone with an assault weapon rather than away. For that, we’re all deeply grateful. But that begs the question: Why are we repeatedly putting our law enforcement officers in such danger rather than taking steps to get rid of assault weapons altogether? If the president truly wanted to show his thanks, he would stop putting police in needless danger. This has gone on too long. California lawmakers have taken steps to stop the sale of assault weapons here. But, as Legan showed, they’re easily purchased out of state. This is a national problem that requires a national solution. In the meantime, we’re left to feel lucky that “only” three innocent people died. That’s how low the bar has been set. It’s time to change that. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2019-07-30 08:10:17,Editorial: Trump&#8217;s post-Gilroy condolences lack any credibility,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

By JAKE SHERMAN and ANNA PALMER 07/30/2019 06:16 AM EDT Presented by Democratic ad-maker Mark Putnam has cut the first paid ad from the recent Robert Mueller hearings. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images PLAYBOOK SCOOP … ROBERT MUELLER was panned last week for being short in his testimony before Congress, giving little ammo to Democrats who wanted to capitalize politically from his appearance. … BUT DEMOCRATIC AD-MAKER MARK PUTNAM has cut the first paid ad from the hearings, funded by TOM STEYER’S Need to Impeach, a spot that’s going to grab many eyeballs in the coming days. The group is spending in the mid-six figures to air the ad on CNN and MSNBC before and after the second presidential debate (which airs tonight and Wednesday night on CNN live from Detroit). Needless to say, this is prime time for millions of politically active TV viewers. THE AD IS 30 SECONDS LONG. It starts out with a frame of the committee room and “WHAT MUELLER SAID” across the screen. “Did you actually totally exonerate the president?” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) asks Mueller. “No,” Mueller says. Did the president’s written answers show that he was not always being truthful, Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) asks. “Generally,” Mueller replies. You believe you could charge the president with obstruction after he leaves office? “Yes,” Mueller says. IT CLOSES WITH House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asking if President DONALD TRUMP accepted Russian interference and then lied to cover it up. The answer to that: yes, and generally yes. WATCH THE AD, because it will be very much talked about in the next few days: 32-second clip BREAKING OVERNIGHT … HEATHER CAYGLE, JAKE SHERMAN and LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ: “DCCC faces mass staff upheaval after uproar over diversity”: “The top echelon of staffers at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee left their jobs Monday, a shakeup following a pair of POLITICO stories detailing deep unease with the party’s campaign apparatus over a lack of diversity. “On Monday morning, Allison Jaslow, DCCC executive director and a close ally of Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) — chair of the committee — resigned during a tense meeting at the party’s Capitol Hill headquarters. And in the next 10 hours, much of the senior staff was out: Jared Smith, the communications director and another Bustos ally; Melissa Miller, a top DCCC communications aide; Molly Ritner, political director; Nick Pancrazio, deputy executive director; and Van Ornelas, the DCCC’s director of diversity. … “A staff turnover of this magnitude seven months into the Democrats’ majority is jarring, and will present Bustos with a set of new challenges. She will be forced to rebuild the committee’s top leadership from scratch in the middle of a presidential campaign that has much of the party’s best talent tied up.” POLITICO AT 10:57 MONDAY NIGHT, 40 minutes after the POLITICO story detailing the staff exodus dropped, BUSTOS sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues with this mini mea culpa: “I am extraordinarily proud of our team at the DCCC, and I am proud to Chair this Committee in the same way I have raised my own family: owning my mistakes, and learning from them, at the same time I celebrate what we have accomplished. “The past few days have been sobering, but they have also been framed by the kind of conversations that we avoid to our own detriment. Today, I recognize that, at times, I have fallen short in leading these talented individuals, but I’ve never been more committed to expanding and protecting this majority, while creating a workplace that we can all be proud of. I know we must do better, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that our staff is truly inclusive.” The full letter ONE OF THE DEPARTURES … @MollyRitner: “After 4+ years and over 2 cycles, I’m sad to say that I won’t be on the DCCC team after today. We had strategic disagreements, but I wish them the best of luck and know that they will hold onto the House that we fought so hard to win in 2018.” RITNER was responsible for the Midwest region in 2018, where the Dems had nine seat flips. If Ritner is having “strategic disagreements” with the committee, that’s something to worry about. Good Tuesday morning. DETROIT SPOTTEDS … at the San Morello restaurant at the Shinola Hotel in Detroit: Tammy Hadad and Hilary Rosen, and Gloria Borger separately from that pair … Frank Luntz getting a tour of the hotel. … Two photos of the set, via CNN ELENA SCHNEIDER: “First debate's fireworks set stage for Detroit ‘free-for-all’”: “Democratic presidential candidates took one big lesson from their first debates in June: The contenders who shined brightest attacked other candidates onstage. Now, they are all preparing to trade punches ahead of round two in Detroit. “Across the Democratic presidential field, candidates are reading up on points of contrast with key rivals and preparing attack lines, while some are going a step further and simulating debate-stage cross-talk with staffers, practicing ways to butt into the conversation and create a memorable moment. Campaigns are studying how CNN handled past primary debates, when the hosts teed up opportunities for GOP candidates to criticize each other in 2015.” POLITICO … Quint Forgey on everything you need to know about the No. 2 debate -- NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL: “Interest among Democratic voters in the party’s presidential primary debates remains high ahead of the candidates’ second meeting this week, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. “Roughly one third of voters who plan to participate in the Democratic primary or caucus in their state, 34 percent, say they are ‘very motivated’ to watch the debates on Tuesday and Wednesday. Another 39 percent indicated they were ‘somewhat motivated’ to watch. Fifteen percent said they were ‘not very motivated’ to watch, and only 8 percent said they weren’t motivated at all.” POLITICO A message from Amazon: Watch what happened when Amazon raised their starting wage to $15/hr in 2018. NICE! … C-SPAN’S @SteveScully: “Looking forward to a conversation with POTUS @realDonaldTrump Tuesday @ The White House to air @cspan this week. Stay tuned C-SPAN.org.” WHILE YOU (READ: WE) WERE SLEEPING, TRUMP continued his attacks on Rep. ELIJAH CUMMNGS (D-Md.): … at 9:34 p.m.: “Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who, despite Congresses [sic] failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum, make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help, Border getting strong!” … … at 9:45 p.m.: “Baltimore’s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years, but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!” LEVEL SETTING, via NYT’s Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher: “Trade talks between the United States and China resumed on Monday with prospects dimming for a transformative deal, as both sides appeared more focused on preventing tensions from escalating before the 2020 presidential election than on making concessions. … “Negotiators from both countries are continuing to press for an agreement, but months of meetings have so failed to yield consensus on the most difficult issues and there is little to suggest that a compromise is within reach. Instead, the United States and China appear to be trying to find a path to keep the talks moving forward and to avoid a breakdown that could rattle stock markets and hurt President Trump’s chances of re-election. “Mr. Trump and his advisers are playing down the likelihood of reaching an agreement in the short term, and the president suggested on Friday that China was trying to drag out the negotiations in the hope that someone else might occupy the Oval Office come January 2021.” NYT ONE OF RATCLIFFE’S BIG HURDLES -- “Trump’s spy chief pick an unknown commodity among Senate GOP,” by Martin Matishak and Marianne LeVine: “Senate Republicans loved Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. They're not sure about his replacement. President Donald Trump’s pick to be the country's next spy chief, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), is largely unknown among the lawmakers who would confirm him, a circumstance that could complicate what appears to be an already narrow path to confirmation. “Few Republican senators, including some in leadership, on Monday said they had known of Ratcliffe or had ever heard of him before his questioning of former special counsel Robert Mueller last week, where he fiercely defended Trump and downplayed the threat posed by Russia. “‘I truly have never met him,’ Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a potential swing vote, said. ‘I don’t know John. I’ve met him a couple times, seen him on TV,’ said Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).” POLITICO -- WAPO’S GREG MILLER: “Some officials fear Trump will get the intelligence he wants, not the intelligence he needs, from DNI pick”: “President Trump’s plan to nominate a political ally as director of national intelligence was seen by current and former officials as a move to subdue spy agencies that he has long regarded as disloyal, and silence one of the few pockets of occasional dissent in his administration. … “Now, with the choice of Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) to serve as the nation’s next spy chief — and Attorney General William P. Barr already entrenched at the Justice Department — Trump is poised to seize greater control over the two pillars of government that he perceives as most hostile to his presidency.” WaPo -- ABC’S ALEXANDER MALLIN, JAMES GORDON MEEK and MIKE LEVINE: “Trump’s pick for intelligence director misrepresented role in anti-terror case” Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

FILL THE SWAMP … “Trump Adviser Said to Have Pursued Saudi Nuclear Deal as He Sought Administration Role,” by NYT’s Sharon LaFraniere IMPEACHMENT WATCH -- “2 top Dem senators give boost to impeachment effort,” by Burgess Everett: “Patty Murray doesn’t typically make waves. But the low-key senator’s endorsement of an impeachment inquiry is doing exactly that in the Senate Democratic Caucus. “The No. 3 Senate Democrat threw her considerable political weight behind the impeachment question on Sunday afternoon, joining Washington State’s House Democrats in a surprise statement. And the No. 4 Senate Democrat, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, followed suit on Monday. “‘The Mueller report is extremely serious. Obstruction of justice is extremely serious. And it’s worthy of an inquiry. Nobody is above the law. The president’s not above the law,’ Stabenow said in an interview.” POLITICO 2020 WATCH … -- “As Trump dives into racial politics, suburban women recoil,” by AP’s Marc Levy and Scott Bauer in Brookfield, Wis.: “Many professional, suburban women — a critical voting bloc in the 2020 election — recoil at the abrasive, divisive rhetoric, exposing the president to a potential wave of opposition in key battlegrounds across the country. “In more than three dozen interviews by The Associated Press with women in critical suburbs, nearly all expressed dismay — or worse — at Trump’s racially polarizing insults and what was often described as unpresidential treatment of people. Even some who gave Trump credit for the economy or backed his crackdown on immigration acknowledged they were troubled or uncomfortable lining up behind the president. “The interviews in suburbs outside Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit and Denver are a warning light for the Republican president’s reelection campaign. Trump did not win a majority of female voters in 2016, but he won enough — notably winning white women by a roughly 10 percentage-point margin, according to the American National Election Studies survey — to help him eke out victories across the Rust Belt and take the White House.” AP -- THE BOSTON GLOBE’S JAMES PINDELL: “Where are they? It’s high summer in N.H., but the candidates are elsewhere”: “Historically, the weeks before Labor Day have been among the most interesting in the presidential primaries, as candidates decamp from Washington to Iowa and New Hampshire to campaign. As a result, the race often resets in a fundamental way. … “But in the 2020 Democratic campaign for president, those kinds of shifts are unlikely to happen next month. Instead of campaigning intensely in the early voting states — shaking hands on Hampton Beach or eating pork on a stick at the Iowa State Fair — most Democrats running for president are much more focused on meeting the Democratic National Committee’s rules for making the cut for the third national televised debate.” Boston Globe -- “Pro-Inslee super PAC to hit rivals on climate during debate,” by Daniel Strauss A message from Amazon: All Amazon employees earn at least a $15/hr starting wage. Fulltime employees get health insurance from the first day on the job. THE JUICE … -- FIRST IN MORNING SCORE -- THE CASH DASH -- House Majority PAC, the House Democratic leadership-aligned super PAC, announced it raised over $8.1 million in the first six months of 2019. HMP said that this was its strongest off-year fundraising report ever, and that it was double what it raised during the same time period two years ago. It’ll report $7.2 million in cash on hand, five times what it had two years ago.

Even medicines manufactured in Iran are tougher to come by for ordinary Iranians, their cost out of reach for many in a country where the average monthly salary is equivalent to about $450. “Iran’s health system can’t keep up and many are blaming President Donald Trump’s ‘maximum pressure’ campaign for the staggering prices and shortages.

John Hyten of sexual misconduct delivered a warning to a Senate committee last week — telling the lawmakers that it would send ‘a very dangerous message to sexual assault victims’ to promote him to be the nation's second-highest ranking military officer. “On Tuesday, Hyten will testify in front of the same panel of senators as they consider his nomination for vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Col. Kathryn Spletstoser — who only revealed her identity publicly on Friday — testified to a closed session of the Armed Services Committee last week that elevating Hyten would deter the next victim from coming forward to report being attacked by a high-ranking officer. “‘Even if the investigators determine that there was no evidence to show that the victim was lying … no one will believe her anyway, so why even bother reporting,’ Spletstoser told the committee, according to a copy of her opening statement obtained by POLITICO.” POLITICO A message from Amazon:  Amazon supports increasing the federal minimum wage to $15/hr CHICAGO TRIBUNE’S LOLLY BOWEAN: “Obama Presidential Center will have ‘adverse effect’ on Jackson Park’s historic design, new report says”: “[W]hile the massive project would alter portions of the property that justified listing it on the National Register of Historic Places, the newly released report is just one step in the federal review process.

MEDIAWATCH -- “Black journalists push media to cover ‘hyper-racial’ moment in politics,” by Michael Calderone: “The Associated Press earlier this year shifted a national race and ethnicity reporter to its 2020 election team, an acknowledgment that race has become a defining element of President Donald Trump’s campaigns. “That beat, assigned to reporter Errin Haines Whack, is fairly unusual among major news organizations. And media outlets’ approach to covering race is frustrating some prominent journalists of color at a time when Trump’s language — including calling a civil-rights leader a ‘con man’ and referring to a majority-black district in Baltimore as a ‘disgusting rat and rodent infested mess’ this week — is threatening to define the campaign. “Some nonwhite journalists are growing increasingly vocal in their push for media outlets to take race head on in political coverage — and they are publicly highlighting the ways they say Trump’s words and the semantic debates over whether to call them ‘racist’ weigh on them personally.” POLITICO -- Jordan Fabian is joining Bloomberg to cover the White House, starting Aug. 12.

These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. Geopolitics reporter Federal prosecutors charged a US Navy reservist earlier this month with illegally manufacturing military-grade weapons in his Maryland home, including AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles, according to newly unsealed court documents obtained by Quartz. Investigators said they also found computer-controlled milling equipment and a hydraulic press, which are used to make weapons, as well as multiple handguns, rifles in various states of completion, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and instruction manuals for building improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. It’s unclear what the reservist, 38-year-old Tamufor Nchumuluh St. Michael, wanted with all these weapons, though according to the documents he may have intended to sell them. St. Michael joined the Navy Reserve in 2008, the filings say. St. Michael is now assigned to the Naval Operational Support Center at Joint Base Andrews, the same Maryland facility where Air Force One is based. Finding a private cache of weapons like this is worrying for any number of reasons, not least among them is that they could be used in a mass shooting. There have been some 280 mass shootings so far in 2019, killing 296 people and injuring another 1,059. The latest occurred Sunday, when a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California, killing three people and injuring another 20. The shooter used an AK-47-style assault rifle, which he legally purchased in Nevada on July 9. While some states have passed their own gun control legislation, federal gun control laws have stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senators have so far refused to vote on a bill approved by the House in late February. Among other things, the House bill would force private sellers to obtain a federal license. All of the guns and parts purchased by St. Michael were obtained lawfully. He even used his military ID card to get a discount in at least one transaction. The feds say they have evidence of St. Michael making at least 133 purchases from gun dealers around the US in the last year, which came from data provided by the sellers themselves. The number of guns found, “coupled with the manufacturing equipment and several firearms in various states of assembly located within the residence, indicate that St. Michael is engaged in the unlawful manufacturing of firearms without a license,” according to case filings. While St. Michael is a state-licensed firearms collector, prosecutors say this does not authorize him to “act as a firearms dealer.” Joseph Giacalone, a former New York Police Department detective and unit commander who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said the arrest may have saved lives. “It looks like all of the checks and balances worked this time and may have headed off a mass shooting,” Giacalone told Quartz. “I’m glad to see sellers making appropriate notifications and I hope that there is no backlash against them for doing the right thing.” St. Michael’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Defense referred Quartz to the Navy. A Navy spokesman declined to comment and referred Quartz to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment while the case is still ongoing. St. Michael, who came to the US as a refugee, has never been in serious trouble before, according to public records. In 2011, the year he became a US citizen, St. Michael filed an immigration-related lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano, attorney general Eric Holder, Maryland US attorney Rod Rosenstein, and officials with US Immigration and Citizenship Services. The case was dismissed four months later after St. Michael failed to serve papers to those named in the lawsuit. Additional information is not available, as the documents remain sealed. St. Michael is free on bail pending his next court date. He was ordered to surrender his passport and is not allowed to leave Maryland without permission. “I’d like to say I’m shocked by these developments, but I’m not,” Giacalone said. “The real question is, how many more of these guys are out there?” The charges come less than three weeks after two US Marines were arrested for sneaking undocumented immigrants into the country, a story first reported by Quartz. Since then, at least 14 other Marines have been ensnared for participating in what authorities are now investigating as a possible human smuggling ring. 📬 Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).

Instead, the Viacom network will air next week’s original episode in its place and plans to run “The Gift” next week. The decision was made two days after three people were killed in an active shooter situation in Northern California. In the sketch in question, comedian and show creator Arturo Castro plays a Guatemalan immigrant who is taking a “Welcome to the United States” class when his teacher cautions them about gun violence, including mass shootings. Castro’s character is in disbelief that shootings are so prevalent and seemingly random in the United States. When reached by TheWrap, Comedy Central had no comment on the programming decision.

202,https://www.gq.com/story/gilroy-shooting,"By Jay Willis Over the weekend, two beloved summertime festivals on opposite coasts became the latest sites of mass shootings in America. On Saturday, two men opened fire during the 56th annual Old Timers Day in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood, killing one and wounding 11 more. The next day, a teenager wielding a rifle began shooting at the 41st annual Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California. Three attendees, including a 13-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy, were killed, and at least 12 more were injured. The gunman died in a shootout with police. Firearms kill around 37,000 people in the United States each year, a number that puts the U.S. after only Brazil, among world leaders in firearms deaths, according to a 2018 study. While block parties, tragically, have been the site for gun violence before, the Gilroy shooting may very well be the first time a mass shooting took place at one of the country's biggest food festivals. It certainly was inevitable, with movie theaters, school classrooms, and office buildings already caught up in this country's gun-violence epidemic. Below are a number of other places in American life once assumed safe from becoming the site of another one of these tragedies. This list is derived from data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. In all likelihood, there will be more to add to it soon. Gunfire at a baby shower in Chicago left six people wounded this past April. In April 1999, a pair of seniors at Columbine High School in Aurora, Colorado, killed 13 classmates and wounded 24 more. At the time, it was the deadliest K-12 school shooting in U.S. history; in the two decades since, its death toll has been eclipsed twice. In 2018, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida returned to campus with a semiautomatic rifle and killed 17 people, injuring 17 more. In 2012, a 20-year-old man shot and killed his mother before attacking Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In five minutes, he killed 20 children—all age 7 or younger—and six staff members, wounding two. In Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, 12 filmgoers died and 70 were injured when a gunman opened fire during a showing of The Dark Knight. Some witnesses who saw the shooter beforehand believed he was playing a prank—a PR stunt put on by the studio, maybe—until they saw him throw a canister of tear gas into the audience. Since then, there has been at least one other mass shooting at a movie theater: At a July 2015 screening of Trainwreck in Lafayette, Louisiana, a man killed two and injured nine. Earlier this month, a man shot his sister at a housewarming party in Fort Bend, Texas, wounding three others. He then killed himself. In June, a Virginia Beach city employee killed 12 colleagues and injured four more at the municipal building where he'd worked for 15 years. In June 2018, a gunman killed five and injured two after storming the newsroom of the Capital Gazette, a paper against which he held a grudge, in Annapolis, Maryland. Nearly four years ago in San Bernardino, California, a husband-and-wife duo professing allegiance to ISIS killed 14 and injured 22 during the holiday party thrown by the county health department where the husband worked. In March of last year, a man killed four people at a residential treatment program for veterans in Yountville, California. He then turned the gun on himself. Last fall, during a country-Western-themed night at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousands Oaks, California, a gunman killed 12 people, including seven college students, and injured 18. In June 2016, a shooter attacked a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 and injuring 53. It would remain the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history for less than two years. In November 2018, a man walked into a Tallahassee, Florida, hot-yoga studio and opened fire, killing two and injuring five. In July 2017, as employees at a Weis Markets supermarket in Eaton Township, Pennsylvania, were preparing to close it to customers, an employee arriving for the overnight shift barricaded the exits and began firing at co-workers inside. He killed three before shooting himself. At a congressional meet-and-greet outside a Tucson, Arizona, Safeway in 2011, a gunman killed six and wounded 13, including Representative Gabby Giffords, who resigned her seat in Congress in order to focus on her recovery. Last fall, a man killed his fiancée, a doctor at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, along with a police officer and pharmaceutical assistant on the scene, in a domestic dispute. The shooter then killed himself. Last January, three people died and four more were injured in a shooting at a Torrance, California, bowling alley and karaoke bar. What is still America's deadliest school shooting took place in April 2007, when a graduating senior at Virginia Tech killed 32 and injured 17 in a campus dormitory and, after that, a lecture hall. In late 2015, a 26-year-old student at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine and injured eight, leaving behind a manifesto referencing, among other well-known incidents of gun violence,  Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Sandy Hook. Just this past May, a former student at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte killed four and injured two while students in a ""Science, Technology, & Society"" class were delivering their end-of-semester presentations. He told investigators he had ""researched"" the Sandy Hook massacre at length. In September 2017, a gunman interrupted regular Sunday service at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, to kill 26 churchgoers and injure 20 more. (A former Air Force enlistee, the gunman had a prior domestic-violence court martial that should have prevented him from purchasing firearms, but the military admitted it had erroneously failed to submit his information to the National Crime Information Center's database.) In September 2017, a gunman killed one worshipper and injured seven at Burnette Chapel in Antioch, Tennessee. A year earlier, a white supremacist in Charleston, South Carolina, attacked Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the country's oldest black churches, killing nine and wounding one. Last fall, an avowed anti-Semite and alt-right sympathizer killed 11 and injured six during morning services at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Six months later, a Nazi sympathizer inspired by that act of terror attacked a synagogue across the country in Poway, California, killing one and injuring three. Seven years ago, a 40-year-old man with dreams of starting a ""racial holy war"" stormed a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four. He died by suicide before police could apprehend him. In April 2018, a gunman killed four and injured four at a Waffle House in Nashville. Last fall, a contestant in a Madden tournament opened fire on his fellow competitors inside a Jacksonville, Florida, pizza restaurant, killing two and wounding 11. Some witnesses speculated that the shooter was upset about a video game he lost earlier that day, but his motive remains unknown. He died by suicide before police could arrest him. In October 2017, a 64-year-old man fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition into the crowd at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas, killing 58 and injuring more than 500. Police found 23 firearms in the 32nd-floor hotel room from which he had opened fire, and another 24 at his home. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

203,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dilbert-creator-accused-of-trying-to-profit-off-victims-of-gilroy-murderer,"Scott Adams says the backlash against him is 'fake outrage' 'Dilbert' comic strip creator Scott Adams is facing criticism after he encouraged witnesses of the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting to sign on to an app he created immediately following the carnage. Adams was accused of shamelessly trying to profit off the tragedy, but he says that isn't the case at all and calls the backlash against him ""fake outrage.""  Within hours of the deadly attack Sunday — which left four people dead and at least 15 injured — Adams tweeted out an ad and link for a new app he co-founded, saying, ""If you were a witness to the #GilroyGarlicFestivalshooting please sign on to Interface by WhenHub (free app) and you can set your price to take calls.""   Adams' message was met with outrage from Twitter users who accused him of using a horrific event to line his own pockets, given the fact that his company is paid a 20 percent cut out of whatever a victim might charge for selling their story on the app to news outlets. But Adams defended himself, following up with tweets explaining that his app was a news gathering tool, and that ""no fake outrage"" was necessary.   By Monday, Adams expected the backlash against him to gain more traction, asking his followers on Twitter, ""Which fake news group will run the best hit piece on me today while getting all the facts wrong? The fake outrage is a thing to behold.""   The 'Dilbert' creator addressed the issue more thoroughly during a Periscope livestream late Monday, explaining his reasoning behind promoting the app and saying he expected that any witnesses who used it would have set their price at $0 considering the circumstances. Adams went on to say that this is not the first time he has promoted his app while a major news event occurred, but admitted the backlash he's received over his Gilroy Festival promotion might make him think twice before piggybacking off a mass shooting in the future, according to the Daily Mail. But Adams also admitted that he was guilty of using the tragedy to plug his business.

204,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/so9p5HLs3Mg/,"Actress Rosanna Arquette responded to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting by falsely claiming that all shooters in the United States have been “white terrorists.” “All of the shooters in America have been White males. White terrorists . The end.” she said. All of the shooters in America have been White males. White terrorists  . The end. — Rosanna Arquette (@RoArquette) July 29, 2019 Arquette’s claim is demonstrably false, and one only has to go back as recently as the May 31, 2019, Virginia Beach shooting to prove it. Here are some other high-profile shootings or mass shooting incidents that also disprove Arquette’s claim: The problem with claims like Arquette’s is that the race of mass shooters has not been monolithic. Just as the types of types of guns used in such shootings vary — from handguns predominately to rifles and shotguns, too — so too is that the race of a given attacker is not necessarily the same as the attacker before him. One thing that is quite common among attackers is the fact that they tend to strike places where their victims cannot shoot back. On November 20, 2018, Breitbart News reported a Crime Prevention Research Center study showing that 97.8 percent of mass public attacks between 1950 and May 2018 occurred in gun-free zones. That is the great common thread among mass shooters, and it has nothing to do with race.

208,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/business/media/scott-adams-dilbert-gilroy.html,"Advertisement Supported by After a gunman killed three people in Gilroy, Calif., Mr. Adams said witnesses could “set your price” on an app he invented. The cartoonist, no stranger to controversy, had found another. By Heather Murphy Scott Adams, the 62-year-old creator of the Dilbert comic strip, said he was flipping between CNN and Fox in his home in Pleasanton, Calif., on Sunday when it hit him: His moment had come. In an interview on Tuesday, he explained that he had been planning to use a big news event to promote his online expert company, which has been struggling to find users. A few hours earlier, a gunman had opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, 60 miles south of his home. He said he was frustrated by how little the witnesses interviewed by broadcast journalists seemed to know. His site could help, he thought. And so, seated in the comfort of his home, with its indoor tennis court and three microwave ovens for optimum popcorn popping, he took action: “I dashed off a tweet and did not think about it.” It did not go over well. In particular the phrase “set your price” — amid a tragedy that took the lives of a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 25-year-old biologist — struck many people as insensitive. Rather quickly, his tweet was “ratioed,” eventually accumulating more than 1,300 comments, far outnumbering the likes and retweets, the equivalent of a beating in the virtual square. “THERE WAS A TRAGEDY, USE MY APP,” one user wrote. “And the ghoulish grifter chimes in,” wrote another. A user who described sitting in Gilroy with scared family members wrote: “Choppers overhead as we are sheltered in place in the ACTIVE MANHUNT SEARCH ZONE & YOU CARE ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE ALMIGHTY $? DO NOT PASS GO, JUST GO TO HELL!!” In the interview, Mr. Adams said he regretted the “set your price” wording because it masked the fact that people who sign up for his site are not required to charge for an interview, and because he really believes his site could facilitate better journalism and help connect people to good experts. “I wouldn’t do it the same way again,” he said, noting that he has promoted his company during two natural disasters without generating any resistance. But what about the fee that his company collects per interview? “If you think $5 is money; I don’t,” he said, laughing. (For context: According to Mr. Adams, he was once paid $100,000 to speak for an hour on techniques for success.) For anyone who has peeked at Mr. Adams’s Twitter feed in the last few years, however, none of this should come as a big surprise. There are the typical tweets promoting his widely syndicated comic strip, which he has been creating for more than 30 years. But there are also plenty of hints of his other identity: online provocateur. Long before his “set your price” tweet ignited controversy, there was the podcast episode in which he defended family separations at the southern border and his “men’s rights” blog post. He is an admirer of President Trump, and he admits to borrowing some of the president’s style. “One of the things that you can learn from Trump’s approach is that energy is more important than being technically correct,” he said on Tuesday. In a live Periscope video, he connected the recent backlash to his support of the president. “The pushback I’m getting is fueled by the intense hatred of Trump and of anybody who’s ever said anything good about Trump,” he said in one widely circulated remark. Still, how did a Bay Area-based artist, known for creating a widely syndicated comic strip about the indignities of office life, get to this point? We put some questions to Mr. Adams. No. In fact, the last presidential candidate he voted for was former Vice President Al Gore, he said. Since then, he said, he has stopped participating in elections. “I publicly don’t vote because it causes bias,” he said, adding that “I define myself as left of Bernie.” His appreciation for Mr. Trump is about communication methods, he said. Mr. Adams is a trained hypnotist and has written a book about the art of persuasion. “He is more persuasive than any public figure I’ve ever seen,” he said of the president. “Early on in 2015 I saw his skill set and thought no one has that skill set. You can’t recognize persuasion unless you’ve studied it.” By that point, Mr. Adams had begun dabbling in provocative political writing himself. In a 2017 Outline article, the writer Alex Nichols pointed to a 2011 blog post about men’s rights as “the first time Adams made a detectable splash” with his blog. “The reality is that women are treated differently by society for exactly the same reason that children and the mentally handicapped are treated differently,” Mr. Adams wrote in the blog post. “It’s just easier this way for everyone.” Mr. Adams apologized after the blog post began to draw negative attention, but he also reprimanded readers for failing to understand what he was trying to say, according to The Outline. He deployed a similar tactic in the latest controversy. Referring to the tweet, Mr. Adams said that his mistake was making “an assumption that people can handle ethical decisions on their own.” More recently, Mr. Adams inserted himself into the debate around the Trump administration’s family-separation policy in a podcast episode in which he argued that those who attack the policy are siding with human traffickers. His comments inspired a 2018 Forbes column, “Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Is Evil (And Why You Should Follow His Lead),” in which the writer urged readers to mimic Mr. Adams’s opportunistic approach to stay afloat “in our new world order.” Yes. Mr. Adams said that he was invited to the White House to meet the president after the publication of his book “Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter.” The book explores Mr. Trump’s unconventional candidacy. “Apparently my book ‘Win Bigly’ made a big impact on his advisers, and he wanted to chat,” Mr. Adams said in a direct message on Twitter. For a creative person, Mr. Adams has long had an unconventional relationship with work. Even as his comic strip took off, he chose to keep a $70,000-a-year job as an applications engineer at Pacific Bell. In 1995, The New York Times wrote, “For nearly two decades he has been a denizen of the very environment he lampoons, toiling anonymously in his own cubicle on obscure corporate projects.” He later ventured into restaurants and a food company, neither of which was particularly successful. The Dilberito, a vitamin-packed meatless burrito, never quite took off. Though his restaurant employees seemed to enjoy his company, they told The Times in 2007 that he had no idea what he was doing. More recently, he created WhenHub, a venture that aims to connect journalists, investors and others to experts. The home page features dozens of so-called video advisers, including a man who charges $499 an hour for “triple-investment commissions,” a woman who will discuss African safaris for $1 an hour and a man who will discuss socialism for $100 an hour. Mr. Adams said he chose not to delete the WhenHub promotional tweet — as much as he wishes he had worded it differently — as part of a personal policy. “I leave the tweet up because in our current world you keep your mistakes as a public record,” he said. “I think that it’s cowardly to delete a tweet.” Advertisement",2019-07-30 22:37:46,"Scott Adams, Dilbert Creator, Has One Regret About Mass Shooting Tweet","computers and the internet,recordings (audio)",1,http://nytimes.com
209,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/army-times/news/your-army/~3/7A5xDRnzeQk/,"The Department of Justice’s effort to clear the way for the federal government to resume capital punishment after a nearly two-decade pause won’t immediately change the individual statuses of those on the military’s death row, but some experts do view it as a potential sign of things to come. There are currently four death row inmates in the military justice system: Ronald Gray, Hasan Akbar, Timothy Hennis and Nidal Hasan. All are former soldiers. In 2009, Nidal Hasan was an Army major when he killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others in a mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. “Attorney General [William] Barr’s announcement does not affect the individual status of any of the four death row inmates,” a Department of the Army official said on background. “The military will make an appropriate announcement if and when an execution date has been scheduled for any of our prisoners."" The new policy under the Trump administration clears the legal path to resume using lethal injection for federal death row inmates, which is also how the military would perform an execution. The policy switches away from a three-drug cocktail that was caught up in legal challenges to using a single drug — pentobarbital — to execute inmates. Although the statuses of the four individuals on military death row are not likely to change anytime soon, the eagerness of President Donald Trump’s DOJ to change the status quo could bode badly for the death row inmates at U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. “If I were on death row, I would consider this a very bad sign, but not a sign that anything is happening immediately. There is going to be litigation over this,"" said Eugene Fidell, a Yale Law School lecturer on habeas corpus and military justice.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Army Times Daily News Roundup. The military hasn’t executed a prisoner since 1961, though capital punishment remains a legal penalty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Military death row was more populated in past decades, but legal challenges stemmed the number of occupants. In the 1970s, capital punishment was invalidated by the Supreme Court, only to be later reinstated by that same legal body. And in 1983, the Armed Forces Court of Appeals also ruled the penalty unconstitutional, only to be again reinstated by an executive order from President Ronald Reagan the following year. The court affirmed Bergdahl’s guilty plea and previous sentence, but one judge dissented. Since then, more cases have wound their way toward and away from the death penalty. “Some have gone away because of clemency, or errors found on appeal,” Fidell, who also served as a judge advocate in the Coast Guard, said. “So there’s been a lot of cases that have gone through the system, but the system does tend to winnow them out. And presidents have not fallen all over themselves to clear the path for executions.” Retired Lt. Col. Jeffrey Addicott, a former Army judge advocate who tried a death penalty case that was ultimately commuted to life, said that he hopes the DOJ guidance signals a change on the military side. “Hopefully it is a harbinger of things to come,” Addicott said. “Obviously the military appeal system is broken and hopefully the DOJ’s decision will energize a revamping of the military’s appeal process so that the victims can have justice.” “Although the military rules of evidence are word for word the same as the federal rules of evidence, the military appeal system takes a somewhat different track than the Federal Court appeal system, but both ultimately merge together at the U.S. Supreme Court,"" he added. As it stands, Ronald R. Gray, a former Army private convicted in 1988 of multiple murders and rapes, appears to be the closest to being put to death. Gray was initially given an execution date in 2008 after then-President George W. Bush approved it, but a stay was granted less than a week afterwards. That stay of execution was lifted in 2016, but even he doesn’t face any immediate execution date. Hasan, the Army psychiatrist who opened fire in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, may also wait to learn of an outcome. Hasan’s former defense lawyer, retired Col. John P. Galligan, told Army Times that they spoke last week on the day in which the new DOJ guidance was announced. Galligan, a former Army judge advocate who still represents Hasan on some civil cases, said that his client could be affected by the new guidance, but there remain many avenues to appeal his sentence. “[Hasan’s] case hasn’t even really gotten through the initial stages of the appeal,” Galligan said. “The case is still being litigated on post-trial discovery issues ... I think it’d be a long time before that [the death penalty] becomes one of the pertinent issues to be addressed on appeal.” Hasan Akbar is another former soldier on death row. He was sentenced to death for a premeditated attack that killed an Army captain and an Air Force major early in the morning of March 23, 2003, at Camp Pennsylvania, Kuwait, at the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Also on death row is Timothy Hennis, a former master sergeant who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of a North Carolina woman and her two children in 1985.

210,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/605067600/0/phoenix/nation~A-hero-amid-Gilroy-gunfire-yearold-girl-drags-toddler-to-safety/,"GILROY, Calif. – A gunman cut through a fence at a popular California garlic festival and turned to a tent where the Honey Ladies were selling their habanero and garlic honey. He shot and wounded the business owner and her husband, but thanks to a 10-year-old girl, their young son escaped harm, witnesses say. Candice Marquez and another woman had stepped away from the stand they were working Sunday with her boss, Wendy Towner, and Towner’s husband, Francisco. She heard what she thought were fireworks, then saw a gunman heading toward their tent. “We were the only ones right there. He had a straight shot for both of us. I’ve never been so scared,” Marquez told The Associated Press. More terrifying, children were still in the tent. But Marquez said her niece sprang into action, dragging her boss’ 3-year-old son out of harm’s way. “She was brave. She grabbed him and put him under a table,” she said. Troy Towner wrote on a fundraising page he set up for his sister that the girl’s actions probably saved his nephew’s life. Santino William Legan: Gilroy shooter from boxing-loving family, cited 'Might Makes Right' Before the shooting: Gilroy and its garlic festival created powerful memories of their own It’s one of the stories of heroism that emerged from the violence that tore through the last day of the Gilroy Garlic Festival, leaving a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a young man from New York dead. As the gunfire erupted Sunday, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar stayed back to keep pace with a relative who uses a cane. The girl was hit. “If Keyla hadn’t been there, her stepfather’s mother would have been shot,” said her aunt Katiuska Vargas. Keyla’s stepfather also was shot and wounded as he went back for her, Vargas said. Her aunt described Keyla as a hardworking student who loved drawing and video games and wanted to become an animator. The Northern California community of Gilroy known for growing garlic and celebrating the prized, pungent crop at one of the largest food fairs in the United States is rallying around the victims – and each other. They vowed at a vigil Monday not to let 19-year-old gunman Santino William Legan tear them down. Authorities were searching Tuesday for Legan’s motive, including combing his social media, where he posted just before the shooting. They say he appeared to fire at random and that police patrolling the event responded within a minute and killed Legan as he turned the weapon on them. On the day of the attack, Legan urged his Instagram followers to read a 19th century book popular with white supremacists on extremist websites. He also complained about overcrowding towns and paving open space to make room for “hordes” of Latinos and Silicon Valley whites. Legan posted a photo from the festival minutes before opening fire, saying, “Come get wasted on overpriced” items. His since-deleted Instagram account says he is Italian and Iranian. He legally purchased the military-style rifle he used this month in Nevada, where his last address is listed. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, residents younger than 21 are barred from buying guns unless they are in the military or law enforcement. Those 18 and up can buy guns in Nevada. Prescriptions included opioids: A phony pharmacist filled over 745,000 prescriptions in the Bay Area Big Mikes Gun and Ammo, which appears to be a home-based internet gun shop in Fallon, Nevada, said on its Facebook page that Legan ordered the rifle off its website and “was acting happy and showed no reasons for concern” when the store owner met him. The shooting sent people running away in terror and diving under tables and a concert stage. Five wounded people ranging in age from 12 to 69 were still in hospitals, San Francisco Bay Area station KTVU reported Tuesday. The youngest victim, Stephen Romero, described by his grandmother as a kind, happy and playful kid, had just celebrated his sixth birthday in June at Legoland in Southern California. The oldest victim was Trevor Irby, 25, who graduated in 2017 from Keuka College in upstate New York and was described as an athlete and Pittsburgh Steelers fan. He was there with his girlfriend, who wasn’t hurt. People had to pass through metal detectors and have their bags searched at the long-running festival that draws more than 100,000 people with music, food booths and cooking classes to the city roughly 80 miles southeast of San Francisco. Police, paramedics and firefighters were stationed throughout the event. Legan bypassed those security measures by cutting through a fence, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said. That’s when Wendy Towner saw him and yelled: “No, you can’t do that!” Troy Towner wrote. The gunman turned toward her tent, shooting her in the leg and her husband three times, Troy Towner wrote on the fundraising page. He said his sister underwent surgery and was expected to have long-term nerve damage, while her husband faces many surgeries. Troy Towner said his nephew was OK and staying with family. He updated the page Tuesday to say the boy saw his mother in the hospital and his father by video chat.

211,https://nypost.com/2019/07/30/2019-democratic-debate-far-left-candidates-moderates-tussle-with-each-other-and-moderators/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Marisa Schultz, Julia Marsh and Aaron Feis Submit July 30, 2019 | 11:39pm				| Updated July 31, 2019 | 1:57am DETROIT, Mich. — The second round of the Democratic primary debates saw far-left candidates fending off skepticism from their more moderate opponents — when any of them could get a word in edgewise over the moderators. Ten White House hopefuls — just half of an over-stuffed field — spent as much time discussing health care, immigration and gun violence as they did tripping over each other and the trio of CNN hosts with pleas for more time. “Please respect the rules,” was a frequent admonishment delivered throughout the night by moderators Jake Tapper, Dana Bash and Don Lemon, with most candidates on the receiving end at some point. “No,” a fed-up Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren finally pushed back at one point in the debate’s third act, shaking her head as she persisted to rebut an attack. Those tightly enforced rules, intended to keep a leash on the crowded field on stage at Detroit’s Fox Theatre, allotted 60 seconds to answer a direct question, and a scant 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals to direct call-outs. What filtered through to millions of viewers at home through the often stilted format was the ideological and generational gulf separating Warren and fellow uber-liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, from their eight more moderate — but lower-polling — opponents. “I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not fairy-tale promises,” said former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, in a not-so-veiled broadside of Warren and Sanders’ ambitious platforms, which include universal health care and forgiveness of student debt. “I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for,” parried Warren, showing her fire wasn’t just reserved for the moderators with a response that drew raucous applause. Sanders offered a similar dream-big sentiment, saying, “I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas.” South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who, at just 37, repeatedly positioned himself as the party’s youthful face of the future — urged the field to focus on sharpening the best policy, not a policy that can be sold to Republicans. “It’s true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they’re going to say we’re a bunch of crazy socialists,” said Buttigieg. “If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they’re going to do? Say we’re a bunch of crazy socialists.” That call for a unified vision came in response to a question about universal Medicare, the first of the big ideas on which the candidates sparred. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to undercut Sanders’ insistence that his “Medicare for All” proposal will guarantee dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses for seniors, interrupting, “You don’t know that, Bernie.” “I do know!” snapped the famously irascible Vermont Democratic socialist. “I wrote the damn bill!”  The pair clashed again in the debate, when Sanders pointed out that polls have him topping President Trump in the 2020 race. “Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls, too,” chided Ryan. Despite the fleeting flashes of fireworks, it was the restrictive format that ruled at the expense of back-of-the-pack candidates, which included former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and self-help author Marianne Williamson. “I think the debate was rigged to a certain extent, and designed to give Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders more air time than the rest of the candidates so that they couldn’t get their message out,” said Fletcher Smith, a former South Carolina State Rep. who’s endorsed Ryan. “It looks like those people who were actually conducting the debate wanted to promote the winners that they were trying to pick.” Many of the millions of viewers watching at home skewered the format on social media. “The time limit is horrible,” tweeted @SandraCoppola7. “I stopped watching when I realized no one could finish an answer to a question.” Joked another viewer, “Jake Tapper is going to TURN THIS DEBATE RIGHT AROUND AND GO HOME if the candidates don’t adhere to the time limits.” Wrote a third watcher, “This format is a disaster.” One viewer who resisted the urge to chime in was Trump. The president — who tweeted during last month’s first debate in Miami that the proceeding was “BORING!” — told reporters that he would be watching the follow-up match, but sat on his fingers throughout Tuesday’s meandering two-and-a-half-hour spectacle. The topic of climate change presented another ideological fork in the road, with former Colorado governor Hickenlooper blasting the lofty jobs promises in the proposed “Green New Deal.” “You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump,” cracked Hickenlooper. Bullock — a late entrant not part of the first debate — said the first step in the fight was to win the minds of GOP lawmakers. “Let’s not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can’t even get a Republican to acknowledge that the climate is changing,” said Bullock. One issue that yielded somewhat more cohesion — just days after three people, including two children, were killed in a California mass shooting — was gun control. “This is not just about a system, this is not just about words, this is about the NRA,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, vowing the take on the deep-pocketed National Rifle Association’s sway in the Beltway that has hamstrung overtures towards reform. Agreed O’Rourke, “In this country, money buys influence, access and, increasingly, outcomes.” Outsider option Williamson tried to expand the discussion of money in Washington to the need for campaign finance reform, saying that voters will rightfully offer a skeptical “yada yada yada” to any candidate who takes sizable lobbyist funding. Ten more candidates will take the stage Wednesday night. They include presumptive front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and a trio of tri-state leaders: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and the Big Apple’s Mayor Bill de Blasio.

          / CBS News A young boy, a teenage girl and a young man were killed in a mass shooting at a Northern California garlic festival that left a dozen other people wounded, police said Monday. The 19-year-old gunman, who also died in the Sunday evening shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, bought his ""AK-47-type"" weapon legally in Nevada, Gilroy's police chief said. The deceased victims were identified by officials as 6-year-old Stephen Luciano Romero of San Jose, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar and Trevor Irby, who the police said was in his 20s. The medical examiner's office identified Romero overnight, and Irby was identified Monday by the president of his alma mater, Keuka College in upstate New York. During a Monday morning press conference, Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee confirmed the gunman has been identified as Santino William Legan, 19. The police chief said investigators haven't found a motive for the shooting. ""Anytime a life is lost it's a tragedy, and when it's young people it's even worse, and it's very difficult,"" Smithee told reporters. ""... It seems that this was a random act, but, again, we've got a long way to go before we can come to a determination what his motivation was."" Smithee told reporters in a late-night briefing that Gilroy officers engaged the gunman within a minute of shots ringing out and killed him. A family member of a 13-year-old girl who was killed by a gunman at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California told The Associated Press that the teenager may have inadvertently saved another relative's life. Keyla Salazar's aunt, Katiuska Vargas, said the teen was eating ice cream with family members when they heard gunshots and began to flee. Vargas says her niece stayed back to keep pace with a relative who uses a cane and was shot with a bullet that otherwise might have hit that woman. Vargas says Keyla's stepfather was wounded as he went back for her. Keyla's two sisters, ages 4 and 12, also were at the festival, but they escaped unharmed. The crowdfunding website GoFundMe created a page with verified fundraising campaigns for victims and those impacted by the Sunday shooting. This includes pages for the families of six-year-old Stephen Luciano Romero, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar and 25-year-old Trevor Irby as well as a woman injured in the shooting. In response to the tragic Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting, we've created this centralized hub for the verified GoFundMe campaigns that are supporting victims & their families. https://t.co/qo7NCtU86T Multiple vigils were held for victims and those impacted by the shooting. One bilingual vigil took place Monday night at St. Mary's Parish in Gilroy. Another vigil, organized by a community member, was being held in a plaza between the town's library and city hall and included music performed by the Christopher High School choir. One attendee suggested merging the vigils as a show of solidarity. Five people remained hospitalized at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, Trauma Medical Director Dr. Adella Garland said during a press conference Monday evening. Of the five patients, three are in serious to fair condition, while two declined to offer updates on their medical condition. Dr. Garland said that the hospital learned much from the military as well as other shootings on how to respond. She and Dr. Peter Coelho, the medical director of the St. Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy, credited their dedicated staff for effectively treating patients. Deputy Special Agent Craig Fair of the FBI's San Francisco branch announced during a Monday press conference that the agency had launched a website for the public to send photos or videos related to the shooting. Fair said he expects it to take a few days before authorities have swept the crime scene, which he described as ""extensive and complex."" Fair said that authorities were looking into social media tips as well. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee mentioned that officials looked into the Facebook profile of ""Chase M. Killings,"" which may have belonged to someone involved in the shooting. After taking the person into custody, authorities determined that he was ""not associated with this event."" The retailer believed to have sold the weapon used in the Sunday shooting issued a statement on Facebook condemning the tragedy, saying ""it goes against everything I believe in."" ""I pray to God for all the families. I did not know this individual. He ordered the rifle off my internet page. When I did see him, he was acting happy and showed no reasons for concern,"" Big Mike's Gun & Ammo wrote. ""I would never ever sell any firearm to anyone who acted wrong or looks associated with any bad group like white power. Everyone is my brother and sister and I am mourning for the families."" Smithee had said witnesses told authorities at least one other person may have been involved in the shooting, but there was no confirmation of that or the role he or she might have played. At Monday's press conference, Smithee said authorities don't have any confirmation that a ""potential second suspect"" opened fire and all leads into who that person may be were being investigated. ""We've gotten multiple reports that there may have been another person with him, that they ran this way or they ran that way, but different people gave different versions, so we really don't know at this point,"" Smithee said. The FBI was among numerous law enforcement agencies assisting Gilroy police, who were leading the investigation. Smithee said overnight the suspect or suspects appeared to have cut through a wire fence at a creek bordering the festival grounds to bypass heavy security to gain access. Witnesses told CBS News the gunman appeared to be firing at random. Some witnesses said he suddenly appeared from behind a stage before beginning to shoot. ""It's just incredibly sad and disheartening that an event that does so much good for our community has to suffer from a tragedy like this,"" Smithee added. The shooting happened on the last day of the annual three-day festival. It features food, cooking competitions and music and attracts more than 100,000 people, The Associated Press notes. Gilroy, a city of 50,000 some 80 miles southeast of San Francisco, is known as ""The Garlic Capital of the World."" Cheryl Low and Candice Marquez were working at a vendor's booth at the festival. They told ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday that their bosses had been shot and are currently in the hospital, where they have both come out of surgery and are in stable condition. They said the gunman had a high-powered rifle and did not appear to be specifically targeting people. ""No, no. Just anybody. He was going back and forth,"" said Marquez. ""It was random,"" said Low. ""He shot one shot, then he put the clip in, and he just started moving shooting back and forth, walking towards our tent because that's where most of the people were in that area, and he started just shooting."" Romero was at the garlic festival with his mother and grandmother, who were treated for gunshot wounds at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose. His mother was reportedly shot in the stomach and hand, and his grandmother in the leg. CBS News' Janet Shamlian spoke with the boy's father outside the hospital Monday. He wasn't ready to say much, but did call it the worst day of his life. Irby studied biology at Keuka College, located about 55 miles southeast of Rochester, New York, and graduated in 2017, the school's president, Amy Storey, said in a statement. Irby was at the garlic festival with another graduate of the school who was not injured in the shooting, Storey said. ""Our hearts go out to Trevor's family and loved ones,"" Storey said. ""We are shocked that this latest episode of senseless gun violence resulted in the loss of one of our recent graduates -- graduates in whom we place so much hope because of their potential to create a brighter tomorrow."" The band Tin Man was doing an encore when gunfire erupted, CBS San Francisco reports. Singer Jack van Breen said he saw a man wearing a green shirt and grayish handkerchief around his neck fire into the food area with what appeared to be an assault rifle. Van Breen and other members of the band dove under the stage. Van Breen told the station he heard someone shout, ""Why are you doing this?"" The person responded, ""Because I'm really angry."" A festival attendee captured video of the band's set when the shooting began. *WARNING: Possibly distressing footage* #BREAKING: Video shows moment gunman opens fire on Gilroy garlic festival Sunday evening; 4 people killed (including suspected gunman), 15 others injured.

215,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/trump-send-her-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael Crowley BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Trump on Saturday extended the debate over a chant of “send her back!” at his campaign rally in North Carolina this week when he retweeted a right-wing British commentator who has drawn repeated condemnation over a long history of anti-Muslim remarks and for casting blame on a Jewish leader for provoking a synagogue shooting. Sending fresh mixed signals about his view of the chant directed at a Democratic lawmaker, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Mr. Trump shared video of the episode posted by the commentator, Katie Hopkins, who has said “Islam disgusts me” and who last year appeared to link a rabbi’s pro-migrant work to the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Ms. Hopkins was celebrating the moment in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday, suggesting that the crowd’s chant could be a new slogan for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. “Send her back is the new lock her up,” she wrote, referring to a refrain from the 2016 campaign directed at Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. “Well done to #TeamTrump,” she added. Mr. Trump, who has shifted his account of how he responded to the chant about Ms. Omar, posted Ms. Hopkins’s tweet on his own feed while adding commentary that placed some distance between himself and his supporters that night in Greenville. “As you can see, I did nothing to lead people on, nor was I particularly happy with their chant. Just a very big and patriotic crowd. They love the USA!” Mr. Trump wrote early Saturday from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The chant followed Mr. Trump’s attack on Ms. Omar and three of her fellow Democratic congresswomen of color — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — in which the president called on the lawmakers to “go back” to their countries. All of them are American citizens, and all but Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee, were born in the United States. A day after the Greenville rally, Mr. Trump, under pressure from congressional Republicans and even his own daughter, falsely claimed that he had tried to interrupt the chant, something clearly disproved by the video. Speaking to reporters on Friday, he declined an opportunity to criticize the chant, calling his supporters “incredible patriots” and saying he was unhappy that Ms. Omar “can hate our country.” It is unclear whether Mr. Trump was aware of the background of Ms. Hopkins, who is a notorious right-wing agitator and former columnist for The Daily Mail whose attacks on Muslims in particular have largely exiled her from the mainstream news media. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has often amplified, through retweets, the voices of white nationalists, fierce critics of Islam, conspiracy theorists and other activists and commentators from the far right. In May, Mr. Trump retweeted a conspiracy-theory account under the handle Deep State Exposed — whose Twitter profile claims 10 retweets by the president in all — that declared: “The ‘elite’ proclaim America must submit to Islam or else!!! #Trump2020.” That month he also retweeted a message ending with an A-O.K. emoji, which has become a symbol of the white nationalist movement. After a terrorist attack in May 2017 at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, Ms. Hopkins tweeted, “We need a final solution Manchester.” Soon after that, she left a job as a talk-show host with LBC radio in London. After a Tunisian man living in France killed 86 people in 2016 by driving a truck through a crowd in Nice, France, Ms. Hopkins incited another backlash by calling for mass deportations of Muslims. “I am not Islamophobic,” she wrote. “Islam disgusts me. This is entirely rational.” After the mass shooting last year at the Tree of Life synagogue that left 11 people dead, Ms. Hopkins suggested that the killer, who expressed fury online over a Jewish charity’s support for Muslim immigrants, had been provoked. “Look to the Chief Rabbi and his support for mass migration across the Med,” she wrote. “There you will find your truths.” It was unclear to whom Ms Hopkins was referring, but Britain’s most senior rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has advocated welcoming immigrants from south of the Mediterranean Sea. In response to an online uproar Saturday over the president’s retweet of her post, Ms. Hopkins followed up with another message. “Call me what you wish. Islamophobe. Bigot. Racist. Vile. It matters not,” she wrote. “What matters is the fight back for our Christian culture we desperately need to defend.” Advertisement",2019-07-20 00:00:00,"In ‘Send Her Back’ Fallout, Trump Amplifies Praise From Right-Wing British Commentator - The New York Times",,1,http://nytimes.com
216,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/gilroy-garlic-festival-gunman-identified-santino-william-legan/,"Trending:  The man who inexplicably killed three people, including two children, by firing a rifle into a crowd at the Gilroy Garlic Festival died in a fierce gun battle with three officers, the city’s police chief said, as more details about the shooter’s life and background came into focus. Santino William Legan was the man who opened fire with an assault-type rifle at Sunday’s close of the three-day festival before three Gilroy police officers, armed with handguns, exchanged gunfire with the shooter and killed him. He was the 19-year-old grandson of former Santa Clara County Supervisor Tom Legan, who died last year. The three people killed were 6-year-old Stephen Romero and 13-year-old Keyla Salazar, both of San Jose, and 25-year-old Trevor Irby, of the town of Romulus in upstate New York. “When the call came in our closest team of officers responded immediately and engaged the suspect in less than a minute,” Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said. “The suspect was armed with an assault-type rifle. He fired at the officers with the rifle and three officers engaged the suspect. And despite being outgunned — they were using handguns against his rifle — they were able to fatally wound the suspect.” Smithee added that the quick action by his officers prevented a tragedy that could “have been so much worse so fast.” The chief said the gun used was what he described as an SKS AK-47 style assault rifle “that had been purchased legally in Nevada on July 9.” The District Attorney’s Office in Mineral County, Nevada confirmed that FBI agents early Monday raided a unit in a triplex in Walker Lake that Legan was believed to have used “during the days prior” to the Gilroy shootings. Around the same time, officers and agents from multiple law-enforcement agencies searched the Gilroy home of Santino Legan’s family Monday morning. Legan grew up in Gilroy, although it’s unclear when he moved to Nevada and when he returned, Smithee said. He would have likely had to have been a resident of Nevada to purchase the gun legally. At a news conference Monday afternoon, Smithee said police were “no closer to determining whether there was or was not a second shooter, and if there was, what involvement they may have had.” However, a law enforcement source told this news organization that Santino Legan is believed to be the only shooter. Court records show no adult criminal history for Santino Legan in Santa Clara County. County health system spokesperson Joy Alexiou confirmed that 19 people from the festival were sent to two county hospitals, St. Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy and Valley Medical Center in San Jose. Of the three fatal gunshot victims, one died at St. Louise. Five patients remain at VMC, with one in critical condition, one in serious condition and one in fair condition. The other two requested privacy about their conditions. The patients taken to VMC ranged in age from 12 to 69. One patient has been discharged from VMC, and three people with gunshot wounds have been discharged from St. Louise. Eight other patients went to St. Louise with non-gunshot injuries and were treated and released. Hospital officials said Monday that many of the surviving shooting victims have improved since being admitted. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited victims at the San Jose hospital Monday to offer comfort, and in remarks to reporters afterward characterized his conversations with them. “Nothing I can say can change what’s happened. I don’t know what I can possibly say to make you feel better except, God bless you, and I’m so sorry, not only what’s happened to you, but what’s happening in this country, in this state, in this nation of ours,” he said. “We’re here for you.” At Monday’s press conference, Craig Fair, deputy special agent in charge at the FBI’s San Francisco office, said he had a team of 30 people in the field gathering evidence. He said the team was looking for “motivation, ideological leanings” of the suspect and whether he had been “affiliated with anyone or any group.” “That still has to be ruled out or determined at this point,” Fair said. Fair said witness photos and videos can be uploaded for the FBI’s review at fbi.gov/gilroy. Information about the shooter can be relayed to Gilroy police at 408-846-0583. In a post on his Instagram page days before the shooting, a user identified as Santino William Legan told followers to “Read Might is Right by Ragnar Redbeard,” an apparent reference to the racist manifesto “Might is Right or The Survival of the Fittest,” written in 1890. The work, written under a pseudonym, has become a key part of the modern white supremacist and Neo-Nazi canon, and is frequently mentioned on extremist websites. In his Instagram post, which has since been taken down, Legan also used racial and misogynistic slurs to describe “hordes” of Silicon Valley workers and people of mixed race origin “overcrowding” towns. The post was accompanied by a photo of a Smokey Bear sign warning of high fire danger. In a post dated Sunday, Legan referenced the Gilroy festival.“Ayyy garlic festival,” the post read. “Come get wasted on overpriced shit.” When asked if Legan targeted any particular group of people at the festival, Smithee said, “The descriptions that have been given to me, it appeared as though it was random, but I think we’re still too early in the investigation to say that definitively.” The suspect’s grandfather, Tom Legan, was a county supervisor in the 1980s. During his second term, Tom Legan was charged with molesting a female relative, but was acquitted of the charges in 1988. Days later, he lost his bid for re-election.

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)  Gilroy Mayor Roland Velasco proclaimed a local emergency Monday morning. “I would ask for the thoughts and prayers of the community as our officers continue to investigate this tragic and senseless crime,” he said. The shooting sent hundreds of panicked festival-goers running for cover. Among the dead was Stephen, whose mother and grandmother were also shot and were being treated at Valley Medical Center in San Jose. The Romeros, including Stephen, are cousins of San Jose City Councilmember Maya Esparza, according to a Facebook post she wrote Monday morning. “Heartache and prayers for my cousins who were wounded yesterday and losing my little cousin, only 6 years old,” Esparza wrote. “And I’m angry, so angry. This violence has to stop. How do some people have such little regard for life.” A GoFundMe campaign for the Romero family has been launched by the South County Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Fiat in Gilroy. Kueka College, located in New York State west of where Irby lived, confirmed in a statement Monday that the 2017 biology graduate died in the shooting. The school also stated that when Irby was wounded, he was attending the festival with a woman who also attended the college and that a campus vigil was planned for the near future. A family assistance center will be hosted at Rucker Elementary School, 325 Santa Clara Ave. in Gilroy, through at least Friday for those affected by the Gilroy Garlic Festival shootings. The American Red Cross, the District Attorney’s Office Victim Services Unit, and county behavioral health services will offer grief counseling, help filing claims for state funds to help pay medical and counseling bills and for other assistance, and referrals to medical, counseling and other assistance providers. Starting Monday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., the center will be open Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and could be extended after that as needed. For more information, call 408-209-8356. Witnesses reported that the gunman appeared to be firing at random after suddenly appearing from behind a stage on the final evening of the three-day event that draws 100,000 people each year. Natalie Martinez, a longtime Gilroy resident, said she had gone to get food and was separated from her two daughters when the shooting began. “I ran to find the girls … and we basically ran into each other,” she said. “I thought, we’re open prey. It was awful.” Some witnesses said the gunman quietly and calmly went about his shooting spree. “He didn’t say anything,” Candace Marquez told KTVU, describing how the shooter began loading what looked like a ammunition clip into his weapon. “He was very quiet. If we would have said a word, he would have shot us.” Leslie Andres, 12, was shot in the leg while at the festival with several friends and family, her sister Yasmin Medellin said, while on her way to visit her at Valley Medical Center in Monday. “The bullet went in and out,” she said, adding that Leslie is expected to be released Tuesday. “We tried asking her what happened but she’s not saying much.” Los Altos resident Troy Towner started a GoFundMe page for his sister, Wendy, who along with her husband, Francisco Aguilera, was wounded by the shooter’s gunfire. On the page, Towner said his sister was out of surgery “but will have long term nerve and muscle damage to her leg. Her husband had more severe damage to his femoral artery,” but “with many surgeries and amazing doctors we have some good results. It will be a long road ahead in PT, skin grafts and plastic surgery for both.” He shared how his sister described the attack: “A man was climbing over the fence in the last hour of a 3 day HOT Garlic festival. My sister, her husband and son were sitting down to catch their breath after a long weekend. She was at the festival selling Habanero and Garlic Honey for her business, The Honey Ladies. Wendy, told the gunman, ‘No, you can’t do that!’ as she saw him climb the fence with a gun.” The man “opened fire on them, hitting both her and her husband. Their 3 year old son was dragged under the table by a brave 10 year old girl, that probably saved his life,” Towner wrote. “He wanted to run to Mommy and Daddy. The shooter then approached closer, and said ‘are you alright?’ ” He said his sister Wendy was shot once in the leg while her husband sustained bullet wounds to his shoulder, femoral artery and lower leg. News of the shooting, and particularly the young age of the victims, shocked a country that has been dealing with mass shootings on an almost regular basis in recent years. Social-media outlets overflowed with reactions, not just condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attack, but also praise for the police officers who quickly stopped the attack as well as political commentary from both sides on gun violence and how to stem it. “The shooter, reportedly dressed in military garb and carrying an assault-type rifle, is the result of a gun industry that embraces militarization and heightened lethality in the design, production, and marketing of its products,” said Violence Policy Center Executive Director Josh Sugarmann in a statement. “Until the gun industry is held fully accountable for its dangerous actions, these horrific attacks will continue unabated.” Several presidential candidates spoke out about the shooting, a tragedy that could be discussed in this week’s Democratic debate on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. We’re still waiting on all the details from Gilroy, but my heart is already breaking for the victims and their families and the survivors. The gun violence epidemic in this country is out of control. Please be safe and take care of one another. https://t.co/lrOA0gh6VD — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) July 29, 2019  At a press conference Sunday evening, Brian Bowe, the festival’s executive director, described Gilroy as “an amazing, tightly-knit community. We are family. We have had the wonderful opportunity in this community to celebrate our family through our Garlic Festival, and for over four decades that festival has been our annual family reunion. It’s such a sad, just horribly upsetting circumstance that this happened on the third and final day of this year’s festival.” Andrew Sanchez, 19, lives in a home behind the suspect’s house in Gilroy and said he can see their yard from his. He told this news organization that while he didn’t know the man or his family, the home seemed quiet. “Thankfully we went to see a baseball game” on Sunday, Sanchez said. “Otherwise we most likely would’ve been” at the festival. He said his mother was still very shaken. “She’s very scared,” he said. “It makes everyone sick.” Sanchez said he thinks that despite the tragedy, the “festival will come back and be bigger than ever. The garlic festival means so much to so many people.” Staff writers Emily DeRuy, Thy Vo, Leonardo Castañeda, Joseph Geha, Jason Green, Maggie Angst and Casey Tolan contributed to this report.

Emergency medical personnel outside of shooting at the annual Garlic Festival in Gilroy has left at least one person dead and at least four persons hospitalized. The even was held near Christmas Hill Park, Gilroy, Calif. on Sunday July 28, 2019. A gunman with an assault-type rifle opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday evening, killing three and wounding 12 others, some critically, before being killed by police, Gilroy police said. A 6-year-old boy was among the dead. Read the latest on this story here. Police Chief Scot Smithee said the gunman — identified in news reports as 19-year-old Santino William Legan — and a companion accessed the festival through a creek and cut through a perimeter fence to avoid metal detectors. Gilroy police did not know what motivated the shooter or how the second suspect may have been involved. Authorities searched the Gilroy home of Legan’s family Monday morning, and neighbors confirmed that he lived at the home. Witnesses reported a second suspect, and a search continued late Sunday night for that person, police said. Authorities were unsure what role the second individual played in the shooting. The barrage of shots that rang out in the final hour of the three-day festival sent attendees diving to the ground, crawling under tables, screaming in fear and sprinting for safety. “It was quite shocking, and I’m fortunate to be alive,” said Michael Paz, 72, a hat vendor at the festival. Paz said he was about 80 feet away from the shooter, whom he described as being in his 30s and armed with a rapid-fire assault rifle. “He came ready to shoot because he was wearing a protective vest,” Paz said. “He was shooting left; he was shooting right without any particular aim.” Paz said everyone immediately dropped to the ground as law officers converged on the gunman and opened fire. At a street corner not far from the festival, officers were standing with drawn weapons. Officers were telling pedestrians to stay away from the area at Filbro Drive and Princevalle Street. It was unclear whether the activity there was related to the search for the gunman. “Go that way! Get outta here!” officers screamed at passing pedestrians. A chaotic video posted on Twitter shortly after 6 p.m. showed dozens of visitors running on the festival grounds. Panicked voices could be heard in the background. “What’s going on? ... Oh, they’re shooting,” the unidentified voices said. Another video posted to social media showed a bloodied shooting victim lying in the back of a white pickup truck, bleeding from his arm and waist. The first 911 calls came in at 5:41 p.m. with witnesses telling police the shooter was a white male in his 20s wearing a camouflage uniform and hat with a long rifle with removable clips. Shortly thereafter, a police officer told dispatch that he saw a Ford pickup driving off, likely to a hospital, while someone gave CPR to a victim in the bed of the truck. At about 5:53 p.m., dispatch logs show, there was the first report of a possible shooter down in the northeast section of park. Santa Clara Valley Medical Center was treating 11 gunshot victims and seven others wounded in the panic, said hospital spokeswoman Joy Alexiou. Eight non-gunshot wound victims were treated at St. Louise Regional Hospital in Gilroy, including one person who broke an ankle running away from the scene. The gunshot victims’ conditions ranged from critical to fair. Some victims were treated and released. Alexiou said the hospital system has never handled a mass shooting in Santa Clara County, but staffers were called in to triage the situation. “This is just a tough situation for our community,” she said. “Hopefully I’ll never see anything ever like this again.” At Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, at least a dozen people inside the front door could be seen crying and embracing each other. Mark Mendoza, 16, and his family said they were heading into the emergency room to find his cousin, who had been shot in the leg at the festival. Mendoza said he was near a children’s play area when a man near him opened fire. The gunman wore a “sheriff-type outfit” and was armed with what appeared to be a semiautomatic rifle, the teenager said. He said he watched as the shooter pointed the gun at a food vendor area and began firing. “A couple bullets hit the ground, I just ran,” Mendoza said. “I looked back, and a couple shots went by me.” One of the bullets struck his cousin, whom he did not identify, in the leg. The family split up, some scrambling into a wooded area and through a fence. A bystander helped some of the children climb through. Mendoza’s cousin was able to run away. Herman Solis of Hollister (San Benito County), who was attending the festival with his girlfriend, said he dropped to the ground when he heard gunfire. “You could hear the bullets whizzing by,” he said. “It was unreal. We ran and ducked for cover. It was chaos. At first I thought it was fireworks. Then I realized it wasn’t.” Solis and his girlfriend ran from the festival, took shelter in a nearby convenience store, and watched ambulances and police cars whiz past, heading for the festival grounds. Another festivalgoer, Felton Amos, 60, of Rio Vista had just finished eating dinner at a food tent with his family when he heard what he thought were firecrackers. He said the shooting lasted for about a minute. “Everybody just ran, panicked,” he said. “It sounded like more than one gun, like they were having a shootout.” Amos pushed his family to the ground as shots rang out nearby. Then he noticed that a woman was standing nearby, frozen in fear. “I got up and snatched her back down,” Amos said. “My mind was saying, ‘I’m going to get hit,’ but it didn’t matter.” Marybelle Arebalo, 23, had just finished a meal of garlic ice cream, bread and fries when the crowd of panicked festivalgoers began surging past. She said she did not hear the gunfire but saw the frightened festivalgoers heading for a rocky path leading away from the festival grounds. Arebalo said she scooped up her 1-year-old niece, plopped her in the stroller and began running with everyone else. “I didn’t believe it actually happened,” Arebalo said. “I was in shock. It’s so sad that we couldn’t even enjoy that day. We had to think about an escape plan and safety, and people dying. I came home and started crying. I can’t put my head around it.” Elena Diaz was waiting for her husband to pick her up from an emergency staging area at Gavilan College. She had to flee with the rest of the festivalgoers when the shooting started. She was working her booth, selling toe rings by the music stage when she heard two pops, “like fireworks” and then a rapid succession of gunfire. She and her customers huddled behind a table, for how long she wasn’t sure. “It was so scary,” she said. “It was like a scary movie.” Gilroy police asked anyone with any information about the shootings to call 408-846-0583. It also is a family-reunification line. Another festivalgoer, Briana Wilson, 20, said she had been volunteering in an olive oil booth when shots rang out. A man pushed her to the ground and, she said, told her to “hide or run.” Wilson said she heard about half a dozen shots that sounded to her like corn popping in a microwave oven. She ran. People running alongside her were calling out for their loved ones, she said. After running for what seemed like 2 miles, she and her friends found a man watering his lawn. He let them take refuge inside his house. Candice Marquez, 51, a honey vendor at the festival, said she was just 10 feet from the shooter and saw him replace a clip of ammunition. “He was super quiet, he was reloading, and we ran,” she said. Brian Bowe, executive director of the festival, told dozens of reporters gathered in the parking lot of Gavilan College that for four decades the festival has been an “annual family reunion” for the Gilroy community. “It is such a sad, horribly upsetting circumstance,” Bowe said. “It’s one of the most tragic and sad things that I’ve ever had to see.” State elected officials condemned the violence even as police were still seeking the shooter. “This is nothing short of horrific,” tweeted Gov. Gavin Newsom. Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies assisted Gilroy police officers at the scene, a sheriff’s department spokeswoman said. First responders from San Jose and Salinas also assisted, as did units from the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The violence in Gilroy is among the few hundred mass shootings in the U.S. each year, generally defined as killing or injuring four or more people. Last week, a shooter in the San Fernando Valley killed four people, two of whom were the gunman’s family members. California’s deadliest shooting in recent years was November’s bloodshed in Thousand Oaks (Ventura County), where a shooter killed 12 at a crowded bar. The nation’s worst shooting remains the 2017 rampage in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 and injured more than 500 at a country music concert. While the number of mass shootings hasn’t necessarily risen in recent decades, the death tolls have generally grown. While legislators have tightened gun laws in some states, including California, other states have resisted changes — and few reforms have come on the national level. Notably, federal law still allows private-party sales without background checks, known as the gun-show loophole. “Our country has a gun violence epidemic that we cannot tolerate,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris. Chronicle staff writers Lizzie Johnson, Kurtis Alexander, Ashley McBride and Matthias Gafni contributed to this report.

By GARY FINEOUT, MATT DIXON and ISABEL DOBRIN 07/24/2019 07:00 AM EDT Good Wednesday morning. Democrats in the U.S. House decided to go on the offense and test Republicans on Venezuela. It didn’t go well. Crisis management — For the last two years leading GOP politicians in Florida have ratcheted up their criticism of the Maduro regime in the South American country, calling for his ouster. Sen. Rick Scott, who has been pushing for more aggressive action, including military intervention, said in April that “we will be judged by our response to this crisis — not just the humanitarian crisis, but the threat to our hemisphere.” There are an estimated 190,000 Venezuelans who call Florida home. Ball of confusion — On Tuesday, House Democrats forced a vote on a bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) that would have temporarily shielded undocumented Venezuelans in this country from immigration enforcement. The move required a supermajority vote and it drew passionate debate from several members of the Florida delegation. “Let’s not confuse this with all of the issues of immigration and the broken immigration system,” Diaz-Balart said. “With what’s going on in Venezuela should we be sending Venezuelans back to that dictatorship or could Congress act? Don’t be cruel? — But the bill was sidelined after 154 House Republicans voted against offering temporary protected status to Venezuelans. Part of the irony? Eight of the GOP no votes were members of the Florida delegation. The results drew a scathing rebuke from Democrats such as Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who said the vote sent a “cruel message” that Republicans were “indifferent” to the “horrific” crisis unfolding. STINGING — “TPS for Venezuelans blocked by House Republicans,” by Miami Herald’s Alex Daugherty: “Republicans voted down a bill Tuesday that would provide Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans, a setback for South Florida lawmakers from both parties.” TO CONGRESS — “Parkland parents will press Congress to act on school shootings,” by POLITICO’s Gary Fineout: Parents who lost children in last year's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School will travel to Washington again this week to try to persuade members of Congress to help prevent future school shootings. Despite the country's fierce partisan divide over gun regulations and arming teachers, some Parkland family members say there are ways that lawmakers can find common ground to respond effectively to the violence. WUT? — “He’s a Chinese billionaire and a member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. Is he also a communist spy?” by Miami Herald's Sarah Blaskey and Jay Weaver: “A high-profile Chinese fugitive — who belongs to President Donald Trump’s exclusive South Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, and has railed against China’s communist government — is accused of being a spy for that very regime, according to new documents filed in a federal court case in New York.” ORIGIN STORY — “After Russian FaceApp goes viral, Rick Scott wants online stores to say where apps came from,"" by Tampa Bay Times' Steve Contorno: “Millions of people who thought they were just creating fun photos of their older selves may have unwittingly given a Russian app maker license to use their images. Sen. Rick Scott thinks he has a plan to prevent that from happening again.” KNOCK, KNOCK — “Wasserman Schultz wants authority to enter migrant centers without warning,” by Sun Sentinel's Andrew Boryga: “Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz isn’t sure exactly what goes on inside the nation’s migrant detention facilities, but she wants the ability to check without warning that she’s coming.” WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS — “Rick Scott stands up for the private prisons that bankrolled his Senate campaign,” by Tampa Bay Times' Steve Contorno: “No candidate benefited more from the largess of private prisons last year than Florida’s Rick Scott. And now the Republican senator is standing up for the controversial industry in the face of financial threats.” IT’S GOOD TO BE THE KING — “Second quarter brings Ballard Partners $4.7m in federal lobbying pay,” by Florida Politics’ Drew Wilson: “The Washington DC branch of Ballard Partners earned an estimated $4.7 million in lobbying pay during the second quarter of the year.

CURBELO OUT — The rumor that Carlos Curbelo would run for Congress again had died down in recent weeks, but he’s now making it official: he isn’t running (for Congress) in 2020. “Although I am confidence I would prevail, now is not the right time for me and for my family. I look forward to staying here at home and contributing to my community,” he told us Tuesday night. ‘Strong possibility’ — Instead, there's a good chance that Curbelo, now a regular on MSNBC’s afternoon lineup, runs for Miami-Dade mayor in 2020. Or, as he told us, there is a “strong possibility” he runs for mayor. Wait, there are numbers — As luck would have it, we also happened to get our hands on some new numbers looking at Curbelo’s old 26th Congressional District. The poll, conducted by GOP firm McLaughlin & Associates, included a hypothetical matchup with current Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who narrowly beat Curbelo in 2018. Turns out Curbelo remains popular in the Miami-Dade County-based seat. He leads Mucarsel-Powell 45-42 lead, according to the poll.

          / CBS/AP The Virginia General Assembly voted to adjourn until November, as Republicans rejected Democrats' request to vote on a series of gun control measures. Virginia lawmakers were set to debate and vote on new gun laws after a gunman killed a dozen people in a local government building. Gov. Ralph Northam ordered lawmakers to return to the Capitol and called for passage of a wide range of gun-control measures. The Democrat said people need ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers"" after a Virginia Beach city employee shot and killed 12 people on May 31. But the special session on gun violence got off to a chaotic start Tuesday before ending the same day. Advocates for and against stricter gun laws held rallies at the Virginia Capitol as lawmakers gathered, with Gov. Northam leading gun-control proponents in chants of ""enough is enough."" Northam had proposed legislation that would include expanding background checks in the state and a review of potential restrictions on gun ""silencers,"" or suppressors, like the one used in the latest shooting. Northam slammed his Republican colleagues for bringing an abrupt end to the legislative session. ""It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives. I expected better of them. Virginians expect better of them,"" said Northam in a statement. GOP lawmakers criticized Northam as trying to exploit a tragedy for political gain. And in the leadup to Tuesday's session, Republican leaders who control the legislature signaled they wouldn't pass gun controls, focusing instead on increasing criminal penalties after gun crimes. But Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment filed surprise legislation Monday to broadly ban guns in any government building. During the session, Virginia Senate GOP majority whip Bill Stanley resigned to protest Norment's bill. Norment then apologized to his caucus and moved to reinstate Stanley to his key leadership post. Stanley was the only one of his Republican colleagues to vote against himself. Kris Brown, president of the gun control advocacy group Brady said in a statement, ""Today, Tommy Norment and Kirk Cox revealed themselves as nothing short of cowards."" Brown added, ""If these 'leaders' won't enact solutions that their own constituents are demanding, then we're going to fight tooth and nail for representatives who will.""

Despite the country's fierce partisan divide over gun regulations and arming teachers, some Parkland family members say there are ways that lawmakers can find common ground to respond effectively to the violence. They'll make that case July 25 at a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing to examine state and federal recommendations for making schools safer. Max Schachter, founder and chief executive officer of Safe Schools for Alex, and Tom Hoyer, treasurer of Stand with Parkland — National Association of Families for Safe Schools, are scheduled to testify. Each lost a child in the Parkland shooting. Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County, Florida, who chaired the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, and Deborah Temkin, senior program area director of Education Child Trends, also are on the witness list for Thursday. Hoyer said he and other members of Stand with Parkland have come up with a list of items that they think that members of both parties could agree to enact in response to shootings. They include limiting public access to school campuses, giving authorities more flexibility to exchange information on students, and enacting red flag laws that allow law enforcement officials to confiscate a person's firearms if a judge deems the individual a threat to themselves or others. “This week, we hope to point out to Congress and the Senate in particular, this problem is not just one thing, it’s many things,” said Tony Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina Montalto was among the 17 killed in February 2018. Montalto is president of Stand with Parkland, a non-profit advocacy group formed in the aftermath of the shooting at the south Florida school. He and his members and will make visits to lawmakers in Washington this week. Gualtieri and the commission successfully pushed for a change in Florida law this year to allow school districts to expand the state’s Guardian Program to allow trained teachers to carry guns in schools. But Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, remains opposed to that idea. “I don’t think that teachers should be the ones who have a weapon,” Hoyer said. “I think their job is take care of the kids day in and day out.” In the days immediately following the shooting, Florida legislators passed a sweeping school safety bill that created the Guardian Program, raised the legal age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21, expanded mental health programs in schools and created a process by which law enforcement can temporarily confiscate guns from a person who a judge has deemed to be a threat. But while states have responded to incidents of gun violence, efforts in Congress have been mired in partisan gridlock. Sen. Marco Rubio is the main sponsor of a bill to give grants to states that pass red flag bills, but the measure has not moved so far. Montalto said he supports legislation from Reps. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.). The legislation, nicknamed the EAGLES Act after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Eagles, would expand the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center, giving it a greater focus on school violence prevention. Rubio is a co-sponsor of a similar bill in the Senate. Hoyer acknowledges that some of the efforts being pushed by Parkland parents might “span an administration or two or three” before they are passed. But he added that “we don’t see any disinterest at this point, people are still willing to work with us.” Pointing to the 50th anniversary of the landing on the moon, Montalto expressed optimism that Congress will step up to the challenge. “Our country didn’t get to the moon by concentrating on what we can’t do or can’t agree on,” Montalto said. “We solved the problem. It’s that kind of spirit that needs to be rekindled in government and put toward safeguarding the future of this country, our children and teachers.” © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2019-07-23 14:59:43,Parkland parents will press Congress to act on school shootings,"education and schools,politics and government,children and youth",18268,https://www.politico.com/

President Trump's love for golf and extensive collection of courses continues to receive widespread media attention. Since his inauguration, he's gone golfing at least 140 times across 280 golf course visits, according to an online tracker. (At last night's presidential debate, Trump told Democratic Nominee Joe Biden, without evidence, ""you probably golf more than I do;"" unlike Trump, Biden doesn't own any golf courses.) Apart from the debate, the president and his golf courses have been thrown back into the spotlight after a New York Times investigation found that his 15 courses combined have lost more than $315.6 million since 2000. In 2012, Trump spent $150 million to buy the National Doral Miami but over the next six years, the Times revealed that it ended up losing $162.3 million. Aso, as noted by Slate, Trump still has a $125 million mortgage on the property that's due in the next three years. In addition, he's lost $63.6 million on his golf courses in the British Isles.

227,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/family-las-vegas-mas-shooting-victim-sues-gun-64103282,"The parents of a woman killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history said Wednesday they know they're in an uphill battle after suing gun manufacturers they blame for their daughter's 2017 death on the Las Vegas Strip. LAS VEGAS -- The parents of a young woman killed in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre said Wednesday his family is blaming gun manufacturers for their daughter's death. ""Someone murdered our daughter,"" said James Parsons, whose 31-year-old daughter Carrie Parsons was one of 58 people killed when a gunman rained down gunfire from a high-rise hotel. ""Someone should be held accountable for that."" A wrongful death         lawsuit filed Tuesday targets Colt and seven other gun manufacturers, along with gun shops in Nevada and Utah, arguing their weapons are designed to be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons. ""It was a horrifying, agonizing experience and we don't want this to happen to other families,"" Parsons told The Associated Press of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The lawsuit is the latest case to challenge a federal law shielding gun manufacturers from liability. It charges that gun makers marketed the ability of the AR-15-style weapons to be easily modified to mimic machine guns and fire continuously, violating both a state and federal ban on automatic weapons. Parsons and his wife Ann-Marie argue in the lawsuit that the firearms are ""thinly disguised"" machine guns that the manufacturers knew could be easily modified, even without the use of a ""bump stock,"" an attachment used by the Las Vegas gunman that allowed him to fire in rapid succession. The Trump administration banned bump stocks this year, making it illegal to possess them under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns. ""We understand this is an uphill battle,"" Ann-Marie Parsons told the AP on Wednesday from their home in suburban Seattle. ""But somebody has got to do something because the carnage continues."" ""Losing our daughter is the worst thing that ever happened to us. It is hurtful to us every time we see these things happen,"" she said. The lawsuit charges the manufacturers showed a ""reckless lack of regard for public safety"" by advertising the firearms ""as military weapons and signaling the weapon's ability to be simply modified."" It alleges there are dozens of videos online showing people how to install bump stocks. ""It was only a question of when - not if - a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying AR-15s to fire automatically in order to substantially increase the body count,"" the lawsuit states. Courts have typically rejected lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers in other high-profile shooting attacks, citing a 2005 federal law that shields gun makers from liability in most cases when their products are used in crimes. Neither Colt nor any of the other manufacturers immediately responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press. The attorney for the Parsons family, Joshua Koskoff, is representing relatives of victims of the Newtown school massacre in a similar lawsuit. The Connecticut Supreme Court in March ruled that gun-maker Remington could be sued for the way it marketed an AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Remington plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Las Vegas shooter opened fire on the crowd of 22,000 from his suite in a tower of the Mandalay Bay casino-resort. Police and the FBI say the gunman acted alone and killed himself before officers reached his hotel room. The FBI's Behavioral Analysis unit later found the shooter sought notoriety in the attack on the open-air concert but cited no ""single or clear motivating factor."" The lawsuit is among more than a dozen filed since the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting, though it's the first to target a gun maker. Victims have sued MGM Resorts International, which operated the concert venue and owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, along with the concert promoter and others. MGM Resorts then sued hundreds of victims in a bid to avoid liability. The company has been in settlement talks with the victims and their families. ——— Associated Press Reno correspondent Scott Sonner contributed to this report from Reno.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation said Wednesday the criminal who opened fire on the Las Vegas Strip on Oct. 1, 2017 killing 58 and wounding hundreds more is responsible. The wrongful death lawsuit filed in Las Vegas Tuesday says eight national gun makers and three dealers in Nevada and Utah are liable for a Seattle woman's death because the AR-15 style rifles could be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons. Shooting foundation vice president Lawrence G. Keane says it's wrong to blame the makers of non-defective products that were sold legally. ———— 11:10 a.m. The family of a woman killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history says they know they're in an uphill battle after suing gun manufacturers. Carrie Parsons' mother said Wednesday that ""somebody has got to do something because the carnage continues."" Ann-Marie and James Parsons of suburban Seattle sued late Tuesday on behalf of their 31-year-old daughter. She was among 58 people killed at a Las Vegas concert on Oct. 1, 2017. The lawsuit against eight gun makers and three dealers argues that their weapons are designed in a way that could be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons. James Parsons says someone should be held accountable for their daughter's death. He says it was a horrifying, agonizing experience that no other family should have to go through. ——— 8:15 a.m. The family of a woman killed in the Las Vegas mass shooting has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against eight gun makers and three dealers. The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Nevada, alleges AR-15 style rifles could be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons. It targets Colt and seven other gun manufacturers, along with gun shops in Nevada and Utah. The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge to a federal law shielding gun manufacturers from liability. The family of 31-year-old Carrie Parsons, of Seattle, argues the firearms are ""thinly disguised"" machine guns. They charge the manufacturers knew their weapons could be easily modified to allow them to fire in rapid succession. None of the defendants immediately responded to requests for comment. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-03 14:10:26, The Latest: Parents blame gun makers for daughter's death,"suits and litigation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
229,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pakistani-teens-family-visits-texas-school-died-64278533,"The family of a 17-year-old Pakistani exchange student who was among the 10 people fatally shot at a Texas high school last year has traveled from their home in Karachi to visit the town where she was killed SANTA FE, Texas -- The family of a Pakistani exchange student who was one of 10 people killed in a mass shooting at a Texas high school last year traveled to the U.S and visited the school and community this week, wanting to learn more about the nine months she had spent there, including her final moments. Sabika Aziz Sheikh's father, three siblings and cousin entered the Santa Fe High School art classroom where the 17-year-old was shot as she hid with other students in a storage closet. Her mother, Farah Naz, couldn't bring herself to take the final steps into the room, explaining in Urdu through an interpreter that the image ""would stay with me ... throughout my whole life."" Although the family knew their two-week visit to the Houston area would be difficult, they felt Sabika would have wanted them to make the trip from Karachi, which also allowed them to personally thank people for their support, particularly residents of Santa Fe. ""We're still trying to grapple with the puzzle pieces, what her final moments were for her. The thought of it is so traumatizing,"" said Sabika's cousin Shaheera Jalil Albasit, who served as the family's interpreter during an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. Although Albasit came to Santa Fe right after the shooting, it is the first visit for the rest of the family. In addition to visiting the school, they met with Sabika's Santa Fe host family and with the prosecutors handling the case against the student charged with carrying out the attack. They also plan to meet with family members of other shooting victims. ""I knew this was going to be hard, but I had to do it,"" Sania Aziz Sheikh, Sabika's 15-year-old sister, said about visiting Santa Fe. Also on the trip were her 11-year-old sister, Soha, and her 14-year old brother, Ali. Sabika,         seven other students and two teachers were killed in the May 18, 2018, attack at the school, which is about 55 miles (88 kilometers) southeast of Houston. Thirteen other people were wounded. The student accused in the attack, 18-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is scheduled to stand trial in January on state murder charges. He also faces federal charges. Sabika came to Santa Fe, a city of about 13,000 residents, through a federal program in which high school students from countries with significant Muslim populations study in the U.S. While Sabika fully embraced living in America — going trick-or-treating on Halloween and attending prom with friends — she also worked to educate Santa Fe residents about Pakistan and Islam. Her parents said Sabika was committed to being a cultural ambassador for Pakistan and representing her religion and country in a positive light. Her father, Abdul Aziz, said it was important to tour Sabika's school and learn about her life there. On Tuesday, the family was given a tour of the campus, which was empty because of the summer break. With Sabika's schedule in hand, they went from         classroom to classroom and sat where she once did. They eventually went to the art room, where the family members who ventured inside sat on the floor where Sabika died and were able to more or less envision what her final moments looked like, Albasit said. Sabika was less than three weeks from returning home when she was killed. Sania said she took comfort in learning from one of Sabika's friends that she had been ""very happy"" the night before the shooting. Abdul Aziz, 52, who works as a distributor of cosmetics and plastic products in Pakistan, said despite what happened, he ""feels very positively"" about the U.S. and Santa Fe. But he and his wife said they had been unaware of the prevalence of gun violence in the U.S. Sabika's parents are part of a         group of family members of shooting victims who sued Pagourtzis' parents, claiming they had been negligent in entrusting him with guns. Albasit said that although Sabika's parents are confident Pagourtzis will be convicted, finding justice for Sabika would require         more of a systemic change in U.S. gun violence. ""No matter what happens, it's not going to bring back my daughter. But that will give me some sense of peace,"" said Naz, 45. Albasit, 27, who recently finished graduate school in Washington, D.C., became active in the gun control movement following her cousin's death. Abdul Aziz, who visits his daughter's grave in Karachi every day, said her presence in their lives remains as real as it was before, but that it's not something that can be seen. ""She's here in everything we do. That is not going to change,"" he said. ——— Follow Juan A.

231,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/experts-check-emergency-plans-festival-shooting-64646648,"Experts say organizers should take another look at their emergency plans in the wake of the deadly shooting at a California food festival to see if they can make additional safety improvements LOS ANGELES -- Event organizers should review their emergency plans after the deadly shooting at a California food festival to see if they can make additional safety improvements as the peak of summer and fair season brings open-air environments that are notoriously difficult to secure, law enforcement experts said. The weekend shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival         left three dead — including two children — and a dozen wounded at the famous three-day event that attracts more than 100,000 people annually to the agricultural         community in Northern California . The festival included a perimeter fence, metal detectors, a bag search and police patrols. Despite those measures, 19-year-old Santino William Legan cut through the fence and, wielding a rifle, opened fire before three officers — in less than a minute — fatally shot him, preventing additional casualties. ""Anytime you put on a large event with a lot of people you're always concerned, which is why we try to run a very tight, closed event where there's, you know, controlled access,"" Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said at a news conference Monday. ""Do we think about how we're going to respond if something were to happen? I would say the answer is yes."" Experts ticked off a list of ideal precautions: a perimeter fence — or even two — with roving police patrols, as well as drones, security cameras, social media monitoring, bag checks, metal detectors, limited points of entry and an ""overwatch"" police unit that monitors the event from a high perch. Recommendations for an overwatch position and securing beyond the site of the event are similar to suggested improvements after another deadly festival shooting: In 2017, a gunman on the 32nd floor of a hotel fired into a crowd and killed 58 people in Las Vegas. It became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. A review recommended securing high-rise buildings overlooking open-air venues, not just the festivals themselves. ""It's not just OK to secure your perimeter and think you're safe,"" Michael Downing, a former Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief, said. Still, officials said first responders and event coordinators need to balance safety concerns, costs and a welcoming atmosphere for visitors, noting that eventgoers likely do not want to be subjected to extensive screening with X-ray machines and metal detectors. ""You obviously can't do an event that is set up like an international airport,"" said Sheriff Tony Spurlock of Douglas County, Colorado, where the annual county fair is being held this week. ""It's not the kind of environment that we would set up magnetometers at every entrance."" Brian Higgins, a former Bergen County, New Jersey, police chief, said controlling an event's perimeter through technology and police is key to safety. Although a long line of people at a single point of entry can pose its own target, limited access means law enforcement can more easily see who is coming in and out — and with what. ""Just because it's a family-friendly event doesn't mean that something bad can't happen,"" Higgins said. Although festivalgoers may notice increased security in the coming weeks, experts don't foresee a major shift in safety protocols going forward. ""Events like this are occurring across the country every weekend and it's up to those event coordinators to determine the extent to which they want to employ security features,"" Craig Fair, deputy special agent in charge at the FBI's San Francisco office, said at Monday's news conference. Experts praised the Gilroy Police Department's precautionary efforts and quick response, noting that law enforcement there had taken many critical steps. ""If somebody's that determined to do something that terrible, it's going to be hard to stop them,"" said Soraya Sutherlin, managing partner of Los Angeles-based Emergency Management Safety Partners. Sutherlin said event planners should clearly label exits, with signs pointing people toward an evacuation route, and design a way for visitors to report suspicious activity either in person, over the phone or through an app. Officials said there must be greater efforts to identify future shooters beforehand, through social media monitoring or other means. ""How do we figure out that he was an absolute ticking time bomb waiting to go off?"" said Stephan Dembinsky, public safety director in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida. ""Until we figure out how to identify them, we're going to keep having these shootings."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-30 00:35:56, Experts say check emergency plans after festival shooting,"murders and attempted murders,festivals",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Craig Fair, the bureau's deputy special agent in charge of the San Francisco Division, says investigators are still determining Santino William Legan's mindset before he fired an AK-47 style rifle at people at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. He says investigators haven't yet determined why Legan moved to Nevada, where he purchased two guns, one of which he used in the incident and another that was found in his car. Fair says the 19-year-old appears to have been a loner, and he notes that people who act alone are ""exceptionally dangerous"" because they often don't communicate their plans to anyone in advance. ——— 4:20 p.m. Gilroy's police chief says investigators have found a shotgun in a car and a bag of ammunition in a creek near a food festival where a 19-year-old opened fire and killed three people. At a news conference Tuesday, Chief Scot Smithee also says it's looking more likely that Santino William Legan acted alone when he attacked the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday, although the investigation continues. Gilroy is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) south of San Francisco. Smithee says investigators have managed to track Legan's movements around town before the shooting and video shows him visiting stores alone. Legan was killed by police soon after he opened fire. Police have said he legally bought the semi-automatic assault rifle and the shotgun in Nevada. There's still no word on a motive. ——— 4 p.m. Authorities say they seized a bulletproof vest, empty shotgun and rifle boxes, a gas mask, empty ammunition boxes, hard drives and other electronic devices from the northern Nevada apartment of the Gilroy Garlic Festival gunman. The Mineral County district attorney's office says Tuesday officials also seized pamphlets on guns and a sack full of ammunition casings. Gunman Santino William Legan killed three people and wounded 12 others when he opened fire Sunday during the famous festival. Police shot him to death. Officials released copies of the search warrant Tuesday, but they say other documents remain under seal. Legan has lived in Gilroy, California, and Walker Lake, Nevada, a few miles north of Hawthorne, Nevada, recently. ——— 1:45 p.m. The FBI says it needs fairgoers' photos and videos taken during the Gilroy Garlic Festival — both before the shooting and during it — that can help investigators pull together a ""bigger picture"" of the deadly event. FBI spokeswoman Katherine Zackel says visitors should upload images and videos to the agency's         website . Zackel says the FBI has dozens of agents collecting evidence, which is expected to continue for days. More than 20 officials are also connecting victims with services such as counseling. Zackel says Gilroy police are the lead investigators because officials have not determined gunman Santino William Legan's motive yet. If it turns out to be an act of terrorism, the FBI will take over. She says FBI agents were at the festival before the shooting to help local police, a common practice. ——— 8:15 a.m. Members of the California garlic festival shooter's family were initially worried that that 19-year-old Santino William Legan was a victim of the attack. Family friend Jerome Turcan tells the Los Angeles Times that when he heard about Sunday's shooting in the city of Gilroy he called Legan's older brother, Rosino, who was in a car with a cousin searching for his younger brother. Turcan says they wanted to be sure he was OK and were thinking of going to an emergency room to see if he was there. Turcan says he was shocked to learn the next day that Santino William Legan was the gunman who authorities say killed three people and injured 12 others. Bay Area station KTVU reports Tuesday that five victims remain hospitalized. They range from age 12 to 69. ——— 10 p.m. The small rural community of Gilroy is reeling in the wake of a mass shooting at its annual garlic festival . But at a Monday night vigil, hundreds of residents vowed to remain ""Gilroy Strong."" Authorities are still seeking a motive for Sunday's attack by a 19-year-old who killed three people and wounded a dozen more before police shot him to death. Authorities say Santino William Legan had posted a white supremacist message on social media and a photo from the festival on Instagram shortly before opening fire with a semi-automatic rifle he'd bought legally in neighboring Nevada. The dead included a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 25-year-old college graduate from upstate New York. President Donald Trump condemned what he called the ""wicked murderer."" Gov. Gavin Newsom visited some victims and their families. He cursed as he condemned what he said was a refusal by federal lawmakers to control high-powered, high-capacity guns that are more tightly restricted in his state. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-30 11:36:57, The Latest: Festival shooter's kin worried he was a victim,"crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

234,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/vegas-police-release-report-lessons-2017-massacre-64255986,"Las Vegas police have released a report about what the department learned from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history LAS VEGAS -- Las Vegas police learned from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history to secure high-rise buildings overseeing open-air crowds and train more officers with rifles to stop a shooter in an elevated position, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Wednesday. Among 93 recommendations in a newly released department ""after-action review"" are requirements to plan ahead with neighboring police, fire, hospital and coroner officials; to let responding officers remove reflective vests so they're less of a target to a shooter; and to ensure more paramedics and trauma kits are available at large-scale events. ""We hope we never have to use these procedures that we are putting in place,"" said Lombardo, who characterized the report as ""our textbook on our response"" to the October 2017 massacre that killed 58 people at an open-air music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. He said it's now required reading for every Las Vegas police officer above the rank of sergeant. Lombardo noted that report authors Capt. Kelly McMahill and Detective Stephanie Ward studied other mass casualty incidents around the country, and said he hoped the Las Vegas report would help others prepare. The 158-page document acknowledged communications snags similar to those described in a separate August 2018         ""after-action report"" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Clark County Fire Department and Las Vegas police. That 61-page document said communications were overwhelmed by 911 calls, the number of victims, and by false reports of active shooters at other Las Vegas Strip hotel-casinos and nearby McCarran International Airport. Lombardo, the elected head of some 5,000 officers, said the new report focuses on internal department ""preparedness, response and recovery."" It comes almost a year after Las Vegas police closed the criminal investigation with a 187-page         criminal investigation report and nearly six months after the FBI issued a         three-page summary of its behavioral analysis of gunman Stephen Paddock. Paddock, 64, a former accountant and high-stakes video poker player with homes in Reno and the southern Nevada resort community of Mesquite, killed himself before officers reached his hotel room. The FBI said Paddock sought notoriety but that investigators found no ""single or clear motivating factor"" for the shooting. Investigators said Paddock planned meticulously and acted alone amassing an arsenal of assault-style weapons before opening fire from a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay resort into a crowd of 22,000 country music fans below. Authorities said more than 850 people were wounded or injured fleeing the gunfire. Lombardo noted the NFL's Oakland Raiders plan to move to Las Vegas and begin play in 2020 at a 65,000-seat Las Vegas Stadium being built just off the Las Vegas Strip. He said policing changes will apply to scheduled events drawing at least 15,000 people, and the report listed more than 17 such events: New Year's Eve fireworks on the Strip; conventions including the Consumer Electronics gadget show at the Las Vegas Convention Center; NASCAR races at Las Vegas Speedway; the Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon; uncounted hotel ""day club"" pool parties; and 41 NHL Vegas Golden Knights hockey home games per year at T-Mobile Arena. Lombardo noted that Las Vegas police already make presentations about what the department experienced in October 2017 to law enforcement officials in the U.S. and abroad. He said the department has already implemented 40% of the new report's recommendations. The release comes a week after Las Vegas police confirmed the firing in March of a veteran officer who froze in a hotel hallway one floor below while Paddock rained rapid gunfire into the concert crowd below. Lombardo said an unspecified number of other officers received lesser discipline for turning off or failing to activate body-worn video cameras, and one for accidentally firing a three-round burst of gunfire inside Paddock's suite. Police union executive director Steve Grammas said the dismissed officer, Cordell Hendrex, was one of two officers disciplined following departmental reviews of their actions during the shooting. The union is fighting to get Hendrex reinstated. Grammas said the only other officer he knew of who had been disciplined for actions during the shooting got his job back after an arbitrator reviewed his firing. Grammas declined to identify that officer, but said he had at least seven years on the job. The Las Vegas Police Protective Association official said the officer had been accused of making comments the department deemed unbecoming and of telling a woman to keep moving away from the scene of the shooting instead of investigating her complaint that she had been a victim of a crime. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-10 20:28:00, Vegas police release report on lessons from 2017 massacre,"police,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

It's the         second time since the killings that authorities have filed the misdemeanor charge against a city employee who allegedly became hostile toward supervisors. The Virginian-Pilot         reported Friday that 48-year-old human services worker Elizabeth Mann told managers that the slayings of 11 city employees and a building contractor could have been prevented. Mann also told supervisor Wendy Swallow that Swallow was the type of person who pushed the shooter to act, according to a partial recording of the June 3 meeting obtained by the newspaper. ""You are exactly the same type of supervisor that probably pushed this guy to do that,"" Mann told Swallow. On May 31, city engineer DeWayne Craddock opened fire in the municipal building where he worked. He had submitted his resignation the same day. The criminal complaint filed by police against Mann alleged that she used an aggressive tone and that Swallow feared for her safety. Swallow did not respond to the newspaper's requests for comment. Mann told the newspaper that she never cursed and was sitting throughout the encounter. ""I wasn't comparing myself to the shooter or justifying his actions at all,"" she said. City spokeswoman Julie Hill confirmed Mann's termination. She also confirmed that mental health services are being offered to employees to help them process the tragedy, but declined to comment further. Mann also faces protective orders from four supervisors, including Swallow. Hill said the supervisors filed the protective orders as private citizens and not in any official capacity. The three other supervisors did not respond to the newspaper's requests for comment. Earlier this month, The Virginian-Pilot         reported that another city employee was charged with disturbing the peace. Jonathan McIvor allegedly raised his voice and showed hostility when his supervisors asked why he wouldn't return to work in the building where the shooting occurred. Chief technology officer Darrell Riddick and acting operations manager Jamie Weaver alleged that McIvor began yelling, ""stood up aggressively"" and stormed out, saying he was going to call Human Resources. McIvor's attorney said in July that the criminal complaint does not accuse McIvor of making any threats: ""The man did nothing remotely close to criminal,"" Taite Westendorf said. Virginia Beach's city manager has said nobody would be forced to return to the building. But McIvor's information technology job apparently requires that he access server equipment in the basement. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-12 13:41:26, Virginia Beach city staffer fired for comments on shooting,murders and attempted murders,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

237,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/virginia-now-election-battleground-fight-gun-laws-64233840,"Virginia is now a key battleground in the long-running fight over gun laws VA governor summons lawmakers to special session on gun safety laws RICHMOND, Va. -- Deep-pocketed interest groups and activists on both sides of the long-running fight over gun laws are gearing up for a major clash in Virginia, now a key election battleground in the issue after Republicans on Tuesday adjourned a special         legislative session called by the governor to consider gun-control measures in the wake of a mass shooting. The state's off-year election will be closely watched because Virginia is the only state where control of the Legislature is up for grabs in 2019. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. GOP lawmakers abruptly ended the session after less than two hours and postponed any movement on gun laws until after the November election. Democrats and gun-control advocates vowed to force them from office. ""If these 'leaders' won't enact solutions that their own constituents are demanding, then we're going to fight tooth and nail for representatives who will,"" Kris Brown, president of the Brady gun-control group, said in a statement. Scores of gun-control advocates gathered Tuesday outside the Capitol, jeering at Republicans like House Speaker Kirk Cox. Meanwhile, hundreds of gun-rights supporters filed through a legislative office building to meet with lawmakers and in a show of force against stricter gun laws. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen called it ""deja vu in Virginia."" ""The gun control lobby says this every election cycle, and time and time again the hundreds of thousands of Virginians who support their fundamental right to self-defense go to the polls,"" she said. ""...This year the gun control lobby is screaming louder than ever in an effort to distract voters"" from         scandals involving top Democrats. Virginia is generally considered a gun-friendly state and is home to NRA's headquarters. The General Assembly has rejected numerous gun-control bills — including several proposed for the special session — year after year. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group made a splash at the tail end of the 2015 legislative elections by announcing it was spending $2.2 million in two open state Senate races to help the Democratic candidates. Republicans were shocked at the amount the billionaire's group was putting into Virginia, but the spending did not appear to make much difference. One Bloomberg-backed candidate won in a Northern Virginia district that has voted reliably Democratic by large margins in past elections while the other Democratic nominee lost in pivotal swing-seat in the Richmond area. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam summoned the Republican-led Legislature to the Capitol to address gun violence in the wake of the May 31 attack that killed a dozen people in Virginia Beach. He put forward a package of eight gun-control measures and called for ""votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers"" in response to the massacre. Republicans said it was Northam, still dealing with the fallout of a blackface scandal that almost drove him from office, who had acted improperly. They assigned the state's bipartisan crime commission to study policy proposals that might have prevented the shooting. ""Quite frankly, we need to take a little bit deeper look at these issues and actually do something rather than stage manage a vote in which we're just trying to embarrass each other,"" state Sen. Mark Obenshain said. Richard Keene, a 51-year-old gun owner from Chesterfield, said the session turned out to be ""a lot of hype for nothing."" ""I'm a little disappointed in everyone, actually,"" he said. ""I don't feel like the common, normal person, the normal American, is represented anymore. It's frustrating."" The special session got off to a chaotic start, with the Republican Senate majority leader averting a mutiny in the GOP caucus by publicly disavowing a gun-control bill he proposed only a day earlier. On Monday, the leader, Tommy Norment, shocked fellow Republicans by filing surprise legislation to broadly ban guns in any government building statewide. That prompted an immediate backlash in the GOP caucus, which controls the chamber by a slim 20-19 advantage. His top vote-counter, Sen. Bill Stanley, resigned as majority whip in protest. But the departure did not last long. Stanley said Norment apologized and asked Stanley to reconsider his resignation. The caucus quickly restored him to his position, and Norment announced that he would throw out his own bill. After the adjournment, Northam issued a statement saying it was ""shameful and disappointing"" that Republicans ""refuse to do their jobs and take immediate action to save lives."" The         Virginia Beach attack began when a civil engineer opened fire on his co-workers and others. Police said DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to kill 12 people at a municipal building.

Police believe Santino William Legan fired randomly Sunday,         killing three people, after cutting through a fence to get into the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Officers patrolling the popular event responded within a minute and killed him. Legan attended high school as a senior in Gilroy and was recently living in Nevada, where he purchased two guns — the         AK-47-style semi-automatic rifle he used in the attack and a shotgun that was found in his car near the festival, authorities said. A bag of ammunition was found in a creek near the fence, police said. ""We understand him to be kind of a loner,"" said Craig Fair, deputy special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco Division. ""People who act alone are exceptionally dangerous because they ... may not communicate their plans, intentions, mindset —  they may not impart that on other people."" Legan was living in an apartment in Walker Lake, a remote northern Nevada community, and had not had any run-ins with the law, officials said. ""He appears to have moved into Mineral County this spring and maintained a low profile,"" Sheriff Randy Adams said in a statement. Officials searched the apartment, seizing empty shotgun and rifle boxes, a gas mask, empty ammunition boxes, electronic devices, pamphlets on guns and a sack full of ammunition casings, prosecutors said. The FBI said they were looking through Legan's social media, emails and phone to find out who he was talking to and what he was expressing and thinking. Authorities don't believe he was targeting anyone based on any specific characteristics like race, but they're still trying to determine his ideology, Fair said. On the day of the attack, Legan urged his Instagram followers to read a 19th century book popular with white supremacists on extremist websites. He also complained about overcrowding towns and paving open space to make room for ""hordes"" of Latinos and Silicon Valley whites. Legan posted a photo from the festival minutes before opening fire, saying, ""Come get wasted on overpriced"" items. His since-deleted Instagram account says he is Italian and Iranian. While some killers in recent mass shootings have taken to posting writing or even broadcasting their attacks, there are cases where shooters leave very little public footprint and no motive is uncovered. That includes the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. No clear motive was found for why Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas in 2017, though the FBI said he sought notoriety. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee told reporters that authorities believe Legan acted alone but are still investigating. Investigators tracked Legan's movements around town before the shooting, and video shows him visiting stores alone, Smithee said. People had to         pass through metal detectors and have their bags searched at the long-running festival that draws more than 100,000 people with music, food booths and cooking classes to the city roughly 80 miles (176 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Police, paramedics and firefighters were stationed throughout the event, along with FBI agents who, in a common practice, had been asked to keep an eye on the event, authorities said. Legan bypassed those security measures by cutting through the fence. He killed 6-year-old Stephen Romero and 13-year-old Keyla Salazar of San Jose, along with Trevor Irby, 25, of Romulus, New York, who was at the event with his girlfriend. She wasn't hurt. A dozen other people were injured. At least seven victims remained hospitalized Tuesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. ——— Associated Press reporter Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-07-30 01:09:49, California town pledges to remain strong in wake of shooting,"crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

240,https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/editorials/mass-shooting-philadelphia-elmwood-gun-violence-gilroy-garlic-california-20190729.html,"Sunday night, many people across the nation were glued to the television or their phones, waiting for updates from the mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, a family-friendly food festival in Northern California. The horror started at 5:40 p.m. local time when a shooter with an assault-style rifle opened fire. At least three people were killed, including a 6-year-old. An additional 12 were injured. The tragedy drew sympathy from public figures including the president of the United States. Twenty minutes before the shooting in Gilroy started, a group of 20-year-olds were preparing to film a music video in the Elmwood neighborhood of Southwest Philadelphia. A man opened fire, killing a 21-year-old on the scene and injuring five more. It was the second mass shooting within a few blocks in Elmwood in six weeks. On Father’s Day, six people — including three teenagers — were shot at a graduation party in a nearby playground. Unlike the Gilroy shooting, there was zero national attention on Philadelphia’s. The president didn’t share his sympathy. CNN didn’t interrupt its scheduling. Elmwood wasn’t trending on Twitter. In a tweet on Monday morning,  state Attorney General Josh Shapiro called the shooting in Elmwood “everyday” gun violence and the shooting in Gilroy a “mass shooting.” The implication is that there is something normal or routine in 20-year-olds being shot while filming a music video — while a mass shooting is a completely unpredictable event that targets the truly innocent. Both the shooting in Elmwood and the shooting in Gilroy are “mass shootings” and neither should be thought of as an “everyday” occurrence. What we’ve come to view as the “classic” mass shooting — Sandy Hook, Columbine, the Batman screening, Las Vegas — impacts mainly white people. In contrast, the victims of urban violence are predominantly black men. While the former is a tragedy that deserves national attention, the latter has been relegated to a consequence of poverty that is prevalent in the black and brown communities of cities like Philadelphia. This dichotomy between mass shooting and urban violence is also revealed in President Donald Trump’s sympathetic response to the shooting in Gilroy while, on the same weekend, using urban violence in Baltimore as a tool against a political opponent. While the killing of black and brown men in cities is common — eight out of 10 homicide victims in Philadelphia in 2017 were nonwhite — accountability for these deaths is rare. Six of every 10 homicides investigated in Philadelphia in 2018 went unsolved. The state preempts the city from passing its own gun laws, but passes few of its own. That’s why City Council President Darrell L. Clarke’s proposal to ban firearms in city parks and recreation centers is unlikely to get traction in Harrisburg, where lawmakers are both unwilling to enact gun control or to allow cities to enact their own. Just like one shouldn’t be afraid to be shot at a food festival, black and brown people in Philadelphia shouldn’t be afraid to leave their homes. It’s time to call your legislators and remind them of the rights  stolen with every homicide: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.",2019-07-29 00:00:00,The mass shooting on Sunday night that you haven’t heard about | Editorial,blacks,106678,http://inquirer.com/
241,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/gilroy-garlic-festival-shooting.html?module=inline,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Jill Cowan [Sign-up for California Today, delivered to your inbox.] When the nation’s latest mass shooting shook another community, this time at a festival in Northern California on Sunday afternoon, the police were already on site. The police chief said Monday that officers staved off greater bloodshed by responding in under a minute, with one of them delivering a fatal shot to the gunman almost immediately. Here’s what we know and don’t know about the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival about 30 miles southeast of San Jose. We’ll continue to update this with new developments. transcript Witness: “What’s going on? What’s going on? Is there a fire? Oh, they shooting — oh, [expletive].” “My son was the first one to get notified where they were. And I went from hospital to hospital looking for him, but my son told me that he was over there and we came over. But when I got here, he was already dead.” “It appears as if though they had come into the festival via the creek, which borders a parking area. And they used some sort of a tool to cut through the fence to be able to gain access through the secure fence line.” “People were running out screaming and yelling. And I just told the family, ‘Let’s get in the car and go. We got to get out of here.’” • As the 41st annual Gilroy Garlic Festival wound down, gunshots rang out, sending festival goers fleeing. The police said three people were killed and 12 people were wounded. The gunman was also killed by the police, the authorities said. • Those killed by the gunman were a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s. The boy’s mother and his grandmother were also wounded by gunfire. [Read about the 6-year-old boy who was shot in the back.] • The gunman, identified by the authorities as Santino William Legan, 19, was carrying a semiautomatic rifle when he was shot and killed by the police. He appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the festival, the Gilroy Police Department said. • Chief Scot Smithee of the Gilroy Police Department said that the gunman had purchased the weapon legally in Nevada this month. • There would have been more bloodshed had three officers not responded in under a minute, with one of them fatally shooting the gunman, Chief Smithee said. Thousands of people were still at the festival. • The officers were wearing body cameras. • Witnesses described a chaotic scene. Video shows people scattering and trying to hide. One festival attendee, Olivia Chiu, said gunshots seemed to come from a central area near food and merchandise vendors. “Everyone was in a state of panic and trying to escape out of the festival to a safer area,” she said. • President Trump tweeted about the shooting, and other California officials weighed in. Senator Kamala Harris on Twitter described the shooting as “horrific,” adding that, “Our country has a gun violence epidemic that we cannot tolerate.” By The New York Times • The identities of the 13-year-old female victim and the man in his 20s who was killed. • It also was not clear whether a second person was involved, as witnesses indicated to the authorities on Sunday night. The authorities have heard contradictory accounts from eyewitnesses. • Any possible motivation for the attack. The Gilroy Garlic Festival was founded in 1979 by Rudolph J. Melone, who had moved to Gilroy several years earlier as president of Gavilan Community College. He started the event after reading about a similar celebration in France, according to The Times’s obituary for Mr. Melone. In the decades since, the festival has become an internationally known destination, drawing roughly 100,000 visitors each year. But it has not lost its importance for locals. “It’s like a second high school reunion for a lot of people,” said Emilia Chavez, 34, who grew up in Gilroy, a small city in the midst of verdant farmland southeast of San Jose. “It’s hard to go and not see someone you recognize.” She and her husband left this year’s event just a few hours before shots were fired, she said Sunday evening. The festival is also a crucial fund-raising opportunity for local charities, and a staple of local students’ community service résumés. While in middle school, Ms. Chavez said she sold lemonade to raise money for a scholarship federation. In high school, she sold Pepsi for the choir. Ms. Chavez said she never questioned the safety of the community’s biggest event. “The biggest problem had been just people sneaking in,” she said. The shooting in Gilroy took place days after four people were killed and two people were injured in a rampage through the San Fernando Valley that the authorities said started when a man first shot his parents and brother, then shot an acquaintance a few miles away before opening fire on a bus, The Los Angeles Times reported. In April, a shooting at a synagogue in Poway prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to push for new funding for security for religious organizations. At the time, Mark Baldassare, president and survey director for the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said that high-profile shootings have a kind of cumulative effect on public opinion. Even in California, which already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, there’s strong support for more controls. ————————————— California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

(Jake May | MLive.com) Ted Nugent has made more derogatory comments about his home state of Michigan. During an appearance on the ""The Laura Ingraham Podcast” on Wednesday, the outspoken Detroit rocker indirectly blasted leadership in Michigan and even went as far to include Michigan on a list of states that “don’t even qualify as America anymore.” ""You know Laura, Michigan was the arsenal of democracy,” Nugent said shortly after declaring himself “a Texan addicted to freedom,” “It was the epicenter of work ethic and pride of productivity when I was born in ’48. But unfortunately, it’s turned into a suburb of San Francisco now politically and it just breaks my heart."" Nugent, speaking from the “soul-cleansing swamps of (his) sacred Michigan,” compared his home state to California, Oregon, Washington, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts ""Politically, those states don't even qualify as America anymore,” he said. It's just heartbreaking.” Nugent has routinely been critical of Michigan since voters elected a slew of Democrats to key state offices in November 2018. Most notably Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel, Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. He took to Facebook to call Michigan a “California Sh**hole” shortly after that election. In February 2018, he received a wave of criticism for sharing an article that alleged David Hogg, an outspoken survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. was an actor coached to push for gun control. A noted supporter of President Donald Trump, Nugent played at several of his Michigan rallies in 2016. He said he plans to do more of the same during the upcoming presidential election. “I’m fighting to keep Michigan and I think we will persevere,” he said. “We have to keep Michigan in 2020,” Ingraham agreed.

There were at least four armed churchgoers who quickly responded to the shooting, preventing what could have become a mass shooting from occurring. But, if it were up to Joe Biden, those worshippers would have been sitting ducks. When Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law allowing lawful gun owners to carry guns into places of worship, Biden slammed Abbott and the law. “It’s just absolutely irrational,” Biden said. “It’s totally irrational.” In September, Democrat Joe Biden attacked TX Gov Greg Abbott for signing a law that let lawful gun owners carry guns into places of worship Biden: ""it's just absolutely irrational. It's totally irrational"" Today, a good guy with a gun saved countless lives inside a Texas church pic.twitter.com/qeK31Bvm84 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) December 29, 2019  Biden also said at the time that “magazines that can hold multiple bullets” should be banned, which just goes to show you how little he understands guns because that’s what magazines do—hold “multiple bullets.” Nevertheless, Biden promised he would not compromise with Republicans on the issue. Governor Abbott signed the law allowing lawful gun owners to carry in places of worship back in September, shortly after a mass shooting in the state. According to CNN, the new laws signed by Governor Abbott, in addition to allowing lawful gun owners to carry in places of worship, also allows them to properly store firearms and ammunition in their cars on school property and allows school districts to have more school marshals. It also allows some foster homes to have firearms, bans owners of rental properties from prohibiting renters from having firearms, and allows for open carry during a disaster. The law went into effect on the first of September. It’s already saved lives. And the Democratic “frontrunner,” Joe Biden, blasted that law.

244,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1619921,"A new study confirms what anyone who pays attention to domestic violence already knows: The presence of a gun raises the chance of a fatality, and the victim is most likely to be a woman. As a tweet from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America puts it, “Gun violence IS a woman’s issue.” The study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, compared state-by-state rates of gun ownership with rates of gun homicide from 1990 through 2016. The study did not find much correlation between gun ownership rates and overall gun homicides. But when it comes to domestic violence, the study’s authors found that states with the highest gun ownership rates had a nearly 65 percent higher rate of firearm homicide compared to states with lower gun ownership rates. What is needed to lower that rate, they say, are stronger state laws. “Overall, these findings support the need for state firearm legislation directed toward protecting victims of domestic violence, as access to firearms uniquely increases the likelihood of homicide among this population,” the authors say in their conclusion. A New York Times story about the study pointed out that the results are not surprising. It quotes Aaron Kivisto, an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Indianapolis and the study’s lead author. The study reaffirms a well-known connection between access to guns and abusive relationships turning deadly, at a time when intimate partner homicides are on the rise. Research has shown that women killed by their partners are more likely to be murdered with a firearm than by all other means combined, and the presence of a gun in domestic violence situations can increase the risk of homicide for women by as much as 500 percent, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Both men and women were at increased risk for domestic homicide when firearm ownership increased, the study found. “But the important caveat to that is, whereas men are victims in about three out of four typical homicides that occur, it fully reverses when we are talking about intimate partner homicide,” Dr. Kivisto said. “Women are three in four victims of intimate partner homicide.” […] “It is women, in particular, who are bearing the burden of this increased gun ownership,” he said. What laws can curb such violence against domestic partners? That is, besides common-sense gun laws such as universal background checks, which are supported by more than 90 percent of Americans? The study points out that some federal laws are aimed at reducing domestic violence gun deaths. Unfortunately, these laws are not always enforced, so some states have countered with their own statutes. The rate of estimated gun ownership varies widely, ranging from about 10 percent in Hawaii to 69 percent in Wyoming, with an average ownership rate of 39 percent, according to the study. Higher rates are found in Southern and Western states, and lower rates of gun ownership are found in the Northeast. The number of murders committed by intimate partners is on the rise nationally. From 2010 to 2017, gun-related domestic killings increased by 26 percent, and the majority of victims are women. The study’s authors suggest that more state laws could help lower the number of those deaths by making it harder for violent partners to obtain and keep guns. “Studies into these policies suggest that states with laws that prohibit individuals at high risk of intimate partner violence from possessing firearms and require them to relinquish any firearms they currently own have a lower incidence of domestic firearm homicide,” the study’s conclusion says. Here are ways that some laws help—and how they fall short. Violence Against Women Act. A federal law that addresses such domestic violence is the Violence Against Women Act, but it is currently in limbo until the Senate acts on reauthorization (if ever). The act was first passed in 1994 as part of the original crime bill that year. It has been reauthorized three times: in 2000, 2005, and in 2013 (delayed because some conservatives objected to provisions extending provisions to same-sex couples and to undocumented immigrants). The many provisions of the law established and funded broad community responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The act helped to protect victims of sexual and domestic violence, adding stricter provisions regarding domestic abusers and gun ownership. It prohibited gun possession by people subject to permanent restraining orders against committing violence against intimate partners. The law expired during the government shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019. It was temporarily reinstated by a short-term spending bill but expired again in February 2019. The House passed a reauthorization bill in April but the Senate has refused to take up the legislation. The supposed reason for the Republicans’ refusal is a new provision protecting transgender people. Another new provision would close the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” meaning a violent partner who was not married to or living with the victim would be subject to the law. The restraining order provision was expanded so that the law would bar not only those under a restraining order but also those convicted of abusing, assaulting, or stalking a domestic partner from buying guns. The Center for American Progress points out the need for continued enhancement of the Violence Against Women Act: Since its original passage as part of the 1994 crime bill, VAWA has established a vitally important and previously nonexistent infrastructure that responds to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. Now is not the time to shy away from the serious work of improving the federal government’s responses to gender-based violence. … Congress can and must continue to push for comprehensive approaches to end violence against women. Gun Control Act of 1968. Another federal law cited in the study is the Gun Control Act of 1968, passed after the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy. It primarily focuses on regulating interstate commerce in guns. It is supposed to prohibit interstate gun sales except by licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers, but it’s too easy for private sellers and buyers at gun shows to skirt the law. The Gun Control Act prohibits all convicted felons (including those convicted of felony domestic violence against a partner), drug users, and the mentally ill from buying guns, but the study points out that it, too, is poorly enforced. Red-flag laws. Several states are trying to lower the threat of violence by passing so-called “red-flag” laws. A total of 15 states have passed some version of a red-flag law, which permits police or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of guns from someone who may present a danger to others or themselves. Many of those laws were passed after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, which killed 17 people. Another 21 states have passed some steps toward such a law. Besides lowering the threat of domestic gun violence, the laws also have been successful in lowering suicide rates, as many of those identified as being potentially dangerous intended harm to themselves. We already know that the majority of mass shooters also have a history of domestic violence, according to research by Everytown for Gun Safety. More than half of all mass shootings in the United States are related to domestic or family violence. Of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history, nine were committed by domestic abusers. And the act of mass shooting is not the first instance of domestic violence by these perpetrators. Everytown for Gun Safety calls the combination of guns and violence against women “America’s Uniquely Lethal Domestic Violence Problem,” as women in the U.S. are 25 times more likely to be shot and killed as are women in other high-income countries. Common-sense gun safety laws in this country, as well as the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, could save a lot of lives.

Nadler and Trump played long before Mueller even sat down, and Donald doesn’t play chess. Jerry taught Donald how to lose, a talent he has perfected to this day. (BTW, Mohammed bin Salman also has a super-cool city he wants to build.) Robert Mueller said he didn’t charge Trump because of the OLC opinion, then walked that back. Ted Lieu believes he did that to avoid calling Donald Trump a felon. Roy Moore’s lawyer has his own, probably not pedophiliac, sex scandal. Florida Senator Lauren Book received phone calls saying ‘Little girl you don’t know what you’re getting into,’ while checking into Jeffrey Epstein’s work release scandal.

Paul Mitchell announced that he would not seek a third term in Michigan's 10th Congressional District, a safely red seat that includes northern Macomb County and the ""Thumb"" region in the eastern part of the state. Mitchell declared that he was leaving after such a short tenure because he felt frustrated to be in a Congress where ""rhetoric overwhelms policy, and politics consumes much of the oxygen in this city."" Mitchell, who had served as CEO of Ross Education before he began his political career, had spent millions of his own money on two campaigns to reach the institution that he so quickly soured on. In 2014, Mitchell ran for the open 4th District in the center of the state and poured $3.56 million of his own money into his bid, but he lost to now-Rep. John Moolenaar 52-36. Mitchell got another shot two years later when GOP Rep. Candice Miller retired from the 10th District, a seat that does not border the 4th. Mitchell threw down another $3.56 million of his own funds (perhaps that's his lucky number), but this time, he won his primary 38-28. However, it sounds like Mitchell may be rethinking those two considerable investments. The congressman told Politico on Wednesday, ""You look at the rhetoric and vitriol, it overwhelms policy, politics becomes the norm,"" adding, ""Everything's about politics. Everything's about an election. And at some point of time, that's not why I came here."" Mitchell also took issue with how little time he got to spend with his family, saying that he'd advise anyone interested in running to succeed him, ""This becomes your life, your entire life, whether you want it to or not. It will consume every waking minute you've got if you let it."" In a separate interview with the Detroit News, Mitchell also expressed frustration with Donald Trump and his racist tweet against four women of color in the Democratic House caucus. Mitchell joined almost the entire House GOP in voting against a resolution condemning Trump, but he says that the “send her back” chant that broke out at a Trump rally the next day infuriated him. The congressman said, “My youngest son is adopted from Russia, and God forbid anybody say he's not American. He'd be picking himself up off the ground.” The GOP should have no trouble holding this seat without Mitchell. Donald Trump carried the 10th District 64-32, which was his best showing in any of Michigan's 14 congressional districts. This seat was also reliably red turf during last year's midterm elections: According to Bloomberg's Greg Giroux, it was again Team Red's best district in both the gubernatorial and Senate races. Politicos immediately began to wonder if Miller, who held this seat from 2003 until 2017, would run to reclaim it. Miller’s spokesperson was asked about her plans and replied that she “will not be commenting further at this time.” Miller, who was elected to a seat on the Macomb County Public Works Commission in 2016, also put out a statement that didn’t directly address the possibility that she could return to Congress, but instead heaped scorn on her successor. Miller wrote, “I would have appreciated seeing some recognition of the great people of the 10th District — good, decent, hardworking people who sent him to Washington DC on their behalf,” and added, “Reading his rant in Politico is not the best way to find out your Member of Congress is not seeking re-election.” There are a number of other Republicans who could run. Roll Call and the Detroit News name-drop state Sens. Kevin Daley, Dan Lauwers, Pete Lucido, and Mike MacDonald; former state Sen. and 2016 primary runner-up Phil Pavlov; state Rep. Shane Hernandez; former state Rep. Pete Lund, who works as state director for the Koch’s Americans for Prosperity group; and retired Air Force Brig. Gen. John Slocum. Roll Call suggested that Lucido would be the favorite if Miller decided to stay out, and GOP consultant Steve Mitchell says that he has the ability to self-fund. ● KS-Sen: State Senate President Susan Wagle announced Wednesday that she would join the GOP primary for this open seat. Wagle is the only woman currently seeking the Republican nod, and she declared at her kickoff, ""The U.S. Senate needs a woman in cowboy boots."" The Kansas City Star also writes that she's close to the Wichita business community, including megadonor Charles Koch, so it sounds like she'll have some important fundraising connections. Wagle was first elected to represent Wichita in the state House in 1990, and she earned a promotion to the upper chamber in 2000. Wagle ran statewide in 2006 as gubernatorial nominee Jim Barnett's running mate, but the GOP ticket was crushed by Democratic incumbent Kathleen Sebelius. The defeat didn't do much to slow Wagle's rise, though. In 2012, she was part of a successful effort to replace moderate Republican state senators with conservatives, and she soon became the first woman to lead the chamber. Wagle was an ally of the Sam Brownback during most of his governorship, and she supported his disastrous tax cuts. While the two temporarily had a falling out over the state of Kansas' economy in late 2016, she opposed the legislature's successful drive to repeal his tax breaks the following year. Wagle has clashed repeatedly with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly over the last six months, and the Senate leader scored a high-profile victory in the spring by blocking Kelly's proposed Medicaid expansion. Wagle's fights with the state's most high-profile Democrat might help her stand out in a primary, though she hasn't always won. For example, the governor successfully vetoed two bills passed by the GOP legislature that would have cut taxes again, which Kelly warned would bring the state back to the bad old days of the Brownback administration. Wagle joins 2018 gubernatorial nominee Kris Kobach, state Treasurer Jake LaTurner, and Kansas Turnpike Authority chair Dave Lindstrom in the GOP primary. A number of other contenders are still talking about running, while everyone is waiting to see what U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will do. Wagle said this week that she'd recently spoken to Pompeo about this contest, but she didn't reveal what he'd said or if she'd defer to him. ● MS-Gov: Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged for the first time this week that there is a chance that he could fail to win a majority of the vote in the Aug. 6 GOP primary and would have to go through a runoff three weeks later. Reeves said, ""Look, there are three people in the Republican primary,"" and added, ""It's hard to get to 50 when there are three people. That is our goal."" We've only seen one poll of this year's GOP primary, and it was an early June survey from the Republican firm Impact Management Group. That poll, which was conducted for the conservative Mississippi blog Y'All Politics, showed Reeves with a huge 50-19 lead over former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr., while state Rep. Robert Foster took 9%. Those numbers gave Reeves just about what he would need to win in round one no matter how the undecideds break, but it's very possible he thinks things are more volatile. Of course, Reeves may just be seeking to warn his supporters against complacency or just be preparing to spin any showing in two weeks as a big win. Mississippi Today notes that there hasn't been a GOP gubernatorial runoff since 1991, and that race did not go well for the frontrunner. Back then Kirk Fordice narrowly finished ahead of state Auditor Pete Johnson, who was considered the favorite, in the first round before decisively beating him in the runoff and then prevailing in the general election. ● FL-26: On Wednesday, former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo told Politico that he would not seek a rematch against freshman Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida's 26th District, though he reiterated that there was a ""strong possibility"" that he would run for mayor of Miami-Dade County in 2020. Mucarsel-Powell beat Curbelo by a narrow 51-49 margin in a very expensive race last year, so his decision will come as a big relief to Team Blue. Restaurateur Irina Vilariño remains the only notable Republican in the race, but as we've written before, she's far from a good fit for a seat that Hillary Clinton carried 57-41. In May, Talking Points Memo reported that Vilariño has an ugly history of sharing far-right conspiracy theories, including a video that was faked to make Barack Obama sound like he was saying, ""It's true, I'm not an American. I wasn't born in Hawaii, I wasn't born in the United States of America. I come from Kenya."" Vilariño showed absolutely no contrition after these tweets became public, telling TPM, ""I don't think any of these tweets warrant an apology, and I am not going to fearfully pander every time someone thinks they might be offended."" Even the disreputable GOP pollster McLaughlin & Associates found Vilariño doing poorly this month. The survey found Curbelo leading Debbie Mucarsel-Powell 45-42 in a hypothetical general election, but the incumbent bested Vilariño 45-33. McLaughlin has done work for Curbelo in the past, but it's not clear who commissioned this survey. We haven't heard any other Republicans mentioned as possible candidates here, though other local politicians may take a look at this race now that Curbelo has made his decision. Whoever runs will need access to a lot of money, though. Mucarsel-Powell raised $605,000 during the second quarter, and she had $934,000 in the bank at the end of June. Vilariño, by contrast, took in $232,000 during her opening quarter and self-funded another $40,000, and she had $256,000 on-hand. ● GA-06: This week, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that construction company owner Marjorie Greene, who has self-funded $500,000 so far for her bid for Congress, has a history of spreading far-right conspiracy theories about the 2017 Las Vegas massacre. Greene is one of several GOP candidates challenging freshman Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, whose teenage son was murdered by a gunman in 2012, in Georgia's 6th District. In early October of that year, four days after a lone terrorist named Stephen Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert in the deadliest mass-shooting in American history, Greene put out a video where she wondered if the attack was part of a government plot to try to pass anti-gun laws. Greene asked, ""Is that why the country music festival was targeted—because those would be the people that we would relate to? Are they trying to terrorize our mindset and change our minds on the Second Amendment?"" She continued by saying she didn't believe Paddock acted alone and told her audience, ""I know most of you don't, either."" Greene kept this up five months later when she shared a post on her Facebook page that accused the FBI of taking part in a cover-up and added, ""Every American knows we have been lied to."" Greene told the AJC this month that she now accepts the official version of events and is satisfied that Paddock acted alone, and she insists she just ""had questions and demanded answers."" However, as of Wednesday evening, Greene's old Facebook post is still up on what is now her own campaign's fan page. ● MN-03: Healthcare executive Kendall Qualls set up a fundraising committee on Tuesday for a potential GOP bid against freshman Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips, and Minnesota Morning Take writes that he's expected to announce Friday. NRCC chair Tom Emmer, who represents a nearby seat, recently touted Qualls, but other members of the party don't sound so high on him. Morning Take writes, ""Multiple Republican sources say that they had only met Qualls once and that he seemed focused on service but naïve about the task of giving Phillips a tough race."" This suburban Twin Cities seat backed Hillary Clinton 51-41, and Phillips unseated five-term incumbent Erik Paulson 56-44 last year. ● NC-09: Advertising Analytics tells Politico that Republican Dan Bishop is launching a $185,000 cable TV ad campaign ahead of the Sept. 10 special election, while his allies at the Club for Growth are spending another $100,000. We do not have copies of either ad. ● NY-27: This week, conservative radio host and Army veteran David Bellavia spoke about his interest in this race for the first time since he received the Medal of Honor from Donald Trump, and he doesn't sound inclined to challenge indicted Rep. Chris Collins in the GOP primary. Bellavia didn't rule anything out, saying, ""Nothing is going to sway me to run or not run,"" and that he was focusing on his ongoing duties in the military. However, he said of running for office after receiving the armed forces' highest award, ""The last thing I'm thinking about right now is cashing this in ... And this feels like it would be cashing it in."" That's a very different tone from May when Bellavia declared that he was ""[n]ot afraid of primaries,"" including contests against Collins. Bellavia ran for this seat once before but lost the 2012 primary to Collins by a 60-40 margin. However, while Bellavia's first campaign didn't attract much attention, his profile has dramatically increased in the weeks since he became the first living American to receive the Medal of Honor for service in Iraq. The Buffalo News recently reported that most local politicos think that he can hold off on entering the race until as late as the end of the year, and that he'd immediately be the frontrunner. ● PA-10: State Auditor Eugene DePasquale has received an endorsement from 2018 Democratic nominee George Scott, who came very close to beating GOP Rep. Scott Perry last year. DePasquale is the clear frontrunner in next year's Democratic primary, but he doesn't have the contest to himself. Attorney Tom Brier raised just over $100,000 during the second quarter, and he had $164,000 in the bank. ● TN-09: Former Shelby County Democratic Party Chair Corey Strong formed a fundraising committee this week for a potential primary bid against Rep. Steve Cohen, though he says he has not yet made a decision. Cohen, who is white, first won a crowded 2006 primary to represent this predominantly black and safely Democratic Memphis seat. During his first two re-election campaigns he faced opponents who argued that this district needed a black representative, and Cohen's 2008 foe even employed anti-Semitic language against the Jewish incumbent. Cohen won those two races with close to 80% of the vote, though, and his next batch of primaries were much more low-key affairs. The closest Cohen has ever come to losing re-election was in 2014, when he prevailed 66-33, but he had no trouble winning during the next two cycles. Strong, who is a Navy veteran, took over as chair of the Shelby County Democratic Party in 2017, a year after the state party decertified them after years of infighting. The reformed party had a considerably better 2018, though, and they won control of the county mayor's office and many other important posts in the August local elections. During that campaign Strong, who is black, attracted some attention when he posted on Facebook that local GOP candidates were ""demonstrably racist, homophobic, unethical and unqualified,"" and he also accused local election officials of trying to ""disenfranchise"" inner-city voters by opening early voting sites days late. Local GOP candidates tried to make Strong's comments an issue, but he didn't back down and the state Democratic Party stood by him. Strong left his party post this year to take a job at Shelby County Schools, but he said he'd remain active in politics. ● VA State House: On Tuesday, days after Virginia Del. Nick Freitas abandoned his bid for re-election because he hadn’t properly filed candidacy papers, a committee of local GOP leaders in the state’s 30th District voted to award the Republican nomination to … Nick Freitas. The matter is hardly settled, though: An unfavorable ruling by the State Board of Elections or the courts could still force the GOP to run a write-in campaign to avoid forfeiting this reliably red seat at the same time that they’re defending their narrow 51-49 majority in the state House. The Richmond Times-Dispatch’s Graham Moomaw reports that Republican officials are hoping to take advantage of a provision in state law that allows political parties to replace a nominee who dies or drops out. The law explicitly forbids parties from renominating someone who was “disqualified for failing to meet the filing requirements,” but Freitas withdrew on Thursday—a day ahead of a planned meeting of the elections board where he could have been disqualified. Board officials met on Friday as planned, but they made no announcement about what course of action they’d decided on, if any. However, it remains to be seen if the GOP’s maneuver will work. Moomaw writes, “If the case goes to court, the outcome could hinge on whether Freitas was or wasn’t a party nominee before he withdrew on Thursday.” The elections board never certified Freitas as the nominee, but Republican officials are arguing that he became the party’s official pick in March when no one else filed to take him on in the primary. Whichever way the board proceeds, there’s very good chance this dispute will wind up before a judge. The board will need to decide whether or not to accept Freitas as the new GOP nominee; if it doesn’t, Freitas could sue. However, if board members rule in the incumbent’s favor, Democratic nominee Ann Ridgeway could go to court to try to remove him from the ballot. Freitas is indeed aware that he may not ultimately appear on the ballot. The delegate told conservative radio host John Fredericks on Wednesday that, if he gets bounced, he’ll consider running a write-in campaign to keep his seat. Freitas did suggest he could step aside if the board determines that a different Republican can appear in his stead, but he didn’t commit to anything. Freitas’ campaign manager estimated that a write-in campaign could cost up to $150,000 but said that the campaign has $500,000 in the bank. This seat backed Donald Trump 60-36 and supported 2017 GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie 61-38, so a well-financed write-in campaign would have a good chance of success. Still, Democrats will count it a victory if the GOP has to divert resources from more competitive seats to hold this district, which Republicans shouldn’t have had to devote even a single thought to.

The Democratic debates have crystallized how far Democrats have moved to the left on all sorts of issues over the past few years. Candidates for the presidency advocated for single-payer health care, a Green New Deal, free college, 70 percent taxes on the ultrawealthy, decriminalizing crossing the border without papers, and upholding “reproductive justice.” But there’s one issue, even as it’s gotten more attention, where major Democratic politicians haven’t moved much: guns. At the debates, most candidates raised the same ideas they’ve had for decades: universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and keeping guns away from dangerous people. Only a few were active in calls to push further, such as Cory Booker’s support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun — which some candidates have joined in — and Beto O’Rourke’s promise that “hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” If you want to make a serious dent in gun violence in the US, this should worry you. Just imagine a world where Democrats get everything leading candidates typically say they want on guns. Congress passes and President Elizabeth Warren signs a comprehensive bill that includes universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a red-flag law that lets law enforcement take away guns from dangerous people. It would be, to be sure, a massive political and policy victory — the culmination of decades of work by gun control advocates. The media would characterize it as a sea change in gun politics. The National Rifle Association and its Republican allies would be livid. Yet it almost certainly would not be enough. We would still likely see mass shootings, like the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, on a regular basis, in addition to the incidents of suicides, urban violence, and domestic abuse that are tragically even more common. That’s because America would still have the weakest gun laws among developed nations, and it would still have the most firearms out of any country in the world — and the research has consistently found that places with more guns have more gun deaths. The problem is dire: The US, with its enormous civilian-owned arsenal of guns, leads the developed world in gun violence. A 2018 study in JAMA found that the US’s civilian gun death rate is nearly four times that of Switzerland, five times that of Canada, 35 times that of the United Kingdom, and 53 times that of Japan. There are, on average, more than 100 gun deaths in the US per day. The typical proposals on guns pick at this problem but come nowhere close to solving it. Background checks can screen out some people from getting a gun, but recent studies suggest even universal background checks, on their own, don’t have a big impact on gun deaths. An assault weapons ban could make some mass shootings less deadly but wouldn’t address the 70-plus percent of firearm homicides that involve a handgun. A red flag law could help law enforcement take guns away from dangerous people but, by definition, these laws only work after red flags arise, which is often too late. Gun control policies that don’t confront the core issue — that America simply has too many guns — are doomed to merely nibble around the edges. Everywhere in the world, people get into arguments. Every country has residents who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness. Every country has bigots and extremists. But here, it’s uniquely easy for a person to obtain a gun, letting otherwise tense but nonlethal conflicts escalate into deadly violence. To change the status quo, Democrats should go big. They need to focus on the abundance of guns in the US and develop a suite of policies that directly tackle that issue, from licensing to confiscation to more aggressive bans of certain kinds of firearms (including, perhaps, all semiautomatic weapons or at least some types of handguns). I am not naive. I don’t think that this would lead to sweeping Australian- or UK-style gun control legislation passing in 2021. But this broader conversation has to start somewhere. The time is now. The NRA is in chaos, as its leadership is caught in a civil war. The Parkland, Florida, activists have forced guns into the spotlight. Recent polls found Democratic voters put gun violence and policy at the top or near the top of issues they want to hear about in the debates. Just like Bernie Sanders helped launch discussions about single-payer health care and free college in 2016, a push in 2020 could help get the party to where it needs to be on this issue if it really wants to address America’s gun problem. The gun problem in the United States is twofold. First, the US makes it incredibly easy for people to get guns. Other developed nations at least require one or more background checks but usually much more rigorous hurdles. In the US, even a background check isn’t an absolute requirement; the current federal law is riddled with loopholes and kneecapped by poor enforcement. Second, America has far more guns than any other country. The number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was estimated for 2017 at 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, ranked second, with 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Congress has tried to address the first problem. In 1993, it enacted federal background checks. A year later, it passed a 10-year assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. In the quarter-century since, elected Democrats have continued advocating for expanded background checks and a renewed assault weapons ban. But a growing body of research has shown that these measures might not be enough — that the guns are the problem. A breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found the US doesn’t actually have more crime than other developed nations, but instead has more lethal crime — and access to guns is one reason why. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery,” they wrote, “make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” Research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center backs this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths — not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings. Stronger gun laws can help. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. But the types of gun control laws matter. To that end, several studies from researchers at UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins have called into question whether universal background checks, compared to non-universal background checks, reduce gun deaths at all. Studies suggest the original assault weapons ban also had limited to no impact, in large part because the great majority of gun violence is carried out with handguns. The problem is these approaches are just too narrow, failing to seriously address the core problem that the US simply has too many guns. Universal background checks only target a small number of people who have clear, bad histories, and an assault weapons ban targets a kind of weapon used in a small minority of shootings. To the extent that either approach works to reduce the number of gun owners and firearms, it would take generations to see results. A better, more immediate goal, then, is to make it harder for literally anyone to buy a firearm and reduce the number of guns not just over time but right now. That’s the only reliable way to reduce incidents of gun violence through gun control quickly. But gun policy has been an outlier in Democratic politicians’ shift leftward. There has been some movement at the margins — demonstrated by some candidates’ support for licensing and even fewer’s call for confiscating assault weapons, as well as centrist Democrats and those representing rural areas, including Bernie Sanders, shifting somewhat on this issue. But by and large, the party has remained in the same place it was in 25 years ago, focused on background checks and, to a lesser extent, an assault weapons ban. There are some good reasons for that. Democratic perennials like universal background checks, targeting firearm prohibitions at people deemed dangerous, and even an assault weapons ban all poll fairly well, including among Republicans, based on Pew surveys. Elected Democrats also a fear a political backlash if they push for more stringent measures. After the 1994 midterm elections, many Democrats blamed historic losses in the House and Senate on their approval of stricter gun laws. Then there’s what experts call the “intensity gap.” In short, defenders of gun rights are, in general, more motivated than proponents of gun control. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, this helps explain why popular support for stricter gun laws doesn’t lead to action in Congress: “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, he suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.” All of this plays into the broader questions about whether certain gun policies could get through Congress or the Supreme Court. Until the public buys into these policies, chances are other institutions won’t either. So Democrats have by and large played it safe. With Democratic voters now more liberal in general and paying more attention to gun violence as mass shootings regularly make the news and student activists march and protest for action, there’s less need to play it safe. Democrats, both elites and supporters, have a clear opportunity here to show that there are bolder, evidence-based policy ideas to seriously tackle the US’s gun problem. They can start that push with 2020. Igor Volsky, the executive director of the advocacy group Guns Down America, pointed to the fight for marriage equality in his recent book, Guns Down: How to Defeat the NRA and Build a Safer Future With Fewer Guns, as one example of how this fight could go. According to Volsky, the marriage equality movement didn’t ever give up on incremental gains, but it was always focused on its ultimate goal. So it was okay when some Democrats, for example, accepted “civil unions” over marriage as a step forward in the early 2000s, but the movement continued to push for marriage equality at the same time. By focusing on this goal and deploying different strategies fixated on the one acceptable outcome for the movement, it slowly built a shift in public opinion, even if the gains seemed small here and there. By focusing on a goal of fewer guns, Volsky wrote, activists could push the country to the left on guns. That would involve accepting the incremental wins — including universal background checks and an assault weapons ban — but also staying focused on the goal of reducing the number of guns in the US overall. And the 2020 campaign, he argued, is a good time to start that push. “You have progressives who are running for president talking about single-payer, talking about the Green New Deal, talking about breaking up large tech companies, talking about a super surcharge on multi-multimillionaires,” Volsky told me. “On an issue that is so important to so many Americans — the issue of guns — it’s unconscionable to me that the solutions we’re hearing from the folks running for president are focused on incremental reforms that they’ve been selling for the last 20 years.” Another potential parallel comes through what Matt Yglesias has described for Vox as the “Great Awokening.” Since 2014, he wrote, “white liberals have moved so far to the left on questions of race and racism that they are now, on these issues, to the left of even the typical black voter.” That happened in part because of the Black Lives Matter movement that took off after the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri, protests, but also because “Democratic elites were beginning to signal to the rank and file that they should take systemic racism concerns more seriously” — such as when President Barack Obama remarked that “if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon [Martin].” Similarly, American progressives are increasingly fed up with mass shooting after mass shooting — hence the rise of the March for Our Lives movement last year. If Democratic elites tap into that anger and signal that bolder gun policies are necessary, much of the public could follow along. History shows that on gun policy, it’s possible to move positions that once seemed radical into the mainstream. Consider just how much the National Rifle Association has changed the conversation about guns in just a few decades: After the NRA went through an internal revolt in the late 1970s, the group began to push against all restrictions on firearms — under the logic that giving even a little on this issue could eventually lead to a sweeping confiscation of everyone’s guns. The organization hammered that message to the public, politicians, legal scholars, and everyone else it could reach. One clear effect the NRA had was changing the way some politicians and legal experts looked at the Second Amendment. For most of US history, the amendment was viewed by courts and legal experts as only protecting a collective right to own guns, insofar as able-bodied men needed the weapons to help defend their state and country through, for example, a militia. Then the NRA began pushing a different interpretation that the Second Amendment actually protected an individual right — even getting scholars to publish work in law journals making the case. Carl T. Bogus, a researcher at the Roger Williams University School of Law, noted in a 2000 law review article that the number of law review articles endorsing an individual rights view was for most of US history dwarfed by the number backing a collective rights framework — until the 1990s, when the great majority (58 of 87 relevant articles) supported an individual rights interpretation. Republican elites, too, got in on the action. In 1982, the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), issued a report, “The Right to Keep and Bear Arms.” The report from the Republican-majority subcommittee argued, “What the Subcommittee on the Constitution uncovered was clear — and long lost — proof that the second amendment to our Constitution was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep and carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his family, and his freedoms.” The results can be seen in the Supreme Court. In 1939’s United States v. Miller, Justice James McReynolds ruled that Congress can ban sawed-off shotguns because that weapon has no “reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.” In 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, Justice Antonin Scalia ruled, to the contrary, that “the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.” There was also an accompanying shift in public opinion. In 1959, when Gallup asked if the law should ban handguns except for the police and other authorized persons, 60 percent of Americans said yes. By 1980, that dropped to 38 percent. As of the latest survey, in 2018, it was 28 percent. The NRA and Republicans helped shift public opinion and even the Supreme Court over decades. A similar political movement could reverse that. Like the NRA’s efforts, a new movement could require a generations-long project. That should only make the issue more urgent, though — because the longer America waits, the longer it will be before real measures are in to properly reduce gun violence. It’s not that there’s a lack of ideas to confront gun violence. With the right goal — reducing the number of guns in the US — and a serious commitment to it, there are plenty of evidence-based policies, tried in cities, states, and other countries, that could work. One way to start addressing the issue would be requiring a license to buy and own a gun. On its face, this might seem like an extension of the background check model, since the idea is still to filter between qualified and unqualified people. But a licensing process can go way further: While a background check is more often than not quick and hassle-free, gun licensing in, for example, Massachusetts is a weeks- or months-long process that requires submitting a photograph and fingerprints, passing a training course, and going through one or more interviews, all involving law enforcement. That adds significant barriers for even a would-be gun owner who has no ill intent or bad history. “The end impact is you decrease gun ownership overall,” Cassandra Crifasi, a researcher (and gun owner) at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, previously told me, discussing Massachusetts’s laws. “Lots of folks think, ‘Well, it’s probably not worth going through all these hoops to buy firearms, so I’m not going to buy one.’ And then you have fewer firearms around, and less exposure.” Licensing works. It’s one reason, experts say, Massachusetts has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the US. A Johns Hopkins study on several gun control approaches, including universal background checks, found that licensing systems were the one policy associated with fewer firearm homicides. Other studies have linked licensing to significantly fewer gun homicides and suicides in Connecticut and Missouri. This, however, could only be a start — the kind of thing that ensures fewer people get guns now and in the future. But in a country that already has so many firearms, something also needs to be done to take out a lot of guns more quickly. That could require rethinking the Second Amendment, whether by appointing judges who interpret it differently in a reverse version of the NRA’s campaign to portray gun ownership as an individual right. It might even mean beginning an effort to repeal it — a project that could admittedly take decades but has gotten less serious consideration and support than packing the Supreme Court or even abolishing the Senate. Significant change could involve imposing bigger hurdles to owning a gun: requiring that people provide a stronger justification, besides self-defense or recreation, to get a license. It could mean banning more types of guns — perhaps all semiautomatic weapons or all handguns — and coupling that with an Australian-style mandatory buyback program, which the research supports. If the key difference between America and other countries is how many more guns the US has, then something has to be done to quickly reduce the number of firearms here. Here, an assault weapons ban is simply far too little. Shootings with rifles, including assault rifles, make up less than 3 percent of gun homicides in the US. More than 70 percent of gun homicides are instead carried out with handguns, which would be largely neglected by a plan to ban and confiscate only assault weapons. So perhaps bans on other guns, besides assault weapons, should be considered. There has been some movement in the Democratic field. Booker was early in his call for a gun licensing requirement, and he’s since been joined by candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. A few candidates have called for the confiscation of assault weapons as well. But the field has shied away from significantly stronger proposals, and the candidates have strayed from saying that the ultimate goal should be to reduce the number of guns in the US. To the contrary, Eric Swalwell, while still a candidate for president, said on CNN in April, as he called for a mandatory buyback for assault weapons: “Keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons — these weapons of war — out of the hands of the most dangerous people.” So the majority of the Democratic conversation remains focused on universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Based on the research, this milquetoast approach just won’t be enough. If nothing else, the 2020 primary should force Democrats to explain why they should merely continue as they have for decades with little to show for it.

A movement of climate activists wants the world to respond to the growing wave of extreme weather and climate disasters the way they would to a mass shooting — like it’s an emergency. On Tuesday, they got three prominent progressive allies in the United States to publicly join their cause: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). The lawmakers introduced a joint resolution calling for the US to join 16 other countries and hundreds of local governments in declaring a “climate emergency.” New York City declared a climate emergency last month. “This is a moral imperative. There is no choice. We are going to have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the ignorance of Donald Trump,” Sanders said Tuesday. A concurrent resolution is nonbinding and does not have the force of law. But Blumenauer said this is the first step toward a Green New Deal, an ambitious progressive resolution Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) proposed earlier this year to address climate change and growing inequality. It also sends a stark political message about the two parties’ priorities. This week, President Trump held an event about his environmental record, repeating a series of misleading statements about his administration’s policies without acknowledging climate change. The backdrop to the event: flooding in Washington, DC, a historic heat wave in Alaska, and a $19 billion disaster aid package passed by Congress last month for hurricane, wildfire, tornado, and storm relief around the country. The resolution declares global warming “a climate emergency that severely and urgently impacts the economic and social well-being, health and safety, and national security of the United States,” and calls for “a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale to halt, reverse, mitigate, and prepare for the consequences of the climate emergency and to restore the climate for future generations.” Sanders’s presidential campaign has yet to unveil its own climate plan. The senator has supported the Green New Deal framework and said Tuesday that he will be coming out with the “strongest” plan in the current Democratic field. He said specifics were an “ongoing proposal” but cited investments in sustainable energy and public transportation. But this proposed emergency declaration fits in with Sanders’s most central message: a need for political revolution. On climate change, Ocasio-Cortez says the United States is in a “political crisis of inaction.” This is well established. Climate policy has become a zero-sum game in Washington, where Republican leaders have made it their political platform to block any climate policy, incremental or bold. It’s created immense headwind to address what is unmistakably a growing global crisis, which if left unaddressed threatens civilization altogether. Vox’s Dave Roberts puts the magnitude of this hurdle in this context: The only way Democrats can hope to pass any legislation — not big legislation, any legislation — is by radically shaking up the status quo balance of powers. That would mean getting rid of the filibuster, possibly granting statehood to Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, reforming the Electoral College and voting laws, and possibly expanding the Supreme Court. So the response from climate activists and progressive lawmakers has been to create a people’s movement — largely in line with how Sanders frames every policy fight. Here’s Roberts explaining this approach: Here’s the only way any of this works: You develop a vision of politics that puts ordinary people at the center and gives them a tangible stake in the country’s future, a share in its enormous wealth, and a role to play in its greater purpose. Then organize people around that vision and demand it from elected representatives. If elected representatives don’t push for it, make sure they get primaried or defeated. If you want bipartisanship, get it because politicians in purple districts and states are scared to cross you, not because you led them to the sweet light of reason. Blumenauer said Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency on the southern border to get his wall inspired him to draft this climate emergency resolution. But he’s not the first to think that using the language of national crises is the way to get countries to act — that’s part of a global activist movement to view climate change more urgently.

Gun control had already become a rising issue in Virginia after 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31. A recent legislative breakdown over gun laws demonstrates how it could be a centerpiece of the state’s upcoming elections. Virginia has a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, but both houses of its legislature are narrowly controlled by Republicans, who have a 51-48 majority in the lower house and a one-seat advantage in the Senate. Although Virginia has had a history of being gun-rights friendly — the state is home to the National Rifle Association — some Democrats believe gun control could be a winning issue in the state. But any action on guns in Virginia won’t happen until after voters go to the polls in November. Candidates in tight races have already seized on the issue: In Virginia House of Delegates District 94, where NRA-backed Republican candidate David Yancey won after having his name drawn out of a bowl to break a tie with Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds, Simonds is trying again, on a platform that includes universal background checks, an extreme risk protective order, and a ban on high-capacity magazines. Yancey, meanwhile, has proposed making it easier to for state law enforcement to prosecute illegal firearms sales. Simonds, though, is betting that Virginia voters want to go further than that, and Democrats are hoping she’s right. All three Democratic candidates for Congress who flipped Virginia House seats in the 2018 midterm elections ran on gun control platforms, according to CNBC: Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger, and Elaine Luria. The May 31 shooting, combined with legislative drama earlier this month, all but guaranteed the issue will be prominent as Virginia prepares for its state legislative elections this year. Lawmakers assembled on July 9 for a special session Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called to address the issue of gun violence. Lawmakers filed about 30 bills in response to the Virginia Beach shooting, including measures that would restrict gun use and make the punishment for violating gun laws stricter. Virginia currently has some of the loosest gun laws in the country: The only significant gun control measure in place is a ban on gun sales to high-risk individuals and those convicted of domestic violence, according to the Washington Post. Northam put forward a package of eight proposals to tighten the state’s gun laws: When the legislature convened, the GOP shut down the meeting in less than two hours. The group refused to address gun control, saying that not enough research had been conducted on the appropriate legislative direction prior to the “premature” session, and suggested Virginia do what it did after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, when then-Gov. Tim Kaine, commissioned a blue-ribbon panel to study mental health and gun control. The legislature ultimately passed some of the panel’s recommendations. Before adjourning the session, Republican leaders in both the House and Senate said that they would send bills submitted in July to the Virginia State Crime Commission to be studied, according to the Virginian-Pilot. The commission will then release a report by mid-November, which will help them make “evidence-based” decisions. They also pledged not to vote on any measure until November 18 — about two weeks after the state’s election on November 5. “It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives,” Northam said in a statement afterward. “I expected better of them. Virginians expect better of them.” Virginia is the only state legislature that could flip its controlling party this upcoming off-year election. With only a slim 51-48 majority in the House and a 20-19 majority in the Senate, Republicans are facing a tight race. Democrats are hoping that they can energize their base around the issue of gun violence to finally gain control in both the House and Senate in more than 20 years. Political strategist Joshua Ulibarri, who polled for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus in 2015 and 2017 elections, argued that candidates like Jennifer Boysko and John Bell were successful in those elections in part because of their strong gun control platforms. It also helps that Virginia is now trending blue, Ulibarri added, although it’s not just because of outrage against President Donald Trump. “A lot of its because the Republican Party in Virginia had been so extreme on so many issues — from guns to choice to health care — that the suburban districts that were red in nature had become blue over time as suburban, college-educated, Anglo women shifted away from Republicans and towards Democrats,” he said. “And at the same time, you have increased interest among people of color and then diversification in the electorate, that those three storms together have really pushed the state solidly blue.” House Speaker Kirk Cox has already called Northam’s special session “an election-year stunt” to distract voters from a string of scandals in the Democratic Party: Northam had been accused of wearing blackface in his 1984 yearbook, causing his approval rate to drop from 59 to  40 percent; Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax was subsequently accused of sexual assault; and Attorney General Mark Herring also admitted to wearing blackface in the past. There is a stark partisan divide on the issue: 82 percent of Democrats in the state favored gun control compared to 64 percent of Republicans who opposed it, according to a July survey released by the Wason Center for Public Policy. But there’s more bipartisan support for specific gun control measures, like the ones Northam had introduced during the special session. 76 percent of Republicans and 96 percent of Democrats supported making all gun sales subject to background checks, according to the survey. 65 percents of voters also said they supported a ban on assault weapons (49 percent for Republicans and 84 percent for Democrats). In some of the districts expected to be most competitive, including Simonds and Yancey’s race, Democratic candidates are emphasizing their views on guns. Democratic candidate Dan Helmer is running in Virginia House of Delegates District 40, one of the rare spots of red left in Virginia’s DC suburbs — Republican Tim Hugo won by a mere 99 votes after a recount in 2017. The former Army veteran, who has been endorsed by gun control organization Giffords, recently appeared on a NowThis video to challenge Hugo’s corporate donors to spend their money on families of Virginia Beach victims and other victims of gun violence. “It’s time to support commonsense measures that would save lives, from universal background checks to bans on dangerous weapons and accessories,” he said. “Corporate donors to Tim Hugo like Visa have been subsidizing his elections, ensuring our lives are more dangerous. Virginians want to be safe.” This candidate is confronting VISA for funding his opponent, an NRA A-rated lawmaker pic.twitter.com/gPc3OYocou Despite the enthusiasm around gun safety, Philip Van Cleave, the president of gun rights group Virginia Citizens Defense League, said gun rights advocates won’t be backing down. The growing debate around gun control has recently woken up several gun owners, Van Cleave said, which is “going to blow up in [Democrats’] faces.” “It’s kind of like the sleeping majority that aren’t out there necessarily voting like they should, not really paying attention,” he said. “When you do stir them up and get them to the polls — watch out.” It’s true that gun rights advocates have been historically more energized than gun control supporters, which is a phenomenon called the “intensity gap.” German Lopez writes for Vox: Essentially, even though more Americans support gun control laws, those on the side opposing stricter measures have long been more passionate about the issue — more likely to make guns the one issue they vote on, more likely to call their representatives in Congress, and so on. Gun control advocates, however, seem more fired up than ever following the Virginia Beach tragedy. A preview of the showdown came at the State Capitol the day of the special session, where gun control activists in bright red “Moms Demand Action” shirts stood beside armed pro-gun protestors. Jennifer Herrera, leader of the Virginia chapter of Moms Demand Action, said she is confident people will vote out lawmakers who don’t address gun violence, and her group is helping by knocking on doors on behalf of pro-gun control candidates. With every gun-related death, more people are realizing that gun control is simply “common sense,” she said, which is why people of all different backgrounds — including Republicans and gun owners — are joining her group to keep the state safe. “It really solidifies the notion that a bullet doesn’t discriminate,” she said. “People are scared, and they want change.” Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Most of what I remember about being 14 involves wanting stuff: I wanted straighter hair. I wanted to seem like a grown-up (or at least like a 16-year-old). And I really, really wanted to go to Warped Tour. It was the summer of 2004, and pop-punk was ascendant. In Canada, where I grew up, this meant listening to a steady stream of Sum 41, Avril Lavigne, Simple Plan, and Billy Talent — all homegrown acts that got regular radio play thanks in part to Canadian content laws. With that as our gateway, my friends and I began our foray into skate-punk lite, memorizing Taking Back Sunday lyrics, trying (poorly) to land an ollie, and developing extremely unrequited crushes on any boy who bore a passing resemblance to Blink-182’s Tom DeLonge. To us, Warped Tour — the traveling “misfit summer camp” that merged punk, ska, rock, and emo with extreme sports and a healthy array of corporate sponsors — was the pinnacle of cool. Unfortunately, I never got to attend, on account of being at actual summer camp. This summer, Warped Tour celebrates its 25th birthday, making it far older than the teenagers it has courted for two and a half decades. Last year was the tour’s final cross-country run — it featured hundreds of bands over the course of 38 stops for which nearly 550,000 tickets were sold, but this impressive turnout was buoyed by the announcement that it was the event’s last hurrah. Attendance the prior year, in 2017, had been down significantly, particularly among the 14- to 17-year-old demographic that had historically been Warped’s lifeblood. The audience was getting older, production costs were rising, and bands weren’t sticking around year after year like they used to. Plus, according to founder and producer Kevin Lyman, he was just getting tired. But in the era of reboots and remakes, it’s not surprising that organizers would want to honor the tour’s silver anniversary just one year after it shut down. The result is a three-city affair: a single-day event in Cleveland celebrating the opening of a retrospective exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and weekend shows in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Mountain View, California. While not strictly a nostalgia play — there are up-and-coming bands booked alongside veterans, and plenty of fans are first-time Warped attendees — this year, the average age of concertgoers appears to be more than a decade older than it was at the tour’s height (15 or 16, as of 2006), and plenty of the once-wayward youth now have kids of their own in tow, keeping them a safe distance from the mosh pit. This is how, on a Saturday in late June, I find myself on a crowded Jersey beach sandwiched between Caesars Casino and the Atlantic Ocean, belting out Simple Plan’s “I’m Just a Kid” with nearly 30,000 other people — many of whom, like me, were in fact kids when the song came out in 2002. High school may be a distant memory, but at least now I’ve finally made it to Warped Tour. ”Oh, my god, I am 12 years old again,” says the sunburnt guy in checkerboard Vans beside me as the crowd whines along with singer Pierre Bouvier: “Nobody cares, ’cause I’m alone and the world is having more fun than me tonight.” The lyrics don’t exactly fit the setting — no one here is alone and everyone seems to be having fun — but the feeling’s still there. For a little while, we’re all our angsty teen selves again. Likewise, there’s a twinge of irony when Good Charlotte tear into their breakout single “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,” a middle finger to celebrity culture written long before Joel and Benji Madden (the band’s lead singer and guitarist) married Hollywood it-girls (Nicole Richie and Cameron Diaz, respectively). Warped Tour itself is a contradiction — it’s a punk rock festival that’s also a prodigious marketing machine, sponsored from top to bottom by brands hoping to win over fans in between shows. This isn’t a knock on the tour, really: if it weren’t able to bridge that gap, it probably wouldn’t exist. The idea for Warped began germinating while Kevin Lyman was working as a stage manager for the alt-rock-focused Lollapalooza in the early ’90s — back when that, too, was a touring festival. He had been immersed in SoCal’s hardcore and ska scenes growing up and wanted to bring some of his favorite bands to audiences around the country with a back-to-basics tour that did away with the music industry’s hierarchies and out-of-control egos: no headliners, no arenas — just a few thousand fans in a parking lot and an average ticket price of less than $30. Even for the biggest acts, that DIY spirit shone through. “You feel more like a carnie on Warped Tour than you do on any other tour or at any other festival,” says Adam Lazzara, the lead singer of Taking Back Sunday, who are currently in the midst of a 20th-anniversary tour, “just because you’re literally there setting up and breaking down into the next town.” Lyman also tapped a handful of pro skateboarders and BMX bikers to come along, recognizing the crossover between extreme sports fans and punk rock’s moshing masses, as well as the fact that both subcultures were becoming increasingly mainstream. In 1995, the same year Warped made its debut run in the summer, ESPN aired the inaugural X Games (then called “Extreme Games”), with athletes competing in action sports such as barefoot water skiing, street luge, and skateboarding. The year prior, the Offspring and Green Day — both bands with roots in California’s underground punk scene — released best-selling albums that catapulted them into popular culture. The time was ripe for something like Warped to exist, though in order to get it off the ground, Lyman needed to buck one of the central tenets of punk and get a few executives to break out their checkbooks. “I grew up with that whole ‘eff corporate America’ mentality,” he says. “And then, for me, I just started looking at corporate America, and no matter how punk rock we were or whatever, we were still supporting it in some way. We were buying their brands; we were using their products.” He looked at the Rolling Stones pulling in millions through sponsorships with Jovan fragrance and Budweiser, and thought: Maybe we can get some money too. It didn’t go seamlessly at first. After the 1995 run — which featured an eclectic lineup that included the ska-reggae band Sublime, a Tragic Kingdom-era No Doubt, and the grunge pioneers L7 — the tour was in dire straits financially, as the small sponsorships Lyman had landed from brands like Converse and Spin weren’t enough to cover the significant production costs. To keep it going, he was desperate enough to consider brokering a deal with the decidedly not-punk Calvin Klein to become the title sponsor. “I don’t really think that would have worked,” he now says, matter-of-factly. Fortuitously, the meeting with the fashion brand was delayed by the devastating East Coast blizzard of 1996, and before they could go any further with the arrangements, Lyman got a call from Vans CEO Walter Schoenfeld. Founded in 1966 as the Van Doren Rubber Company, Vans had engendered strong ties to the skateboarding community, which was loyal to the brand’s sneakers thanks to their grippy soles. The $300,000 check the company wrote turned the Warped Tour into the Vans Warped Tour, giving Lyman some financial runway while securing the festival’s ties to corporate America. (At the time, Vans was owned by the venture banking firm McCown De Leeuw & Co., thanks to a $71 million 1988 leveraged buyout.) The Warped partnership was led by Steven Van Doren, the company’s vice president of events and promotions and the son of Vans founder Paul Van Doren, who saw an opportunity to give the brand national exposure beyond the Sun Belt states that at the time accounted for most of its sales. He also introduced amateur skateboarding competitions to the tour, giving contestants the chance to win pro contracts with Vans. “Having Steve involved really solidified our partnership,” says Lyman, noting that he turned down bigger subsequent sponsorship offers from the shoe brand Airwalk because he felt Vans was in it for the long haul. He was right: By 1999, Spin reported at the time, Vans owned a 15 percent stake in Warped and was paying $1 million per year “to strengthen [its] presence with ‘Generation Y’” (or, as we’d call them today, “millennials”). Two years later, it stepped up its investment, paying $5.2 million for a 70 percent controlling stake, according to Forbes. Today, Vans is a $3 billion brand — current parent company VF Corp bought it for $396 million in 2004 — and a household name for most Americans, including those who have never set foot on a skateboard. Even as it has grown well beyond its fringier roots, though, the brand’s relationship with Warped has endured, and at the 25th-anniversary show, seemingly every other fan is wearing Vans sneakers: Sk8-Hi’s, Old Skools, the ubiquitous checkerboard slip-ons. (Airwalk fizzled by the early 2000s and was reborn as a Payless brand; its current owners — the same company that recently acquired Sports Illustrated — are trying to stage a ’90s-nostalgia-fueled comeback.) Even with the Vans investment, Lyman had to hustle to keep the tour afloat in the early years. “We had to raise nearly $4 million in sponsorships to make the ticket price what it was, to give you the show you wanted, to bring all those side stages that developed young artists,” he says. In 1999, he signed a partnership with the brand new surf label Hurley and got up-and-comers Blink-182 — then still a year out from the explosively popular Enema of the State — to wear the brand’s clothes onstage in exchange for free seats on one of the Warped Tour’s buses, since the band couldn’t yet afford their own transportation. It was a turning point for both band and brand: Blink had just replaced its former drummer with Travis Barker, who’s still with the group today, and Hurley’s founder Bob Hurley had left a successful career with Billabong to start his namesake clothing line earlier that year. Four years later, Blink was selling out arenas and topping Billboard charts, and Hurley had grown into a $70 million business, which Nike acquired in 2002. It wasn’t just hormone-addled fans going through an adolescence of sorts at Warped. “I always said Warped was a developmental spot, not only for bands but for crew people to learn how to tour and learn how to be good citizens in the music community, as well as brands,” says Lyman. “A lot of brands got their starts in those parking lots.” One of those was Monster Energy, which has been a tour sponsor since it launched in 2003, back when it was made by a California soda company called Hansen’s Natural Co. The company set up a portable rock wall, became “the official energy drink of the Vans Warped Tour,” and embarked on a wildly successful rebrand that has seen its stock soar more than 72,000 percent since its public debut that same year. According to Lyman, Monster also came up with the idea of “Tour Water” — specially designed cans of water that make it look like bands and crew members are chugging energy drinks all day onstage without the risk of cardiac arrest; the concept is now an industry standard, and cans from early tours go for more than $75 on eBay. Another was Jeffree Star Cosmetics. Before Star was a beauty mogul, he was a MySpace-famous scene kid who performed on the tour as a solo artist in 2008 and 2009. In the following years, he came back to host meet-and-greets with his YouTube fans and, when he launched his makeup empire in 2014, set up shop among the merch tents. The Warped Tour also forced more corporate brands to loosen up a little: After the PlayStation team showed up in uniform polo shirts their first year on the tour, Lyman told them they’d have to change, citing a life motto of his: “Never trust a person in a golf shirt unless you’re at a golf course.” (They’re either a douchebag or they don’t know what they’re talking about, he says.) When the tour created a “reverse day care” for parents on-site in 2001 — complete with air conditioning and noise-canceling headphones — Lyman convinced Target to put its bull’s-eye logo on top, sans brand name, citing the symbol’s history with ’70s mod bands like the Who and the Jam. He even dug out the Ramones’ tour rider to persuade the makers of Yoo-hoo that the chocolate drink was, in fact, kinda punk rock, and by the 1998 tour, fans were climbing a rock wall shaped like a giant Yoo-hoo bottle and competing for branded skateboard decks. Walking around the grounds in Atlantic City, there’s a near-endless array of stuff to buy at Warped this year: limited-edition Vans, commemorative 25th anniversary bracelets, T-shirts reading “Mall Goth Trash” and “SadBoy Crew,” henna tattoos, water bottles, skate decks, and beer koozies (plus $14 Pacifico). There are also plenty of freebies: branded coupon wristbands from the teen retailer Journeys, which has been the tour’s presenting sponsor since 2014; T-shirts from Truth, the anti-smoking organization; stickers from PETA. Among the panoply of shoppable teenage rebellion are booths with a cause, like Hope for the Day, a suicide prevention organization, and A Voice for the Innocent, a nonprofit that offers resources to survivors of rape and sexual abuse, which was brought on board in the wake of a series of sexual assault and harassment allegations involving artists who had performed on the tour. ”The Warped Tour is really interesting because it jumped early on the idea that crowds could be commodified,” says Gina Arnold, a former rock journalist and the author of Half a Million Strong: Crowds and Power from Woodstock to Coachella. “They were able to widen out the notion of the festival as a marketplace — not so much of ideas, but a marketplace of actual things.” Today, the concept of festival-as-shopping-mall is well established — so much so that this year’s Coachella attendees could have Amazon orders delivered same-day to lockers on site — but in the ’90s, it was still a novel idea. Before then, it was all “bad food and band T-shirts,” as Arnold put it. (The exception: the parking lot of any Grateful Dead concert, long a thriving marketplace of tie-dye tees, beaded jewelry, DIY taco stands, and any drug you might fancy, collectively known as Shakedown Street.) Band T-shirts still make up the bulk of the merch at Warped, just as they do at most concerts these days. As album sales have dropped off a cliff and services like Spotify have taken their place, paying a fraction of a penny per stream, merchandise has become an increasingly essential part of artists’ income. A superstar like Taylor Swift or Kanye West can gross $300,000 to $400,000 in merch during a single show, according to a Billboard interview with licensing exec Dell Furano. Warped artists aren’t coming close to that, but especially at the tour’s peak, they were pulling in a good amount of cash. Taking Back Sunday made a reported $20,000 to $30,000 per show on merch on the 2004 tour; My Chemical Romance set the record the next year, selling $60,000 worth of black T-shirts, sinister-looking posters, and fingerless gloves at a single stop. 2005 was also the only year Warped made money on ticket sales, according to Lyman. Headliners Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance were regulars on MTV’s TRL thanks to crossover hits “Sugar, We’re Goin’ Down” and “Helena.” Teens who hadn’t heard of most of the “authentic” punk bands the tour had booked in prior years were turning out in droves. By the end of the 48 dates, 700,000 fans had bought tickets, and the tour grossed an all-time high of $25 million. ”That was a pretty wild year, with all the bands exploding,” says Lisa Johnson, who’s been photographing Warped Tour since its first run. “I’m not gonna lie, it was a little frustrating in the photo pit because it was so jam-packed. And a little dangerous, because there were so many kids coming over the barricade constantly. But at the same time, how fantastic is that?” Of course, not everyone agreed. From its inception, Warped provoked criticism from punk purists who argued — not without reason — that the corporate-sponsored festival was antithetical to the values of the genre. It also ruffled feathers with the bands it booked, particularly as the rise of “mall punk” and emo put bands like Good Charlotte, Blink-182, and My Chemical Romance alongside punk mainstays like Rancid, Pennywise, and Bad Religion. ”You go to the Warped Tour and walk around and you’ll hear 100 bands that try to sound like Green Day or NOFX. It’s just disgusting,” said Mike Avilez, a vocalist for the California punk band Oppressed Logic, in the book Gimme Something Better: The Profound, Progressive, and Occasionally Pointless History of Bay Area Punk from Dead Kennedys to Green Day. “They’re missing the angst. To me, punk rock is supposed to be angry and pissed off.” The tour has also caught flak from within over the years. In a 2004 Chicago Reader piece, “Punk Is Dead! Long Live Punk!” the music critic Jessica Hopper chronicled a clash between Lyman and a band called the Mean Reds: “It was only the sixth day of the tour, and they were already on ‘probation’ for running their mouths onstage about what a sold-out capitalist-pig enterprise Warped is, how it isn’t really punk, et cetera.” Even Adweek, hardly a voice of the counterculture, said in 2005 that the influx of corporate cash “does somewhat undermine the legitimacy of the event, even as it introduces groups of men in tight pants to new audiences.” Among those who’ve been along for the ride since Warped’s early days, though, ambivalence about the scene’s brushes with the mainstream is tempered by ideas both idealistic — that the tour provided a platform to bands that otherwise might not have made it, and a community for kids who didn’t always fit in elsewhere — and practical. ”There’s always going to be critics,” says Shira Yevin, who’s performed at Warped as Shiragirl since 2004, and for a decade produced a stage at the tour dedicated to promoting women-fronted bands. “But they’re the same ones bitching because they only got paid $100 for the gig and they don’t have enough money to get to the next state, you know?” In 2019, the idea of “selling out” seems like a product of an earlier generation — one without climate change or student loans or school gun violence to worry about. And anyway, the purists may be getting their way for now, since even pop punk isn’t popular these days. Instead, the top 40 charts are ruled by Lil Nas X’s boundary-pushing country trap, genre-fluid acts like Billie Eilish, and mumble rappers like Post Malone. The loud, fast, guitar-driven sound that Warped is known for? “In top 40, it’s very rare,” says Nate Sloan, a musicologist and the co-host of Vox’s Switched on Pop podcast. “Even the bands that sort of assert that look and that style and may throw a guitar around their shoulder, the actual sound doesn’t necessarily have that.” On the second day of the Atlantic City shows, in one of the festival’s seemingly endless meet-and-greet lines, I meet 20-year-old Sam and 14-year-old Tori, friends from Philadelphia who made the trip down for their first Warped Tour. Sam has rainbow hair and rainbow gauges in her ears; Tori’s wearing a Set It Off band tee. They met at the Hot Topic where Sam works, a store that itself has transformed from mall-goth central into a haven for geek fashion. ”I basically live there,” says Tori. ”We vibed about the music we listen to,” says Sam. ”I don’t really have any other friends that listen to this kind of stuff,” explains Tori. “I almost kind of get made fun of, because it’s like, ‘Oh, emo music, what do you do, cry all day?’” At Sam’s high school, most guys listened to trap or rap, while “angsty music” was mostly the domain of girls or “the guys who had a bad upbringing.” ”It was just divided,” she adds. “Like the way the country is right now.” While genres may separate fans into factions in high school, Sloan says they’re not necessarily as diametrically opposed as they seem. “A lot of the sensibility of rock ’n’ roll has gone into the sound of SoundCloud rap and mumble rap,” he says. “This genre is sort of the spiritual heir to a lot of the acts that first kicked off the original Warped Tour. Sonically, it feels like a world apart in a lot of ways, but in terms of the intense emotional affect, it’s very clearly picking up the mantle.” Part of the transformation may be technological. “Maybe 20, 30 years ago, if you were an angsty teenager, the easiest way to express yourself would have been by installing yourself and your friends in the garage with a couple of crappy guitars and a battered drum set,” says Sloan. “Today, the easiest way to express your angst would be through a pirated copy of [the music software] FruityLoops and a USB microphone.” This evolution may also help explain why punk’s communal, anti-commercial spirit seems to have fallen out of favor while themes like alienation and disaffection (which Gen Z artists like Eilish mine extensively) have endured. Shifting musical tastes are just one factor contributing to Warped’s decline. Most people I talked to had similar theories about what’s behind the drop-off in teen attendance: It’s not just that today’s rock bands can’t compete with the colossal forces of hip-hop and pop; they’re also up against YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, esports, and social media, all of which are pouring billions into the race for young people’s attention. Plus, parents are warier about sending their kids to live shows because of tragedies like the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas and the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Lamenting the changing habits of teenagers has always been an adults’ game, though. For the current generation of fans and artists, the end of the tour is, inevitably, the beginning of whatever comes next. Not Ur Girlfrenz was the youngest touring act at Warped last year, and now at ages 13 (bassist Gigi Haynes) and 14 (lead singer and guitarist Liv Haynes and drummer Maren Alford), the trio is on the cusp of what was once the festival’s prime demographic. They also just released their first EP, the title track of which, “New Kids in America,” riffs off the Kim Wilde hit with bouncy pop-punk energy and lyrics like, “When did the trend of no one ever having fun / Spread throughout the land infecting everyone?” Still, they’re more optimistic about the future of the kind of music they play. “Kids our age these days just aren’t really exposed to it anymore. It’s not exactly like they just don’t like it. They’re just not exposed to it,” says Maren. She’ll introduce her friends to a new band or tell them to stay and watch whoever Not Ur Girlfrenz has opened for, “And they’re like, ‘Oh, my gosh, this is my new favorite band!’” Plus, with early-aughts nostalgia already trending heavily among Gen Z (so much so that this year’s VidCon — a conference for online video creators and their mostly teenage fans — featured a meeting room decked out in Lizzie McGuire posters and blow-up furniture), a musical comeback seems timely. “You hear the 1975 bringing back the ’80s sounds, so I think now’s the time to bring back the 2000s,” reasons Liv. At their Sunday set, it’s easy to see why they’re hoping for another Warped Tour next year — even if Lyman insists that, for real this time, this is the last. Fans are yelling their names and singing their lyrics back at them from the crowd. ”I did the whole thing where, you know, someone points at you and you look behind you and then you’re like, ‘Oh, wait, it’s me!’” Liv says with a laugh. At a signing at their merch tent after the set, the screaming starts again. “We were like, ‘Is somebody famous here? Oh, my god, is it Blink-182?’” recalls Gigi. ”Yeah, we saw this huge group of people,” says Maren, “and we were like, ‘Ooh, someone important is giving a signing. I wonder who it is.’” ”Nah, it was just us. Psh,” Gigi sighs.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

253,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-fight-for-the-future-of-youtube,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Neima Jahromi Earlier this year, executives at YouTube began mulling, once again, the problem of online speech. On grounds of freedom of expression and ideological neutrality, the platform has long allowed users to upload videos endorsing noxious ideas, from conspiracy theories to neo-Nazism. Now it wanted to reverse course. “There are no sacred cows,” Susan Wojcicki, the C.E.O. of YouTube, reportedly told her team. Wojcicki had two competing goals: she wanted to avoid accusations of ideological bias while also affirming her company’s values. In the course of the spring, YouTube drafted a new policy that would ban videos trafficking in historical “denialism” (of the Holocaust, 9/11, Sandy Hook) and “supremacist” views (lauding the “white race,” arguing that men were intellectually superior to women). YouTube planned to roll out its new policy as early as June. In May, meanwhile, it started preparing for Pride Month, turning its red logo rainbow-colored and promoting popular L.G.B.T.Q. video producers on Instagram. On May 30th, Carlos Maza, a media critic at Vox, upended these efforts. In a Twitter thread that quickly went viral, Maza argued that the company’s publicity campaign belied its lax enforcement of the content and harassment policies it had already put in place. Maza posted a video supercut of bigoted insults that he’d received from Steven Crowder, a conservative comedian with nearly four million YouTube followers; the insults focussed on Maza’s ethnicity and sexual orientation. When Crowder mentioned Maza in a video, his fans piled on; last year, Maza’s cell phone was bombarded with hundreds of texts from different numbers which read “debate steven crowder.” Maza said that he’d reported the behavior to YouTube’s content moderators numerous times, and that they had done nothing. On Twitter and his YouTube channel, Crowder insisted that, in labelling Maza a “lispy queer” and a “token Vox gay-athiest sprite,” he had been trying to be funny. Maza’s supporters, meanwhile, shared screenshots of ads that had run before Crowder’s videos, suggesting that, because YouTube offers popular video producers a cut of ad revenue, the company had implicitly condoned Crowder’s messages. YouTube said it would investigate. A week later, it tweeted that Crowder hadn’t violated its community guidelines in any of the videos that Maza highlighted. The next day, it announced its new policy, which included a warning that the company would no longer share ad revenue with YouTubers who repeatedly brushed up against its rules. Then it announced that Crowder would be cut off from the platform’s ad dollars. The news made no one happy. Maza said that he wanted Crowder’s channel removed completely; conservatives, including the Republican senator Ted Cruz, complained about censorship. YouTube employees, siding with Maza, began denouncing their bosses on Twitter and in the press. “It’s a classic move from a comms playbook,” Micah Schaffer, a technology adviser who wrote YouTube’s first community guidelines, told me. “Like, ‘Hey, can we move up that launch to change the news cycle?’ Instead, it made it worse. It combined into a Voltron of bad news.” (A YouTube spokesperson said that the launch date was not in response to any individual event.) Former colleagues deluged Schaffer, who had left the company in 2009, with bewildered e-mails and texts. (A typical subject line: “WTF is Going on at YouTube?”) Sitting in a dentist’s office, he started typing a response on his phone, trying to lay out what he thought had gone wrong at the company. Schaffer told me that hate speech had been a problem on YouTube since its earliest days. Dealing with it used to be fairly straightforward. YouTube was founded, in 2005, by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who met while working at PayPal. At first, the site was moderated largely by its co-founders; in 2006, they hired a single, part-time moderator. The company removed videos often, rarely encountering pushback. In the intervening thirteen years, a lot has changed. “YouTube has the scale of the entire Internet,” Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, which owns YouTube, told Axios last month. The site now attracts a monthly audience of two billion people and employs thousands of moderators. Every minute, its users upload five hundred hours of new video. The technical, social, and political challenges of moderating such a system are profound. They raise fundamental questions not just about YouTube’s business but about what social-media platforms have become and what they should be. Perhaps because of the vast scale at which most social platforms operate, proposed solutions to the problem of online hate speech tend to be technical in nature. In theory, a platform might fine-tune its algorithms to deëmphasize hate speech and conspiracy theories. But, in practice, this is harder than it sounds. Some overtly hateful users may employ language and symbols that clearly violate a site’s community guidelines—but so called borderline content, which dances at the edge of provocation, is harder to detect and draws a broad audience. Machine-learning systems struggle to tell the difference between actual hate speech and content that describes or contests it. (After YouTube announced its new policies, the Southern Poverty Law Center complained that one of its videos, which was meant to document hate speech, had been taken down.) Some automated systems use metadata—information about how often a user posts, or about the number of comments that a post gets in a short period of time—to flag toxic content without trying to interpret it. But this sort of analysis is limited by the way that content bounces between platforms, obscuring the full range of interactions it has provoked. Tech companies have hired thousands of human moderators to make nuanced decisions about speech. YouTube also relies on anonymous outside “raters” to evaluate videos and help train its recommendations systems. But the flood of questionable posts is overwhelming, and sifting through it can take a psychological toll. Earlier this year, YouTube described its efforts to draw more heavily on user feedback—survey responses, likes and dislikes—to help identify “quality” videos. And yet, in a 2016 white paper, the company’s own engineers wrote that such metrics aren’t very useful; the problem is that, for many videos, “explicit feedback is extremely sparse” compared to “implicit” signals, such as what users click on or how long they watch a video. Teen-agers, in particular, who use YouTube more than any other kind of social media, often respond to surveys in mischievous ways. Business challenges compound the technical ones. In a broad sense, any algorithmic change that dampens user engagement could work against YouTube’s business model. Netflix, which is YouTube’s chief rival in online video, can keep subscribers streaming by licensing or crafting addictive content; YouTube, by contrast, relies on user-generated clips, strung together by an automated recommendation engine. Programmers are always tweaking the system and the company is reluctant to disclose details. Still, a 2018 white paper outlined the general principle at that time: once someone starts watching a video, the engine is designed to “dig into a topic more deeply,” luring the viewer down the proverbial rabbit hole. Many outside researchers argue that this system, which helped drive YouTube’s engagement growth, also amplified hate speech and conspiracy theories on the platform. As the engine dug deeper, it risked making unsavory suggestions: unearth enough videos about the moon landing and some of them may argue that it was faked. Francesca Tripodi, a media scholar at James Madison University, has studied how right-wing conspiracy theorists perpetuate false ideas online. Essentially, they find unfilled rabbit holes and then create content to fill them. “When there is limited or no metadata matching a particular topic,” she told a Senate committee in April, “it is easy to coördinate around keywords to guarantee the kind of information Google will return.” Political provocateurs can take advantage of data vacuums to increase the likelihood that legitimate news clips will be followed by their videos. And, because controversial or outlandish videos tend to be riveting, even for those who dislike them, they can register as “engaging” to a recommendation system, which would surface them more often. The many automated systems within a social platform can be co-opted and made to work at cross purposes. Technological solutions are appealing, in part, because they are relatively unobtrusive. Programmers like the idea of solving thorny problems elegantly, behind the scenes. For users, meanwhile, the value of social-media platforms lies partly in their appearance of democratic openness. It’s nice to imagine that the content is made by the people, for the people, and that popularity flows from the grass roots. In fact, the apparent democratic neutrality of social-media platforms has always been shaped by algorithms and managers. In its early days, YouTube staffers often cultivated popularity by hand, choosing trending videos to highlight on its home page; if the site gave a leg up to a promising YouTuber, that YouTuber’s audience grew. By spotlighting its most appealing users, the platform attracted new ones. It also shaped its identity: by featuring some kinds of content more than others, the company showed YouTubers what kind of videos it was willing to boost. “They had to be super family friendly, not copyright-infringing, and, at the same time, compelling,” Schaffer recalled, of the highlighted videos. Today, YouTube employs scores of “partner managers,” who actively court and promote celebrities, musicians, and gamers—meeting with individual video producers to answer questions about how they can reach bigger audiences, giving them early access to new platform features, and inviting them to workshops where they can network with other successful YouTubers. Since 2016, meanwhile, it has begun paying socially conscious YouTubers to create videos about politically charged subjects, through a program called Creators for Change. “In this instance, it’s a social-impact group,” Paul Marvucic, a YouTube marketing manager, explained. “We’re saying, ‘We really believe in what you guys are saying, and it’s very core to our values.’ ” The question of YouTube’s values—what they are, whether it should have them, how it should uphold them—is fraught. In December of last year, Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, went before Congress and faced questions about social media’s influence on politics. Democrats complained that YouTube videos promoted white supremacy and right-wing extremism; Republicans, in turn, worried that the site might be “biased” against them, and that innocent videos might be labelled as hate speech merely for containing conservative views. “It’s really important to me that we approach our work in an unbiased way,” Pichai said. And yet the Creators for Change program requires YouTube to embrace certain kinds of ideological commitments. This past fall, for an audience of high-school and college students, YouTube staged a Creators for Change event in the Economic and Social Council chamber at the United Nations. The occasion marked the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and five “ambassadors” from the program joined Craig Mokhiber, the director of the New York office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, onstage. “The U.N. is not just a conference center that convenes to hear any perspective offered by any person on any issue,” Mokhiber said. Instead, he argued, it represents one side in a conflict of ideas. In one corner are universal rights to housing, health care, education, food, and safety; in the other are the ideologies espoused by Islamophobes, homophobes, anti-Semites, sexists, ethno-nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis. In his view, YouTube needed to pick a side. He urged the YouTubers onstage to take the ideals represented by the U.N. and “amplify” them in their videos. “We’re in the middle of a struggle that will determine, in our lifetime, whether human dignity will be advanced or crushed, for us and for future generations,” he said. Last year, YouTube paid forty-seven ambassadors to produce socially conscious videos and attend workshops. The program’s budget, of around five million dollars—it also helps fund school programs designed to improve students’ critical-thinking skills when they are confronted with emotionally charged videos—is a tiny sum compared to the hundreds of millions that the company reportedly spends on YouTube Originals, its entertainment-production arm. Still, one YouTube representative told me, “We saw hundreds of millions of views on ambassadors’ videos last year—hundreds of thousands of hours of watch time.” Most people encountered the Creators for Change clips as automated advertisements before other videos. The Mumbai-based comedian Prajakta Koli, known on YouTube as MostlySane, sat beside Mokhiber in the U.N. chamber. Around four million people follow her channel.  Her videos usually riff on the irritating people whom she encounters in her college cafeteria or on the pitfalls of dating foreigners. “No Offence,” a music video that she screened at the Creators for Change event, is different. As it begins, Koli slouches in her pajamas on the couch, watching a homophobe, a misogynist, and an Internet troll—all played by her—rant on fictional news shows. A minute later, she dons boxing gloves and takes on each of them in a rap battle. After the screening, Koli said that she had already begun taking on weighty subjects, such as divorce and body shaming, on her own. But it helped that YouTube had footed the production and marketing costs for “No Offence,” which were substantial. The video is now her most watched, with twelve million views. On a channel called AsapScience, Gregory Brown, a former high-school teacher, and his boyfriend, Mitchell Moffit, make animated clips about science that affects their viewers’ everyday lives; their most successful videos address topics such as the science of coffee or masturbation. They used their Creators for Change dollars to produce a video about the scientifically measurable effects of racism, featuring the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson. While the average AsapScience video takes a week to make, the video about racism had taken seven or eight months: the level of bad faith and misinformation surrounding the topic, Brown said, demanded extra precision. “You need to explain the study, explain the parameters, and explain the result so that people can’t argue against it,” he said. “And that doesn’t make the video as interesting, and that’s a challenge.” (Toxic content proliferates, in part, because it is comparatively easy and cheap to make; it can shirk the burden of being true.) YouTube hopes that Creators for Change will have a role-model effect. The virality of YouTube videos has long been driven by imitation: in the site’s early days, clips such as “Crazy frog brothers” and “David After Dentist” led fans and parodists to reënact their every move. When it comes to political videos, imitation has cut both ways. The perceived popularity of conspiracy videos may have led some YouTubers to make similar clips; conversely, many Creators for Change ambassadors cite other progressive YouTubers as inspirations. (Prajakta Koli based her sketches on those of Lilly Singh, a sketch-comedy YouTuber who has also spoken at the United Nations.) In theory, even just broadcasting the idea that YouTube will reward social-justice content with production dollars and free marketing might encourage a proliferation of videos that denounce hate speech. And yet, on a platform like YouTube, there are reasons to be skeptical about the potential of what experts call “counterspeech.” Libby Hemphill, a computer-science professor at the University of Michigan’s Center for Social Media Responsibility, studies how different kinds of conversations, from politics to TV criticism, unfold across social media; she also prototypes A.I. tools for rooting out toxic content. “If we frame hate speech or toxicity as a free-speech issue, then the answer is often counterspeech,” she explained. (A misleading video about race and science might be “countered” by the video made by AsapScience.) But, to be effective, counterspeech must be heard. “Recommendation engines don’t just surface content that they think we’ll want to engage with—they also actively hide content that is not what we have actively sought,” Hemphill said. “Our incidental exposure to stuff that we don’t know that we should see is really low.” It may not be enough, in short, to sponsor good content; people who don’t go looking for it must see it. Theoretically, YouTube could fight hate speech by engineering a point-counterpoint dynamic. In recent years, the platform has applied this technique to speech about terrorism, using the “Redirect Method”: moderators have removed terrorist-recruitment videos while redirecting those who search for them to antiterror and anti-extremist clips. (YouTube doesn’t pay people to create the antiterror videos, but it does handpick them.) A YouTube representative told me that it has no plans to redirect someone who searches for a men’s-rights rant, say, to its Creators for Change–sponsored feminist reply. Perhaps the company worries that treating misogynists the way that it treats ISIS would shatter the illusion that it has cultivated an unbiased marketplace of ideas. One way to make counterspeech more effective is to dampen the speech that it aims to counter. In March, after a video of a white-supremacist mass shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, went viral, Hunter Walk, a former YouTube executive, tweeted that the company should protect “freedom of speech” but not “freedom of reach.” He suggested that YouTube could suppress toxic videos by delisting them as candidates for its recommendation engine—in essence, he wrote, this would “shadowban” them. (Shadow-banning is so-called because a user might not know that his reach has been curtailed, and because the ban effectively pushes undesirable users into the “shadows” of an online space.) Ideally, people who make such shadow-banned videos could grow frustrated by their limited audiences and change their ways; videos, Walk explained, could be shadow-banned if they were linked to by a significant number of far-right Web havens, such as 8chan and Gab. (Walk’s tweets, which are set to auto-delete, have since disappeared.) Shadow-banning is an age-old moderation tool: the owners of Internet discussion forums have long used it to keep spammers and harassers from bothering other users. On big social-media platforms, however, this kind of moderation doesn’t necessarily focus on individuals; instead, it affects the way that different kinds of content surface algorithmically. YouTube has published a lengthy list of guidelines that its army of raters can use to give some types of content—clips that contain “extreme gore or violence, without a beneficial purpose,” for example, or that advocate hateful ideas expressed in an “emotional,” “polite,” or even “academic-sounding” way—a low rating. YouTube’s A.I. learns from the ratings to make objectionable videos less likely to appear in its automated recommendations. Individual users won’t necessarily know how their videos have been affected. The ambiguities generated by this system have led some to argue that political shadow-banning is taking place. President Trump and congressional Republicans, in particular, are alarmed by the idea that some version of the practice could be widely employed against conservatives. In April, Ted Cruz held a Senate subcommittee hearing called “Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.” In his remarks, he threatened the platforms with regulation; he also brought in witnesses who accused them of liberal bias. (YouTube denies that its raters evaluate recommendations along political lines, and most experts agree that there is no evidence for such a bias.) Among Cruz’s guests was Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University. In his testimony, Kontorovich pondered whether regulation could, in fact, address the issue of bias on search or social platforms. “Actually enforcing ideological neutrality would itself raise First Amendment questions,” he said. Instead, he argued, the best way to address issues of potential bias was with transparency. A technique like shadow-banning might be effective, but it would also stoke paranoia. From this perspective, the clarity of the Creators for Change program adds to its appeal: its videos are prominently labelled. Engineers at YouTube and other companies are hesitant to detail their algorithmic tweaks for many reasons; among them is the fact that obscure algorithms are harder to exploit. But Serge Abiteboul, a computer-science professor who was tasked by the French government to advise legislators on online hate speech, argues that verifiable solutions are preferable to hidden ones. YouTube has claimed that, since tweaking its systems in January, it has reduced the number of views for recommended videos containing borderline content and harmful misinformation by half. Without transparency and oversight, however, it’s impossible for independent observers to confirm that drop. “Any supervision that’s accepted by society would be better than regulation done in an opaque manner, by the platforms, themselves, alone,” Abiteboul said. Looking back over the history of YouTube, Micah Schaffer thinks he can see where the company made mistakes. Before YouTube, he had worked at a Web site that showcased shocking videos and images—gruesome accidents, medical deformities. There he saw how such material can attract a niche of avid users while alienating many others. “Bikinis and Nazism have a chilling effect,” he said. YouTube sought to distinguish itself by highlighting more broadly appealing content. It would create an ecosystem in which a large variety of people felt excited about expressing themselves. The company featured videos it liked, banned others outright, and kept borderline videos off the home page. Still, it allowed some toxic speech to lurk in the corners. “We thought, if you just quarantine the borderline stuff, it doesn’t spill over to the decent people,” he recalled. “And, even if it did, it seemed like there were enough people who would just immediately recognize it was wrong, and it would be O.K.” The events of the past few years have convinced Schaffer that this was an error. The increasing efficiency of the recommendation system drew toxic content into the light in ways that YouTube’s early policymakers hadn’t anticipated. In the end, borderline content changed the tenor and effect of the platform as a whole. “Our underlying premises were flawed,” Schaffer said. “We don’t need YouTube to tell us these people exist. And counterspeech is not a fair burden. Bullshit is infinitely more difficult to combat than it is to spread. YouTube should have course-corrected a long time ago.” Some experts point out that algorithmic tweaks and counterspeech don’t change the basic structure of YouTube—a structure that encourages the mass uploading of videos from unvetted sources. It’s possible that this structure is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy civic discourse. “It’s not that Jesus came down and said, ‘You must suck up five hundred hours of content per minute, every day,’ ” Sarah T. Roberts, an expert on commercial content moderation at the University of California, Los Angeles, said. “That’s something that they came up with, that they facilitated. We’re inside the parameters of the potentials and possibilities that have been meted out in the architecture and in the economics of these platforms. It’s only been a decade and a half, at most, and it’s so second nature.” YouTube has denied that rabbit holes leading toward radicalization exist on its platform; it also says that, despite what researchers claim, “extreme” videos are not more engaging or algorithmically favored. At the same time, the company has said that it has tuned its recommendation systems to redirect users who search for borderline content about breaking news toward more authoritative sources. (What counts as “authoritative” among mainstream outlets such as Fox News and CNN is itself a sticking point.) As the Times reported, in a recent article about the apparent power of alt-right YouTubers, the company also appears to have tweaked its recommendation system to push users to watch videos on new and varied subjects. (In theory, helping viewers find new interests will keep them engaged in the long run.) Recently, it also announced that it would give greater control over recommendations to its users, who will now be able to more easily prevent individual YouTube channels from popping up among their suggested videos. There are commercial reasons, it turns out, for fighting hate speech: according to a survey by the Anti-Defamation League, fifty-three per cent of Americans reported experiencing online hate or harassment in 2018—rates of bigoted harassment were highest among people who identified as L.G.B.T.Q.—and, in response, many spent less time online or deleted their apps. A study released last year, by Google and Stanford University, identified toxic speech as a “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion.” As part of the Creators for Change program, YouTube has drawn up lesson plans for teachers which encourage students to “use video to find your voice and bring people together.” Teen-agers posting videos disputing toxic ideas are engaged users, too. I asked YouTube’s representatives why they didn’t use the Redirect Method to serve Creators for Change videos to people who search for hate speech. If they valued what their ambassadors had to say, why wouldn’t they disseminate those messages as effectively as possible? A representative explained that YouTube doesn’t want to “pick winners.” I brought that message back to Libby Hemphill, the computer-science professor. “I wish they would recognize that they already do pick winners,” she said. “Algorithms make decisions we teach them to make, even deep-learning algorithms. They should pick different winners on purpose.” Schaffer suggested that YouTube’s insistence on the appearance of neutrality is “a kind of Stockholm syndrome. I think they’re afraid of upsetting their big creators, and it has interfered with their ability to be aggressive about implementing their values.” The Creators for Change program is open about its bias and, in that respect, suggests a different way of thinking about our social platforms. Instead of aspiring, unrealistically, to make them value-neutral meeting places—worldwide coffee shops, streaming town squares—we could see them as forums analogous to the United Nations: arenas for discussion and negotiation that have also committed to agreed-upon principles of human dignity and universal rights. The U.N., too, has cultivated celebrity “ambassadors,” such as David Beckham, Jackie Chan, and Angelina Jolie. Together, they promote a vision of the world not merely as it is—a messy place full of violence and oppression—but as we might like it to be. Perhaps this way of conceptualizing social platforms better reflects the scale of the influence they wield. After YouTube removed ads from Steven Crowder’s channel, he gathered his co-hosts and his lawyer and started a live stream—also on YouTube—to respond. YouTube could keep their money, he said, so long as he could “keep the reach” of his four million followers. (That reach draws in money from fans, who buy merchandise, and sponsors.) Crowder also claimed that YouTube’s partner managers had courted him years ago, saying that they wanted more conservative voices on the platform. He went on, “If they said, ‘Listen, we’ve changed our minds, you cannot say anything that offends anybody and we don’t want conservatives here’—you know what? I’d walk off into the sunset.” Almost certainly, this claim is a bluff. “YouTube has a complete monopoly on video hosting, and they know it,” Lindz Amer, a queer and nonbinary YouTuber, told the Guardian, after the controversy with Carlos Maza. When Amer tried to leave YouTube for another platform, Vimeo, their average audience size went from a hundred thousand views per video to five. Recently, Gregory Brown, of AsapScience, also expressed his disappointment with the company. “We opened ourselves up to unbelievable hate after coming out on @YouTube,” he wrote, on Twitter, of his relationship with his co-host, Moffit. “But we ignore it, because we love educating people about science on the platform.” When I spoke to him a few days later, he told me that he was “trying to be as empathetic to YouTube as possible—which, at times, is in conflict with what I really feel.” It hurt to know that it was possible to “make money, right now, on YouTube, by being homophobic.” But Brown also said that he recognized the complexity created by YouTube’s global reach. “YouTube is trying to moderate and keep their values while trying to make money off, literally, the entire world,” he said. At the same time, he continued, “Being able to educate people on this huge scale is so important to me. I still feel that YouTube is the best place to do it.” Steve Chen, the YouTube co-founder, recalled the platform’s early days, when he often intervened to highlight videos that could only be found on YouTube and that the algorithm might not pick up. He might place amateur footage of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina, or documentation of a racist attack at a bus stop in Hong Kong, on the home page. “I remember a video that only had twenty-five views,” he told me. “I said, ‘There’s no way that this piece of content from some photographer in Africa would ever be viewed from around the world without YouTube, so I’m going to feature this.’ ” Creators for Change, he explained, sounded like a “more evolved version of what I was trying to do on the home page—trying to showcase, encourage, and educate users that this is the kind of content that we want on YouTube.” But the technological developments that have made the platform’s global reach possible have also made such efforts more difficult. “Regardless of the proportions or numbers of great content that YouTube wants on the site, it’s the way the algorithm works,” he said. “If you’re watching this type of content, what are the twenty other pieces of content, among the billions, that you’re going to like most? It probably won’t be choosing out of the blue.” Chen, who left YouTube a decade ago, told me that he doesn’t envy the people who have to decide how the system should work. “To be honest, I kind of congratulate myself that I’m no longer with the company, because I wouldn’t know how to deal with it,” he said. Brown, for his part, wanted the platform to choose a point of view. But, he told me, “If they make decisions about who they’re going to prop up in the algorithm, and make it more clear, I think they would lose money. I think they might lose power.” He paused. “That’s a big test for these companies right now. How are they going to go down in history?” This article has been updated to include a comment from YouTube regarding the timing of the company's hate-speech-policy rollout.

255,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/07/baltimore-mayor-rains-hell-on-childish-trump-is-righteous-cnn-scolding/,"President Donald Trump has continued to double down on his attacks on the city of Baltimore amid his racially-tinged fury with House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD), even tweeting about it amid the aftermath of a gruesome mass shooting in California. In a phone interview with CNN's John Berman on Monday, Baltimore Mayor Bernard ""Jack"" Young tore into Trump for attacking his city. ""I would like to tell him, stop tweeting,"" said Young. ""No president in modern history of the office of the president has done any childish behavior like this president has exhibited. If he really wants to, he needs to send us federal assistance, not only to Baltimore but cities around this country, that are in the same situation that Baltimore is in."" ""He’s the most powerful man on the face of the Earth as president of the United States of America,"" added Young. ""This is below a president to do these kind of things. He should be uniting this country instead of racially dividing us. A president has never in my lifetime exhibited this type of behavior. He’s alienated our allies around the country. What else is he going to do?"" ""The president claims he’s talking about the conditions in the city of Baltimore,"" said Berman. ""Let me ask you, you’ve been mayor of the city since May, has he reached out to you once since you’ve been mayor to talk about conditions?"" ""No, he has never reached out,"" said Young. ""He had a pledge, that he was going to do infrastructure. We’re still waiting on that. We have an aging infrastructure in the city of Baltimore for unfunded mandate by the EPA for us to correct it, and we have to constantly raise water rates on the poor people of the city of Baltimore. We’re a poor city. Do we have, you know, problems? Yeah. We have problems with crime and everything else, just like any other major city, just like the city that his person -- Mitch McConnell -- represents has these problems."" ""Do you think these attacks are even really about your city, or about something else?"" Berman pressed him. ""I think it’s about dividing this country,"" said Young. ""If you look, he attacked four minority women and didn’t even do the research to find out three were born here and one is a naturalized citizen now. Then he attacked one of the most powerful congressmen in the country, Elijah Cummings, who represented Baltimore as well. He has a pattern of attacking people of color. If you want to help us, help us. Don’t talk about us. Send the resources that we need to rebuild America. He’s talking about he wants to make America great again, put the money in the cities that need it the most. That’s where you can make America great again. What he’s doing is, he’s making America the laughingstock of the world ... Our country is in turmoil under his leadership."" Young added that Baltimore has plenty of problems, like a number of cities, but that ""It’s because of the constant reduction in funding for cities like Baltimore"" from the federal government. Watch below:  The ""Big Lie"" by Trump supporters continues to grow, even more than half a year after the January 6th insurrection by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the results.

256,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/07/gop-candidate-arrested-over-insane-mass-shooting-threat-one-day-after-actually-shooting-someone/,"A failed Oklahoma gubernatorial candidate was charged with making a mass shooting threat a day after he was arrested in connection with a shooting at his home. Christopher Jonathan Barnett was jailed again Thursday evening and remains held without bond after allegedly threatening a University of Tulsa administrator and the school's football fans leaving a game at halftime, reported the Tulsa World. The 36-year-old Barnett allegedly posted the threat on the website for Transparency for Oklahoma group he operates, which describes in highly specific detail how to ""take down"" the university with a supposedly ""hypothetical"" threat intended to ""drive the left crazy."" ""The best way to get a message across is violence,"" states the post, which was written by Barnett. ""The Judicial System has failed America. So you need to have a large amount of deaths. You have to take the idiots like David Hogg and you need to find their fear factor. If I were a terrorist and I were going to actually harm anyone at The University of Tulsa, there are a few things I'd do."" The post then lists 22 steps that could be taken to undertake a mass shooting on Tulsa college football fans, sexually assaulting several individuals and framing some of the university's professors for murder and possession of child pornography. ""As much as The University of Tulsa and Hall Estill would love for a school shooting to take place at The Terrorist University of Tulsa, it won't be by me or my husband Trey,"" Barnett wrote. ""I do hope that they are the victims of a school shooting and I hope there are lots of causalities. Parkland didn't deserve to be the victims of a school shooting, but The University of Tulsa does."" Barnett then encourages violence against Hogg, who became an outspoken gun rights activist after a mass shooting at his school, and suggests the recent high school graduate was not present during the Parkland massacre. The post targets a Tulsa provost who suspended Barnett's husband, who was a student in the theater department, after Barnett posted disparaging messages about TU faculty on social media. The couple then sued the university, where Barnett is a theater professor. Barnett finished third out of 10 candidates in last year's Republican gubernatorial primary, with 5,212 votes, and intends to challenge Sen. Jim Inhofe, whose name he misspelled in a statement, next year in the GOP primary. The former GOP candidate was arrested Wednesday after police said he shot a process server who was delivering legal papers to his home. The process server was hospitalized but is expected to recover, and Barnett was charged shooting with intent to kill and later released on bond. Barnett disputed the police account of the shooting, saying the process server drew a weapon and tried to break into his home. ""I am very Thankful to be alive and I count my blessings every minute,"" Barnett said in a statement. ""I would be dead if I had not taken quick action. It is tragic that I had to use a gun to defend myself, my home and my family and I have no regrets.""  QAnon-inspired Republicans are ratcheting up their assault every day on COVID vaccines, defying common sense and reason even if it kills many of their own followers as collateral damage. But the insanity has another friendly-fire victim: Donald Trump.                           Within minutes of having his ""America First"" rally with fellow lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) canceled by a third California venue, Rep. Matt Gaetz took to Twitter to sarcastically whine, ""Nothing like feeling welcome in Anaheim!"" after the city first tweeted they were looking into his visit only to announce soon after it had been canceled. Critics of the GOP lawmaker -- and his rally co-star --were quick to pile on, telling the lawmaker currently under investigation for possible sexual relations with an underaged teen that he is likely not welcome many places and he needs to get used to it.                According to a report from Forbes, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL) are once again seeking another venue to host their ""America First"" rally in California after a third location pulled the plug. Last week a hotel in Laguna Beach canceled their far-right rally after the management learned who the main speakers would be.     Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

257,https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/state-net/news/2019/07/12/local-governments-shine-light-on-public-surveillance.page,"State Net's Expert News Reporting Request a State Net Demo Already a subscriber?   Sign in In May the Board of Supervisors for the City and County of San Francisco approved an ordinance banning the use of facial recognition technology by all city departments. It’s the only major U.S. city to have taken such action against the emerging technology. But the measure is part of a larger and growing movement among localities and states to increase oversight of the use of surveillance technologies by government entities. San Francisco’s ban on facial recognition technology is just one provision of an ordinance restricting the city’s use of surveillance technologies in general. Among other things, the law will require city departments to obtain approval from the Board before acquiring any type of surveillance equipment - from closed-circuit TV cameras to software for monitoring social media - or obtaining information acquired through the use of such technology. Departments that obtain Board approval, through a process involving a public hearing, will have to file a report each year on the use of the applicable technology. The ordinance doesn’t apply to private entities, which as the Atlantic pointed out, “introduces some ironies.” San Francisco’s police department “will be barred from using Amazon’s Rekognition software to scan video footage for suspects after a shooting - but a grocery store will be permitted to do the same thing to analyze shopper behavior,” the publication said. San Francisco isn’t the first locality to pass such sweeping restrictions on government surveillance. Santa Clara County, encompassing much of California’s Silicon Valley, approved an ordinance like San Francisco’s - minus the ban on facial recognition technology - in 2016. And unlike previous laws dealing with the issue, it didn’t just apply to a particular surveillance technology that raised privacy concerns but to all such technologies, including those that hadn’t been developed yet. “Silicon Valley’s local lawmakers made sure the law passed today was future-proof by creating consistent rules for all the surveillance technology that currently exists and those we know will come,” Nicole Ozer of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California said at the time. In 2017 Nashville; Seattle; and Somerville, Massachusetts passed ordinances similar to Santa Clara County’s. And in 2018 Lawrence and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Yellow Springs, Ohio; and the California cities of Berkeley, Davis, Oakland and Palo Alto all did the same. There are some significant variations among the laws, such as San Francisco’s ban on facial recognition technology and whistleblower protections in Oakland. But they all broadly restrict the use of surveillance technology by government agencies. The laws came after a decade-long, federally-subsidized expansion of surveillance technology use by local law enforcement agencies across the country, spurred by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Often those technologies, including automated license plate readers, biometric (e.g., face, voice, gait, etc.) identification systems, cell phone tracking devices, drones, and software for predicting criminal activity, have been deployed without notification of impacted residents or local governments. The New Orleans Police Department used predictive policing software to identify potential perpetrators and victims of crimes for six years without the city council knowing about it. In response to this surveillance tech boom, the ACLU launched an effort in 2016 to ensure adequate oversight of municipal surveillance. The organization’s Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) campaign included a model law requiring city council approval for the acquisition of surveillance technologies and annual reporting on the use of such technologies to the council and the public, among several other things. According to the ACLU’s CCOPS webpage, the surveillance ordinances passed in Santa Clara County, Nashville, Seattle, Somerville, Lawrence, Cambridge, Yellow Springs, Berkeley, Davis, Oakland, Palo Alto, and San Francisco were all CCOPS efforts. There hasn’t been much formal action on the issue this year in major U.S. cities other than San Francisco, according to a new local government service provided by LexisNexis State Net. That service, which currently covers major jurisdictions in 37 states, shows San Francisco, Santa Clara County and Seattle recently passed ordinances related to the government surveillance restrictions they’d previously approved. But most of the ordinances in the database, including those proposed or approved in Atlanta, Houston, Kansas City and Phoenix, authorize rather than restrict the use of surveillance technologies. According to the CCOPS webpage, however, there are more than a dozen cities, large and small, working on their own CCOPS ordinances. They include Boston; New York City; Muskegon, Michigan; and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The webpage also indicates California and Maine are working on statewide CCOPS legislation. What’s more, ACLU Senior Advocacy and Policy Counsel Chad Marlow, who leads the CCOPS campaign, told SNCJ the localities and states identified on its webpage as “Working on CCOPS legislation” are just the ones where the process is far enough along to make it public. He said CCOPS efforts are also underway in “quite a few other places.” In addition to the state CCOPS efforts, at least nine state legislatures have considered bills this session aimed at restricting government use of surveillance technologies, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and LexisNexis State Net’s legislative tracking system(see Bird’s Eye View). At least 13 states have also considered measures dealing with government use of biometric data, one of which, New Mexico HB 98, has been enacted. Pam Greenberg, who tracks technology issues for NCSL, said she’s “seen an increase in all types of privacy legislation this year” and expects “that trend to continue.” As with other privacy-related issues, much of the debate over the government surveillance measures - in city halls and statehouses - revolves around the balance between security and civil liberty. “This is really about saying we can have security without being a security state,” San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin said of the city’s new government surveillance ordinance, which he wrote, as the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Peskin and others say surveillance technologies raise serious societal concerns. Among them is the threat they pose to citizens’ ability to freely exercise their civil rights, such as attending a political protest. They also subject individuals simply going about their daily lives to the same scrutiny as those with criminal intent. “When you have the ability to track people in physical space, in effect everybody becomes subject to the surveillance of the government,” Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the New York Times. Surveillance technologies also make mistakes. A test of Amazon’s Rekognition system last year by the American Civil Liberties Union misidentified as criminals 28 members of Congress, a disproportionate number of whom were people of color, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And critics say the technologies can too readily be used to intentionally target specific populations, such as African-Americans or immigrants, as China - a country with an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras – has been doing with the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority in its western region. But others argue that technologies like facial recognition make the public safer. “It is ridiculous to deny the value of this technology in securing airports and border installations,” said Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, as theTimes reported. “It is hard to deny that there is a public safety value to this technology.” And as Tony Montoya, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, noted, according to the Times, facial recognition technology has also “been successful in at least providing leads to criminal investigators.” One recent example is the use of the technology to help identify the suspect in a mass shooting at an Annapolis, Maryland newspaper in June. For those and other reasons some oppose the idea of banning such technologies. “We agree there are problems with facial recognition ID technology and it should not be used today,” the group Stop Crime SF said in a statement. “But the technology will improve and it could be a useful tool for public safety when used responsibly and with greater accuracy. We should keep the door open for that possibility.” Some have also taken issue with the cost of complying with the surveillance ordinances. According to the Chronicle, the SFPD estimates it will take two to four full-time employees to carry out the compliance responsibilities associated with San Francisco’s new ordinance. But more ordinances like it appear to be on the way. The ACLU’s Marlow said he thinks the momentum of the CCOPS campaign will not only continue but increase. “Having passed 13 laws in 2 1/2 years - a startling average of one new law less than every 3 months - the question has gone from asking new cities if they would pass a CCOPS law, to asking them why they don’t have one,” he said. “In the next 12 months, I expect we will see quite a few more major U.S. cities adopting CCOPS laws, which will just add to the campaign’s ongoing strength.”  -- By KOREY CLARK Start Tracking Now Free subscription to the Capitol Journal keeps you current on legislative and regulatory news.

258,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-city-lgbt-bar-owners-relief-as-rainbow-flag-burning-suspect-is-caught,"SEARCH Alexi Minko of Harlem’s Alibi Lounge said the arrest ‘serves as a cautionary tale to anyone thinking of targeting anyone for their gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.’ Senior Editor and Writer Alexi Minko, the owner of the Alibi Lounge, New York City’s only black-owned LGBTQ bar, said it was “a huge relief” that the NYPD had arrested a suspect Tuesday night for the burning of the bar’s rainbow flags. The NYPD’s arrest in the much-publicized case followed the burning of three of the Alibi Lounge’s rainbow flags outside its Harlem entrance—two on May 31 at the beginning of Pride month and one sometime between Sunday night and early Monday morning. Police arrested Tyresse Singleton, 20, of Manhattan, in connection with both incidents. He is charged with two counts each of criminal mischief as a hate crime and arson. It was not clear if an attorney had been assigned to his case. He was awaiting arraignment in Manhattan criminal court Tuesday night. “It brings a sense of resolution,” Minko told The Daily Beast of the arrest, “and serves as a cautionary tale to anyone thinking of doing something similar not only to us, but to anyone who thinks of targeting anyone else for reasons of gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. It is also a reminder that we live in a civilized world and more often than not you get the resolution you deserve. We’re really relieved to put this behind us and just move forward.” Dermot Shea, the NYPD’s chief of detectives, announced via Twitter late Tuesday afternoon that cops had apprehended a suspect. The suspect had been apprehended thanks to a Crimestoppers tip. The NYPD had released footage of both incidents to encourage witnesses to come forward. On Monday evening, when The Daily Beast visited the Alibi Lounge, Minko had kept a beady eye on who was outside, and who was coming in past the rainbow flag flanking its entrance. Minko opened the bar just over three years ago (on June 24, 2016), and said he had experienced no homophobia during that time. The flag burnings shocked him—and made him determined to stay open “and stay proud.” The incidents attracted considerable media coverage: on Monday night, news crews from NBC and ABC’s New York stations stopped by for interviews. Governor Andrew Cuomo had directed the state police hate crimes unit to assist the NYPD in its investigation. Inside the bar on Monday night, Nina Kennedy and April Gibson, who just produced an ‘It’s World Pride’ Club Mix, had come to the bar from the East Village to show their support. Kennedy told The Daily Beast, “I’m outraged. It’s really shocking that this happened in Harlem, where black people are supposed to feel safe. We shouldn’t have to deal with this crap up here.” Gibson added: “We came to be bodies-in-the-chairs tonight, to show our support, and say, ‘Yes, we are here.’ It is important that there are LGBTQ spaces in all areas of the city, because we are everywhere and we need to be able to feel supported, loved, and welcome no matter where we are.” Alibi Lounge's title of the only black-owned LGBTQ bar in New York City, “is one we unfortunately inherited after Club Langston closed last year,” said Minko. Like the latter, Alibi serves a predominantly black LGBTQ clientele, although Minko emphasizes: “We are all inclusive. You can be purple as long as your credit card goes through.” Other customers, who asked not to be named as they sipped their drinks, said they had been disgusted to hear about the flag burnings, and also wanted to come and show their support. Minko was at the bar when the first incident happened, and heard about the second from staff on duty on Sunday night. “The first time it happened, my first feelings were around how surreal it looked,” Minko told The Daily Beast. “It was raining that night. I first saw only one flag burning and thought it must be an accident involving lighting a cigarette. Then I saw the second flag burning, and the flames were crazy. “The flags are a symbol of Pride, and for the first few minutes I wondered, was this for real? Was it an accident? Was it supposed to be a joke that someone found funny? Then I saw the footage the next day, and saw how malicious it was, how calculated. The person took his time to light both flags on fire. I got angry obviously, and a bit disappointed in humanity.”  The May 31 incident happened close to the anniversary of the Pulse mass shooting, Minko added. The act of seeing the arson had been traumatizing, and made Minko ask himself what would have stopped the perpetrator from coming into the bar itself. However, his anger lessened with the “level of support and love” he had received from the community. The NYPD had been “brilliant” too, and checked on the bar every night afterwards. Then it happened again. Barman Lucca Martini was shocked to see the flames. “I don’t know why anyone would do such a thing,” he said. “It’s absolutely surreal,” said Minko. ‘I just thought, ‘Not again.’ And so we have put another rainbow flag out there, to say ‘We will not be intimidated, we will not give in.’ Of course you start to worry. This has happened twice in five weeks. You have no idea what lies behind such things. Is it the same person or different people? Are they trying to send a message to you? Are they coming back? I feel responsible for every person who walks through that door. I feel a lot of emotions, and they’re not good ones.” Cole Knapper, LGBTQ chairperson for Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, was also at the bar Monday night and “absolutely shocked” by the attacks. “This is such a great neighborhood—so warm and accepting. Alibi has been here, without incident, for three years. We need to send the message, ‘This is not Harlem. This is not who we are, and it will absolutely not to be tolerated.’ “Harlem keeps getting more diverse and better. If this turns out to be an act of homophobia, it would shock me, but would point to areas where we need improvement in the neighborhood and our cultural competency as a neighborhood. We’ll learn and grow from this.” “This sort of terrorism, because that is what it is, has to stop,” Carmen Neely, president of Harlem Pride, and co-chair of the Black and Latino LGBTQ Coalition, told The Daily Beast. “Burning the flag itself is one thing, and it what it represents. For it to have happened a second time is absolutely untenable and egregious.” The two incidents had bookended a successful Pride month, Neely noted, “and for this to happen in our neighborhood is absolutely ridiculous. We don’t usually have any problems. I’m sure where this is coming from or who it could be or why. It’s very much out of the blue.” Harlem Pride and the Black and Latino LGBTQ Coalition plan to present Minko with new rainbow flags to put up. Minko said he was determined to focus his energy positively, rather than on the offender. “Whatever his problem is, it’s between him or them and the justice system. People are coming to the bar to show support. The positive impact this nonsense has had is that it’s woken up the community. It reminds people we are still vulnerable, and the way to be less vulnerable is to band together. “It’s a heinous act, a criminal act, and it is not to be tolerated or excused. It has to be called out for what it is—a hate crime. I gave birth to this bar, it’s like someone harming my child. I’m very defensive and protective of this place.” A lawyer in his earlier professional life, it had been Minko’s dream to own his own business. A bar seemed a good idea, “because I don’t have many skills apart from getting people drunk and making sure people have a good time.” The warm and witty Minko was determined to keep this philosophy uppermost. “You’ve got to get back on the horse and keep going. We can’t give into our fears, otherwise we LGBTQ people wouldn’t be where we are today. We’ve got to move forward. Here at Alibi we stand proud, we stand tall, and we’re not going anywhere. This bar is staying open.” He laughed. “The rent needs to be paid before the end of the week. Right now there’s no other option! Over the last few weeks I’ve seen the pride, happiness, joy, and love that we are receiving from the community, and I hope that we are sending it back into the community.” Asked what he wanted to let the public know following the arrest of the suspect, Minko laughed again. “That we’re open seven days a week from 5pm to 4am.” The recommended cocktail at Alibi Lounge, he added, was the “Elegance Is an Attitude.” If you have information, call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782); or via the CrimeStoppers website or on Twitter @NYPDTips.
