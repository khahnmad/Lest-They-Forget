report brennan used preliminary data new analysis found overall murder rate across entire us rose 7.8 percent 2015 2016 estimate murder rate would still nearly half 25 years sizable increase nonetheless brennan reports based early estimates fbi release full 2016 crime data whole us later year brennan reports give us early peek likely come throughout reports brennan repeatedly emphasized

two hypothesized versions ferguson effect one black lives matter protests scared law enforcement officers proactive policing necessary prevent crime time criminals emboldened know police backing aggressive tactics theory protests reinforced communities distrust law enforcement making harder solve prevent crimes also possible versions playing mixed role conservative columnist heather mac donald major proponent first version theory pointed data showing protests riots death freddie gray baltimore 2015 murder rates began climb evidence favor data last year violent crime murder rates chicago rising protests police shooting laquan mcdonald need rigorous analysis connection validated richard rosenfeld criminologist university missouri st. louis studied 2015 increase murders cautiously argued version ferguson effect plausible previously told good sociological historical evidence people lose confidence police protect lack trust police believe police harassing behaving unfairly tend take matters hands one tends see preemptive killings retaliatory shootings go up. distinction matters policy mac donald version ferguson effect right vindicates proactive aggressive policing tactics characterized us tough crime policy era version right calls less aggressive tactics community engagement still reason caution rigorous study far definitively backed either version ferguson effect impact may last long example brennan projected baltimore murder rate declined 2016 massive nearly 56 percent increase 2015 another possibility echoed every criminologist talked 2015 2016 changes short-term fluctuations become long-term trend seen short-term fluctuations murder rate went steadily 5.5 per 100,000 people 2004 5.6 2005 5.8 2006 dropping way historical low 4.4 2014 thing could happened 2015 2016 whatever reason maybe even version ferguson effect two years particularly bad murders crime maybe hopefully blip long-term trend crime decline continue also possible murder rate alone gives distorted view violent crime since murder rate generally low prone large statistical fluctuations one example new orleans–based crime analyst jeff asher told expects 2016 mass shooting gay nightclub orlando florida 50 died lead massive increase murder rate city even though one particularly bad event consider criminologists still debating caused roughly 50 percent decrease violent crime murders since 1980s 90s many theories changes policing tactics incarceration reductions lead exposure one knows certain similarly experts beginning develop sorts theories may ongoing rise murder violent crime rates asher one told possible police beginning pull back tactics strategies worked reduce crime perhaps result dwindling resources university chicago criminal justice researcher john roman argued increase murders may driven shooters using higher-caliber weapons claim backed recent reports rise shootings chicago could driven contagion shootings leading retaliatory shootings needs study researchers work hyper-local trends tease plausible national story fact possible ultimate cause factor even considered yet may single national driver increases instead increases

captured anti-trans policies big problem bathrooms right exist public spaces trans people told quoting trans actress laverne cox without access appropriate bathrooms much limited try imagine day would like absolutely restrooms use home would take planning would probably find avoiding liquids probably avoiding eating maybe avoiding going public long time. trump letting schools trans kids several schools embraced anti-trans policies result one reason several lawsuits working state federal courts regards issue impact trump lgbtq rights grow appoint supreme court justice uphold lgbtq rights
