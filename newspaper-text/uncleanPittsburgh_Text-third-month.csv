But they are guided by very human emotions Last modified on Thu 27 Dec 2018 17.07 GMT With Christmas Day just gone, it seems fitting that Steph Curry already has something he’d probably like to take back. Two weeks ago, the Golden State Warriors star gave the 24-hour news cycle an incredible gift during an appearance on The Ringer’s Winging It podcast. The show, which features the Atlanta Hawks’ Vince Carter and Kent Bazemore as hosts, styles itself as more of a hang session than a proper interview; the point is to give listeners a sense of conversations that players actually have when scoop-hungry reporters aren’t parsing their every word. For 70 minutes the Warriors sharpshooter played along as Carter recalled his experience playing with Curry’s father, Dell. Had you zoned out around the 45-minute mark, you may have missed the playful digression about dinosaurs sounds (“A bone don’t tell you what a sound is,” one player quips) that prompted Curry to suggest that the 1969 moon landing (and the five others that followed) never happened. Clearly, CNN’s forthcoming Apollo 11 documentary can’t get here fast enough for them.  The blowback to Curry’s throwaway thought was swift and strong. Nick Gurol, the Philadelphia science teacher who had pushed back against Kyrie Irving after the Boston Celtics standout claimed – while appearing on another NBA players’ podcast in early 2017, incidentally – that the world is flat, was crying foul all over again. Former Nasa spaceman José Hernández accused Curry of promoting “idiotic conspiracy theories.” But not all the reactions to Curry’s astronomical gaffe were so harsh (at worst, maybe it disqualifies him from starring in the long-rumored sequel to Space Jam…). Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine mostly laughed off Curry’s remarks: “I can’t imagine he really believes that,” he told TMZ. Nasa invited Curry on a tour of its Houston lunar lab, while retired astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent a record 520 days in space, visited with Curry and stressed the importance of scientific literacy. Ultimately, Curry apologized for his comments – which, he strained to note, were “obviously” made in jest. But his contrition didn’t sit well with Irving, who had only just walked back his flat-Earth claims in October. “There’s world hunger going on, there are political things going on,” Irving told a gaggle of beat reporters. “There are so many higher things on the totem pole of society that matter to human beings. But, hey, Curry says he doesn’t believe in the moon [landings]? It’s on CNN. And they say we’re just jocks, we’re just athletes. But it’s on your channel. We’re [thinkers] but you don’t want us to be that.” It used to be that conspiracy theorists hewed to a type. They wore tinfoil hats, babbled incoherently to themselves and, by and large, were little more than a nuisance to the onlookers with the curiosity or the compassion to engage them. But in the current post-truth era, where crowdsourced information has replaced peer-reviewed research and confirmation bias stands in for intellectual curiosity, the truthers congregate online to double down on old conspiracy theories (like the Earth being flat) and breathe life into new ones (like Hillary Clinton being a lizard person). Science can’t hold a candle to celebrity, and sports personalities seem keener than ever to stir the pot. The past year alone has seen ex-NFL tailback Reggie Bush trade anti-vax views with his 2.88 million Twitter followers, retired All-Star pitcher Curt Schilling dismiss one of the victims of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a crisis actor, and even the former England cricket all-rounder Freddie Flintoff joined the flat-Earth movement. And while Irving – whose comments some say are satire anyway –is right to point out that there are more pressing matters to consider than whatever far-out notions that he and his fellow sports celebrities kick around in their safe spaces, he and Curry should know better than anyone the weight that their endorsements carries. If sports heroes can sell sneakers and sugar water, odds are they can pretty much sell anything. When the Seattle Seahawks’ Pete Carroll was reported to have confronted a former US Army general with popular 9/11 conspiracy theories, those truthers cheered the Super Bowl-winning coach for boosting their credibility. It makes you wonder how big the John Birch Society might be today if their commie-fighting followers on the 1984 Padres pitching staff had come along 25 years later. And if some of these ideas haven’t spoiled your family gatherings this holiday season, well, just give it time. Dr James Davis, an associate professor of psychology at Benedictine University, chalks up these flights of fancy to the human propensity to make meaning. “An evolutionary advantage to humans is that we are able to make causal links between events,” he tells the Guardian. “Our brains are so adept at this that oftentimes we will make causal links that don’t exist.” And when sports heroes do this, their young admirers are most likely to receive their conclusions as gospel. Gurol, the Philly science teacher, reckons “anywhere from half to 75%” of his class would believe “whatever [Curry] says.” It’s not just kids. Sports fans are another captive audience with an overactive imagination. Under the right circumstances, they could believe anything: that the NFL triggered the power outage that delayed Super Bowl XVLII to inject life into a game that was quickly turning into a blowout (“Ahh, Roger Goodell,” Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs told ESPN, “he always has something up his sleeve…); that a heavily favored New Zealand side was intentionally given food poisoning before the 1995 Rugby World Cup final, paving the way for South Africa’s breakthrough victory; that Sonny Liston took a dive against Muhammad Ali in 1965; that NBA commissioner David Stern rigged the 1985 draft for the struggling New York Knicks with a chilled envelope. Anytime things go against one rooting interest or the other, there must be an explanation. There must be a real story that just needs to be uncovered. Doubtless for some, the fact that even two highly intelligent men like Curry and Irving could get swept up in the conspiracy theory craze might seem the most far-fetched idea of all. But it makes perfect sense to Davis. In August, the Benedictine psychologist was the lead author of a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology that found African Americans to be vastly more likely than whites to endorse conspiracy theories; that’s partly because of their diminished status in society, and partly because of the all-too-real conspiracies that have been perpetrated against them – like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, the cellular plundering of Henrietta Lacks and the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Mich. “If you live in a world where it is very plausible that there are all these conspiracies against you and your group,” says Davis, “then it’s less of a jump to be like, ‘well, the moon landing was a conspiracy.’” Flat Earths, faked moon landings, lizard people: there are objective facts to rebut these theories. And if athletes still aren’t buying it? That doesn’t make them nuttier than Christmas fruitcake. According to a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Political Science, “half of the American public consistently endorse at least one conspiracy theory.” If anything, it makes athletes just like the rest of us.",2018-12-27 04:30:17,Fake moon landings and a flat Earth: why do athletes love conspiracy theories?,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

2,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/589388746/0/phoenix/local~Prison-time-mental-illness-drugs-all-commonalities-in-Phoenix-police-shootings/,"The year of the police shooting started with two shots in the back. On a cloudy morning 10 days into 2018, Phoenix police radios crackle with reports of hit-and-run wrecks and an errant produce truck near 48th Street and Broadway Road. The driver, 31-year-old Isadore Deshon Byrd, jumps from a wrecked box truck and holes up in a good Samaritan's GMC pickup parked nearby. Body-worn camera footage shows Officer David Dehority and others with Phoenix police screaming orders at Byrd for more than six minutes as he fidgets around the driver's seat. ""Out of the car!"" they shout. ""Put your hands up!"" ""He may be getting ready to run,"" Dehority says. ""Got a stun-bag?"" In an instant, the door swings open. Byrd steps out, and a BB gun in his right hand raises toward Dehority. Pop goes the officer's gun. Byrd makes a 180-degree turn and runs — apparently raising the gun behind him and giving cause to shoot, according to police. Pop. Pop it goes again. Byrd hits the asphalt as officers run toward him with their guns drawn. One asks where he was hit. The other steps on Byrd's outstretched arm. They lift the man's black-checkered hoodie, examine his stomach and find no signs of blood. An officer checks Byrd's pockets before even seeing where he was hit. They see the answer when they roll him onto his side: twice in the back, where blood soaks through his sweatshirt. ""He was angry at that time,"" investigators who reviewed the shooting said of the suspect. ""Byrd said he was having problems in a relationship and did not want to live anymore. He purposely pointed the BB gun at the officer, and he was shot. Byrd admitted he was high on methamphetamine and was drinking."" That quote, from a nearly 100-page police report, captures some of the broad themes from the 44 Phoenix police shootings this year — a number that shattered records, generated national attention and spurred an outside review. Phoenix police officials blame the surge on increasingly violent people in the city. MORE: Group issues travel warning in midst of record-breaking year of police shootings Activists have called cops trigger-happy and demand investment in communities. An analysis by The Arizona Republic shows prison history, mental illness and recent drug use were commonalities in Phoenix's soaring number of shootings. Those factors are consistent with research looking into police shootings nationally, said Michael White, a professor and policing researcher in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Arizona State University. But that alone can't explain why Phoenix police fired more times than any other agency its size in the United States, prompting outside investigations, he said. “I think the police have gotten much better, rather than worse, in dealing with those things,"" White said, referring to improved police interactions with community members. ""That makes me think that there's something unique going on here."" Phoenix, the country's fifth most-populous city, has had 44 police shootings so far in 2018, more than any of the country's four largest cities. The New York City Police Department, the largest in the country, covering a city of 8.5 million, had 13 police shootings through November, a spokesman told The Republic. As of Dec. 10, Los Angeles and Chicago had 31 shootings, and Houston had 16. Phoenix's total is significantly higher than the combined tally of 30 from the three most-similarly populated cities, Philadelphia, San Antonio and San Diego. They have recorded 12, 12 and six, respectively, The Republic found. Phoenix police were involved in 21 shootings in 2017. Facing public backlash and demands for information, Phoenix in November launched an online data page that catalogs its police shootings. Among the key takeaways as of Dec. 28: Officials said the aggregate data and information was in the name of transparency — a common refrain from Chief Jeri Williams and demand from community activists that has been met with resistance. Other agencies publish police shooting narrative details, as in Philadelphia, and video footage, as in Los Angeles. Phoenix has not announced plans to do anything similar, despite driving Maricopa County's shooting tally to 81 this year, also a record. Of the shootings it has reviewed so far countywide, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office has deemed each of this year's shootings justified. No officers have been criminally charged. Nearly one in three police shootings in Phoenix — at least 12 this year — involved suspects who had spent time in an Arizona prison, The Republic's analysis of shooting investigations, court documents and prison records found. The total number of previously incarcerated suspects could be higher. It is difficult to determine if any of the suspects spent time in other prisons across the United States because no all-encompassing easily searchable database exists that reliably captures such information. Some of those convicted, incarcerated, released and later shot by Phoenix police officers were involved in drug or drug-related crimes decades ago. Others served time for more violent offenses. The amount of time out of prison varied from decades to days. Steven Patrick Scheuer, 49, was released from the Arizona Department of Corrections on March 19 after serving nine years for aggravated DUI, prison records show. When he got out, he built a shed in his older sister's backyard and called it home. Seven weeks later, on May 6, Scheuer's sister called police to report her brother had been having drug-induced hallucinations, ""acting strangely"" and was walking around the neighborhood with a knife, according to police reports. She wasn't sure what drug he was using, but he was talking about construction lumber being in the trees and machines underneath them. She said it was like how he acted 20 years earlier after using methamphetamine. The first call ended amicably. But officers were called again that night about an erratic Scheuer armed with a knife and wandering the streets near 43rd and Missouri avenues. On the way there, officers talked about how they could detain him and get him a mental-health evaluation. When they arrived, Scheuer was holding a staple gun. He walked toward officers, who demanded he drop it. Scheuer obeyed, but then he pulled out a knife about 6 feet from the officers, raised it above his head and walked toward them, according to police reports. One officer pushed him back before retreating to a palm tree for cover. Scheuer continued toward them and, two shots later, he fell to the ground. After a scuffle, officers arrested Scheuer on suspicion of aggravated assault. Assault charges have been filed, and he is slated to stand trial in January. A prison sentence is likely. MORE: Activists decry Phoenix police shootings as 'epidemic of violence' In other cases with previously incarcerated people, the dynamics ranged from defined mental-health crises with those who never fully fit into society, to some who seemed borderline successful before falling back on criminality. Andres Arteaga, 28, spent three years in the Arizona Department of Corrections for, among other reasons, fleeing a traffic stop and fighting with police. Arteaga, who was released in October 2017, missed an August court date. A judge issued a warrant for his arrest, and plainclothed officers found him two days later near 15th and Southern avenues in Phoenix. After a foot chase through the neighborhood and a flubbed stun-gun attempt to subdue him, officers fatally shot Arteaga as he reached for a gun. Before he went to prison in 2014, investigators wrote to the court that Arteaga had a history of drug use and wanted treatment. Childhood abuse, parents who were incarcerated and drugs contributed to his delinquency, investigators said. His younger sister wrote on Facebook that she often felt like an older sibling. They weren't especially close after he was released from prison. But she took solace in knowing that he cared for her — sentiment captured in a voicemail from him that she posted on Facebook after his death. ""Hello, sister. I just want to wish you a happy birthday,"" Arteaga said in the recording. ""I love you with all my heart."" Mental illnesses — specifically suicidal thoughts or statements — were part of at least one in five of the shootings, based on Phoenix police reports that have been released for 2018 shootings and reviewed by The Republic. It's likely a much more prominent and far-reaching factor that simply isn't captured in official documents. Crises that ended in police shootings sometimes coincided with the most grisly crime scenes this year. In February, Edward Hallinan was the focus of one of them. The 39-year-old Phoenix man had been using methamphetamine and cocaine, believed people were trying to kill him, and made comments about ""wanting to delete himself,"" records show. His mother grew concerned he was developing a mental illness. On Feb. 20, she called a crisis hotline, and workers conducted a home-visit evaluation, ultimately recommending he get a neurological evaluation. He seemed responsive, but that quickly changed. The next day, Hallinan armed himself with an MP-15 rifle, fatally shot three people whose bodies were found in an adjacent yard and holed up in a nearby pickup truck. After a standoff with officers, Hallinan fired two shots and police returned fire. His body was pulled from the pickup and the Maricopa County Medical Examiner determined he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. It was one extreme case in which someone's mental health was called into question before mayhem unfolded — and where the systems that existed failed to prevent violence. Estimates about the prevalence of so-called ""suicide-by-cop"" vary widely. Some researchers say it explains about 10 percent of police shootings, while others cite it as a factor in about one-third of cases. Records released thus far about Phoenix's shootings point toward the latter. Phoenix police officers in March were investigating an argument near 59th Avenue and Osborn Road and got into a ""running gunbattle."" David Gardea, 27, smoked marijuana and drank a pint of vodka before telling his girlfriend ""I love you"" as the cops arrived and the shooting commenced. She later said he confided in her that he planned to ""take himself out"" if the police ever came for him again. In April, a transgender woman who was transitioning from male to female made suicidal statements and ""wanted to end it,"" according to police reports. After shooting a gun inside her home, prompting a police response, 44-year-old Alexis Stinson shot at responding officers who returned fire, killing her. She, too, had made previous statements of self-harm. One of the most controversial police shootings this year played out over 24 hours. Alexandre J. Aldrich barricaded himself in a motel room in June and threatened to burn the place down. He claimed to be a federal investigator and hallucinated that he was surrounded by 20 people inside the room. Aldrich had a previously diagnosed mental illness, but family members said he had refused to get treatment. Officers were called and left without incident, but they were called back the next day. While handcuffing 34-year-old Aldrich on suspicion of trespassing, the man pulled away and began to swing the arm with the cuff toward an officer. A fight followed in which an officer punched him and deployed the stun gun with ""little to no effect,"" according to police reports. With one handcuff on his wrist and the other hanging open, Aldrich kicked free and turned toward the officer. Concerned that the open handcuff could cut his throat, the officer fatally shot Aldrich. His body-worn camera fell off during the scuffle, according to police. Elected officials have taken note of residents' demands for a greater emphasis on, and communication about, mental-health training among police officers. City Council members in a December meeting called for a report detailing officer training on mental health, from new recruits going through the police academy to officers participating in new training modules. Williams said the topic was top of mind as an increasing number of calls, including those that do not end in violence, involve people with mental illness who might also be using drugs. She has lauded crisis intervention training her new officers receive and said she is working on a program to get mental-health experts more involved in dispatching and responding to emergency calls. “The mental-health issue isn’t lost on us at all,"" Williams told the council. ""We’re working hard to bridge those gaps in the system.” Joel Carson walked into a Phoenix Circle K on May 9 ready to kill and be killed. The 53-year-old man with a lengthy rap sheet of felony convictions spent the previous night smoking crack cocaine and stabbing his neighbor, police reports show. With the gun he stole from his wounded neighbor, Carson walked into a Circle K near 18th Avenue and Grant Street and went to the checkout line. There, he stood behind a stranger, raised a gun to the back of the stranger's head, and pulled the trigger. The man crumpled, and Carson turned to the shoppers who ducked for cover. ""This is not a game. This is not a joke,"" Carson announced, according to police reports. ""I don't want no money, don't want no beer. I came prepared to die!"" He pointed the gun at patrons and pulled the trigger. But nothing happened. Customers seized the moment and tackled Carson. Snipers set up outside fired through the glass, hitting him before taking him into custody on suspicion of multiple counts of assault and a single count of murder. Investigators in their reports painted a picture of a homicidal man on a mission to kill. They captured his cold demeanor. ""I told Joel the victim from Circle K had a wife and kids,"" an officer wrote. ""I asked him what he would say to them if given the chance, and he replied, 'He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'"" Investigators examined the handgun and found eight remaining bullets. Each had been hit by the firing pin, but the bullets didn't go off because the cylinder was out of alignment. If not for that malfunction, Phoenix could have had a mass shooting this year. It's cases like these that law enforcement officials have used to explain the surge in police shootings this year. Some members of the public, officials have said, have been increasingly violent toward spouses, neighbors, strangers and officers. Those people have stolen cars at gunpoint. They have been wanted for murder. In one case, a man allegedly crept to within 10 feet behind an officer, aimed a gun at his head and said ""freeze, motherf****r."" The officer spun, fired and took the man into custody. The spike in police shootings coincides with a recent uptick in violent crime in metro Phoenix, FBI data show. Year over year, the rate of violent crime per 100,000 Phoenix residents jumped to 761 in 2017 from 674 in 2016. That reverses years of downward trends but isn't a significant departure from other major cities. Williams, though she has cited a surge in assault on officers, pushed back against claims that Phoenix residents are inherently more aggressive in a radio interview earlier this month. ""We're not uniquely violent,"" she said. Police shootings are among the most polarizing events in law enforcement. They also generally face the most significant scrutiny, compared with the thousands of other police encounters every month, more than 99 percent of which do not end in violence. The reams of paperwork are voluminous, from internal reviews to determine if the shooting was within policy to criminal homicide inquiries and findings presented to county prosecutors. Despite the reinforced web of checks and balances, every case in which a review has been completed this year in Phoenix has ended the same way: within policy and without criminal charges. Not captured in the data, and perhaps impossible to capture in Phoenix police's backlogged records system, is the number of times an officer peacefully resolves standoffs with those in crisis — including in cases in which a police shooting technically might be deemed justified. Williams has come out hard against critics who say her officers have acted aggressively and are unnecessarily escalating already volatile encounters. She also cited an increase in assaults on officers as an equally — if not more — troubling aspect this year. ""While I cannot account for the reasons why some members of our community take active aggression against officers, I can encourage and create opportunities for additional training,"" Williams wrote in a statement to the community in August. ""The safety of our community and officers is the foundation of this department."" It is unknown how many suspects in police shootings have been formally charged with assaulting officers, and how that number compares with past years. The Republic filed a records request for the data in early October, but the County Attorney's Office has not provided the information. Some of the spike in reported assaults on officers could stem from changes in reporting practices. A police department spokesman in late November said Williams had no time available to accommodate a follow-up interview with The Republic, as she was focused on police shootings and addressing 2019 priorities. She was ""booked up the few days remaining this year,"" he said Nov. 29. The spokesman referred a reporter to ""numerous interviews"" Williams provided through the year addressing the spike in shootings. Her most recent at the time was in August, after Officer Adrian Cruz, 27, was shot and wounded during a north Phoenix traffic stop. “This is happening all over the city,"" Williams said in that interview. ""This is happening with different ethnicities and genders. This is happening with different types of weapons and firearms, and you name it. So there’s not one thing. It’s an alarming trend.” Two weeks after reportedly being ""booked up,"" Williams responded in radio and television interviews to a New York Times article on Phoenix police violence. Williams has addressed the uses of force more subtly at Phoenix City Council meetings, usually before the council authorizing the department's purchase of thousands of dollars in equipment. MORE: New York Times article 'misrepresents' shootings, Phoenix police chief says She has generally opted not to offer input about what might be behind the unusual year and leaned on a  $149,000 council-approved, taxpayer-funded study. The National Police Foundation has been meeting with department personnel and collecting reports to suss out what trends exist that the department might have missed. Preliminary findings from that investigation were planned by the end of the year, although that report has been delayed until early 2019. White, the researcher, said shootings and police encounters more broadly should be viewed like a chess match. Likening interactions that might end in shootings to a match where each player makes and anticipates moves, he said, can lead to a deeper understanding of what might be done differently to change the outcome. ""It gets away from looking at, 'Was the person armed at the time he or she got shot?’ to a broader focus,"" he said. ""What decisions did the officer make and the citizen make throughout the encounter that either increased or decreased the likelihood that deadly force was going to have to be used?"" Viridiana Hernandez, executive director of neighborhood activist group Poder in Action, has led an effort against police violence and city leaders she says are complicit in the shooting surge. Hernandez and others have called for a halt in increased police funding. Instead of giving police new guns, technology and equipment, the group wants to see a greater investment in their communities — places where people fear the police and have a dearth of resources, primarily for drug and mental-health treatment. “It’s the lack of mental-health resources, the lack of economic opportunities, the lack of basic necessities to live,"" Hernandez told The Republic. ""For us, all of those are factors for what lead people to a moment of crisis.” Protesters took over public comment portions of City Council meetings, including an especially boisterous one Dec. 5 that the mayor quickly shut down. The group has protested at council chambers in recent months and unfurled banners from freeway overpasses and a downtown parking garage decrying the shootings. The most significant spike in shootings happened in Phoenix City Council District 4, spanning the central and western parts of the city represented by Laura Pastor. Twelve shootings happened there in 2018, compared with two in 2017. Through a spokesman, Pastor acknowledged the increase in shootings in her district but called attention to the citywide surge. ""She is committed to identifying and dedicating existing and new resources to address this issue where available,"" the spokesman said. District 5, which includes parts of western Phoenix represented by Councilwoman Vania Guevara, also saw a sharp uptick, with six police shootings in 2018 where there were none the year prior. Guevara said the focus in 2019 needs to be finding groups that are doing ground-up community work, revitalizing west Phoenix neighborhoods and re-engaging the community. ""I think it’s more of a holistic approach that we need to take on and talk about what safety looks like,"" she told The Republic. ""We all need to be at the table."" Seeking a solution, Hernandez pointed to a recent move by elected leaders in Minneapolis to siphon more than $1 million from the police department's budget and instead fund broader public-safety efforts. The effort, which did not subtract from the number of sworn personnel, was aimed at paying for youth outreach, conduct review and a program that pairs officers with mental-health professionals. Hernandez and law enforcement actually have that concern in common. They're both critical of police being expected to handle all of society's most volatile emergencies, from people acting violently to people experiencing a crisis. Using police and incarceration as the only solution unfairly and dangerously expands their role, Hernandez said. And through time, policing has been seen as the only answer for safety. ""For us,"" she said, ""these are all social issues. These are not public-safety issues. They’re public health issues.” Officials hope the past 12 months were not the start of a new normal. Data trends suggest those hopes might be realized. The six-month stretch from March to August saw the vast majority — 76 percent — of the year's police shootings, records show. Law enforcement experts have said the increase in those months is typical each year. Williams has stopped short of saying that any single departmental change caused the number of shootings to slow in the final weeks of 2018. Time will tell, she said, whether this was simply an ""anomaly year."" Outside researchers are probing what other sociological factors might be steering people toward situations that end in police shootings, and efforts are ongoing to see what, if anything, needs to change inside the department. Meanwhile, Byrd, whose case started the year that came to be defined by police shootings, remains in a Maricopa County jail cell. Byrd has an eighth-grade education and was hearing voices Jan. 10 when he crashed a truck and engaged in a standoff with police. He was experiencing a bout of paranoia from what his attorney in court papers said is an ""undiagnosed mental illness."" Shot twice in the back, Byrd was rushed to a hospital where doctors performed surgery and kept him alive. He'll face a judge and jury in a trial scheduled for Jan. 22.

3,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/california-today-thousand-oaks-mass-shooting-afghanistan.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by California Today By Jill Cowan Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) It’s been a difficult year for California. Deadly wildfires devastated communities up and down the state. And yet another mass shooting punctured a place that felt like a refuge. My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote about a young man who survived the shootings in Las Vegas and the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks and is now preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. I’ll let her tell you more about meeting the young man, Brendan Kelly: Before the shooting last month, Thousand Oaks was perhaps best known for its reputation as one of the safest cities in America. So I was hardly surprised when Brendan Kelly described his childhood as idyllic. But now, at 22, Mr. Kelly has  experienced more mass violence than anyone should face in a lifetime. First, he was in Las Vegas last year, when 58 people were killed at a country music festival. As he recovered, he spent countless nights at Borderline. Just as things were really feeling back to normal for him, a gunman entered Borderline and killed 12 people there. He seems to approach danger — and even death — in the most matter-of-fact way. To memorialize two of his closest friends who were killed last month, he tattooed their names on his back, along with something a friend told him as they left Las Vegas: “In this game of life, no one makes it out alive.” In just a few days, Mr. Kelly will head to Afghanistan for his first tour of duty as a Marine. As I spent time with Mr. Kelly and two of his friends who also survived both mass shootings, it was impossible not to be struck by the incongruence of their peaceful childhood with the carnage they have seen in the last 14 months. They each speak about the way Thousand Oaks has embraced them, with friends and strangers trying to offer comfort and support. But they also know what is painfully obvious: Nobody could have imagined this. It has been hard for anyone to truly understand. As Mr. Kelly spent his final days in California before his deployment, I tried to understand just how the shootings have shaped him, both haunting him and propelling him forward. He never considered postponing his service overseas. His father worries that only once he is there will he fully begin to grapple with what he has already been through.

The number is more than three times the 20 measures passed in 2017, The New York Times reported.
Of the gun-control measures passed, nine aim to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, eight targeted bump stocks and other devices that increase firing speed, eight were extreme risk protection orders in which firearms can be confiscated from at-risk individuals, seven increased background checks, six tightened concealed carry laws and eight provide funding to urban gun violence prevention programs.
New Jersey passed the most measures, including a six-bill package previously vetoed by former Gov. Chris Christie. New Gov. Phil Murphy signed an extreme risk protection order act and laws on background checks, concealed carry permitting and magazine capacity.

(Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction and the Franklin County Sheriff's Office ) Three men were charged Wednesday in a 2017 fake ""gender reveal"" party shooting in Ohio that left one woman dead and eight wounded, police said Monday. Suspects Roshawn Bishop, 28; James Echols, 23; and Michael Sanon, 21, were indicted Dec. 11 on 22 counts of various charges including murder, aggravated robbery, and cruelty to animals. The July 2017 shooting in Colerain Township, about 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati, was planned and drug-related, police said after connecting multiple witnesses to drug rings. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The chaos left Indiana resident Autum Garrett, 22, dead, and the injured included three children and a dog. From the outset of the investigation, authorities were hampered with multiple false leads and uncooperative witnesses, Colerain Township Police Chief Mark Denney told the Cincinnati Enquirer. ""From the very beginning of this investigation, we met significant resistance that is uncommon from victims of crime wanting a resolution,"" Denney told the paper. Nine people who gathered to celebrate a woman's pregnancy became victims of a mass shooting, police said. (FOX 19) On the day of the attack, people gathered for a gender reveal party for 21-year-old Cheyanne Willis. She told local media after the shooting that she suffered a miscarriage after being shot in one of her legs. A week later, police said Willis admitted that she had not been pregnant. Garrett was Willis’ cousin. ""There were a lot of things we initially believed that turned out not to be true. It hindered the investigation, no doubt about that,"" Denney said. Witnesses said about 30 people attended the party but only a dozen stayed into the night. Two men entered the home through an unlocked door and fired at least 14 shots into the living room before fleeing. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

10,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/29/social-media-detox-read-books-one-week,"My mission: quit social media and spend the time reading the year’s top titles. The results were refreshing – and surprising Last modified on Sat 29 Dec 2018 11.02 GMT On a Sunday in mid-December, I drove towards Nevada City, a former Gold Rush mining camp in the foothills of the Sierras in northern California. I had rented a secluded internet-free cabin – a “tiny house” to be precise – outside town.  My mission: to detox my brain by logging off my social media accounts and trying to read 30 books in a week. To prepare for the trip, I had gone to six independent bookstores to locate copies of the National Book Award longlists for fiction, nonfiction and poetry. This was a perfect assignment. For journalists on many beats – including mine, which includes the far right and gun policy – it had been a year of escalating violence during which conspiracy theories had moved into the mainstream. By December, I was exhausted and anxious. I craved the most American form of self-care: I wanted to get away with something. My co-workers had plenty of opinions on my new mission. One of them loudly referred to it as “your vacation” whenever she thought our editor was listening. How many books? How many days? How had this happened? “I am very good at reading,” I replied with dignity. By the time I drove to Nevada City, I was already three days into the experiment, which I had eased into gently: no Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, but still occasional email for work. (I did not Farhad this assignment, in the style of the New York Times columnist who wrote about a Twitter detox while still tweeting daily.) I was not going to finish all 30 books at any cost, skimming to the right section of the right chapter in order to say one smart thing – in the US, we call this skill a “liberal arts education” – but instead wanted the books’ authors and their protagonists to collide and argue with each other, to give me some different understanding of what had happened in 2018. I arrived at the tiny house in late afternoon, built a fire, sat down on the couch and opened my first novel: An American Marriage (Tayari Jones), which follows a well-educated, middle-class black couple after the husband, Roy, is wrongfully convicted of rape and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The novel is not a courtroom procedural. It does not follow Roy’s wife, Celestial, on her brave fight to free her husband. Instead, Celestial, who has been fighting to build a career as an artist, is told that it is her responsibility, as a black woman, to heal her husband from the violence America has inflicted on him. One of the central questions of the novel is whether Celestial is able do this – and what might happen if she refuses. I was surprised by how radical and uncomfortable it felt to read about a woman who has the power to help someone she loves, but does not immediately dedicate her life to helping. An American Marriage is interested in the implacable logic of violence, the way it spreads like a disease. When I finished the last page, I looked up. It was night already, and the fire had burned out. Suicide, 3D-printed guns, mass incarceration, opioid addiction, class struggle, vulnerable young men spinning out of control: this year’s stack of prize-winning fiction wouldn’t make good beach reading material. But it did provide a very different perspective from the news. We Americans have a weird reverence for violence. Healing doesn’t get much narrative respect, even though it’s a long, dramatic process, full of tension and reversal. Helping people recover is often women’s work, and it is usually treated as if it were boring. Violence, in contrast, is treated as if it were extremely interesting. Not only in films and novels, but in news coverage, we create step-by-step guides for how an attack unfolded, where exactly the bullets hit. We do this even though violence – largely men’s work – is cheap, sloppy and usually over quickly. The best of this year’s fiction titles push back against this expectation, finding the drama in healing instead. This is true of The Great Believers (Rebecca Makkai), which opens in 1985, as Yale Tishman and his partner attend a memorial for Nico, the first of the friends in their close-knit Chicago circle to die from Aids. The novel flashes back and forth between the late 1980s and 2015, as Nico’s sister Fiona, who cared for his brother and many of his friends as they died, finally begins to reckon with the grief and trauma she never fully processed – and how much that trauma has hurt her own daughter. American violence has always been met with tenderness, the novel suggests, but there’s usually only just enough love to keep people stumbling forward, never quite enough for them to heal. “The saddest thing in the world,” as one of the men in The Great Believers puts it, is “not hatred, but the failure of love”. Generational trauma is also explored in There There (Tommy Orange), a kaleidoscopic novel about self-described “Urban Indians” in Oakland. “The bullets moved on after moving through us, became the promise of what was to come,” Orange writes in a historical prologue pointing out that the massacres and displacement of Native people hasn’t stopped: “Stray bullets and consequences are landing on our unsuspecting bodies even now.” There There has a vivid sense of place: it is the Oakland of elevated Bart trains and the hulking Coliseum stadium, of East Oakland boys coasting down the street on their bikes and encroaching white hipsters “trying to come off as confident, all the while hiding their entire faces behind big bushy beards”. Orange captures not only how trauma is passed down from one generation to the next, but also the intimate social dynamics – fear, loyalty, grief, the need to show off and the need to pay the bills – that motivate young men to shoot guns. It was a relief to read stories about gun violence that were messy and daring enough to reject the American demand that all victims be innocent, all survivors righteous, all first responders heroic. Gun Love (Jennifer Clement), a neon fairytale about a girl raised in a Florida trailer park is full of topical issues: gun trafficking, veterans with PTSD, a megachurch pastor on the make. But, written in the punchy, exaggerated style of a graphic novel, it’s surprisingly enjoyable. The guns in the novel end up talking, murmuring stories of the people they’ve killed. That’s not enough to stop anyone from using them. Alone in the woods, I did not ache for my phone, did not yearn to be online. Given the freedom to wander, a stack of novels to read and the explicit permission to ignore the news cycle, I read for hours without stopping. My only real distractions were hunger and cold. My heat came from a small wood-burning stove, and keeping the tiny house at the right temperature, it turned out, required the same kind of constant low-level attention as my Twitter feed. When the fire was out, I missed it. It made me less lonely to hear it in the background: the mutter of the kindling, the sigh as a log caught, the little coughs, then quiet, as it burned down into ash. Perhaps it’s not surprising that, in the context of a perfectly designed reading experience, it was easy to avoid distraction. But too many of the arguments about social media “addiction” pay no attention to context when they should. Many of the ostensibly “addicted” social media users are always working, trapped at our desks or in our cars, eyeing our phones, perpetually on call. Like coffee, the little dopamine hits of a “like” or “fave” are an affordable pleasure in a world of constant work. There were books that reminded me of the flatness of arguments on social media and how people and their motives are occasionally more complex than they can convey online. The Friend (Sigrid Nunez) is a magnificently petty and erudite novel about a New York writer who adopts a friend’s dog after the friend kills himself. The dog, an enormous great dane named Apollo, becomes a focus for the narrator’s love and grief. On some levels, Nunez’s novel could be read as a #MeToo critique. The narrator’s friend and mentor – the kind of famous male writer who believed in the pedagogical value of sleeping with his students – had been shaken by his fading sexual appeal and the shock of teaching women who will not let him address them as “dear”. But novels, blessedly, are not Twitter threads, and the narrator’s relationship with her friend’s legacy grows more complex. How delicious, I finally realized, that in a novel dealing with the cultural reckoning over horny and abusive geniuses, the role of the genius is played by a giant dog. The most illuminating perspective on social media came from one of the non-fiction books: Brothers of the Gun: A Memoir of the Syrian War (Marwan Hisham and Molly Crabapple). By turns wry and earnest, Hisham tells the story of how two of his childhood friends from Raqqa became rebel fighters, and how he became a journalist. (Early in the war, he writes, “I knew about as little as a western analyst”.) Hisham, who risked his life to file stories while his hometown was ruled by the Islamic State, describes his constant efforts to stay connected, the way his access to the internet was often cut off, monitored or controlled. In a terrifying moment, a soldier demands to examine his phone, and Hisham has a few brief seconds to try to delete WhatsApp, with all his contacts, before he hands it over. The image of his mobile app icons shaking as he tries to quickly delete it is impossible to forget. Twitter might be more essential to Hisham than most – among other things, it’s how he met Crabapple, an iconoclastic artist and journalist, and his collaborator on Brothers of the Gun – but he’s far from enamored with it. “Borderless, funny and cruel,” he calls it, full of troll armies and “diverse clans who fancied themselves part of the war even as they wrote from suburban American safety”. When Hisham’s work goes viral after breaking the news on Twitter about US airstrikes on Raqqa, he resists the kind of fame that journalist Twitter wants to give him: “They had expected a Brave Activist – Isis bad! Very bad! – the sort of boy you could feed some freedomspeak and parade on the conference scene.” Hisham knew what happened to those news cycle heroes: “Their fame grew and collapsed, and they disappeared.” We talk all the time about fake news. But Americans are facing another, quieter crisis: how do we talk truthfully about who we are as a country, about what we’ve done, and still see a way forward? Heartland (Sarah Smarsh) is a journalist’s reckoning with her own family history. Smarsh grew up without much money in rural Kansas, as the daughter – and the granddaughter – of teenage mothers. She uses public records and old family letters to track how often the women in her family moved or were forced to move, seeking new jobs, better opportunities, an escape from violent men. Smarsh is very good at showing how the crises of the American economy affected her parents and grandparents, who would never have labeled themselves “white working class”. But her book is most astonishing in how it grapples with the emotional lives of her parents, including how her young mother’s frustration and isolation shaped Smarsh’s own childhood. It is not easy to write with love about how you have been hurt. But Smarsh walks that very fine line, exploring why she fought so hard to break her family’s cycle of teenage motherhood, while still writing with fierce loyalty about the strength and creativity she inherited. It’s common these days for pundits to make casual references to America’s growing “tribalism”. I had not made much of this trend until I started Directorate S: The CIA and America’s Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Steve Coll), a book that opens in the days just before 9/11. In his introduction, Coll describes how frustrating it is to hear Americans describe Afghanistan and Pakistan as “lands of ‘warring tribes’ or ‘endless conflicts’”. “The region’s ‘endless conflicts’ are not innate to its history, forms of social organization, or cultures,” he writes. “They are the outgrowth of specific misrule and violent interventions.” Before the Soviet invasion of 1979, he adds, Afghanistan was peaceful and stable for decades. Its civil wars “have been fueled again and again by outside interference”. Calling conflicts in Afghanistan a “tribal” problem, in other words, is not simply inaccurate, it’s a lie that places blame for the violence Afghans have suffered on their supposedly backward character while ignoring a complex political conflict whose flames have sometimes been fanned by Washington. What did it mean that the label of being “tribal”, which Americans had used inaccurately and violently in the Middle East, was now being used by American pundits to explain the anger of their own citizens? I came back from my week of social media detox surprised at how well the endless quips and Twitter threads had stood up to a week of reading immaculately researched non-fiction and prize-winning prose. Stepping back from the inane clamor of daily Twitter made it easier to spot what is good and revealing on social media. It is not most of it, and yes, you have to wade through the dreck and babble. But it is there: take historian Kevin Kruse, for example, who translates long books and complex research into quick, easy-to-share Twitter threads. Or the writers who produce genuine insight at the pace of breaking news. In future, I may take the well-informed lurker approach, and tweet less. I keep hearing Sigrid Nunez’s dry little aside: “If reading really does increase empathy, as we are constantly being told that it does, it appears that writing takes some away.” Books read in their entirety over the week: 12 Books read in their entirety in four days at the cabin: 10 Number of the fiction books that end in a mass shooting: 1 Best opening lines: “My mother was a cup of sugar. You could borrow her anytime.” (Gun Love, by Jennifer Clement). Best poem: From Terrance Hayes’s Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin, a sonnet about Congresswoman Maxine Waters: I love how your blackness leaves them in the dark. / I love how even your sound-bite leaves a mark. Most fragrant: Daniel Gumbiner’s debut novel, The Boatbuilder, about a twentysomething dealing with his opioid addiction and learning to build boats on the California coast. This novel is very quiet, clean and smells better than anything I’ve read: wood and varnish, leaves, coffee and salt. Best writing: The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life, by David Quammen, explains crucial advances in the field of molecular phylogenetics, including the discovery of archaea, a whole new category of life. This is Quammen’s 15th book, and he writes like the director of a summer blockbuster: blasts of rich detail, quick cuts, not a second wasted. The only thing I read twice: The short story that opens Heads of the Colored People (Nafissa Thompson-Spires) is a 14-page deconstruction of the public reaction after a police shooting. Thompson-Spires is writing in opposition to the flat, credulous language of crime reporting, and she also challenges the practiced language and rituals of mourning. She writes with complete control, building a story in the precise shape of her anger. Her sentences intertwine and double back on themselves, and each one stings.",2018-12-29 06:00:17,Unplugged: what I learned by logging off and reading 12 books in a week,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

12,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/589520482/0/phoenix/nation~Stock-market-stocks-to-buy-next-year/," After a bruising year for virtually all stocks, what companies are worth buying next year? USA TODAY offers up 19 top picks for 2019 from some of the nation's top mutual fund managers. Next year's winning stocks, the portfolio managers say, will be those that can survive and thrive no matter how rocky things get. Companies best poised to rebound, they say, will be ones that can grow their earnings at a faster clip than the rest of the market, even if the economy slows sharply as many fear. Stocks that fit the profile include companies that will benefit from new product cycles, technological innovations or leading positions in emerging businesses like reality-enhanced gaming. Stocks on their buy lists also include names that are despised, well off their highs and out of favor with investors.

The reboot of the 181-year-old retailer, driven by CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and chief artistic officer Reed Krakoff, is seen driving its lagging stock higher, says Dan Chung, chief investment officer at Alger, which manages the Alger Small Cap Focus and Alger Spectra funds. Moves inspired by the new management team, such as rolling out its first new engagement ring in nearly a decade and launching its Paper Flowers jewelry line this fall, Chung says, will help make the brand ""more current and contemporary"" and boost sales and profits. He says It's an ""excellent time to buy"" Tiffany's stock, which has tumbled more than 40 percent from its July peak. ""Tiffany has been around a long time and isn't going anywhere."" This video game maker is a beneficiary of some key long-term trends: the ongoing shift towards more profitable digital gaming and eventual move to games enhanced by virtual reality and other whiz-bang technologies, as well as the demographic sweet spot of millennial gamers moving into their peak earning and spending years, says Alger's Chung. Take-Two Interactive Software has a lineup of games with a ""fanatical fan base,"" Chung says, including titles such as ""Grand Theft Auto,"" ""Red Dead Redemption"" and ""NBA 2K"". What makes the stock attractive is the difficulty of upstarts breaking into this tech-centric entertainment business, the greater profit potential from distributing games digitally and even better technology down the road that will lure in even more players. ""Video gaming is here to stay as a form of entertainment and way of socializing,"" says Chung. ""Virtual reality and gaming is a match made in heaven."" Blackstone, one of Wall Street's most powerful private equity firms, has one thing working against its shares: its partnership structure makes it ineligible for inclusion in index funds, such as those that track the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. And index funds, often referred to as ""passive"" investments, have been where the bulk of the investment dollars have been flowing to in recent years. Without the help of index-driven cash, the investment company's shares are selling at a much cheaper price relative to their earnings than the broad market gauge, says Charlie Bobrinskoy, head of the investment group at Ariel Funds in Chicago and manager of Ariel Focus and Ariel Focused Value funds. ""Everyone acknowledges that this is a great company in a great business, but people are not buying the stock"" because it's not part of a popular index like the S&P 500, Bobrinskoy explains. Given the company's 10 percent earnings growth rate and below market price-to-earnings ratio, the shares are undervalued, he says. BorgWarner makes drive trains which power autos. The reason the stock is so undervalued and has room to rise, however, is that investors mistakenly perceive the company's propulsion business as focused solely on gas-powered vehicles, missing out on the electric car revolution, says Ariel's Bobrinskoy. But that's wrong. Its technology is already deeply embedded in electric cars and hybrids, he says. On its website BorgWarner estimates that by 2023 ""it will have content on about half of the hybrids and over 30 percent of EV vehicles produced globally."" What makes the stock more enticing is that BorgWarner still has a big business in gas-powered vehicles, which Bobrinskoy predicts will ""still be the dominant fuel for the next 15 years."" More than a year removed from the deadly mass shooting at a concert at its Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas, Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core fund, is placing a bet on MGM Resorts International shares. While the stock is down about 40 percent from its January 2018 peak, the fund manager says its earnings and cash flow will get a boost next year from the ramp-up of its new MGM Cotai property in Macau, the reopened and renovated Park MGM Las Vegas, and a rebound in convention bookings after the tragic mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017. ""Given the market's decelerating earnings growth, we are focusing on ideas or companies with easy earnings comparisons and on new product cycles that will allow for growth rates to look better than the broader market,"" Rottinghaus says. Corning's big role in the fiber build-out for 5G, the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications, is just one of the reasons why Rottinghaus of T. Rowe Price feels connected to the stock. Corning, which also makes the glass used in smartphones and flat panel TVs, has seen many of its fiber competitors disappear over the years due to a fiber glut. As a result, it is poised to take advantage of the 5G revolution. ""5G is unique and will generate better growth due to the new product cycle,"" says Rottinghaus. Corning's ""Gorilla Glass,"" which is thin, light, damage-resistant and shatter-proof, will also see new uses beyond the iPhone. ""Gorilla Glass is just starting to be adopted in electric vehicles in dashboard displays and windshields,"" he says. The market for the glass will be small at first, but build as electric cars start to penetrate the market in higher numbers, he adds. Despite benefits from tax cuts and gains in net income, bank stocks performed far worse than the broad market in 2018. But Bill Nygren, manager of the Oakmark fund, thinks they are setting up for a good year in 2019. One bank stock he likes is Capital One, a leading credit card lender that the value investor says sells at a much cheaper price relative to its earnings than other big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. While noting ""there is risk to any loan in a bad economy,"" Nygren doesn't see a recession next year. That's good news for Capital One, he says, which continues to seek out new customers to lend to, even those with lower credit ratings but which they charge a higher interest rate. Nygren also likes that the bank is using its excess capital to buy back its shares, which he believes are undervalued. Online bank Ally, one the nation's largest independent auto lenders, is also on Nygren's 2019 buy list. One upside is Ally's lower-cost Internet-based focus has enabled it to pay higher interest rates on savings and checking accounts, which has attracted a lot of deposits from a key targeted customer: millennials. While critics contend that Ally will run into more bad loans if the economy sours, Nygren argues that those fears are inflated because investors are measuring the possible downside based on the last recession, which was among the worst in history. You might not heard of Conagra, but you probably have heard of its brands like Healthy Choice, Birds Eye and Boom Chicka Pop. And that's good because Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, says those Conagra brands are part of two of the trendiest and best-selling areas in the food space: frozen foods and snacking. The food giant is also at the center of the health and wellness movement. ""It's core of what they do,"" Dreyer says. ""They are very much on trend."" Frozen foods, he notes, don't require a lot of preservatives and rank high in convenience. And its snack lineup also is leaning healthier with last year's purchase of Angies Boom Chicka Pop. Are you a diehard Rangers or Knicks fan? Or a regular at big-name concerts at Madison Square Garden, often dubbed the ""world's most famous arena""? If so, now's a good time to own a piece of the teams and iconic arena, says Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. There are a few catalysts that could catapult the stock price. Millennials' focus on experiences, like spending money on concerts and sporting events, is one. Another is the prospect of spinning off the sports part of the business from the entertainment side. ""That would unlock value,"" says Marangi. The maker of software for property and casualty insurers is moving its business to the cloud. And that digital transition comes with big revenue potential as migrating clients to the cloud will generate 3 dollars in billings for every dollar now, says Michael Lippert, manager of the Baron Opportunity Fund. Insurers will now be able to outsource all things tech to Guidewire, who will manage data and everyday business needs ranging from policy underwriting to claims processing and billing. Need to build a website? Wix.com, a website building platform, can help. But the reason Lippert of Baron Opportunity Fund likes the company's stock is that the Israeli-based company also is involved in many revenue-gathering businesses such as eCommerce-based web apps, including bookings, payments and marketing help. ""Wix.com has leading market share and generates a lot of cash flow,"" says Lippert. Investors looking for a tech play with growth potential and a chance to become the next tech stock rock star should seek out companies with far lower profiles than Facebook and Netflix, says Kevin Landis, manager of Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund. Roku, the pioneer in streaming video content from the internet to your TV, fits the bill. ""If you already own Netflix, Roku is the second streaming stock you want to buy,"" he says. Roku is a pure-play on chord cutting, or the trend towards consumers canceling higher-priced subscription services such as cable TV in search of more convenient and cost-effective options. The stock is a volatile one, however, so beware wild price swings. Cree, thanks to its silicon carbide components, better known as SiCs, is also on Landis' stocks-to-buy list. The company, he says, has ""finally found a great end market for this esoteric material"": its use in the emerging electric vehicle market. One of its newer switching devices, for example, power the drivetrain of electric vehicles, the company said earlier this year. ""The stock,"" says Landis, ""has a lot of upside."" One benefit of owning Cree, he adds, is it is not an overly popular stock that every investor around the globe has heard about. Who says cash is dead, replaced by plastic payments? Those Brink's trucks you see in front of retail outlets with armed guards are still relevant, says Ward Sexton, manager of William Blair Small Cap Growth Fund. ""There's still money to be made moving money by truck,"" he says. Brink's, which serves customers in more than 100 countries, began bolstering its management ranks back in 2016 with the appointment of CEO Douglas Pertz. The new team, Sexton says, is focused on ""driving returns, taking out costs and being more efficient,"" moves that helped boost its operating profit by 25 percent in 2018's third quarter. Brink's recent partnership with Canopy Growth, Canada's leading cannabis producer, will provide a business boost. Brink's will not only provide secure logistics and cash management services for the the pot company, it will also provided transport services for its growers and retail customers. Coca-Cola is more than just a seller of soda these days. It has branched out, for example, into the fast-growing coffee business with its August purchase of Costa Coffee, which follows earlier acquisitions of vitamin water, tea and other drink-related companies. ""They are transforming from a mostly soda company to a total beverage company by making acquisitions outside their core brand,"" says Saira Malik, head of global equities at Nuveen. What also makes their stock attractive is that Coca-Cola sells products that consumers purchase on a regular basis in good times and bad, a trait investors like when economic times get tough. Medical device maker Boston Scientific has two things investors will be looking for in 2019: the ability to deliver growth in any kind of economic environment and ""levers to pull"" on its own to boost its business, says Nuveen's Malik. The health care company's November acquisition of U.K.-based BTG, a company that sells products that help doctors treat patients using minimally invasive procedures, provides an opportunity to boost profit margins. Its also seeing growth in the cardio area. The fortunes of drug maker Alkermes could be riding on the success of two drugs, says Connor Browne, manager of the Thornburg Value fund. The drugs that he says can drive their earnings, price-to-earnings ratio and stock price higher in 2019 are Vivitrol, which treats opiod dependence, and Aristada, a drug for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Online real estate site Zillow hasn't had many investors placing high bids on its stock this year. Shares of Zillow, known for its home price value ""Zestimates"" and which owns brands such as Trulia and apartment search site HotPads, are down . The stumble, says Browne of the Thornburg Value fund, is due in part to the broad selloff on Wall Street as well as frustration from homebuyers and real estate brokers regarding Zillow's buyer lead-generation system and its move to buy homes directly from sellers in search of quick cash in places like Phoenix and Las Vegas, says Browne. ""But we think these issues are short-term in nature,"" says Browne.  ",2018-12-28 05:01:03,Stock market: 19 stocks to buy next year,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

The stock market suddenly was no longer a one-way bet, and every selloff sparked fresh worries. Readers were captivated by family feuds and battled over #FakeNews. There’s still no end to the debate over the best time to start taking Social Security, though we tried to end that one with this test of Social Security calculators. Retirement is more than that, however, and seemingly everyone had an opinion about the FIRE movement (financial independence, retire early), though not always expressed as vociferously as Suze Orman did. That sparked a whole other debate over whether $5 million is the magic number. And, perhaps surprisingly, readers really wanted to know if their local Sears or Lowe’s was shutting its doors. In case you missed them, these are 10 of MarketWatch’s most-read articles of 2018. You probably won’t agree with this chart. Fake news travels fast, especially when there’s a political agenda attached to it. The wife of a Supreme Court justice was swept up in this fake item about the migrant caravan — another popular read. This is just through Oct. 27, just after the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The numbers have swollen since then, of course, and the number of mass shootings, as compiled by Gun Violence Archive, an independent data-collection and research group, reached 337 through Dec. 27, by its count — almost one per day. The most popular Moneyist column of the year: My new wife wanted to live with me for free, even though she had $800,000 in the bank — so I asked her to move out.

Of course not. As a year ticks into its final hours, old acquaintances are front of mind, sometimes painfully so. It lends a certain melancholy sweetness to the whole ritual. We mark a milestone reached, but we also remember all that we have lost along the way. Meaning personal losses, yes: a dad, a friend, a child, a husband or a sister who once was here but has since turned to memory. But it’s a moment for remembering our public losses, too. Like Sen. John McCain and former President George H.W. Bush, two towering statesmen who died at a time when statesmanship is in short supply. We lost Dennis Edwards, whose raw, serrated vocals lifted the Temptations to “Cloud Nine.” We lost the Queen, Aretha Franklin, whose voice was a kinetic fire, burning away everything but truth. And we lost Stan “The Man” Lee, the creative genius who made generations of us believe in spider powers, misunderstood mutants, a rainbow bridge and the sovereign nation of Wakanda. ‘Nuff said. But the signature loss of this year was neither personal nor public. No, 2018 will go down as the year we lost ourselves. Although, granted, we’ve been losing ourselves for a while now. Americans cherish a self-image as a people who, while they may make a wrong turn here and there, are ultimately noble, ultimately compassionate, ultimately selfless and ultimately driven and defined by vision, values and verities that make us unique among nations. Or as Bruce Springsteen sang in a song called “Long Walk Home,” “That flag flying over the courthouse means certain things are set in stone — who we are, what we’ll do, and what we won’t.” He sang that back in 2007, using the walk home as a metaphor for bridging the gulf between what America is supposed to be and what it too often was back when the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina were still fresh wounds. But his assertion of American identity seems critical now in ways that were unimaginable then. Meaning, back before we were a nation where survivors of a mass shooting were derided as “crisis actors.” A nation whose president defends Russia and Saudi Arabia against the American intelligence community. A nation where the government ignored a government report forecasting dire climate-change consequences. A nation where Republicans commit voter suppression and other acts of political thuggery in plain sight. A nation that used tear gas against children in diapers. “This isn’t us.” That’s what people keep saying. But it is. That’s the entire point. The abiding anger, the situational morality, the disregard for fact, the cruelty, the political gangsterism, these things are what America, writ large, now stands for. And when Springsteen sings of “who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t,” well, who the hell knows anymore? And yet . . . This was the year women ran for office in blockbuster numbers, as Democrats won the House, picked up red-state gubernatorial wins and served notice. Because for all the talk of a blue wave, this was actually a wave of youth, femininity and color as Democratic voters sent to Congress its first Native American and Muslim women and the youngest congresswoman ever, a 29-year-old Latina activist named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Yes, 2018 was also the year Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Beto O’Rourke lost their races in Georgia, Florida and Texas, respectively, but even in that, they electrified the electorate, fracturing the conventional wisdom that a progressive agenda cannot gain traction. The aforementioned political thuggery suggests the GOP knows better. You don’t try to stop people from voting (as happened in Georgia and elsewhere) if you don’t think their candidates can win. You don’t strip winners of power (as happened with Wisconsin’s incoming Democratic governor and attorney general) if you don’t fear what that victory means. So yes, conservatives understand what happened here, and it has them scared. Liberals must understand it, too. It will lend them hope. And hope, one hopes, will breed new activism and involvement, will help people who may not have considered politics before to realize that they have the ability and the responsibility to create government that looks like all of us and reflects the majority’s values. Maybe this, in turn, will breed more waves of youth, femininity and color, as more of us decide to take America at its word about forming that more perfect union. Maybe this year means all of that. Or at least, so we are now empowered to hope. There’s an old Chi-Lites song that says, “Give more power to the people.” But in a democracy, power is not a thing you wait to be given. Rather, it is a thing you take — something the left once knew but somehow forgot until, perhaps, just now. In reclaiming that knowledge, we write a cautiously optimistic coda to a godawful year – properly sobered by all that we have lost but also buoyed by what we have perhaps found. Springsteen was right. It’s going to be a long walk home. But at least now, for the first time in a very long time, we seem to remember the way. Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. In this Jan. 1, 2017 file photo, revelers celebrate the new year as confetti flies over New York's Times Square. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) The year 2018 saw continued pressure against the mainstream news media, deadly attacks against reporters and persistent calls of ""fake news."" But when the famous ball descends in Times Square on Monday to usher in 2019, reporters will receive a singular honor. Organizers say the festivities will celebrate journalism and press freedom. The honor was confirmed via Twitter by event organizers. According to the Reuters news service, two attacks in particular influenced organizers with the Times Square Alliance as they discussed in the fall who should get to initiate the ceremonial ball drop seconds before midnight. One was the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Saudi writer and activist whose work appeared in The Washington Post. He was killed inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. The other key event: the mass shooting in June at The Capital, a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, in which five employees were killed. “Throughout the year it’s been a big issue,” Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said in an interview, according to Reuters. “Times Square itself is the ultimate agora and public space.” Tompkins pointed out that the famed Midtown Manhattan zone was named after The New York Times, and that it was a Times publisher, Adolf Ochs, who began the tradition of the ball drop in 1907. Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the Times Square Alliance approached his group because of “the perception that the journalism and journalists in particular are under threat and their role is being questioned.” Various news outlets said that apart from Simon, designated honorees include NBC Nightly News and ""Dateline NBC"" anchor Lester Holt, ABC News chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz, Fox News Channel's own Jon Scott, and Karen Attiah, global opinions editor at The Washington Post. The button press has in previous years been performed by notables including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, an Iraq War veteran, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the singer Lady Gaga, Reuters reported.

          / CBS News What about the year gone by?  Time for one last look with Jane Pauley: The year began with California becoming the sixth state to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana. Later in the month, a judge sentenced physician Larry Nassar to up to 175 years in jail for sexually abusing more than 250 girls. February brought the Winter Olympics to South Korea; and a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 students and staff members. Survivors launched a campaign for stricter gun laws … …Which brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to Washington for a rally, the March For Our Lives. Facebook executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress to defend his company over data breaches; and Stormy Daniels took center stage after President Trump denied paying off the former stripper over their alleged encounter. Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano sprang to life in May, spewing ash thousands of feet in the air. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear pact; and some 29 million viewers tuned in to see American Meghan Markle marry Prince Harry. June brought reports that migrant children had been separated from their parents as part of President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" border policy; and the President traveled to Singapore to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to meet with a North Korean leader. France won the World Cup, defeating Croatia; and President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, replacing the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. August saw the passing of two giants: Aretha Franklin, the ""Queen of Soul""; and Arizona Senator John McCain. Christine Blasey Ford found herself in the headlines in September, after she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assault during high school. After televised and hotly-debated Congressional hearings, Kavanaugh was later confirmed to the Court. Hurricane Michael made landfall. And there was more gun violence: 11 died after a gunman opened fire at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The month also brought the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, thought to be the work of agents of Saudi Arabia. The mid-term elections saw the Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives. On the West Coast, wildfires left 88 dead in the massive Camp Fire. And there was still another mass shooting, this time at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. We laid former President George H.W. Bush to rest in Texas. Later in the month, a deadlock over funding for President Trump's border wall led to a partial shutdown of the federal government, which continues to this day. Story produced by Julie Kracov.

18,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/fcNtG-9Gvic/,"A Broward County safety commission report on the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, found Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had holes in its security measures and protocol. The draft report found several campus doors were unlocked and unsupervised, and that there were no designated areas for students to hide. It also found the school had too few security cameras and no campus-wide PA system that could have been used to alert students and faculty of the threat. According to the report, school personnel failed on multiple occasions to alert authorities or call a ""Code Red,"" which locks down the school, upon seeing the suspected shooter on or near the campus. The commission says one school monitor saw the suspected shooter walk onto campus with a rifle bag, but that they did not call a Code Red. Another security monitor reportedly failed to order a lockdown and hid in a closet when shots rang out. The school's resource officer, the only armed school official on campus, reportedly ""failed to act consistent with his training"" and hid for nearly 48 minutes. The commission's report also alleges several county deputies failed to enter the building even after hearing gunshots. Local police didn't enter the building until five minutes after the shooting ended. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

20,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/31/from-plastic-straws-to-pet-cpr-how-new-california-laws-could-change-your-life-in-2019/,"Trending: The beginning of a new year is a time for tradition: Revelry late into the night. Resolutions for self-improvement. Hundreds of laws taking effect in California. Here are some of the new policies — the useful, the controversial, and the downright quirky — that could change your life starting Jan. 1. Worker pay As California’s minimum wage gradually climbs to $15 per hour, workers can expect another bump in their paychecks in the new year: The base hourly wage increases to $12 for companies with 26 or more employees and $11 for smaller businesses. California will also begin phasing in Assembly Bill 1066, a controversial expansion of overtime pay rules for farms that bring them in line with other industries. Within four years, agricultural workers on large farms will eventually receive time-and-a-half wages for working more than eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. Small farms have three extra years to comply. Sexual misconduct The first year of the #MeToo movement against workplace sexual harassment brought enormous changes to the country and to the California capitol, including some new protections at the office. Senate Bill 820 forbids companies from forcing employees who settle sexual harassment complaints to sign non-disclosure agreements that prevent them from speaking out about what happened. While a victim can still choose to keep his or her name private, the perpetrator’s name can no longer be confidential. Senate Bill 1300 similarly bans the business practice of requiring workers to sign releases of liability as a condition of continued employment or in exchange for a bonus. Under Senate Bill 1343, nearly every California employee will now receive biannual sexual harassment training. The gains extend into the legal system. Assembly Bill 1619 provides victims up to a decade to seek civil damages from a sexual assault, while Assembly Bill 3118 will require the state to complete an audit of untested rape kits, which likely number in the ten of thousands, by July. And women will be guaranteed a larger role in the state’s corporate leadership. Senate Bill 826 compels public companies in California to have at least one female director on their boards by the end of the year. Gun control California continues to tighten what are already among the strictest firearms regulations in the country. Senate Bill 1100 raises the age limit for the purchase of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, from 18 to 21. The state already restricts handgun purchases to adults 21 and older. Assembly Bill 2103 requires applicants to undergo a minimum of eight hours of training and pass a live-fire shooting test to receive a concealed carry weapons permit. Under Assembly Bill 3129, anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence going forward will lose his or her right to own a firearm.
Senate Bill 1200 adds magazines and ammunition to the list of items that can be temporarily confiscated with a gun violence restraining order. “Bump stocks,” the rapid-fire device used in the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas, are now explicitly banned in California because of Senate Bill 1346.
Elections With Californians increasingly voting by mail, the state is taking steps to make the process easier and more accessible. Assembly Bill 216 requires elections officials to provide prepaid mail ballots, so you won’t have to supply your own stamp for the return envelope ever again. Gender identification Californians who don’t identify as either male or female will now have a third option for their driver’s licenses: Senate Bill 179 creates a “nonbinary” gender category, designated by the letter “X.” The law previously made it easier for individuals to change their gender, including to nonbinary, on official documents such as birth certificates by removing a requirement for a court order or proof of clinical treatment. Restaurant orders If you enjoy sipping from a plastic straw while dining out, you’ll have to make a special request to your waiter. Assembly Bill 1884 aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of single-use plastic items by prohibiting full-service restaurants from providing straws unless a customer asks. In an effort to combat childhood obesity and other diseases linked to sugar consumption, Senate Bill 1192 requires establishments that market kid’s meals to serve water or unflavored milk as the default drink. Customers can still order an alternative like soda and juice. Selling homemade food is no longer illegal, thanks to a permit for small home cooking operations created by Assembly Bill 626. So feel free to buy that ceviche through Facebook. Police shootings Amid growing public outcry and protest over police shootings, California has taken steps to increase transparency and accountability around officer killings of civilians. Senate Bill 1421 opens public access to internal investigations of incidents where police killed or seriously injured someone, as well to sustained findings of sexual assault and lying on the job. Starting in July, Assembly Bill 748 will require law enforcement agencies to release audio or video footage within 45 days of a shooting or other incidents involving serious use of force, unless it would interfere with an active investigation. Criminal justice With recreational marijuana now legal in California, individuals can petition to overturn or reduce old convictions for possession, cultivation and distribution. Assembly Bill 1793 simplifies that process by directing the state to identify by July all offenses eligible for expungement or resentencing, and if prosecutors do not object, clean up those criminal records. More than 200,000 cases could be affected. A pair of laws to limit the prosecution of minors, and encourage rehabilitation over punishment, also takes effect: Senate Bill 439 establishes 12 years as the minimum age for prosecution in juvenile court, unless a minor younger than 12 has committed murder or rape. Senate Bill 1391 eliminates the ability to try a defendant under the age of 16 as an adult, thereby sending them to prison instead of a juvenile detention facility. Under Senate Bill 1046, Californians found guilty of driving under the influence will have to temporarily install breathalyzers in their vehicles to get their driver’s licenses back. Health insurance California moved aggressively to expand health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and it is protecting those gains as the Trump administration works to undo the law. Senate Bill 910 prohibits insurers from offering short-term health plans in the state. It blocks a recent federal rule that would reintroduce low-cost, bare-bones health insurance to the marketplace, allowing companies to offer temporary plans that may cap benefits, exclude prescription drugs and services like mental health care, and be denied to patients with pre-existing conditions. Senate Bill 1375 prevents employers from joining forces to form their own “association health plans” that are exempt from many of the coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act. As the federal government considers allowing insurance companies to set aside more money for profits and administrative costs, Assembly Bill 2499 will require health plans to spend at least 80 percent of each premium dollar on health care.

Electric scooters The bane of some and a joy for others, electric scooter rentals are the latest craze sweeping California cities. Assembly Bill 2989 allows adults 18 or older to ride the scooters without a helmet, on city streets with a speed limit of up to 35 miles per hour. Breastfeeding Nursing mothers will receive more accommodation at work to pump breast milk. Though California already requires businesses to make a reasonable effort to provide a lactation space and breaks for pumping, Assembly Bill 1976 states that the space must now be a private area that is not a bathroom. Graduation ceremonies When an Elk Grove high school kicked a student out of his graduation ceremony two years ago for refusing to remove a kente cloth from atop his robe, it launched a debate over whether students should be allowed to represent their heritage at a school event. Those expressions will be protected under Assembly Bill 1248, which affirms the right to wear religious and cultural adornments, such as tribal feathers and leis, during graduation ceremonies. Pet emergency aid You’ve heard of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. But what about “mouth-to-snout”?

22,https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/31/texas-man-arrested-prophecy-gun/,"Shutterstock/Brandon Seidel Authorities arrested a man dressed in tactical gear and carrying a loaded gun Sunday after a witness notified the police of the man’s suspicious-looking activity. The Seguin City Police Department arrested 33-year-old Tony Albert in San Antonio, The Associated Press reported Monday. Albert was headed to a church to fulfill “a prophecy,” he told authorities. Albert carried a loaded gun and possessed a face shield and extra ammunition at the time of his arrest, TheAP reported. He was arrested on drug charges and for illegal possession of a firearm, according to TheAP. The arrest comes after 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley allegedly shot and killed 26 people during a church service at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in early November 2017. He allegedly wounded dozens more. Like Albert, Kelley was dressed in tactical gear and wore a face mask. Kelley used a semi-automatic rifle to allegedly shoot the church attendees. A cross in remembrance of Annabelle Pomeroy killed in the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, U.S., November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking The U.S. saw a number of mass shootings in 2018. Mass shootings killed scores of people at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and Santa Fe High School in Texas. Mass shootings in 2017, including the massacres at First Baptist Church and Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, also afflicted hundreds of victims and their families. (RELATED: Sandy Hook Terrorized With Bomb Threat On 6th Anniversary Of Mass Shooting) Albert was taken to the Guadalupe County jail according to Senguin police, but it is unclear if he remains there, according to TheAP. Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi promised to act “boldly” to bring “commonsense” gun control reforms to the table in December 2018. With Pelosi’s support, Democrats have coalesced to create a gun reform proposal that would require federal background checks on all gun sales, including private sales, Politico reported. The bill will be introduced to Congress in early 2019, according to Politico. The National Rifle Association opposes “expanding firearm background check systems, because background checks don’t stop criminals from getting firearms,” according to its website.

24,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/31/louis-ck-parkland-survivors-standup-routine,"Comedian said of teen activists: ‘You’re not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot’ at 16 December set Last modified on Mon 31 Dec 2018 18.55 GMT Louis CK faces new controversy over a standup routine in which he appeared to mock survivors of the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.  The comic has been attempting a comeback after admitting to sexual misconduct including masturbating in front of women. In audio posted online of a recent routine, he seeks to poke fun at the activism of teens who survived the mass shooting in which 17 people were killed. “They testify in front of Congress, these kids,” he says. “What the fuck? What are you doing? You’re young. You should be crazy, you should be unhinged – not in a suit saying: ‘I’m here to tell …’ Fuck you. You’re not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot.” Users who uploaded audio of the set to YouTube said was recorded on 16 December at the Governor’s comedy club on Long Island, New York. “Why does that mean I have to listen to you?” the comedian continued. “How does that make you interesting? You didn’t get shot. You pushed some fat kid in the way, and now I’ve got to listen to you talking?” The jokes were an apparent reference to students who survived the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on 14 February and have since become prominent advocates for gun control. “It’s a shame when you sink so low that your comeback plan is to make fun of school shooting survivors for speaking out,” one Parkland survivor, Ryan Deitsch, wrote on Twitter. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, wrote: “To anyone who knows Louis CK, please deliver this message for me. My daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting. My son ran from the bullets. My wife and I deal with loss everyday. Why don’t you come to my house and try out your new pathetic jokes?” CK also mocked political correctness among young people and requests by gender non-binary people to be addressed by certain pronouns. He also discussed his own “bad year”, which was set in train after he admitted to allegations of sexual misconduct. CK lost his TV show and a planned standup special. He told the audience he lost “millions and millions” of dollars: “You don’t tell people you have $35m. But you can tell them you lost $35m, because that shit is hilarious.” Joking that the controversy had shown him who his real friends were, CK said: “People say that like it’s a good thing. That’s not a good thing. That’s a horrible experience. Who the fuck wants to know who your real friends are? I liked having a bunch of fake friends and not knowing who was who.” He went on to say he was “really disappointed in the younger generation”, calling them “boring” for objecting to what they consider offensive comments. The routine was panned on social media. “This hacky, unfunny, shallow routine is just a symptom of how people are afraid to feel empathy,” actor and director Judd Apatow wrote on Twitter. “It’s much easier to laugh at our most vulnerable than to look at their pain directly & show them love and concern. Louis CK is all fear and bitterness now. He can’t look inward.” The comedian Andy Richter said: “You know what’s the worst, most boring kind of comedy? The kind where older white men are angry that older white men can’t do or say whatever the fuck they want any more.” “All it took for Louis CK to go from ‘fuck Trump’ to sounding exactly like him was being caught,” said the standup comedian Dan Telfer. CK appeared to acknowledge the possibility his jokes could cause offense: at the end of a bit mocking the shift from labeling children “retarded” to “intellectually challenged” he said the word didn’t bother him. “You can fucking get offended. Listen, fuck it. What, are you going to take away my birthday? My life is over, I don’t give a shit. You can be offended. It’s OK. You can get mad at me.” CK also declared that no subject was too taboo to joke about. “Yes, that was a joke about fucking a child,” he said at one point. “Which, by the way, I know fucking children is wrong. Joking about it is not, obviously.”",2018-12-31 12:22:24,Louis CK mocks Parkland survivors in audio of standup routine,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

By Tamar Lapin Submit December 31, 2018 | 10:29am Disgraced comedian Louis C.K. continued his controversial comeback tour by mocking the high schoolers who survived the Parkland massacre during a recent gig in Long Island, according to newly released audio of the set. “You’re not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you?” the stand-up whined in audio of a Dec. 16 performance published to YouTube on Sunday. “Why does that make you interesting? You didn’t get shot. You pushed some fat kid in the way and now I gotta listen to you talking,” C.K. added, to howling laughter from the audience at the Governor’s Comedy Club in Long Island. “They testify in front of Congress, these kids … What are you doing? You’re young, you should be crazy, you should be unhinged. Not in a suit saying, ‘I’m here to tell you … F–k you,'” C.K. continued. Teens including David Hogg, 18, and Emma Gonzalez, 19, became high-profile advocates for gun control after 17 people were shot dead in their Florida school on Feb. 14 — the deadliest mass shooting at a high school in US history. The 51-year-old comic — who less than a year ago admitted to creepy sexual misconduct by masturbating in front of women — continued to rail against youngsters in his hour-long spiel. “They’re just boring,” C.K. said. “F–king telling me you shouldn’t say that. What are you, an old lady?” The comic, who’s been performing at clubs around the city in recent months after a hiatus, was quickly skewered online for his latest set — including by the father of a Parkland victim. “To anyone who knows Louis CK, please deliver this message for me. My daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting. My son ran from the bullets. My wife and I deal with loss everyday. Why don’t you come to my house and try out your new pathetic jokes?” tweeted Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the mass shooting. The former darling of the comedy world — who was hit with the cancellation of an upcoming film and had to sever ties with HBO and Netflix over his admitted misconduct — also used the set to grouse about his difficult year since the scandal broke. “I live in New York. I f–king hate it now. I loved New York for 20 years. Now I’d rather be in Auschwitz, honestly. I mean Auschwitz now,” C.K. said.

The stock market suddenly was no longer a one-way bet, and every selloff sparked fresh worries. Readers were captivated by family feuds and battled over #FakeNews. There’s still no end to the debate over the best time to start taking Social Security, though we tried to end that one with this test of Social Security calculators. Retirement is more than that, however, and seemingly everyone had an opinion about the FIRE movement (financial independence, retire early), though not always expressed as vociferously as Suze Orman did. That sparked a whole other debate over whether $5 million is the magic number. And, perhaps surprisingly, readers really wanted to know if their local Sears or Lowe’s was shutting its doors. In case you missed them, these are 10 of MarketWatch’s most-read articles of 2018. You probably won’t agree with this chart. Fake news travels fast, especially when there’s a political agenda attached to it. The wife of a Supreme Court justice was swept up in this fake item about the migrant caravan — another popular read. This is just through Oct. 27, just after the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The numbers have swollen since then, of course, and the number of mass shootings, as compiled by Gun Violence Archive, an independent data-collection and research group, reached 337 through Dec. 27, by its count — almost one per day. The most popular Moneyist column of the year: My new wife wanted to live with me for free, even though she had $800,000 in the bank — so I asked her to move out.

31,http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/pf/~3/x5wUns3uObc/story.asp,"A GoFundMe page to raise money for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, created on Dec. 16, has raked in over $19.7 million in just over three weeks with an ultimate goal of $1 billion, and inspired at least one competing page dedicated to paying for ladders to get people over said wall (that page has so far raised over $$160,805 with a $100 million goal after being established on Dec. 19). The dueling pages are the latest example of how crowd-funding sites have become political battlegrounds in an increasingly divided America, with the rapidly-raised money a weapon wielded to support causes at both ends of the political spectrum. But who has the upper hand? Donations poured into fundraising site GoFundMe in 2018 and the largest campaigns may reveal the political leanings of many of the donors. Don’t miss:Trump calls illegal immigration a ‘crisis,’ but doesn’t declare emergency Two of the six most popular funds created last year skew liberal — #Metoo-inspired Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund (No. 1 with $24.2 million) and the gun control campaign March for Our Lives (No. 4 with $15.1 million) — but the GoFundMe page for President Trump’s, a cause widely supported by conservatives, remains at No. 2. Many people using GoFundMe in 2018 were also donating for the first time. In fact, 61% of those who gave money in 2018 were first-time donors. (The fastest-growing areas for donations are events, family and animals.) It’s not clear whether progressive causes are traditionally more popular on crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe or whether there’s simply been a backlash or — at the very least — a strong emotive reaction to some of President Trump’s most socially and politically divisive policies. In addition to the president’s pledge to build a wall on the Southern border with Mexico, for instance, Trump has vowed to restrict the number of immigrants and refugees entering the U.S. “
        ‘People can vote for Donald Trump and hate the separation of children. They can vote Democrat and still think the wall is a good idea.’
        ” “It’s not surprising that political causes are popular this year because people on the left are really angry about policies on the right,” said David Callahan, author of “The Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age” and founder of Inside Philanthropy, who like all the commentators in this story, spoke to MarketWatch before the GoFundMe page for Trump’s border wall was created. “But a few years from now if we have a Democratic president, we may have a lot of successful crowdfunding from the right.” GoFundMe’s latest figures, released earlier this month, are supported by other recent charitable data, which show a significant uptick in progressive social and scientific causes. The number of campaigns addressing gender reassignment on YouCaring, a crowdfunding platform that was purchased by GoFundMe in 2018, increased by 78% year over year, while fertility treatments rose by 36.5% and social justice causes increased by 34%. People appear to have found a way to make a difference with their smartphones instead of “liking” posts on Facebook and Twitter

        +0.02%.
       “Strikingly, the number of fundraisers with ‘immigration’ as a key topic increased by 117% in the last year, and those with ‘climate change’ by 112%, though both represent a relatively small proportion of all YouCaring fundraisers,” according to that organization’s annual report released earlier this year.

        ‘It’s not surprising that political causes are popular this year, because people on the left are really angry about policies on the right.’ 
        ” “It’s primarily a matter of timing,” said David L. Thompson, vice president of public policy for the National Council of Nonprofits, the nation’s largest network of nonprofit organizations. “Younger donors are asking, ‘What are the hot issues?’ You’re donating using your phone and that’s one of the flash points affecting people that aren’t used to having a philanthropy budget, and those people that aren’t used to participating in longstanding movements.” Each administration brings its own set of policies and each generation their causes, he said. “Had it been the Obama administration? Perhaps it would have been more conservative,” he added. “This administration has caused people to react. It may come across as liberal now, but it’s a matter of timing. When you’re crowdfunding, you’re not thinking in terms of charitable tax deductions, you’re acting upon your emotions of the day.” The 24/7 news cycle triggers people and helps drive donations, he added. “Unless they’re giving to a political party, people are reacting to policies and the news,” Thompson added. “People can vote for Donald Trump and hate the separation of children. They can vote Democrat and still think the wall is a good idea. Policies are what people respond to. When people are responding to immigration, they are responding to a public policy issue.” Also see:How to avoid GoFundMe scams on #GivingTuesday Politics means different things to different people, he said. “For that reason, I don’t use the word political,” Thompson says. “You could talk to five people and come up with seven definitions of what political means. Young people are more agitated. These issues are generating strong reaction and they want to do something.” Most people are one click away from giving to a cause close to their heart. “It’s very easy to do something about it now,” he added. There is, however, another reason Thompson shies away from “conservative” and “liberal” when talking about donations. Charities don’t tend to get involved in the machinations on Capitol Hill, and avoid supporting or denouncing political figures. “To maintain their tax-exempt status, charitable nonprofits cannot be politically partisan, but they can have strong public views on policy matters like immigration or abortion or marriage,” he said. “The majority of charitable nonprofits like it that way.” What’s more, Alaska — a “red” state that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election with 51.2% of the vote — was named as the most generous state for 2018. However, Alaska was followed by a slew of “blue” states who voted for Hillary Clinton: Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington and Vermont, California, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey and Oregon. (The results were calculated as donations per capita.) “
        ‘Strikingly, the number of fundraisers with immigration as a key topic increased by 117% in the last year, and those with climate change by 112%.’
        ” Other dynamics: The 2018 YouCaring report found that women are typically on average twice as likely to donate money online than men, with younger generations displaying a smaller donation gap between genders. However, when men do donate online, they tend to give larger sums than women. That could be because they tend to earn more. (Government data suggests women earn approximately 83 cents for every dollar earned by a man, an issue influenced in part by occupation.)

       fundraising features have raised more than $1 billion since they were introduced in 2015. Here are the top 6 fundraising campaigns on GoFundMe in 2018, now including the campaign for President Trump’s border wall: A page raising money for legal defense funds to combat sex discrimination in the workplace raised more than $24.2 million since it was created on Dec. 20. The page was made in response to the growing #MeToo movement, in which women shared their experiences with harassment and sexual assault. The movement has raised a staggering amount of money since it took off in October 2017, according to Charity Navigator chief operating officer Larry Lieberman, with “many tens of millions” going to women’s causes as a result of issues brought up. The GoFundMe Time’s Up funds will be managed by the National Women’s Law Center, a national women’s legal rights association. It is still active and will continue to take donations into 2019. Brian Kolfage, who is a veteran and Purple Heart recipient, wrote: “Like a majority of those American citizens who voted to elect President Donald J. Trump, we voted for him to Make America Great Again. President Trump’s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he’s followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.” “As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today. Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.” Tragic accidents can hit people hard, and encourage them to help by digging deep into their pockets. One of the most successful fundraisers in GoFundMe history was the “funds for the Humbolt Broncos” page, which raised more than $15.1 million Canadian dollars ($11.4 in U.S. dollars) for the families of the Canadian hockey team killed in a bus crash in April 2018. The page got 1.9 million views within the first 24 hours of going live and more than 90,000 donations from 65 countries in just a few days. People raising money after reading about tragic news stories or seeing them reported on television has been a trend throughout 2018, according to Rob Solomon, GoFundMe’s chief executive officer. “This year, we saw social fundraising become an integral part of bigger movements that inspire others,” he said in a statement. After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. on Feb. 14, which left 17 people dead, more than 60 fundraisers sprung up to support “March for Our Lives,” the anti-gun violence movement started by teenagers affected by the tragedy. Fundraisers were created for similar movements around the country to support tougher regulations for gun ownership, the GoFundMe report said. Social activism and donations among young people are on the rise, Solomon said. “It’s clear that with the youth of today, we are witnessing the next generation of change makers,” he said. “They borrow techniques from their predecessors, such as marches and protests, but they also leverage the most powerful new tools at their disposal: social networks.” Of course, many campaigns are non-partisan. Nearly 700,000 refugees have arrived in Bangladesh in recent months, “having been violently expelled from their homes by Buddhist extremists in Myanmar,” the Houses for Rohingya Refugees page states. “They have experienced and witnessed many atrocities. Most of these refugees have settled in two sprawling camps just over the border: Kutupalong and Balukhali. While aid agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are doing their best to cope with the humanitarian crisis, most refugees are provided with only the basics they need to survive.” Another fundraiser that sprung out of a public tragedy, the Tree of Life Synagogue Funds page, is still taking donations and has raised more than $1.26 million since it was created on Oct. 27 following a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which left 11 people dead. “Respond to this hateful act with your act of love today,” the charity description said. In addition to this GoFundMe, there was a 1,000% increase in donations to Jewish groups, CharityNavigator.org found. Ultimately, donating via smartphone is likely based on what’s happening in that exact moment. A donor could be spurred by a television commercial, cable news debate or dinner party conversation. Emotion, not politics, matters most, Callahan added. “Crowdfunding is most successful when it’s fueled by some kind of strong emotion, whether personal, social, or political,” he says. “After mass shootings, you’ll often see crowdfunding for those issues.” This story was updated on Jan. 9, 2019.

32,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_eNewpOSiT0/,"A waitress at a Seguin, Texas, restaurant possibly averted a mass shooting at a church after she reported an armed man behaving suspiciously to police. The man later allegedly told officers he was headed to a church to “fulfill a prophecy.” Brianna Jimenez, a waitress at Las Mañanitas Mexican Restaurant saw a man entering the local eatery wearing a mask and sunglasses on Sunday morning. She greeted the man and he proceeded to the restroom. She told reporters he stayed in the restroom for a long time, but she didn’t think much about it at the time, according to KTRK ABC13. Seguin is located east of San Antonio on Interstate 10. Jimenez noted the man, later identified as 33-year-old Tony Albert from Houston, was wearing a backpack, brown pants, a surgical mask, and sunglasses. When he exited the restroom, Jimenez said she got a weird feeling about him. “(Albert) was looking at me and he was saying something about, ‘Do you know where the nearest church is at?'” she told reporters. She pointed to the Door Christian Fellowship Church across the street. Albert responded, “I’ve been to that church many years ago,” she said. She then asked her mother for directions to a Baptist church which she provided. Albert then allegedly asked Jimenez to take him tot he church. She declined — stating she had to work. She then noticed that Albert was armed with a pistol. “He’s gripping it, like, he has his finger on the trigger,” Jimenez said. Albert then exited the restaurant and Jimenez quickly locked the door and asked her mother to call the police. KTRK reported that no customers were in the establishment at the time. Jiminez and her family took cover and waited for police to arrive. Seguin Police Department Spokeswoman Tanya Brown told reporters that an off-duty officer found Albert some distance away. He told the officer he was on his way to a church to “fulfill a prophecy.” The officer ran the man’s record and discovered his previous felony convictions from Houston. He arrested the man for possession of a small amount of marijuana and for being a felon in possession of a handgun. He is now in the Guadalupe County jail on a $100,000 bond, officials reported. Police said they are grateful to the Jiminez family for reporting the suspicious behavior. “(Albert) could have carried out a shooting, or he was capable of doing that, because he had a loaded handgun,” Brown stated. Jiminez said she didn’t really think about the possible consequences until later. “Now that I think about it, he could’ve taken a trip to any church and — a lot of people leave in body bags,” she explained. “That kind of hurts me, like, what if? You know what I mean? What if that really happened?” Court records from Harris County District Clerk Chris Daniel’s website reveal Albert’s criminal history dating back to 1995. In October 2016, Albert attempted to take a handgun away from a Houston Police Department officer by force. The criminal complaint stated that Albert intended to harm the officer or himself. He received deferred adjudication on the charge and probation. Several months later, a Harris County Court found Albert guilty of assaulting a family member. He received a “time served” sentence and was released, court records indicated. The felony conviction and the domestic violence assault would bar Albert from legally purchasing or possessing a firearm. His other criminal records include an arrest for allegedly resisting arrest in 2016 and 2017 and a DUI in 2009. In a court filing, Albert stated he is associated with Messianic Judaism (a religious movement that combines Judaism and Christianity) and the First Church of Cannabis. He said the latter is a “private and secretive one” stating that the members seek to “separate ourselves from recreational cannabis users who continue to pervert the usage of our sacrament,” the San Antonio Express-News reported. In addition to the Seguin Police Department, Texas Rangers, the FBI, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are investigating the incident.

33,https://townhall.com/columnists/salenazito/2019/01/01/american-civic-life-tries-to-make-a-comeback-n2538318,"PITTSBURGH -- It's just before 7 p.m. on a frigid December night, and already the Allegheny Elks Lodge No. 339 on the city's North Side is filling up quickly -- both the long bar and the tables in the adjacent hall. There's a woman collecting for a 50-50 raffle. (You may as well give in; she won't take no for an answer.) Elks volunteers young and old are manning the bar and the kitchen, where the special tonight is a gourmet grilled cheese (black forest honey ham, Gouda cheese and bacon). Upstairs a six-lane sparkling white and red art deco bowling alley straight out of the 1920s is filled with young people from a local league. The floor above that is where lodge meetings are held; it is a beautiful ballroom also straight out of the Roaring '20s. The beer is cheap and cold. The food is cheap and tasty. Soon the entire building is packed to the rafters, people lining the walls in the hall and the bar. It's as if Frank Capra made a movie in this century. Tonight is Banjo Night, the weekly event when the Pittsburgh Banjo Club takes to the stage in the 90-year-old building. The event attracts an eclectic mix of college students; suburbanites; pink-haired, inked, multi-pierced artists; and octogenarians all joining in to sing along to tunes like ""Daisy, Daisy"" and ""You are my Sunshine."" There's even a free song sheet, but it carries a stern warning: ""Thou shall not take with you."" This is not an Elks event, as the Banjo Club rents the hall every week. Still, its presence at the lodge has helped reignite interest in the civic organization that first came into being just after the Civil War. A group of young actors initially formed a social club to elude New York City's strict Sunday tavern hours of operation. Theatrical shows would end too late for them to grab a drink after a show. The Jolly Corks, as they were originally called, evolved into a charitable civic group through tragedy. One of the original members died, leaving his widow and children destitute, and they all chipped in to ease her financial stress. This moment transformed their organization from the social Jolly Corks to the service-oriented Elks. Memberships in civic organizations such as the Elks or Masons or Rotary Clubs peaked across America after both world wars, and they began falling in the 1960s when Americans began shedding fraternal socialization and front porches for television shows in their living rooms and backyard decks. Since the late '90s, all of them have rapidly faced near extinction, thanks to the isolating effects of gaming and smartphones, and the anti-social components of social media. These things erase that sense of community, security and civic duty that fraternal organizations can cultivate. By 2012, the membership at this Elks had hit a low, only 340 members remaining, and most of them were closer in age to 80 than to 70. The community was ebbing in fast-forward, and that social capital was evaporating. And something else was fading: the tradition of elders sharing stories, sometimes tall tales, passing on their wisdom and experiences to the young people in the community. It's the kind of knowledge and information you can't Google or ask Alexa to find for you, the kind of knowledge that shapes the character of men and women and a community. Today the membership is nearly double its 2012 low point. Weekly outside events like Banjo Night and the monthly jazz and bluegrass nights bring the crowds. Annual events like the Lenten Fish Fry and the very popular Johnny Cash Night, which always falls on the late crooner's birthday and typically features several Cash cover bands, have raised enough awareness about what Elks actually do that membership has soared. And the scope of its work, all volunteer, is astounding, from supplementing federal food stamp deficiencies for the local poor, to summer day camps for at-risk kids, to youth drug-awareness programs, to veterans programs, to visiting nurses, to a holiday charity drive. There was even a luggage charity drive to collect gently used luggage, totes and book bags for foster children transitioning between homes and women transitioning in or out of women's shelters. This provided a bit more dignity than the black trash bag Health and Human Services provides. They also raised money for the victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and for the Tree of Life Synagogue Victims & Families Fund in the aftermath of the mass shooting this fall. All of these only touch the tip of the iceberg of the philanthropic work this one lodge does, with many of the new members having first walked through the lodge doors on Banjo Night, looking for a place that could become a second home of sorts, a place to connect with people they were somehow missing in their lives. Too often people think that to make significant change in the world they have to get involved in global issues or lobbying the central government. What they miss is that most things that improve the world begin in a small community civic organization like this Elks -- even something like helping homeless veterans get a free haircut, interview clothing and housing until they get on their feet. That vet or the kid who gets a scholarship through the Elks will in turn keep alive the notion of service and go on to improve the world in his or her own way. Ray Link, the young ""exalted ruler"" of this lodge, says there are a dozen or so new members about to be sworn in to this Elks beginning in 2019. Even the mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, has been a member in good standing for a couple of years. Joining has been something Americans have been doing for centuries. In the past decade, we've sadly replaced our participation in churches and civic organizations with a heavy participation in politics and social media, neither of which really does much for us or our communities.

By Tamar Lapin Submit December 31, 2018 | 3:23pm The owner of the Long Island club that hosted Louis C.K. when he delivered a set mocking teenage victims of a school shooting declared the disgraced comic “a genius” and said it was an honor to have him on stage. “He brought the house down,” James Dolce, owner of Governor’s Comedy Club in Long Island, told The Daily Beast. “He’s a genius.” Leaked audio from the fallen funnyman’s Dec. 16 set at the Levittown joint – which was shared widely Monday – featured him panning the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students, who have become high-profile gun control activists in the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting. “You’re not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you?” the stand-up whined. “Why does that make you interesting? You didn’t get shot. You pushed some fat kid in the way and now I gotta listen to you talking.” The student survivors responded quickly. “F–k L***s CK and all the politicians that sound and act just like him,” tweeted Matt Deitsch. “17 people died at my high school, my friends brother watched his friends die in front of him,” added Jeremy Wein. “F–k you Louis. Seriously if you are a club in NYC still welcoming this POS into your room, f–k you too.” Cameron Kasky, a Parkland survivor and co-founder of the March For Our Lives movement told The Post he used to like some of C.K.’s comedy. “But this isn’t the voice of intelligent and edgy Louis,” he said. “This is a very angry individual.” “That joke came from what I believe was a pretty nasty place,” Kasky added. “I say that I cannot police comedy because plenty of provocative humor can be great… That being said, I find Louis’ new joke to be very mean-spirited and wrong.” Other comedians also blasted CK for the comments. “This hacky, unfunny, shallow routine is just a symptom of how people are afraid to feel empathy,” actor and director Judd Apatow tweeted. “It’s much easier to laugh at our most vulnerable than to look at their pain directly & show them love and concern. Louis CK is all fear and bitterness now. He can’t look inward.” The comic Andy Richter added: “You know what’s the worst, most boring kind of comedy? The kind where older white men are angry that older white men can’t do or say whatever the f–k they want anymore.” But the club owner, Dolce, said people shouldn’t be surprised by C.K.’s antics. “I did hear that a couple people are perturbed by some of the things that he said. My response to that is that it’s comedy. You know who you’re coming to see. You bought tickets to see him,” he said. ”I have no regrets at all. He’s a legend in the comedy biz. To have a legend play my club is an honor.” Read Next Demi Lovato thanks everyone who supported her in 2018 Share Selection  This story has been shared 160,893 times.

37,http://www.nationalmemo.com/how-the-gun-lobby-misfired-in-2018/,"Reprinted with permission from Shareblue.  The NRA had a terrible 2018. This year was full of setbacks for the most prominent alliance of gun extremists in the country. Even with a staunch ally like Trump boosting them from the White House, the NRA faced a crisis in public support, electoral strength, and financial resources. The spiral began in February, as millions mourned the victims of the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida. Instead of bowing to the NRA’s demands that victims and everyone else stay silent about the role gun availability played in the massacre, the teen survivors of the shooting started a grassroots uprising. That put the NRA’s attack dogs on defense for a change. The lobbying group was being easily bested in the court of public opinion by an ad-hoc alliance of teenagers. The NRA cried victim and lashed out while the teens got busy putting together the historic March for Our Lives. Americans listened to the voices of the Parkland students, and got fed up with the NRA’s toxic influence. Soon, corporate supporters and sponsors ended their affiliations with the NRA. Walmart made itharder for young people to purchase guns there, while Dick’s Sporting Goods dropped assault rifles altogether. The NRA angrily called the backlash “shameful” and an example of “cowardice.” For the first time in 18 years of polling, the NRA is now viewed more negatively than positively. And the hits kept coming. The NRA has been experiencing major cash shortages due to falling membership dues; its receipts in 2017 were down $55 million from the year before. The group was so strapped for cash that it even cut off free coffee and watercoolers for employees at its Fairfax, Virginia headquarters. The cash-strapped NRA cut back on investing in Republican campaigns by a significant amount. By October, the NRA had pledged only about $1.6 million to GOP candidates in the midterms — compared to the $16 million they spent on GOP campaign efforts in the last midterm election in 2014. Soon there were layoffs at NRA TV, the organization’s propaganda arm. The NRA faced the perfect storm in November, as its chosen Republican candidates lost big at the ballot box to candidates who championed the mainstream American call for more gun safety legislation. Reeling from its midterm losses, the NRA made the foolish decision to attack doctors — one of the most respected professions. Responding to recommendations from the American College of Physicians on how to help gun safety, the NRA tweeted, “Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.” From that insult sprung the hashtag #ThisIsMyLane, where thousands of doctors, elected officials, and ordinary citizens made it crystal-clear to the NRA that gun safety matters to mainstream Americans. The NRA’s public image was also shaken by revelations that Russian entities invested in the NRA as a way to assert influence over the Republican Party. By the end of 2018, an admitted Russian spy had pleaded guilty in open court to working for Vladimir Putin’s government through the NRA to manipulate American politics. The NRA has been on the wrong side of history for a long time, but has always managed to bully and intimidate its way into keeping political power. But 2018 was the year Americans finally decided they wouldn’t be bullied anymore — and made the NRA pay for its dangerous behavior. Published with permission of The American Independent.  Know first. The opinions that matter. Delivered to your inbox every morning Michael Flynn Former Trump administration National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has made more than his fair share of disturbing, jaw-dropping remarks-- like telling the former guy he should impose martial law to hold a new election or suggesting a Myanmar-like coup at a QAnon conference in May. But he seemed to reach a new low when he joked about using a newly gifted assault rifle to carry out an assassination in the nation's capital. ""We were trying to come up with a rifle that we thought was appropriate for a general, so we went with an old-school Woodland camouflage...one of our top-quality guns,"" said Jason Parker, a gun company employee who gifted the weapon to Flynn.        Sean Hannity Reprinted with permission from Media Matters Fox News host Sean Hannity disclosed during his radio show on Friday that he had made peace with a fellow right-wing radio host whose content mill had warned that Hannity's ""feverish support of the vaccine"" against the novel coronavirus betrayed his conservative audience.

38,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/590055170/0/indystar/todaystopstories~Harry-Styles-partnered-with-Second-Helpings-to-provide-nearly-meals-to-Hoosiers/,"Harry Styles did more than sell out Bankers Life Fieldhouse when he stopped in Indianapolis over the summer to promote his No. 1 solo album — he also helped provide nearly 16,000 meals to Central Indiana residents. Each of the One Direction alum's 89 sold-out shows saw a portion of sales go to local charities, including $18,983 to Indianapolis' Second Helpings, a donation which provided more than 15,800 meals to Hoosiers in need, according to the organization's CEO, Jennifer Vigran. Second Helpings provides more than 4,000 meals each day to nearly 90 partner organizations across the Central Indiana, rescuing prepared and perishable food from wholesalers, retailers and restaurants that would otherwise go to waste. To put that in perspective, a donation of that size would be enough to pay for after-school meals provided to a local Boys & Girls Club for an entire year or food support to the Julian Center for six months, Vigran said in an email Monday to IndyStar. That translates to savings in those organizations' budgets that allow them to provide additional programming and services to their clients. ""The way that I think about it is that when we receive any gift, no matter what the size is, it doesn't stay within the walls of Second Helpings,"" said Katie Prine, Second Helpings' senior director of philanthropy. IndyStar's Dave Lindquist recaps the concert here: 5 ways Harry Styles charted his own course in Indianapolis Still no plans? Here are 20 things to do on New Year’s Eve in Indianapolis In all, Styles' tour raised $1.2 million for more than 60 charities worldwide between ticket and merchandise proceeds and outside contributions, according to a July report from Variety. It also raised awareness for water conservation and registered hundreds of new voters via Headcount. The partnership between Second Helpings and Reverb, the nonprofit that made these connections along Styles' tour, was sparked by the Indianapolis nonprofit's environmental impact, Prine said. The organization saves millions of pounds of food from going to landfills each year by rescuing food and using it to provide meals, supplement pantry shelves and offer hands-on experience for students of the Second Helpings' Culinary Training Program. Part of the tour's water conservation efforts included the sales of reusable water bottles, so Second Helpings representatives at the concert sold stickers for fans to put on their bottles that included an educational message about food waste. Including sticker sales, Second Helpings received more than $19,000 through the partnership, Prine said. Harry’s gift helped prepare & deliver more than 15,818 meals to Central Indiana residents in need. We’re so grateful he chose to #FeedIndy with us! https://t.co/y1WOWNNKzF Second Helpings was one of 62 nonprofits and charities that partnered with Styles' tour. Other efforts included hunger relief, refugee aid and movements such as the women's equity group Time's Up and March For Our Lives, a student-led, anti-gun-violence movement formed in the wake of the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. Explore the list: See all the charities that received donations from Styles' tour here The June 27 stop at Bankers Life was the first time Styles had performed in the Circle City since One Direction played to 45,000 fans at Lucas Oil Stadium in July 2015, shortly before the boy band announced its indefinite hiatus. Styles' fans rallied around him for his first solo tour, selling out the first leg in 29 seconds and setting merchandise records at over 50 venues in North and South America, Australia and Europe, according to Variety.

It goes without saying that 2019 will be a pivotal and momentous time for our country and the entire planet. As you know, there is a monumental clash now taking place between two very different political visions. Not to get you too nervous, but the future of our country and the world is dependent upon which side wins that struggle. The bad news is that in the United States and other parts of the world, the foundations of democracy are under severe attack as demagogues, supported by billionaire oligarchs, work to establish authoritarian type regimes. That is true in Russia. That is true in Saudi Arabia. That is true in the United States. While the very rich get much richer these demagogues seek to move us toward tribalism and set one group against another, deflecting attention from the real crises we face. The good news is that, all across this country, people are getting politically involved and are fighting back. They are standing up for economic, political, social and racial justice. In the last year we saw courageous teachers, in some of the most conservative states in the country, win strikes as they fought for adequate funding for education. We saw low paid workers at Amazon, Disney and elsewhere undertake successful struggles to raise their wages to a living wage - at least $15 an hour. We saw incredibly courageous young people, who experienced a mass shooting in their school, lead successful efforts for commonsense gun safety legislation. We saw diverse communities stand together in the fight against mass incarceration and for real criminal justice reform. We saw tens of thousands of Americans, from every walk of life, take to the streets and demand that politicians respond to the global crisis of climate change. As we enter 2019, it seems to me that we must mount a two-pronged offensive. First, we must vigorously take on the lies, bigotry and kleptocratic behavior of the most irresponsible president in the modern history of our country. In every way possible, we must stand up to the racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious intolerance of the Trump administration. But fighting Trump is not enough. The truth is that despite relatively low unemployment, tens of millions of Americans struggle daily to keep their heads above water economically as the middle class continues to shrink. While the rich get richer, 40 million live in poverty, millions of workers are forced to work two or three jobs to pay the bills, 30 million have no health insurance, one in five cannot afford their prescription drugs, almost half of older workers have nothing saved for retirement, young people cannot afford college or leave school deeply in debt, affordable housing is increasingly scarce, and many seniors cut back on basic needs as they live on inadequate Social Security checks. Our job, therefore, is not only to oppose Trump but to bring forth a progressive and popular agenda that speaks to the real needs of working people. We must tell Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the National Rifle Association and the other powerful special interests that we will not continue to allow their greed to destroy this country and our planet. Politics in a democracy should not be complicated. Government must work for all of the people, not just the wealthy and the powerful. As a new House and Senate convene next week, it is imperative that the American people stand up and demand real solutions to the major economic, social, racial and environmental crises that we face. In the richest country in the history of the world, here are some (far from all) of the issues that I will be focusing on this year. What do you think? How can we best work together?

Saudi Arabia's Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) flagged the episode, titled ""Saudi Arabia,"" which it said was in violation of the country's anti-cybercrime law. In the episode, which was the second one of the series and aired shortly after the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Minhaj was critical of the Saudi government, in particular, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

Netflix has gone all in with stand-up comedy, managing to talk Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle and Tracy Morgan into doing their first specials in years. This year, they’ve already done the same with Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais and coming soon, Ellen DeGeneres -- also pumping out a comedy special a week. But it’s still an incredible amount of stand-up to wade through. We’re here to help, ranking each special from worst to best.
Netflix





23. Harith Iskander – “I Told You So”
Malaysian comic Harith Iskander endlessly pats himself on the back just for landing an international stand-up special. He asks, what am I going to wear on stage? How should I do my hair (he’s bald)? Should I call my special, “The Funniest Comedian in the World?” Check out my hot wife! Throw in some pointless crowd work and a hacky rimshot, and this is just painful.
Netflix





22. Fakkah Fuzz – “Almost Banned”
Another Malay comedian, Fakkah Fuzz’s stand-up is strictly limited to differences between Malaysians and people from Singapore, which would be even more reductive if international audiences had any idea what he was talking about.
Netflix





21. James Acaster – “Repertoire”
The pale, scruffy haired London comic James Acaster has not one, but four stand-up specials on Netflix. They’ve been framed as part of a comprehensive series, each color-coded and with a supposed theme. But after kneeling down for 15 minutes as a “loophole” to avoid actually starting the show, his childhood life story quickly unravels into goofy nonsense. He’s wacky, off-kilter and unusual, sure, but who has the time?
Netflix





20. Katt Williams – “Great America”
Is Katt Williams even telling jokes anymore? His cranky exuberance feels awfully tired when aimed at Trump. He’s performing to a Jacksonville, Florida, crowd (and he unwisely opens with material that only plays to that room) that likely is pretty split politically, and his bland observations barely cut left or right.
Netflix





19. Kevin James – “Never Don’t Give Up”
When did lactose intolerance become a sign of the decline of American masculinity? Kevin James makes a pretty feeble attempt at trying to jump into the culture wars of 2018. His stand-up is derivative, generic and barely even utilizes his best physical comedy gifts. He has a lengthy story about how he became obsessed with a guy who gave him a cigar that has a whiff of being a rejected concept for an episode of his sitcom.
Netflix





18. Enissa Amani – “Ehrenwort”
Enissa Amani is a German-Iranian comedian, the first woman in Germany with a Netflix original special. Her very literal and lengthy setups to every joke feel appropriately German. She’s charming and is just happy to be part of the Netflix club. “Does Netflix have porn? Or news? I’d binge a whole season of news in advance. It’d be a spoiler though.” But she falls into the same trap as other international comics on Netflix, trying to play to every different culture in the room and spreading everything thin.
Netflix





17. Ricky Gervais – “Humanity”
Ricky Gervais’s special is called “Humanity,” but it’s all about him. Not ashamed of comparing himself to Jesus to start the show, Gervais spends the remainder of his time scoffing at his critics and explaining away already bad and tasteless jokes about Caitlyn Jenner he made at the Golden Globes years ago. “People get offended when they mistake the subject of the joke with the actual target,” he says, writing off any online backlash as just a misunderstanding. Inflating his ego is part of what you’re paying for with Gervais, but this is irritating even for him.
Netflix





16. Rachel Feinstein - “The Standups” Episode 4
Neurotic, overly personal, loud and far too familiar to be surprising, Rachel Feinstein’s routine falls into cliche awfully quick. Why so many accents? And wow, you have parents who are bad on Facebook too?
Netflix





15. Gad Elmaleh – “American Dream”
Gad Elmaleh’s material is inoffensive and pleasant, but rarely surprising. Some of his weaker gags can be boiled down to, “Americans tip like this, and French people tip like this.” He’s smart at deconstructing language. But what should’ve been fresh for Elmaleh, his first special entirely in English, results in some recycled gags about “em-PHA-sis” and French doors from his 2017 Netflix special.
Netflix





14. Gina Yashere - “The Standups” Episode 2
Gina Yashere observes that most people in Hollywood think black women look either like Halle Berry or Precious. Yashere is neither, a Nigerian woman from London, and she’s uniquely funny. But you wish her material would focus more on her own life rather than on clichéd, outdated observations of American culture. One joke stops just short of insights about why racism is far subtler in Britain and defaults to an easy swipe at the South. “I treated Alabama the way white people treat Africa the first time. Wow, they have cars and shoes and s---,” she says. And how many times does she have to sing the “Team America” theme song?
Netflix





13. Brent Morin - “The Standups” Episode 5
Brent Morin is that bro who dominates the conversation at a party rattling off a story you lost track of hours ago. He’s got great little callbacks and one-liners and a hilarious observation about how if you’re a white guy, how flattering it is to be complimented by a black or gay guy. But is he still doing that butler impression of his Uber driver? How did he start complaining about bread at Italian restaurants? What’s a “sunshine hand?”
Netflix





12. Marlon Wayans – “Woke-ish”
This is Marlon Wayans’s first ever stand-up special in a three decade career, and yet you know what you’re getting with him. It’s fun, raunchy and stupid, and it isn’t long before he crosses more than a few lines, thus his special’s title “Woke-ish.” Like Gervais, Wayans also has a tone deaf Caitlyn Jenner joke. “I ain’t seen a white chick that ugly since me and Shawn did the f---in’ movie!” But you might consider sticking around for his impression of Designer’s “Panda” or an amusing, if stereotypical, bit about white people going through customs to earn the privilege to say the N-word.
Netflix





11. Joe List - “The Standups” Episode 1
White guy insecurities, childhood name calling and nearly 10 minutes about being awkward at the gym are a dime a dozen, but Joe List does it justice with a deadpan delivery and relatable awkwardness. List's best story is about how as a kid, a girl said his big forehead looked like a “fivehead.” Yeah, that's a pretty good burn.
Netflix





10. Kavin Jay – “Everybody Calm Down”
The best of the three Malaysian comedians, Much of Kavin Jay's charming material comes at the expense of his weight. But he acknowledges he’s not playing just to the room he’s in. “In Asia, parents use [my weight] to discipline children,” Jay says. “In America, I’m a medium.” At one point he even talks to some New Yorkers in the crowd. “I don’t know where that is. And now you know how that feels.”
Netflix





9. Greg Davies – “You Magnificent Beast”
“The more upset you are, the funnier I find it,” Greg Davies says to someone in his crowd. This Welsh comic takes glee out of telling charming stories about his parents and his childhood before turning them disgusting. He has one routine about getting a giant teddy bear as a kid. He named it BT, like the alien ET. Aww, how sweet. He makes us think that’s the end of the story before revealing that as a teenager, “I f---ed that bear.” He couldn’t go out with friends because he was “too busy knocking the back end out of it!”
Netflix





8. Fred Armisen – “Standup for Drummers”
Every word out of Fred Armisen’s mouth sounds like the start to some absurd, rejected “Portlandia” sketch, and I love it. Armisen is literally performing to a room full of people who know how to drum (Green Day’s Tre Cool pops up in the audience). Isn’t putting together a snare so annoying? I know! Sometimes his observations may genuinely be for an audience of one. But anyone will love his mini impressions of accents around the country and drumming impressions of Ringo Starr, Keith Moon, U2’s Larry Mullins Jr., Stewart Copeland and Meg White.
Netflix





7. Tom Segura – “Disgraceful”
Those who want a replacement for Louis C.K. in the schlubby, cynical and brutally honest middle-aged white guy department can look to Tom Segura. But Segura isn’t trying to challenge social norms in the way C.K. used to; he’d rather troll people in the parking lot or talk up how great it is to never have to leave the house. One of his best gags makes a smart comparison to show how future generations will never understand how hard it once was to buy weed. Pigeons used to deliver messages? Are you crazy?

6. Aparna Nancherla - “The Standups” Episode 6
At first, Aparna Nancherla stands out as a socially awkward goofball, her cartoonish voice enhancing silly anxieties like what to say to a pilot upon leaving a plane. But she soon hauls out a PowerPoint presentation and brilliantly manages to translate internet humor to the stage. Nancherla deconstructs emojis that look like a “multicultural boy band” or bullet points she grabbed from a Ted Talk random name generator, and she does it all in a deadpan weirdness that should make her a star.
Netflix





5. Natasha Leggero & Moshe Kasher – “The Honeymoon Stand-Up Special”
Natasha Leggero and Moshe Kasher each have their own 30-minute special, but I can’t separate these two. Leggero toys with this Texas crowd about whether or not she’ll keep the baby she’s pregnant with and delivers scathing material about her white trash family, all while embracing her own trashy side. And Kasher’s brain is moving a mile a minute as he rattles off personal stories about your horny grandmother and feminist lesbian porn, all with energy and intensity rare for comics who talk about their neuroses. But they bring crowd work to the next level when they take the stage together and offer couples counseling. It’s hilarious insult comedy with a loving and pleasant twist that shows why Leggero and Kasher make a great pair.
Netflix





4. Todd Glass – “Act Happy”
Todd Glass has put together a truly strange and subversive hour of comedy. More performance art than strictly jokes, Glass has a big band playing only public domain songs to put a button on his ironically hacky gags. He’s playing to a tiny room of 75 people, but he’s giving rants and monologues that he presents as larger than life, even asking the sound guy to give some reverb on his voice. The band taunts his “bragging” and the audience seems to be in on the joke. He even twice busts out into “song,” singing a time-killing anthem that he wrote in case he didn’t have enough material. But I could watch him for hours.
Netflix





3. Chris Rock – “Tamborine”
For his first special in nearly a decade, “Tamborine,” Chris Rock immediately comes out swinging. His practical takes on the shootings of black kids, gun control and poverty are vintage Rock. But his material now reflects his middle age. You may disagree with some of his more Millennial-bashing takes, but he shows remarkable candor and great wisdom when he addresses his divorce and what it takes to keep a relationship going. The secret is to approach it like a tambourine player in a band. “You play that motherf--- right!” Rock sure does.
Netflix





2. Kyle Kinane - “The Standups” Episode 3
Kyle Kinane may be from my hometown of Addison, Illinois, but that’s not the only reason I can relate. His material has been bleak in the past, but in this set he speaks to the moment with insightful material about why he’s still recycling in the face of an apocalypse, Kurt Cobain’s Christmas album and a theory that the Ku Klux Klan has a great chef (“same outfits, different hats”). His finest gag takes full advantage of the pulse of the country and even plays on knowing he was taping this in advance for Netflix: “What if by the time this airs, there’s no mass shooting,"" he asks. ""This is America.”
Netflix





1. John Mulaney – “Kid Gorgeous at Radio City”
John Mulaney has matured into such an effortless, likeable performer. He stands tall as he gallops around stage and proudly declares everything he says even as he’s confessing his deepest fears and embarrassments. He’s the butt of nearly every joke, but it’s astutely observational humor, like Seinfeld did in his hey day. But each of Mulaney’s stories are told with such prose and imagery. He’s never been political, but he works his way into the partisan mine field through a genius analogy about a horse loose in a hospital. We have “no idea what’s going to happen next.”

Chris Rock, Aparna Nancherla and Todd Glass have some of the best specials of the year so far

Netflix has gone all in with stand-up comedy, managing to talk Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle and Tracy Morgan into doing their first specials in years. This year, they’ve already done the same with Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais and coming soon, Ellen DeGeneres -- also pumping out a comedy special a week. But it’s still an incredible amount of stand-up to wade through. We’re here to help, ranking each special from worst to best.



View In Gallery Netflix has gone all in with stand-up comedy, managing to talk Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chappelle and Tracy Morgan into doing their first specials in years. This year, they’ve already done the same with Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais and coming soon, Ellen DeGeneres -- also pumping out a comedy special a week. But it’s still an incredible amount of stand-up to wade through. We’re here to help, ranking each special from worst to best. 23. Harith Iskander – “I Told You So” Malaysian comic Harith Iskander endlessly pats himself on the back just for landing an international stand-up special. He asks, what am I going to wear on stage? How should I do my hair (he’s bald)? Should I call my special, “The Funniest Comedian in the World?” Check out my hot wife! Throw in some pointless crowd work and a hacky rimshot, and this is just painful. 22. Fakkah Fuzz – “Almost Banned” Another Malay comedian, Fakkah Fuzz’s stand-up is strictly limited to differences between Malaysians and people from Singapore, which would be even more reductive if international audiences had any idea what he was talking about. 21. James Acaster – “Repertoire” The pale, scruffy haired London comic James Acaster has not one, but four stand-up specials on Netflix. They’ve been framed as part of a comprehensive series, each color-coded and with a supposed theme. But after kneeling down for 15 minutes as a “loophole” to avoid actually starting the show, his childhood life story quickly unravels into goofy nonsense. He’s wacky, off-kilter and unusual, sure, but who has the time? 20. Katt Williams – “Great America” Is Katt Williams even telling jokes anymore? His cranky exuberance feels awfully tired when aimed at Trump. He’s performing to a Jacksonville, Florida, crowd (and he unwisely opens with material that only plays to that room) that likely is pretty split politically, and his bland observations barely cut left or right. 19. Kevin James – “Never Don’t Give Up” When did lactose intolerance become a sign of the decline of American masculinity? Kevin James makes a pretty feeble attempt at trying to jump into the culture wars of 2018. His stand-up is derivative, generic and barely even utilizes his best physical comedy gifts. He has a lengthy story about how he became obsessed with a guy who gave him a cigar that has a whiff of being a rejected concept for an episode of his sitcom. 18. Enissa Amani – “Ehrenwort” Enissa Amani is a German-Iranian comedian, the first woman in Germany with a Netflix original special. Her very literal and lengthy setups to every joke feel appropriately German. She’s charming and is just happy to be part of the Netflix club. “Does Netflix have porn? Or news? I’d binge a whole season of news in advance. It’d be a spoiler though.” But she falls into the same trap as other international comics on Netflix, trying to play to every different culture in the room and spreading everything thin. 17. Ricky Gervais – “Humanity” Ricky Gervais’s special is called “Humanity,” but it’s all about him. Not ashamed of comparing himself to Jesus to start the show, Gervais spends the remainder of his time scoffing at his critics and explaining away already bad and tasteless jokes about Caitlyn Jenner he made at the Golden Globes years ago. “People get offended when they mistake the subject of the joke with the actual target,” he says, writing off any online backlash as just a misunderstanding. Inflating his ego is part of what you’re paying for with Gervais, but this is irritating even for him. 16. Rachel Feinstein - “The Standups” Episode 4 Neurotic, overly personal, loud and far too familiar to be surprising, Rachel Feinstein’s routine falls into cliche awfully quick. Why so many accents? And wow, you have parents who are bad on Facebook too? 15. Gad Elmaleh – “American Dream” Gad Elmaleh’s material is inoffensive and pleasant, but rarely surprising. Some of his weaker gags can be boiled down to, “Americans tip like this, and French people tip like this.” He’s smart at deconstructing language. But what should’ve been fresh for Elmaleh, his first special entirely in English, results in some recycled gags about “em-PHA-sis” and French doors from his 2017 Netflix special. 14. Gina Yashere - “The Standups” Episode 2 Gina Yashere observes that most people in Hollywood think black women look either like Halle Berry or Precious. Yashere is neither, a Nigerian woman from London, and she’s uniquely funny. But you wish her material would focus more on her own life rather than on clichéd, outdated observations of American culture. One joke stops just short of insights about why racism is far subtler in Britain and defaults to an easy swipe at the South. “I treated Alabama the way white people treat Africa the first time. Wow, they have cars and shoes and s---,” she says. And how many times does she have to sing the “Team America” theme song? 13. Brent Morin - “The Standups” Episode 5 Brent Morin is that bro who dominates the conversation at a party rattling off a story you lost track of hours ago. He’s got great little callbacks and one-liners and a hilarious observation about how if you’re a white guy, how flattering it is to be complimented by a black or gay guy. But is he still doing that butler impression of his Uber driver? How did he start complaining about bread at Italian restaurants? What’s a “sunshine hand?” 12. Marlon Wayans – “Woke-ish” This is Marlon Wayans’s first ever stand-up special in a three decade career, and yet you know what you’re getting with him. It’s fun, raunchy and stupid, and it isn’t long before he crosses more than a few lines, thus his special’s title “Woke-ish.” Like Gervais, Wayans also has a tone deaf Caitlyn Jenner joke. “I ain’t seen a white chick that ugly since me and Shawn did the f---in’ movie!” But you might consider sticking around for his impression of Designer’s “Panda” or an amusing, if stereotypical, bit about white people going through customs to earn the privilege to say the N-word. 11. Joe List - “The Standups” Episode 1 White guy insecurities, childhood name calling and nearly 10 minutes about being awkward at the gym are a dime a dozen, but Joe List does it justice with a deadpan delivery and relatable awkwardness. List's best story is about how as a kid, a girl said his big forehead looked like a “fivehead.” Yeah, that's a pretty good burn. 10. Kavin Jay – “Everybody Calm Down” The best of the three Malaysian comedians, Much of Kavin Jay's charming material comes at the expense of his weight. But he acknowledges he’s not playing just to the room he’s in. “In Asia, parents use [my weight] to discipline children,” Jay says. “In America, I’m a medium.” At one point he even talks to some New Yorkers in the crowd. “I don’t know where that is. And now you know how that feels.” 9. Greg Davies – “You Magnificent Beast” “The more upset you are, the funnier I find it,” Greg Davies says to someone in his crowd. This Welsh comic takes glee out of telling charming stories about his parents and his childhood before turning them disgusting. He has one routine about getting a giant teddy bear as a kid. He named it BT, like the alien ET. Aww, how sweet. He makes us think that’s the end of the story before revealing that as a teenager, “I f---ed that bear.” He couldn’t go out with friends because he was “too busy knocking the back end out of it!” 8. Fred Armisen – “Standup for Drummers” Every word out of Fred Armisen’s mouth sounds like the start to some absurd, rejected “Portlandia” sketch, and I love it. Armisen is literally performing to a room full of people who know how to drum (Green Day’s Tre Cool pops up in the audience). Isn’t putting together a snare so annoying? I know! Sometimes his observations may genuinely be for an audience of one. But anyone will love his mini impressions of accents around the country and drumming impressions of Ringo Starr, Keith Moon, U2’s Larry Mullins Jr., Stewart Copeland and Meg White. 7. Tom Segura – “Disgraceful” Those who want a replacement for Louis C.K. in the schlubby, cynical and brutally honest middle-aged white guy department can look to Tom Segura. But Segura isn’t trying to challenge social norms in the way C.K. used to; he’d rather troll people in the parking lot or talk up how great it is to never have to leave the house. One of his best gags makes a smart comparison to show how future generations will never understand how hard it once was to buy weed. Pigeons used to deliver messages? Are you crazy? 6. Aparna Nancherla - “The Standups” Episode 6 At first, Aparna Nancherla stands out as a socially awkward goofball, her cartoonish voice enhancing silly anxieties like what to say to a pilot upon leaving a plane. But she soon hauls out a PowerPoint presentation and brilliantly manages to translate internet humor to the stage. Nancherla deconstructs emojis that look like a “multicultural boy band” or bullet points she grabbed from a Ted Talk random name generator, and she does it all in a deadpan weirdness that should make her a star. 5. Natasha Leggero & Moshe Kasher – “The Honeymoon Stand-Up Special” Natasha Leggero and Moshe Kasher each have their own 30-minute special, but I can’t separate these two. Leggero toys with this Texas crowd about whether or not she’ll keep the baby she’s pregnant with and delivers scathing material about her white trash family, all while embracing her own trashy side.

His material has been bleak in the past, but in this set he speaks to the moment with insightful material about why he’s still recycling in the face of an apocalypse, Kurt Cobain’s Christmas album and a theory that the Ku Klux Klan has a great chef (“same outfits, different hats”).

42,https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/technology-ranked-1830501100,"The world is filled with amazing technologies, many that are so old we don’t even think of them as technologies at all. Today, we present the definitive list of every important technology ever, ranked by their importance. These aren’t all necessarily good technologies, of course. There are plenty that have made the world a more miserable place for everybody. But they’re still on the list. If you have any opinion about the fact that this list may be omitting an extremely vital technology, you would be wrong. This list is both correct and definitive and cannot be changed. And you’re wrong. Are you one of those chumps still milking a cow by hand? An extremely primitive automated cow milker was invented around 1860, but the contraption would see many iterations through the 1920s and ‘60s as the rise of futuristic “factory farms” (not yet a dirty word) would become the norm. The humble screw thread was invented sometime around 400 BC. And while we may only think of its applications in modern construction today, it radically changed everything from irrigation (the turning of large screws can raise water very efficiently) to food production (some of the first screws were used to press olive oils). Images from early video cameras looked like shit. But once they became mainstream and commercialized, the modern video camera changed the way that people captured the world around them, and eventually the way that we saw ourselves. All things considered, the surgeon’s scalpel is a pretty important invention in the history of humankind. Maybe not as vital as anesthesia, which it should be noted was invented way later, but important nonetheless. Sure, the flashlight is predated by thousands of years by the simple torch. But I’d rather not grab a torch after dropping my Apple TV remote behind the goddamn couch again. Why does that thing suck so much? The Apple TV remote, not the flashlight. Some people are old enough to remember the various home video format wars of the 1980s (remember Betamax?) and the later ones involving Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. But the VHS tape was an entire new world for home movie watching. As I wrote many years ago for the Atlantic, VHS was a medium that could wear out from too much love, as I did of a VHS tape of Michael Jackson in Captain EO when I was a kid. But for all its imperfections, it brought Hollywood blockbusters (to say nothing of porn) into our living rooms. There’s nothing that sounds cooler on this Earth than an electric guitar. That’s just science. Or, at least, the science of cool. The electric guitar made rock and roll possible. And while it seems tremendously 20th century-centric to praise rock and roll, it really was one of the most important music movements of all time. A distorted electric guitar still has the ability to sound fresh and unnerving after all these years. And I wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em. Much like the electric guitar, the microphone has transformed music in more ways than we can possibly imagine. But obviously it’s not just for music. You know who else stood in front of microphones besides David Bowie? Hitler. Escalators are just neat, okay? They’re not sexy, they’re not highly advanced, but when they were first invented in the 1890s, people would travel from far and wide to see them. Walkie talkies weren’t just playthings for 1980s kids in countless movies. They were invented for very serious business—namely, the business of killing people. Alcohol is poison. Quiet literally. But humans love poisoning themselves, and with good reason. It feels damn good. Whiskey, much like wine and beer, has contributed great things to the creative aspects of civilization. And it has also ruined lives. Good job, whiskey still. The automatic dishwasher may seem like a silly extravagance, and it really is in many ways, but it’s getting a place on this list for its unfulfilled promise as much as its direct impact on society. The dishwasher represents the failures of the push-button society. And for that failure we salute it. Much like the dish-washing machine, CRISPR is on our list for both its potential and the fact that it’s a technology that hasn’t yet delivered. MIT Technology Review even put CRISPR on its year-end list of “the biggest technology failures of 2018” and it’ll likely stay on those lists and remain a symbol of unfulfilled futuristic promises for some time to come. Sure, it’s weird to think about. But the 20th century would’ve been a very different timeline without the theatrics of the electric chair. There are a number of different things that those of us in the 21st century have a difficult time imagining. What was it like before artificial light? What was it like before the airplane? But perhaps nothing compares to the question, “What was it like before anesthesia?” The answer? Very unpleasant. Anesthesia was first invented in 1846, provided you don’t count smoking old-fashioned opium as a form of anesthesia which dates back to 4000 BC. But today, it’s standard for medical procedures the world over. Yes, anesthesia is still imperfect, and there are plenty of horror stories that you can find online. People have been left completely awake during surgery. And while people of the 22nd century will view our medical techniques as barbaric (provided society moves in the right direction and doesn’t go backward), at least we live in a time with anesthesia. Put me under for a paper cut, as far as I’m concerned. It may not have been quite as revolutionary as the invention of recorded music in the 19th century, but the MP3 still deserves a place on any list of important inventions. Taking thousands of songs with you on a tiny device was the stuff of science fiction within my lifetime. Now, it’s nothing at all. Contact lenses can be a horror show, but they’re actually pretty clever pieces of technology. For me, they were the things that allowed me to participate in sports when I was a kid without my fucking glasses (which I acquired at the ripe old age of 9) getting in the way. Yeah, I know plenty of nerds like myself swore by rec-specs. But c’mon. Contacts are the way to go. Do you remember the first time you saw a DVD? For film nerds, it was like a revelation, not only because the audio and visual quality was simply great. DVD more than any other technology made widescreen movie formats (as opposed to pan-and-scan transfers) the norm for home viewing. With DVDs you could finally see the whole movie, not just a third of it. Microwaves are good. Fight me. Modern Americans eat a lot of corn, even when they don’t think they are. It’s in soda, chips, cereal, and even fish. It’s everywhere, and it looked a lot different a few thousand years ago. Back then, it had just a few kernels on a cob. But it was “invented” to be what we know today—a food that’s literally killing us. If we step back and examine all of human technological history, the mobile phone is incredibly new. But it’s proving to be one of the most important inventions of our era. And not necessarily for the better, when we consider the applications we’re staring at on our smartphones all day: Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook has been used to facilitate genocide. So maybe we should take a break with the phones and figure out what the fuck is going on. The first mechanical computer used to be largely credited to Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine in 1822. But thanks to the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism from around 100 BC, we now know that mechanical computers have been around for a lot longer. And that makes any fan of “hidden history” excited for all of the other high-tech inventions that may have been lost to history over the past few thousand years. Recorded music turned a completely ephemeral experience into something that could be transported and listened to again and again. Music recorded on cylinders may have been the first, but the gramophone brought recorded music to the masses. And we’re all better for it. Usually. HDTV may not be the most important technological development in the past few thousand years, but it certainly wins awards for being one of the most watched devices of all time. Next to our phones and computers, HDTV is something that we literally spend over five hours staring at every single day. For many of us, it’s probably both our longest and most precious relationship. Aside from our phones, of course. Oh hell yeah. Hellll yeah. Fire, motherfuckers. Though it’s a little strange that lighters were invented before matches. First invented around 4000 BC, but not fully embraced until around the year 14 AD, Romans used the waterwheel for irrigation, pumping water, and in so doing dramatically altered the landscape around them. Indoor air conditioning obviously made living in hot climates more comfortable. But with comfort comes a change in where humans feel like they can live. Just look at the American southwest. The Sun Belt of the early 20th century was sparsely populated. But air conditioning, as The Atlantic has explained, caused a rapid population boom in places like Arizona. So depending on how you feel about Arizona you can determine whether the invention of air conditioning was a good thing. Sanitary napkins date to at least the fourth century, but many of the best innovations for menstrual protection have come since the dawn of the industrial revolution. Feminine hygiene products are still often overlooked when it comes to serving the needs of low income people and those in disaster areas, but that’s only because we live in a very backwards and broken society that should be destroyed. Some people drink raw milk. And while I don’t believe that raw milk should be illegal, I think that every bottle of raw milk should be mandated to have a picture of Louis Pasteur and the word, “Really, idiot? Really?” We take the elevator for granted, but modern skyscrapers wouldn’t be possible without them. Have you ever tried to walk up a dozen flights of stairs or more? It’s not fun, if movies have taught me anything. And it’s easy for some people to forget just how revolutionary the elevator was for accessibility. Elevators are so crucial to mobility for certain people that they even have their own section in the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act. We told you this list wasn’t going to be all sunshine and sleek, shiny objects. Modern cement was patented in 1824, and has helped define our modern age, but this incredibly useful mixture of stone and sand has been around for thousands of years in one form or another. The story of concrete is a great lesson in how sometimes the things that most change our environment are simple improvements on technologies that have been around for many generations, if not even thousands of years. When Americans landed on the moon, it was seen as the greatest achievement in space travel ever. And with good reason. But the Space Shuttle program was arguably even more important. How important? Despite the fact that the Shuttle program has died, we probably won’t know just how world-changing it was for another few decades. The Space Shuttle program was unique in that it allowed astronauts to blast off into space and then return in the same ship. But what many people don’t know is that Space Shuttle missions included classified missions and classified payloads. That’s right, America’s spies were using the Space Shuttle to launch all kinds of things into space. Maybe give the shuttle program a little more credit than it’s gotten for changing the world. Especially now that people seem to have completely forgotten it when they’re talking about all the exciting innovations in reusable rockets today. Much like 16mm, 8mm film cameras changed the world, putting home movies into the hands of millions. And while we eventually developed more user-friendly mediums, 8mm was no less revolutionary for bringing films into our homes. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in the 1790s and helped change the course of American history. It helped turn cotton into America’s largest export until the Civil War and the abolition of slavery got in the way. But oddly enough, America’s destruction of chattel slavery led to the rise of slavery in other parts of the world who wanted a piece of the lucrative cotton market, driven by Britain’s seemingly insatiable need for the product. The U.S. military didn’t invent night vision capabilities. But they sure as hell improved upon it and utilized it like no one else. Night vision was introduced in Britain in 1929 by a Hungarian scientist who was working on infrared sight. But that primitive contraption would prove to be pitiful compared to the night vision systems that were developed by the Army for the Vietnam War. And, like so many of the technologies improved upon in Vietnam (from drones to border sensors), night vision was brought back home to be used on Americans. If you ask any average person on the street if we have a cure for cancer, the answer would be no. But in many ways, we do have a highly successful treatments. It’s called chemotherapy and it’s getting a little bit better with every decade. Yes, we still have a long ways to go. But cancers that would’ve killed people very quickly just a few decades ago are now on the run, thanks to advancements made in chemotherapy. The part that’s still up for debate, at least in the U.S.: who should be able to access chemo and should expensive treatments be allowed to bankrupt people just because they got sick? You learn about the printing press as one of those “world changing” inventions in school. And everything you learned is absolutely correct. It was important. And while Johannes Gutenberg didn’t invent moveable type (check out number 30 on this list), he did make improvements in mechanizing the printing process in such a way that his name has rightly gone down in history for his innovations during the 1430s. The web wouldn’t have been possible without the internet, but the web is distinct and important in its own right. The world wide web, invented by Tim Berners Lee, provided a portal to kids like me in the 1990s who saw the internet as something truly transformative. We couldn’t foresee the shitshow that was to come in the 2010s, but for a period in the 1990s, everything was cool as hell online. The invention of television is remembered as something that popped into existence in the 1950s, but there was decades of toil that went into this innovation before it became a mainstream reality. People of the 19th century pictured a world where you could be transported to any point on the globe, even the bottom of the sea, to explore new worlds. And they imagined that TV would allow you to see and hear someone on the other side of the planet. TV has had its ups and downs, as media theorists of the mid-20th century worried that television was rotting our brains and turning Americans into little more than consumers. And they weren’t altogether wrong. But the invention of television, more than perhaps any other technology up to its invention, changed the way that we see the world dramatically. We did get to see the bottom of the sea, and the edge of space, thanks largely to the idiot box. But today the definition of TV is a bit more hazy. It’s not longer a tangible medium, it’s just a message. And the message is breaking us apart, no matter how you’re getting it. The first artificial human-made satellite was launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union. Called Sputnik, it made the Americans shit their pants and kicked off the Space Race. Not bad for a little satellite. Oh yeah, it’s also an absolute necessity for things like worldwide TV broadcasts, GPS, and many aspects of modern state-sponsored espionage. So there’s that too. Without it, there’d be no modern aircraft industry and no rockets blasting into space. So pour one out for the jet engine—a noisy piece of machinery with sometimes deadly consequences that would make the capital-F Futurists proud. Radar literally won the war for the Allies in World War II. I mean, that’s the story we’re told. And it’s nearly true. So, um, thanks radar? Otherwise we might be living in an alternate reality world where a Nazi sympathizer was in the White House. What a nightmare. The AR-15 may seem like a weird choice for a list of important inventions, but its deadly functionality has led this gun to be the firearm of choice for mass shooters in America. The AR-15 has dramatically altered American life in ways that few other inventions have. It was the gun of choice in mass shootings like Aurora in 2012 which saw 12 people die and 70 wounded. The AR-15 was used in Orlando in 2016 when 49 people were killed and 53 were wounded. And it was one of many guns used in Las Vegas that killed 59 and injured 851. The AR-15 was also used at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 where 20 children and 6 adults were slaughtered. And it will almost certainly be used in another mass shooting in the near future. The AR-15 is used by countless mass killers and America is alone in the developed world as a country that still sells this weapon to almost anyone who wants one. It’s an invention that has changed the world and will continue to change the world until American lawmakers come to their senses and finally do something about it. But I’m not holding my breath. TV may have changed the world in the 1950s and ‘60s, but radio was arguably even more revolutionary as a broadcast medium. Invented as a means to communicate from one person to another, radio became a broadcast technology thanks to advancements in the late 1910s. And pretty soon broadcasting meant that a single person could talk to thousands, and eventually millions of people all at once. It seems rather antiquated now, of course, but we wouldn’t have the world we live in today without the old iron horse. First appearing in Great Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, the steam locomotive would conquer distant lands and spread humans and commerce throughout the world. For better and for worse, of course. The mechanical clock and capitalism are forever linked. Before the invention of the mechanical clock, the notion of being precisely “on time” was rather silly. But with the clock came the ability for bosses to say, “you need to be here exactly at 8am.” So, thank you mechanical clock? You’re a great daily reminder of the inhumanity we endure every day as we’re beholden to this strange concept of “being on time.” Sometimes I try to think what might life would look like without glasses. And it’s not pretty. Yes, it would be an ugly world in the very literal sense for me, as things would be incredibly fuzzy. But I wouldn’t be able to do many of the things that help me simply live my life—like walking around without fear that I’m going to run into something, or worse yet, get mugged by a huge blurry mass of humanity. Rubber balls date back to at least 1600 BC and ball-dependent sports are even older than that. So while it’s easy to forget that something so basic had to be invented, someone had to do it. We may not know the inventor’s name (Bally McBallface?) but we salute them just the same. Many people may not think of canned food as technology. But it revolutionized the way that people eat. Invented by a French brewer in 1809, canning gave an extended life to foods that might otherwise spoil. Global positioning system, more commonly known as GPS, has dramatically changed how we navigate our world. Just ask anyone who had a first generation iPhone. I still remember pulling over in my car to input a starting address to get a map of where I was supposed to go. Thankfully, I also had a paper map at the time, but GPS more than virtually any other technology has changed how we move around in the 21st century. GPS, like most important innovations of the past 100 years, was invented by the U.S. military and was first developed by the U.S. Air Force in the 1970s and didn’t become fully operational until the 1990s. But that military-to-civilian pipeline brought GPS to our fingertips and now it’s hard to imagine the world without it. But we might have to, since GPS is incredibly vulnerable to hacking. In retrospect, it was probably a mistake. But it changed the world, that’s for sure. The thing you put in between wheels, not the singer. That’s Axel. Still good, but not appropriate for our list. The car has transformed the way that humanity lives. And it’s also fundamentally destroying our planet. What an absolutely shit world we’ve built for ourselves, eh? Enjoy it while it lasts. Which is to say, not much longer. Oil refining was invented in central Europe during the 1850s. And while it helped give birth to the world we know today, it’s obviously up for debate whether that was a good thing. One thing’s for certain, we don’t need to be using fossil fuels anymore. But uttering such an idea is still considered heresy in certain corners. Much like automobiles, it’s enabling mass suicide. And we’re doing very little to stop it. They cut things. Gotta have ‘em. The birth control pill was incredibly controversial when it first received FDA approval in 1960. It was even banned in many states—an affront to God, apparently. But like most social movements of the 20th century, the good guys eventually won. Which is tough to say today. Society seems to be going in the wrong direction when it comes to giving people the right to have control over their own bodies. Ancient peoples had some fascinating ways of navigating the seas, but the compass really changed the game and did more than perhaps any other invention to open up the world to exploration. The AR-15 changed the modern American mass shooting. But the AK-47 changed the world. It’s estimated that at least 8 million people have been killed with an AK-47 worldwide. And while that pales in comparison to the potential destruction of a nuclear weapon, that’s still a lot of death. The first condoms were made of sheep intestines. Don’t ask me who the first people were to try that, but we tip our hats to them. What absolute legends. Photography, invented in 1839, changed the world for better and for worse. Do you know how hard it was to sext before some weirdo invented the camera? Much like the automobile, this one has probably done more damage than most inventions. But it needs to be acknowledged. The internal combustion engine would be a damn cool invention if it wasn’t contributing to the complete destruction of our planet. Alexander Fleming, a professor in London, discovered penicillin in 1928 and changed the world. Large scale production of antibiotics wouldn’t begin until World War II, but once it did, this live-saving treatment made life a lot more likely for humans. It’s estimated that roughly 200 million lives have probably been saved since the invention of antibiotics. Not bad. Not bad at all. Unless you live in the 21st century, where antibiotics are becoming increasingly useless. The sailboat was invented in Mesopotamia around 1300 B.C. and had an incredibly long and successful run, helping people circle the globe many times over. The only problem? Sails require not only wind, but wind going in the direction you’d like to travel. By the late 19th century, the sail gave way to steamships powered by coal, and the rest is history. There were a number of mechanical inventions in the 20th century that changed the world. But one that can be easily forgotten is the mechanical refrigerator. Few things outside of trucks themselves revolutionized the way that people ate in the 20th century. It used to be incredibly rare to find “out of season” fruits and vegetables in the supermarket shelves. But there’s no such thing as out of season anymore in the modern grocery store. Thanks to refrigeration, food travels from all over the world in ships, trucks, and personal cars, and is deposited in the home refrigerator for consumption later. Cast iron was first developed around roughly 1500 BC, and it would radically transform life for average people with its use in agriculture and eventually warfare. The modern pencil wasn’t invented until 1795 by Nicholas-Jacques Conte, but it went through many iterations before this particular birth. And much like other landmarks in creation, such as photography, the pencil would alter how we recorded the world and how we saw our place in it. Where would you be without a fork? Eating some fucking spaghetti with your bare hands, that’s where, motherfucker. They’re like forks, only cooler. And much more versatile. Have you ever tried eating sushi with a fork? I’ve seen it done, and I wouldn’t recommend it. Invented sometime around the year 1000 by Bi Sheng in China, moveable type would change the world, making it easier to print books and other knowledge. Hilariously to modern eyes, many people saw the transition away from oral traditions to the printed word as a form of laziness. But when we step back and look at the transition to internet-available knowledge, it’s perhaps easier to understand their concerns. When was the last time you felt like you truly absorbed information and didn’t check a fact on the internet in an instant when confronted with a tough question? That’s what I thought. Oil lamps can be traced back to 4500 BC and virtually every civilization since has made their own improvements on this vital device. There were few things more important than an oil lamp before the invention of electric light—at least if you had any desire to not rely on the sun as your only means of light. Say what you will about capital punishment, but the guillotine gets the job done. The guillotine, or at least something like it, was invented in the 1200s, but this invention and the name we use today became popular during the French Revolution in the 1790s. Decapitation seems unpleasant (I wouldn’t know, I’ve never been decapitated) but the guillotine wasn’t just a way of killing someone. It was meant to send a message. That message? Off with their heads. No gods, no masters. Off with their fucking heads. No wonder the guillotine has become a bit of a meme these days. History has a funny way of resurfacing this invention any time the wealthy decide that they prefer austerity to economic concessions for the masses. The modern sewing machine was invented around 1790 in England, but it’s another great example of a time when the inventor isn’t necessarily the one who was able to successfully market and sell it. The sewing machine would come into common use during the 19th century, would revolutionize the production of clothes for generations to come. Without irrigation we wouldn’t have modern agriculture or the modern world. And while some people insist that a lack of modern agriculture might be a good thing, they’re romanticizing a past that never existed. What would you be in a hunter-gatherer society? The person who forages for tweets? That’s what I thought. Pass me another microwaved burrito, fellow nerd. We’re not hunting for shit. Have you ever tried to bareback a horse? Me neither. But apparently it’s really hard. Invented around 365 AD by the Sarmations in what’s now modern Russia, the horse saddle fixed that problem. People at the turn of the 20th century predicted that the horse would be extinct by now, thanks to the invention of the automobile. And while they’re not exactly gone forever, thankfully we don’t have to deal with the roughly 2.5 million pounds of horse manure and 420 million gallons of horse piss that used to flow through New York’s streets per day at the start of the 20th century. The longbow was probably invented around 3300 BC, but it wasn’t until the Middle Ages when this weapon of war really came into its own. English archers killed a lot of people with their longbows, so there’s no doubt it deserves to be on any list pertaining to important inventions. Chop that shit up. The spinning wheel, used for creating thread and yarn, was likely invented in India sometime around the year 500 and spread throughout Asia and the Middle East from there. The spinning wheel was an absolutely essential invention for clothes and textiles before the Industrial Revolution. Likely invented around the year 500 by the Persians, the windmill would go on to be used for crushing grain and pumping water in countless societies. The humble windmill might just be an aesthetic novelty to many Americans. But modern agriculture and manufacturing owes a great deal to this invention. Few things have made the world smaller than the airplane. Humans spent generations trying to make powered, heavier-than-air flight a reality, but when the Wright Brothers first succeeded on December 17, 1903, the world entered a new age. Just like every major technological breakthrough, the world didn’t change overnight in 1903. There were plenty of hurdles to surpass, like crossing the Atlantic (Charles Lindbergh made the first solo trip from New York to Paris in 1927 and so on), but the world would look a lot different without the airplane. Especially 1990s stand-up comedy. It would be impossible to guess how many people have been killed with pistols throughout history since their invention in the 16th century. But let’s just say it’s a lot. The worst thing about pistols? They’ve made suicide a lot easier. When we talk about gun violence, the mass shootings and gang violence get all the headlines. But we barely talk about the number of Americans who kill themselves with handguns every year. Currently, it’s about 20,000 Americans who die by suicide every year. The Egyptians constructed the first dam sometime around 2950-2750 BC, and while that dam fell apart pretty quickly, the concept ushered in a new era of humanity’s ability to control its environment. I think I speak for all of humanity in the 21st century when I say that the telephone is more of a burden than it should be these days. But it was quite important in its time. Quite. Much like the wheel, nobody knows exactly who invented the spear. We just know that the first one was created roughly 500,000 years ago. And it’s been used to kill plenty of animals (and humans) ever since. For when you need to see small shit. Prozac, otherwise known as fluoxetine hydrochloride, was the first mainstream antidepressant in the SSRI family. It got a lot of bad reactionary press after it became the world’s most prescribed anti-depressant in the late 1980s, but for people who respond to SSRIs, it’s been a godsend. There is a segment of the population that believes going on drugs like Prozac is wrong, and that all you need is to radically change your life with some vaginal jade eggs or some shit. Those people, of course, are idiots and you should take any drug that makes you feel better. I mean, they’re fucking swords. They had to be on the list. It’s difficult to imagine what it must have looked like to see the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. It had so many fantastic attractions, from the Ferris Wheel to the Midway. But for my money, I’d love to see that particular fair (as a time traveler, of course) just to see the artificial electric lights. Electricity wouldn’t become come in homes for decades after the Chicago World’s Fair. At the start of the 1920s, just 35 percent of American households had electricity. But by the end of the decade, it was 68 percent. Again, it all seems rather pedestrian from the vantage point of the 21st century, but electric light was a radical invention in humanity’s long timeline. Gunpowder was discovered in China in the 9th century, but it was mainly used for peaceful purposes like fireworks. It wouldn’t be used for warfare for another few centuries, when it changed the world of battle forever. But gunpowder wasn’t just for war. It could literally move mountains. Or, at least, large pieces of a mountain. Explosives became crucial for mining, opening up the Earth with a tremendous bang and literally creating empires. The birth of the internet is tough to pin down. Even experts can’t agree on the details. But if we go with the IEEE, an important engineering organization, we know not only when but where the internet was born: The night of October 29, 1969 in room 3420 at Boelter Hall at UCLA. The rest is history. The internet has transformed our lives in the 21st century. And we’ll let future historians determine whether it was a net negative or a net positive for humanity. No invention improved public health better than the invention of the sewer system. If you’re a fan of not having literal shit in your water supply, thank the development of the sewer system. It’s a technology that can be easy to forget, but it changed the world. The humble transistor made modern computing possible. And without it, we wouldn’t have computers, smartphones, or the internet. The earliest modern computers used vacuum tubes, which were bulky, cumbersome, and unreliable. But the invention of the transistor miniaturized computing in the best ways possible, opening the door to the computer revolution that we’ve seen in the 20th and 21st centuries. Some of the earliest evidence of steel that we have is in modern Turkey, dating back to 1800 BC, but this incredibly versatile alloy of iron and carbon would be used in countless different ways over the next few thousand years. Post-World War II production in the United States depended heavily on steel, giving rise to entire pockets of the country now known as the Rust Belt that have never fully recovered. The job of the plow is pretty straightforward: It’s used to break up the earth so that crops can be planted. It’s a deceptively easy concept to those of us in the 21st century, but it was absolutely necessary for the rise of modern agriculture. We wouldn’t have civilization as we know it without the plow. During the 19th century, the electric telegraph was arguably more revolutionary than the telephone and the internet would ever become. In fact, there’s an entire book with that premise. And it’s probably right. When Samuel F. B. Morse transmitted his first message, “What hath God wrought?” from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore on May 24, 1844 he opened up an entirely new world of technological possibility. The world became instantly smaller, allowing for communication over vast distances in a way that use to require physical delivery (letters) or large visual signal stations most common in wartime. Anyone who wanted to send a message from the United States to Europe in the 1850s would have to wait at least 10 full days—the time it took for ships to cross the Atlantic. But that all changed on August 16, 1858 when the first transatlantic electric telegraph line was laid. Suddenly a message could travel around the globe in minutes. We wouldn’t have the world we know without it. Electricity was harnessed in the 19th century and by the end of that century it was being used to light up homes and power street cars. By the turn of the 20th century, electricity was being used in homes for any number of gadgets and the tech nerds of yesteryear were geeking out over the earliest radios, dishwashers, electrical saws, electric light baths, and light-up Christmas tree holders. To say nothing of the more grim side of electricity, like the electric chair. But all in all, most Americans in the 21st century couldn’t imagine their lives without it, despite the fact that roughly 1.3 billion people still don’t have reliable access to electricity. If you ask a hundred historians what the most important invention is, a vast majority would no doubt put the wheel in their top ten. And for good reason. have you heard about this wheel thing? It’s pretty neat! Ancient peoples harnessed fire in ways that allowed them to control their environment. For example, aboriginal Australians were able to keep bushfires under control by shaping and manipulating what they destroyed—reinvigorating the land and limiting the number of fires that had the potential to get out of control. It’s fire. It’s kinda important. Nuclear weapons catapulted humanity into an age when we can now destroy virtually all human life on Earth. There’s no going back. The most conservative estimates of the death toll in Hiroshima (150,000 people dead) and Nagasaki (75,000 people dead) from the United States’ decision to drop two atomic bombs and kill thousands of civilians doesn’t include the suffering that came from those exposed to the bomb and lived or died much later. So no, nuclear bombs haven’t killed as many people as conventional weapons. Not even close. But the idea that we live in a world where virtually everyone could be dead in the span of less than a day—that’s what makes it take the top spot. Corrections: This article originally stated that cast iron was first developed in China, but the earliest iron was probably developed by the Hittites around 1500 BC. We also accidentally dropped the ball on #51. Gizmodo regrets the errors, though as it was stated earlier, this article is perfect and does not contain errors. I love this article. Number one is unexpected but also fitting... sad and scary as well. Also I think the Internet should be higher.  For good or ill (mostly ill these days) the internet has so radically changed everything.

In addition to sharing his thoughts on being name-dropped in a song by ex-fiancée Ariana Grande, the 25-year-old comedian had a few choice words for C.K., whom he accused of trying to get him fired from ""Saturday Night Live.""  The revelation, which was reported by Newsweek and Us Weekly, sprang out of a joke in which Davidson wondered if his choice of tattoos was a causal factor in a couple of celebrity deaths. ""I got a Harry Potter tattoo,"" he told the audience during ""Pete Davidson & Friends"" show in Boston. ""Then the next day, Alan Rickman, the guy who played Snape, died, and I was like, 'Oh, what a weird coincidence,' "" Davidson joked, according to E! He continued, ""Then I got a Willy Wonka tattoo. Next day, Gene Wilder dies. Now I'm like, all right, that's a coincidence, that's weird. So I'm thinking of getting a tattoo of Louis C.K., what do you guys think?"" C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct last year, had again been criticized for mocking students who survived last year's mass shooting in Parkland, Florida during his latest comeback set.  Davidson said that the last time C.K. hosted ""SNL"" in April 2017, the ""Louie"" star ""told all the producers in front of me that 'all this kid does is smoke weed and he's gonna smoke his career away.'"" The ""SNL"" star, who has said he uses marijuana to cope with chronic pain brought on by Crohn's Disease, claimed C.K. told executive producer Lorne Michaels, ""Pete smokes so much weed that it makes people uncomfortable."" It was the first stand-up set since the comedian worried colleagues and fans with a December Instagram post in which he said he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore."" During his two cathartic performances, Davidson also revealed that he cried to his mother following his broken engagement to Grande and shared his thoughts on her breakup anthem, ""Thank U, Next."" ""Usually, breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know,"" Davidson said, according to E! News and The New York Times. ""Bam. She named all of us."" Davidson recalled the song (in which Grande sings: ""Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful"") was released right before ""SNL"" aired, describing it as a ""sad day."" ""That (expletive) came out before I had to put on a (expletive) duck hat and be like, 'derrrp here's the pizza!'

Related: Ariana Grande says her exes heard 'Thank U, Next' before its release      The comedian split with Grande in October after a whirlwind romance, which was the fodder for at least two ""Weekend Update"" segments this fall, including an appearance with wounded Navy SEAL-turned-Congressman-elect Dan Crenshaw, whom he had compared to a ""hitman in a porno movie."" He had kept a low profile during the final episode of ""SNL"" of 2018, where he was not seen aside from introducing musical guests Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson. That was the same night he deleted his Instagram account. On Dec. 23, Davidson was spotted above the stage at friend Machine Gun Kelly's concert in Cleveland.

46,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/02/san-bernardino-shooting-suits-vs-facebook-google-twitter-dismissed--.html," A federal judge has dismissed lawsuits seeking to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable to victims of the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, for letting the Islamic State flourish on their social media platforms. In a decision late Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said the attack, which killed 14 people and injured 22 others, was not the direct result of the companies' alleged providing of resources to Islamic State. ""A contrary conclusion poses boundless litigation risk and is not tenable given how interconnected communication services are with modern economic and social life,"" the judge wrote. Beeler also found no liability for aiding and abetting terrorism under the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act , finding allegations only that the companies were ""generally aware"" that Islamic State used their services. The plaintiffs included victims and relatives of victims of the Dec. 2, 2015, attack at a government building by Syed Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, a native of Pakistan.Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. Both died soon after the attack in a police shootout. Islamic State said Farook and Malik were two of its followers. Beeler dismissed the lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they cannot be filed again, citing other courts' rejections of similar claims in other cases. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by users. Keith Altman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, on Wednesday said the decision was ""not a surprise,"" and that issues including the impact of JASTA and what constitutes direct liability should be addressed at the appellate level. Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc. Altman plans on Jan. 15 to ask the federal appeals court in Cincinnati to revive a similar lawsuit against the three companies over the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people.

48,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/guns-second-amendment-supreme-court.html,"Advertisement Supported by Conservative judges worry that the Second Amendment has become “a second-class right.” By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer A specter is haunting the Supreme Court  — disrespect for the Second Amendment. Perhaps you haven’t realized that the Supreme Court’s disinclination to expand on its landmark 2008 decision creating an individual right to gun ownership means that the justices are treating the Second Amendment as a “second-class right.” A “watered-down right.” A “disfavored right.” If you are unaware of these outlandish claims, then you haven’t tuned into the rising chorus of judicial voices demanding more from the Supreme Court than gun fanciers already won in that intensely disputed 5-to-4 decision a decade ago, District of Columbia v. Heller. Why is this happening, and why now? To understand why the “second-class right” meme is suddenly penetrating the judicial conversation, we have to begin with Justice Clarence Thomas. He is not the first member of the current Supreme Court to use the phrase; Justice Samuel Alito Jr. used it in his 2010 opinion that extended the analysis of the Heller decision, which had applied only to Washington, D.C., as a federal enclave, to the states. The court was being asked, Justice Alito wrote in McDonald v. City of Chicago, “to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class right,” which he said the court would not do. But it is Justice Thomas who has taken up the phrase as a weapon, using it in a series of opinions over the past four years to accuse his colleagues of failing in their duty to keep pushing back against limitations on gun ownership and use. The opinions were all dissents from the court’s decisions not to hear particular gun-rights appeals. In 2015, for example, he wrote that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had been wrong to uphold an Illinois city’s ban on assault weapons, and that by refusing to hear the appeal, his colleagues had failed to “prevent the Seventh Circuit from relegating the Second Amendment to a second-class right.” Last year, objecting to the court’s decision not to hear a challenge to California’s 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, Justice Thomas mused that “I suspect that four members of this court would vote to review a 10-day waiting period for abortions.” He declared, “The right to keep and bear arms is apparently this court’s constitutional orphan.” In another opinion, this time joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Thomas said it was “indefensible” and “untenable” for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to have upheld California’s ban on carrying concealed weapons. By turning down the appeal, he wrote, the justices were enabling “the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.” And in a remarkable concluding paragraph to his eight-page opinion, he added: “For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous. But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a state denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.” By calling attention to Justice Thomas’s Second Amendment crusade, I want to make four points. First, he’s simply wrong. The court decided Heller to vindicate what the majority described as a “core” Second Amendment right — the right of an individual to keep a handgun at home for self-defense. That’s all. Whatever else the Second Amendment enables people to do with their guns was left open. As Justice Antonin Scalia observed in his majority opinion, “It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” Maybe Justice Scalia included that and a few other disclaimers in order to stay within the comfort zone of a member of his narrowest of majorities, probably Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. Or maybe he was just kicking the can down the road. In any event, it’s certainly not the case that justices who decline to overturn a 10-day waiting period can be accurately labeled hypocrites who are content to hide in their marble palace while leaving the populace unprotected. Nor is the Second Amendment absolutism that Justice Thomas is calling for reflected in the way the Supreme Court interprets most other constitutional guarantees. Judge Bruce Selya of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit made this point in a majority opinion in November rejecting a challenge to a provision of the Massachusetts gun licensing statute. “Even though the Second Amendment right is fundamental,” Judge Selya, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his opinion for a unanimous panel, “the plaintiffs have offered us no valid reason to treat it more deferentially than other important constitutional rights.” That decision, Gould v. Morgan, will shortly be appealed to the Supreme Court. My second point is to underscore the role Justice Thomas plays in creating this rhetorical tidal wave. He is a Federalist Society icon and a hero to many young conservative lawyers, including the 10 former Thomas law clerks whom President Trump has already appointed to federal judgeships. (A dozen other former Thomas clerks hold important nonjudicial positions in the administration.) They and their colleagues among the new Trump judges, many of whom clerked for other conservative justices, are the ones who are making the “second-class right” mantra a standard feature of any Second Amendment dissent — in other words, not only that a particular majority opinion is incorrect, but that it is part of a dangerous trend that the Supreme Court, by implication if not explicitly, needs to address right now. For example, the full 15-member Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently refused to reconsider a decision by a three-judge panel to uphold the longstanding federal ban on interstate sales of handguns. Dissenting from that refusal, Judge James C. Ho, a former Thomas clerk who joined the Fifth Circuit last year, cited Justice Thomas’s opinions in observing, “Yet the Second Amendment continues to be treated as a ‘second-class’ right.” His dissent included a subtle dig at Chief Justice John Roberts, who notably has not joined Justice Thomas’s Second Amendment choir. The government rationale for the ban on interstate handgun sales is that while federally licensed firearm dealers can be expected to know the laws of their own state, they may not be familiar with laws of other states and so may not know whether an out-of-state purchaser is legally entitled to own a gun. That is not sufficient justification for the ban, Judge Ho wrote; if dealers could learn their own state’s laws, they could learn other states’ laws as well. “Put simply, the way to require compliance with state handgun laws is to require compliance with state handgun laws,” he wrote in a riff on the chief justice’s much-discussed line in a 2007 school integration case: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Judge Ho’s Fifth Circuit colleague Don R. Willett, another new member of the court, observed in his own dissenting opinion in the same case, “The Second Amendment is neither second class, nor second rate, nor second tier.” An appeal in that case, Mance v. Whitaker, is now pending at the Supreme Court, and the justices will decide this month or next whether to accept it. Another new judge, Stephanos Bibas, dissented last month from a decision by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that upheld a New Jersey law limiting a firearm magazine to 10 rounds of ammunition. He said the state had failed to provide sufficient evidence that “specifically links large magazines to mass-shooting deaths.” Acknowledging that five other federal circuit courts have also upheld limits on magazine sizes, Judge Bibas observed that while judges were understandably concerned about gun violence, “they err in subjecting the Second Amendment to different, watered-down rules and demanding little if any proof.” “The Second Amendment is an equal part of the Bill of Rights,” Judge Bibas wrote. “We may not water it down and balance it away based on our own sense of wise policy.” That case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. The New Jersey affiliate of the National Rifle Association, which brought the case, is first seeking review by the full Third Circuit. The 49-year-old Judge Bibas, a former law professor, won plaudits for his dissenting opinion. “It is easy to see why President Trump chose to appoint him,” said an article on the website ammoland.com that appeared under the headline: “Third Circuit: Second Amendment Is a Second Rate Right.” John O. McGinnis, a well-known conservative professor at Northwestern University Law School, writing on the Law and Liberty website, called Judge Bibas’s dissent “the judicial equivalent of a perfect game, a first-round knockout, or a checkmate within 10 moves.” He added, “It will not be the last opinion of the Trump appellate judges that will shake the judiciary from its dogmatic slumber.” My third point is this: Professor McGinniss may well be right, at least when it comes to the Second Amendment. The substitution of Brett Kavanaugh for Justice Kennedy may do the trick. On his former court, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Justice Kavanaugh took an aggressive gun-rights position, dissenting in 2011 from a decision that upheld the district’s ban on certain assault rifles. Calling the majority’s analytical approach to the case “especially inappropriate,” then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “A ban on a class of arms is not an ‘incidental’ regulation. It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech.” As a matter of constitutional doctrine, I understand his argument: that a right deemed by the Supreme Court to be fundamental, whether under the First Amendment or the Second, is entitled to the highest level of judicial protection. Nonetheless, to analogize possession of assault rifles to the right to free speech is a provocative move. The two conservative judges who made up the majority on the three-judge panel, Douglas Ginsburg and Karen LeCraft Henderson, were sufficiently provoked by Judge Kavanaugh’s 52-page dissent that they added to their own opinion an unusual six-page “appendix” for the specific purpose of contesting his arguments. “The dissent mischaracterizes the question before us,” Judge Ginsburg wrote for himself and Judge Henderson. “We simply do not read Heller as foreclosing every ban on every possible sub-class of handguns or, for that matter, a ban on a sub-class of rifles.” Justice Thomas himself has cited Judge Kavanaugh’s dissenting opinion favorably. It would hardly be surprising for Justice Kavanaugh to return the favor and join the crusade. And that brings me to my final point. The Supreme Court’s appetite for expanding the Second Amendment, if such an appetite develops, will be wildly out of sync with the mood of the country. As The Times reported last month, based on data compiled by a gun-control advocacy group, public support for gun-control measures is surging. State legislatures passed 69 gun-control measures in 2018, more than three times the number in the previous year. More than half the states enacted at least one, while 90 percent of bills the National Rifle Association backed at the state level were defeated. Even the Trump administration has caught the trend, with its announcement last month of a ban on bump stocks, the cheap attachments that turn ordinary rifles into something close to machine guns and that the Las Vegas killer used to commit mass murder a year ago. The ban, to take effect in March, has already drawn at least two lawsuits. Perhaps these lawsuits will be a step too far even for the Second Amendment newbies on the federal bench. Or maybe not. Does it matter if the public and the Supreme Court are running in opposite directions? It’s good news to anyone who would like to accelerate the collapse of public confidence in the one organ of government that at the moment seems to stand between us and disaster. For the rest of us, it’s one more thing to worry about as the new year begins. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.

The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission criticized the response of school staff and the Broward County Sheriff's Office to the carnage Feb. 14. The commission's 15 members issued a unanimously approved, 439-page preliminary report Wednesday aimed at preventing similar attacks and improving the response should they occur. The report and its recommendations were sent to the governor's office and Legislature for consideration. ""All stakeholders ... should embrace the opportunity to change and make Florida schools the safest in the nation,"" the report says. ""There must be a sense of urgency – and there is not, across-the-board – in enhancing school safety."" More: Parkland survivors slam Louis C.K. More: After Parkland shooting: A day-by-day fight over guns in America More: Police, schools had no duty to protect Parkland victims, judge rules Florida law allows districts to train and arm administrators and other staff. Teachers must have a military or police background to carry a firearm. The committee argued that teachers are often the first line of defense in school shootings and encouraged legislation to arm more of them. The report recommends that the Legislature approve a measure that would allow teachers ""properly selected, thoroughly screened and extensively trained to carry concealed firearms on campuses for self-protection, and the protection of other staff and students in response to an active assailant incident."" In the days after the shooting, Trump suggested 20 percent of teachers should have the ability to ""immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions."" Highly trained teachers would serve as a ""deterrent to the cowards that do this,"" he said. ""Far more assets at much less cost than guards."" The state teachers union does not support arming teachers, and some law enforcement leaders balked at the proposal. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called arming teachers “the height of lunacy.” Richard Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said few police chiefs back such proposals. The report says the Broward County school system and sheriff’s office were unprepared for the attack by Nikolas Cruz, who had been expelled from the school. Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer, was among deputies criticized for failing to immediately confront Cruz. Sheriff Scott Israel was blamed for not requiring his force to confront active shooters. Israel told the commission he had eliminated the policy requiring deputies to confront active shooters because he didn't want deputies charging into ""suicide missions."" Cruz, then 19, entered the building armed with a semiautomatic assault weapon, smoke grenades and a mask, authorities said. He allegedly fired more than 100 shots before the gun apparently jammed, and he walked out of the building amid the chaos. Cruz was taken into custody walking through a nearby neighborhood a short time after the shooting. A grand jury indicted him on 17 counts of first-degree murder that could result in the death penalty. He is also charged with 17 counts of attempted murder.",2019-01-03 08:43:07,"Parkland school shooting panel backs arming teachers, rips responding deputies",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. The 116th Congress gets sworn in today — a historic day for women in government. A whopping 102 women will take their seats in the House — that’s nearly a quarter of its voting members. Of those women, 35 (or 34.3 percent) are entering Congress for the first time. Exactly a quarter of the Senate will now be made up of women, as 25 women, five of whom are new, will be sworn in. The majority of women serving in both chambers are Democrats.

[Monica Hunter-Hart / Bustle] Apple cut its sales outlook for its fiscal 2019 first quarter by nearly 8 percent to $84 billion. The company had previously said it expected $89 billion to $93 billion in sales for the holiday quarter, which ended December 29. In a letter to investors, CEO Tim Cook blamed “emerging market challenges” and lackluster iPhone sales; in both instances, China was a driving force behind the lower-than-expected numbers, and Apple’s statement seems to be a not-so-thinly-veiled stab at President Donald Trump’s trade battle with the world’s most populous country. But that’s not the only reason people are buying fewer iPhones. [Rani Molla / Recode] The Federal Communications Commission will suspend most of its services by midday today if the partial government shutdown continues. The FCC plans to furlough more than 20 percent of its staff and will cease all work that is not “required for the protection of life and property” or related to spectrum auctions, which are funded by the sale of spectrum licenses. The agency’s wind-down would impact electronics makers, consumers, broadcasters, and many federal employees. [Chris Welch / The Verge] A federal judge dismissed lawsuits that sought to hold Facebook, Google, and Twitter liable to victims of the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured 22 others. US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco found that while the platforms were “generally aware” that the Islamic State used their services, the shooting was not a direct result of the companies providing resources to the terrorist group. [Jonathan Stempel / Reuters] Netflix pulled an episode of “Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj” in Saudi Arabia after the government there leveled a legal threat over a segment in which the comedian criticizes US ties to the regime and ridicules Saudi attempts to explain the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Netflix said it was simply complying with a local cybercrime law; human rights group Amnesty International said Netflix’s action is “further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression.” The 27-minute episode, titled “Saudi Arabia,” remains available on Netflix in all other territories. [Todd Spangler / Variety] Popular Fortnite streamer Tyler Blevins, a.k.a. Ninja, earned nearly $10 million in 2018, with 70 percent of the revenue coming from Twitch and YouTube. Every time one of Ninja’s 20 million-plus YouTube subscribers watches a pop-up ad on his channel, he earns a percentage of the ad sale; most of his videos on YouTube have been viewed millions of times. More than 12.5 million users follow him on Twitch and almost 40,000 pay to watch, forking over either $4.99, $9.99, or $25 per month to watch him blast his way to big bucks. The rest of his income is from sponsors like Samsung, Uber Eats, and Red Bull, which leads to a question about him and his peers in the burgeoning eSports community: Are they athletes? Blevins said he sees himself instead as a small business owner. [Dave Briggs / CNN] How much of the internet is fake? A lot of it, as it turns out. Studies suggest that, year after year, less than 60 percent of web traffic is human, and a healthy majority of it is bot. For a period of time in 2013, a full half of YouTube traffic was “bots masquerading as people” — a portion so high that employees feared an inflection point after which YouTube’s systems for detecting fraudulent traffic would begin to regard bot traffic as real and human traffic as fake.

Jon Bernthal returns as Frank Castle, a military veteran who takes on a new role as a renegade crimefighter under the name The Punisher. As the events of last season’s finale hinted, Castle’s season-long foe Billy Russo (Ben Barnes) might be well on his way to becoming the famed Jigsaw villain from the comics that he’s inevitably been heading toward. Though this mainly teases a season-long Punisher/Jigsaw showdown, The Punisher will also welcome a pair of new characters into the fold: husband and wife schemers Anderson and Eliza Schultz. The two extra antagonists are played by Corbin Bernsen and Annette O’Toole, the latter of which is no stranger to superhero TV, having previously played Martha Kent during the run of Smallville. The Season 2 cast also includes Amber Rose Revah, Jason R. Moore, Josh Stewart, and Floriana Lima. Season 1 of the series was initially delayed last year after a decision to move the show’s premiere in the wake of the October 1 Las Vegas mass shooting. At the time, Bernthal told IndieWire, “There is no question that I am concerned with the desensitization of violence. That is something that we should talk about, and we should address.” This new trailer also comes with a January release date. The show was previously revealed as part of a busy start to the upcoming new year that also includes the return of A Series of Unfortunate Events, Grace and Frankie, and Friends from College, the ending of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and the premiere of the animated series Carmen Sandiego.

FILE - In this Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, file image taken from police body cam video released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on July 25, 2018, an armed law enforcement official points his gun while searching for a shooter in Las Vegas. Police in Las Vegas said Thursday, Jan. 3, 2019, they have finished releasing audio, video and written records about the investigation of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department via AP, File) LAS VEGAS – Police in Las Vegas said Thursday they have finished releasing audio, video and written records about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history 15 months ago during an open-air concert. The department said that after 34 releases of material since May, officials believe they have complied with a court order in a public records lawsuit about the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. Plaintiffs included The Associated Press. ""We don't expect any further major releases of either video or documents,"" the department said in a statement. ""If documents are identified that have not previously been released, they will be made available."" Fifty-eight people died, 869 were wounded or injured, and thousands were affected when a high-limit video poker player fired assault-style weapons equipped with rapid-fire devices from the Mandalay Bay resort into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers across Las Vegas Boulevard. The material released until last week provided dramatic details about horror and heroism, but no insight about the motive of 64-year-old gunman Stephen Paddock. Authorities have said Paddock killed himself before police arrived. Investigators believe he acted alone with no broader conspiracy and no link to terrorism. The records stemmed from video clips from nearly 1,200 officer body-worn cameras; more han 1,000 audio clips of 911 calls; about 2,100 pages of officer reports, witness statements and dispatch logs; and video from streetscape, rooftop and helicopter vantage points. Transcribed statements from 18 of the hundreds of officers who responded to the shooting were made public last week. The material came with little department comment or explanation and no narrative thread. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo released an investigation summary and declared the police investigation ended in August, saying frenzied reports of other shootings on the night of the massacre turned out to be false. The FBI is expected to soon release a report including a behavioral analysis of Paddock.

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot Media By Emily Jacobs Submit January 3, 2019 | 7:11pm Conservative radio talk show host Michael Savage has “changed locations” after a restaurant he frequents received a mass shooting threat for serving him. The undisclosed establishment allegedly received an email warning of “serious f—ing damage” if they allowed Savage to dine at the restaurant again. “I DEMAND THAT YOU REFUSE TO ALLOW MICHAEL… IN YOUR F—ING RESTAURANT AGAIN,” reads the threat, which was obtained by the Washington Times. “HE IS A RACIST WHITE SUPREMACIST PIECE OF S—T.” The email goes on to refer to Savage as a “crypto Jew” who the sender plans to kill, along with turning the restaurant into a “shooting gallery” unless they refuse to serve him. “DONT WANT TO LISTEN TO ME? WELL I GUESS YOURE ALL GONNA F—ING DIE,” the email sender threatens. “I WILL WAIT AND WATCH YOUR F—ING BUSINESS AND WHEN I SEE HIM GO IN THERE IM GOING TO START SHOOTING EVERY BODY I CAN FIND. I OWN 3 GUNS AND I CAN DO SOME SERIOUS F—ING DAMAGE.” Savage told the Washington Times that while he has been a victim of death threats in the past, he took the latest scare “very seriously” and decided to “change locations” as a safety precaution. He said authorities “have a suspect they’re looking at.” Local and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating the threat, according to the newspaper. Savage, a veteran talk radio host of 25 years and the author of four New York Times bestsellers, has sparked controversy on his program before. During the 2016 election, he faced backlash — including being temporarily taken off WABC in New York — for a segment on “Hillary Clinton’s delicate health” which suggested she had Parkinson’s disease.

56,https://www.salon.com/2019/01/04/if-young-jazmine-barnes-is-a-victim-of-domestic-terror-is-white-america-ready-to-own-it/,"This post has been updated. Last Sunday morning, around 7 a.m., 30-year-old LaPorsha Washington sat in her car with a family group in a Walmart parking lot in Cloverleaf, Texas, a suburb of Houston. As she made her way to the exit, a white man, roughly 40 years old with a salt-and-pepper beard and wearing a red hoodie, drew a firearm and emptied rounds into her car. Washington took off, tires screeching as she left the lot — trying to protect her family by evading the gunman. As she drove, not realizing that one of the shooter's bullets had pierced her arm, a teenage daughter, wounded by shattered glass cried that her little sister was not moving. Washington stopped the car. Her daughter, Jazmine Barnes, 7, shot once in the head, was unconscious in the backseat.  When Harris County police officers arrived on the scene they found Washington and her two teenage daughters wounded and her youngest daughter, Jazmine Barnes, dead. The shooter remains at large, as the country mourns the death of yet another innocent child to racism and senseless gun violence. Since the shooting, a $75,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Barnes killer, who was driving a red or maroon pickup, has been offered.  There used to be two things that were guaranteed in America — death and taxes, at least for non-billionaires. Now I’d like to add a third to the list: gun violence. Gun violence has long been a part of America culture. Many of our citizens see only the supposedly good parts of gun culture: hunting trips, the ""freedom"" of the Second Amendment, the right to protect your family with lethal force. Those citizens seem to ignore epidemic rates of suicide, or the mass shooting tragedies we have seen so often: Las Vegas, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Virginia Tech, Columbine, the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Police had a gun buyback program in Baltimore where I live a few weeks ago and a person passed in a rocket launcher — a real rocket launcher and still the NRA Second Amendment nuts, gun apologizers and too many gutless, soulless politicians won’t admit that America has a gun problem cocktailed with an unhealthy dose of domestic terrorism. What if young Jazmine Barnes is a victim of domestic terror? I think she is.Will her killer, if he is found, be treated like the terrorist he is or be granted the ability to cop to second-degree murder or manslaughter based on road rage? In examining this I hope prosecutors consider that seven-year-old  Barnes will never get to wrap a gift for her mom again or experience a first kiss, never get pick out a prom dress, watch another sunset or hold a precious newborn baby because it is likely she has been killed by a terrorist — a domestic terrorist. Barnes was being raised in the world where the current administration loves to paint Mexicans or Muslims as the bad guys. But it seems like every time a television is flicked on, there’s a new story about some disgruntled white man expressing rage by shooting at people. Sometimes they call him a loner or tormented soul in need of help — I say call them what they are, domestic terrorists.  We must say this, acknowledge this and prosecute the suspect as such. Failure to do so will only continue to normalize the behavior of Barnes’ killer and terrible people like him, which will only give others the confidence to commit this kind of savagery again. * * * Update: A tip from writer and activist Shaun King, helped bring a pair of suspects to justice. Below is a quote from King's Instagram account detailing the tips that led up to the apprehension. Twenty-year-old Eric Black Jr. admitted to driving the vehicle used in the shooting said Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. Black, who was charged with capital murder, ""Became a target in our investigation based on a tip that initially went to journalist and activist Shaun King. Mr. King then passed that tip to me personally,"" said Gonzalez. According to 12 News ABC, Black allegedly identified his passenger and the trigger man as Larry Woodruffe, 24, who is also in police custody on drug charges and is now a capital murder suspect. According to Gonzalez, Washington was not a target. ""It appears to us, based on the information we've received, this was likely a case of mistaken identity, where the intended targets were someone else,"" he said. We now know that authorities adjusted their initial report as they gathered more information and are saying the shooting was a result of mistaken identity not a race-based hate crime and the suspected killers are African American men, not a disgruntle white male.

59,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/01/04/stoneman-douglas-commission-formally-approves-arming-teachers/,"Back before Christmas, we looked at the initial findings of the Stoneman Douglas Commission in Florida which had been tasked with studying ways to improve school security in the wake of the horrific mass shooting at Margory Stoneman Douglas High School. Many of their recommendations seemed quite solid (assuming they can find the money for them) and didn’t cause much controversy. But the 15 person panel raised more than a few eyebrows when they voted 14-1 in favor of allowing qualified, willing teachers to arm themselves in class as a possible first line of defense. This had the teachers unions and some student activists up in arms, but the panel still sent their findings on to the full commission for approval. That process is now complete, and the commission has unanimously approved the entire package, forwarding their results to the state government. And yes, the provision for arming teachers is still in there. (Boston Globe) The commission investigating a shooting massacre at a Florida high school unanimously approved its initial findings and recommendations Wednesday, including a controversial proposal that teachers who volunteer and undergo training be allowed to carry guns. The 15-member Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission’s 446-page report details what members believe happened before, during, and after the Feb. 14, 2017, shooting attack that left 14 students and three staff members dead and 17 wounded. The report, which the commission sent to Governor Rick Scott, incoming Governor Ron DeSantis, and the Legislature, is also critical of the Broward County sheriff’s deputies who failed to confront suspect Nikolas Cruz, and of Sheriff Scott Israel, whose office did not at the time have a policy requiring them to rush the three-story freshman building where the shooting happened. The fact that the commission was critical of the Broward County Sheriff’s Department is probably interesting to the public, but unlikely to result in any charges. It could still be constructive, however, if it leads to a full review of the department’s updated policies on how officers respond to critical threats such as a mass shooting at a school. As far as the upgrades to security go, the highlights of the report look pretty good. It’s not full of unrealistic or unattainable goals and all of the recommendations seem to take into account the challenges of funding such measures. In districts where the funding is available, upgrades such as metal detectors, more secure doors, and armed resource officers are being proposed. Intervention efforts when students report individuals who may pose a threat might be a bit more constitutionally challenging, but they should at least keep such considerations in the minds of school administrators. The choice to allow trained teachers to arm themselves will likely have the biggest impact in more rural school districts with smaller budgets. And the provisions they’ve included to make sure there are only qualified people doing this should satisfy all but the most partisan opponents. Background checks and intensive training programs are required. This should open up the opportunity to carry to more teachers. Currently, the only ones who can do so are current or former police officers, active military members, or Junior ROTC instructors. That’s a pretty small slice of the overall teacher population. I have to give credit to Florida for putting the politics aside and moving to make concrete improvements in school security. This won’t be able to stop every shooting incident, but it should at least improve response times and give prospective mass shooters pause before plotting such attacks.

60,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/01/muslim-charity-islam-media-criticism-islamophobia.html,"On the last day of 2018, I was spending time with a friend visiting New York City from Florida. He told me he was thinking of heading to Times Square to watch the ball drop. “No way,” I told him, as any tri-state native would. “Avoid at all costs.” I’ve never understood why a person would voluntarily squish themselves between wasted tourists only to walk home through an obstacle course of 50 tons of trash. Not me. I stayed home, counted down to midnight with my wife, then went straight to bed. As it turns out, across the Atlantic, many of my peers were out for a different reason. A group of more than 1,000 Muslims organized by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association in the U.K. prayed their first prayer in 2019, strapped on high-visibility jackets, and swarmed the streets with brooms and garbage bags to help groom their cities after the boozy celebration. They do it every year as an act of worship, fulfilling one of the five pillars of Islam: charity. Along with this annual rite invariably comes favorable press coverage, and the story promptly rose to the top of Reddit’s UpliftingNews subreddit. Pieces like these appear all year, whether it’s Muslims rallying to fundraise in the face of tragedy like a deadly mass shooting or giving money to fight hunger on Christmas. The acts of charity are real and commendable, and it warmed my heart to see a story like the one from the U.K. go viral. Yet there was also something else that was nagging at me, as it often does when I see coverage like this: Why is this even a story? On its face, it’s really just Muslims acting as their faith requires. In this case, the AMYA had a photographer on hand to document the young Muslims out in the wee hours on Jan. 1. It clearly courted the coverage. Why? Is this charity or performance? In a sense, it’s not so hard to understand: A recent study conducted by the University of Alabama found that terror attacks committed by Muslims received 357 percent more press attention than terror attacks committed by non-Muslims. Only half of Pew-polled Americans say they know a Muslim, and research has shown that Americans who do not interact with Muslims directly hold less favorable views toward Islam. Opinions of my family and community are shaped by the overrepresentation of negative coverage of Muslims in the media. For that reason, it’s hard to fault these stories or the Muslim organizers who proffer them too much. The piece about the Muslims cleaning up after New Year’s Eve only appeared in my feed, and I only clicked on it, because it offers a rare positive view of Islam in the news. It’s one we don’t usually see—an Islam that I recognized. Every time news breaks of a lunatic shouting “Allahu akbar” and news networks invite a non-Muslim “expert” to debate a full-blown bigot over whether or not Islam is what caused the attack, I lose my mind. So maybe it’s obvious why AMYA would invite their own photographer to document their charity. When cable news anchors still ask unashamedly where the “moderate” Muslims are, I get why Muslim groups around the world want to answer that call. But in a way, these photo-ops also feel like a capitulation to the most extreme views about Islam. They suggest the charity is somehow a surprise, a novelty. Part of me would love if the next time I bought a meal for a person in need, a group of panelists on CNN argued whether Islam was the answer to poverty. But is that really going to happen? And doesn’t touting ordinary service as extraordinary classify these acts of community and altruism, by default, as abnormal for Muslims? The temptation for the photo-op is understandable, but in some ways it seems to work against its own goal. Besides, even as they document undeniable good, these stories feel a bit patronizing, as if to say, “Hey, look, a good Muslim!” It’s easy to see why they seem necessary in an atmosphere where Islam is only mentioned in the news after tragedies, but I wonder if it cheapens faith-required service to turn it into an opportunity to remind people we’re not evil radicals or exotic foreigners. Muslims like me shouldn’t have to overcompensate for lunatics by putting Islam on display for all to see. I hope more people will see and internalize stories about us fulfilling our faith rather than stories about terrorism, but surely a more effective vessel for change in media is to confront the way they treat Muslims directly, not a futile mission to flood the press with alternative narratives. My friend from Florida did not make it to Times Square, but maybe next year I will find my own New Year service, inspired by the AMYA. If I do, it’ll be off camera, like the overwhelming duty of Muslims around the world. A famous hadith from the Prophet Mohammed tells Muslims that the better charity is done with the right hand if the left hand doesn’t know. I hope to keep it that way.

Ralph Northam (D) proposed gun confiscation orders, criminalization of private gun sales, an “assault weapons” ban, and other gun controls on Friday. Northam claimed these controls will reduce “gun violence” although all evidence actually points to the contrary. Northam tweeted: “This morning I announced a broad package of reasonable legislation to prevent gun violence and improve Virginia’s public safety. I look forward to having a dialogue with the General Assembly this session on these important issues.” This morning I announced a broad package of reasonable legislation to prevent gun violence and improve Virginia's public safety. I look forward to having a dialogue with the General Assembly this session on these important issues. pic.twitter.com/g8qapNqqbe — Ralph Northam (@GovernorVA) January 4, 2019 The state of California already has gun confiscation orders, but that did not prevent the November 7, 2018, firearm attack on the Borderline Bar & Grill. Twelve people were killed in that attack. Florida has gun confiscation orders, but that did not prevent the August 26, 2018, Jacksonville Landing attack that killed three people. And as for the criminalization of private gun sales, California has had such a law since the early 1990s, but it has done nothing to prevent the myriad high-profile attacks that have occurred in the 20 years since. Gov. Northam is also pushing an “assault weapons” ban, which Maryland has but which has done nothing to stop the death and carnage that marks the city of Baltimore. As for the criminalization of private gun sales, such a control would not have stopped a single mass shooting in the 21st century because nearly every mass attacker got his guns via background checks. The exceptions are those who stole them. Despite these myriad failures, Northam claims his gun control package will work if tried in Virginia.

Jan. 5 2019, Updated 8:16 p.m. ET Missing Colorado mom Kelsey Berreth's fiancé and baby dad Patrick Frazee has been charged in her murder. Now, as the Daily Mail reports, Frazee's girlfriend, who allegedly disposed of the presumed dead woman's cell phone, has been exposed as nurse Krystal Lee, 32. According to the Mail, Lee is a divorced mother of two and is also allegedly being investigated over her alleged role in 29-year-old Berreth's shocking disappearance. Although Berreth's body hasn't been discovered, as RadarOnline.com has reported, on Monday, December 31, Frazee was formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of solicitation to commit first-degree murder. The Mail reported that Lee allegedly had an affair with Patrick Frazee, 30, but the nurse, who lives in Twin Falls, Idaho, hasn't been formally identified by police as the woman they are investigating. However, the Mail has reported that a nurse was a person of interest in the case and allegedly got rid of Berreth after she went missing. Daily Mail has named the mystery woman as Lee, who works as a pre-op nurse at the St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls. The hospital told the British publication that Lee has been placed on a leave of absence. Lee's maiden name was Kenney; she married rancher Chad Lee in October 2010, according to the report. Court records show that the Lees' marriage ended in divorce in June 2016, the Mail reported. They had lived in a remote six-bedroom farmhouse overlooking a canyon in Kimberly, Idaho, seven miles east of Twin Falls. The property is now plastered with ""no trespassing"" signs, the Daily Mail noted. Sources told the Daily Mail that Frazee romanced Lee after they had met at a rodeo. As Radar reported, court documents have stated that Frazee is accused of robbing his fiancée Berreth and plotting to murder her, either by acting alone or ""with one or more persons."" The charges allege that Frazee may have also hired a hitman to murder his significant other. Police believe Frazee murdered the mother of his child at their home in Woodland Park, Colorado, around Thanksgiving. Berreth's cell phone ""pinged"" off a tower in Idaho's rural Gooding County, just north of Twin Falls, three days after she was last seen,according to investigators. Frazee and Berreth shared a daughter, Kaylee, 1. Berreth was last seen on November 22 leaving a supermarket with her daughter. Police raided Frazee's property but did not find Berreth. The missing mother is presumed to be dead. The Idaho nurse has not been charged with a crime, the Mail reported. Frazee had allegedly been plotting the murder for close to three months, court papers have revealed. A judge set a preliminary hearing for February as Frazee remains in custody without bond.

She was attentive and didn’t say anything audible in court.    Yohanna was charged with disorderly conduct, false report of offense; and official misconduct, forbidden act. Both are felonies. She will need to pay $1,000 to go free until her next court date Thursday, and the judge also asked the sheriff to approve electronic monitoring for her.    She was arrested after she sent an email from her own work computer to the inspector general’s office stating another employee would be conducting a mass shooting at the COPA offices. In court, prosecutors said the incident happened Dec. 28, after she logged into her workstation and computer. Two witnesses saw her send the email, which indicated a male co-worker had a gun and was going to bring it to the office and was planning a “mass shooting.’’ Someone called 911, prompting police, SWAT and tactical officers to swarm the building and evacuate it. They later learned the worker had no gun and “had no such plan,’’ prosecutors said. The IP address came right back to her workstation. Investigators made contact with her, and she admitted sending the email and that she never saw the worker with the gun, according to prosecutors. The email was sent out of an “abundance of caution,’’ her attorney Robert Pervan told the judge. “It wasn’t done with any malicious intent.’’ Later, outside the courtroom, Pervan said she sent to email after she had a conversation with the co-worker and believed he did have a gun, which are not allowed in COPA offices, and a plot. According to Pervan, the email was more precautionary in nature, a message to the effect of: “You might want to speak to this guy.’’ “Nothing in the email suggested that this was an imminent danger or that there was something that was going to happen quickly or on that date.’’  Pervan said Yohanna is a licensed attorney who has worked as a COPA investigator for one year and has no criminal background. She is currently on paid leave.    “She’s more shocked than anything,’’ Pervan said of her reaction to the charges.    Yohanna, who lives in the 600 block of West Gordon Terrace in Chicago, turned herself in Thursday. Her brother was in court Saturday but declined to comment.    “Unfortunately, we live in a society where we are told ‘if you see something say something,’ ’’ Pervan told reporters after the hearing. “She actually does something, and she’s being prosecuted for it.’’    dawilliams@chicagotribune.com  rsobol@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-01-05 15:10:00,"'It wasn't done with any malicious intent,' claims lawyer for COPA investigator accused of filing false report of mass shooting",,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

At least that’s my takeaway from a Twitter skirmish he and freshman legislator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got into Saturday night. Scalise referenced a Hot Air piece from Saturday on Twitter as he took AOC to task. The subject was taxes and the responses from AOC’s supporters got ugly quickly. Referencing Ed’s piece about AOC’s idea that soaking the wealthy is a fine idea to fund her pet project, the Green New Deal, Scalise pushed back. Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned moneyDemocrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs https://t.co/NxJPSCqvrt — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 5, 2019  Innocent enough, right? Scalise was making a run-of-the-mill point that Republicans believe taxpayers should keep more of their own money instead of sending it off to the federal government. That is about as basic of a Republican principle as you can get. AOC decided she would respond disrespectfully by calling Scalise ignorant about marginal tax rates. I know. “Oh that’s right, almost forgot,” the Democratic socialist wrote. “GOP works for the corporate CEOs showering themselves multi-million bonuses; not the actual working people whose wages + healthcare they’re ripping off for profit.” Bless her heart. The incoming class of socialist freshmen and the far left legislators (like Senator Elizabeth Warren) love to pin the troubles in the world on corporations. They prefer to wage class warfare and support ideas that they think will be more equitable, whatever that means. The corporate CEOs she references answer to corporate stakeholders and Boards of Directors. She studied economics at a tony East Coast college and should know that the tax rates she longs for from back in the day are counterproductive. The high tax rates don’t produce the revenue hoped for, as Ed explained in his piece and never did. Democrat President John F. Kennedy slashed tax rates and the economy greatly benefited. Yes, as Scalise tweeted, AOC is full of “leftist fantasy programs” and she’s not alone in her thinking. We find ourselves in a battle to push back on a socialist takeover of our economy. The far left, “radicals” as AOC likes to describe herself, believe the problems of working-class people will be solved by more government intervention, whether it is sharply increasing taxes on the wealthy or randomly choosing a dollar amount like $15.00 per hour as a minimum wage for all workers. AOC’s supporters showed up in replies to Scalise and one immediately took the low road. “Snipe his ass” was the response most offensive that I saw. This is a vulgar reference to the mass shooting at baseball practice with congressional Republicans in Virginia as they prepared for an annual charity game. Scalise was gravely wounded by the shooter and barely survived. Scalise decided to end the Twitter discussion and let it go at that point. He said he looked forward to the debate on the House floor. Hi @AOC. Happy to continue this debate on the Floor of the People’s House, but it’s clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers. #StayClassy pic.twitter.com/lZCO3oiLUZ — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 6, 2019  #StayClassy, indeed.

It can be noted that Steve Scalise sat for his first interview after the shooting with 60 Minutes conducted by Leslie Stahl.

67,https://www.salon.com/2019/01/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-debates-economics-with-congressman-who-was-shot-in-2017/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., just got into a heated Twitter debate with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., over questions of tax policy — although Scalise cut things short after Twitter users began ridiculing him for nearly dying during a mass shooting in 2017, even though his own supporters also posted insulting tweets. The online exchange began when Scalise, reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's proposal that the marginal tax rate be increased to 70 percent for Americans, tweeted, ""Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money Democrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs."" His tweet included a link to an article that described Ocasio-Cortez specifically calling for the tax hike to fund programs in a Green New Deal. In her response, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to Scalise that ""you’re the GOP Minority Whip. How do you not know how marginal tax rates work? Oh that’s right, almost forgot: GOP works for the corporate CEOs showering themselves in multi-million?bonuses; not the actual working people whose wages + healthcare they’re ripping off for profit."" Her comment referenced the fact that her proposed tax increase would only apply to Americans who make more than $10 million each year. At this point Scalise drew attention to some of the inappropriate responses of people who seemed to be supporting Ocasio-Cortez in the exchange, including one who wrote ""snipe his ass,"" another who urged her to ""kick his cane"" and a third who praised her by saying ""she's got better aim than James Hodgkinson, that's for sure."" After citing these tweets, Scalise wrote ""Hi @AOC. Happy to continue this debate on the Floor of the People’s House, but it’s clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers. #StayClassy."" That said, many of the responses to Ocasio-Cortez from Twitter users who seemed to agree with Scalise were deliberately disrespectful toward the congresswoman, with at least one also implying violence will occur if her policies were implemented. One person tweeted, ""Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Obviously you don't know how economic works. If you tax the wealthy Americans at 70% why would they want to stay in this country? The top 3% taxpayers already pay more than 50%. Look at what is going on in socialist countries in Europe? The people are rebelling!"" Another wrote, ""Its funny how we used to see how socialism does not work, but now that the elitists on the left want their power back, they need votes and so socialism is now a successful model."" Another Twitter user referred to Ocasio-Cortez as an ""economic imp,"" while a fourth person implied violence could result as a result of Ocasio-Cortez's proposal by tweeting that ""Here’s an idea, Taxation = Theft ....pretty sure we fought a war over taxes being levied against us before"" Scalise has not publicly expressed any objections to those tweets against Ocasio-Cortez. The Louisiana congressman survived a harrowing ordeal after he was nearly assassinated during a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. After returning to the House of Representatives, Scalise explained to ""60 Minutes"" that ""I found out later just how much damage was done internally. You know, I mean, my femur was shattered. The hip and pelvis had serious damage where the bullet went through and, you know, did some damage to areas that had to be shored up with steel plates and then they did a phenomenal job of rebuilding, you know, kind of the, rebuilding Humpty Dumpty. I mean, there were, there was a lot of damage inside that had to get fixed."" Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer for Salon.

House Democrats hold first committee hearing on Capitol riot News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit January 7, 2019 | 9:26am				| Updated January 7, 2019 | 10:06am A Florida stripper with an affinity for serial killers and mass murderers threatened to commit a violent killing spree in a “very public place,” police said. Brein Basarich, a 31-year-old dancer at Show Girls in Plant City — about 25 miles east of Tampa — was arrested Wednesday after posting threats of widespread carnage on her Tumblr page under the chilling username “taking-lives,” according to a police affidavit obtained by The Post. “I had a vision … of a very public place, only one way in and one way out,” one post reads. “Preferably a bar/club on a busy night. 2019 has a lot in store if my plans go accordingly!” When asked by another user if she had homicidal urges, investigators said, Basarich responded: “I feel at times a lot of us have urges, whether they will admit or not is the question. So yes, I have.” Basarich, who admitted to police that she was behind the troubling social media account, told another Tumblr user that she planned to buy an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle “soonish,” according to the affidavit. “Pretty excited,” she replied. “It will be my first gun and I plan to get others.” Basarich also professed her love for “true crime” and told police she’s a big fan of “serial killers and mass murderers,” according to the affidavit. Basarich, of Lakeland, is now facing felony charges of written threats to kill, do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. She was released from the Polk County Jail on Thursday after posting $5,000 bond, jail records show. Attempts to reach her early Monday were unsuccessful. Gary Gross, a Lakeland police spokesman, said Basarich was arrested after her mother called her at work and told her to come home. No weapons were found at the Elon Crescent address. Gross insisted Basarich’s alleged threats posed “no direct threat” to the public. “There’s really no substance to it,” Gross told The Post during a brief interview Monday. It’s unclear if the 5-foot-1, 135-pound Basarich had acquired an attorney. Read Next Saudi teen who escaped abusive parents is placed 'under th...

The suspect, Brien Basarich, admitted to having posted such threats on Tumblr under the username ""taking-lives."" According to the Bradenton Herald, Basarich — who dances at Showgirls Men's Club in Plant City, Florida — boasted of purchasing guns. The outlet reported that the Lakeland Police Department said Basarich wrote about having a ""vision"" of firing guns into crowded areas — such as bars or clubs ""on a busy night"" — that have only one entrance or exit.

75,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/bill-would-limit-number-of-guns-californians-can-buy-to-one-per-month.html," A bill has been reintroduced in the California state legislature that would limit the number of guns Californians can purchase to just one per month. A similar measure was vetoed last year by outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown. It comes as another Democrat, Gavin Newsom, takes the reins Monday as the state's 40th governor. Newsom took a swipe at the gun lobby and Trump administration in his inaugural address. ""Make no mistake, there are powerful forces arrayed against us,"" Newsom said. ""Not just politicians in Washington — but drug companies that gouge Californians with sky-high prices. A gun lobby that's willing to sacrifice the lives of our children to line their pockets."" In the aftermath of the Nov. 7 Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Newsom went on record supporting tougher gun control laws. He wasn't specific on any piece of legislation but indicated there were bills Brown rejected that he favored. ""I've been as transparent on gun issues as any candidate for higher office in decades,"" Newsom told reporters in November. ""I think we can even do more and better."" California Senate Bill 61, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, would impose a prohibition on the purchase or transfer of more than one firearm within a 30-day period. California law already prohibits any person from purchasing more than one handgun per month. Last September, Brown vetoed Senate Bill 1177, a similar bill that would have banned Californians from buying more than one long gun per month. He also rejected another measure doing the same thing in 2016 and called the legislation in his veto message ""well intentioned,"" but added it ""would have the effect of burdening lawful citizens who wish to sell certain firearms that they no longer need."" Maryland has a ban on the books barring a person from buying more than one handgun or assault weapon within a 30-day period, while New Jersey bars dealers from transferring more than one handgun to any person within a 30-day period. Virginia passed a one-handgun-a-month law in the early 1990s but repealed it in 2012. ""California already has extensive waiting periods before a law-abiding citizen can exercise a fundamental constitutional right,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun rights advocacy group based in Connecticut. ""Further burdening and infringing on Californians' constitutional rights by rationing its exercise will not make the community safer. This was something former Gov. Brown understood.""

BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Céline Dion played the first of four sold-out shows at The O2 in London on June 20. The performance contributed to The O2’s ranking as the world’s top-grossing arena for the chart year to date. For concert venue executives, the world changed in 2017 when a suicide bomber killed 22 outside of England’s Manchester Arena on May 22, and when a gunman took at least 58 lives at a festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1. Venue managers can sum up new security precautions in one word: more. In addition to tighter security, ticketing technology, production complexity, higher-end concessions and keen competition for superstar tours have all raised the bar for today’s arena managers. And the stakes are high: The world’s top-grossing concert venues drive a significant part of the touring industry’s estimated $25 billion-plus in annual revenue. The Arena Power Players recognized here are chosen for their leadership of the venues that dominate Billboard Boxscore worldwide rankings in two categories: buildings with a capacity of 15,001 or more and those with a capacity of 10,001 to 15,000. The rankings are based on ticket grosses reported to Boxscore in the first eight months of the chart year: Nov. 8, 2016, through July 17, 2017. (Not all events taking place during this period are reported by venues). This year, buildings from the United States, Europe and Australia top those lists. Top 10 Venues, 15,001-Plus Capacity 1. THE O2, LONDONBoxscore gross, chart year to date: $119 millionJohn Langford, 46, VP/GM, The O2 “Immediately after the terror attacks in Manchester and on London Bridge [in June], we essentially doubled our site security, and we continually review security,” says Langford, who came from the SSE Hydro arena in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2016 to succeed Rebecca Kane as head of The O2. Retaining its long-held position as the world’s highest-grossing concert venue, The O2 this summer celebrated its 10th anniversary with sellouts by Céline Dion and Ed Sheeran. “Commercially, we’re having our best year ever,” says the Johannesburg-born father of two, who’s also overseeing the construction of a designer outlet village at The O2 that will “bring a significant amount of daytime traffic to the venue.” 2. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK$102.8 millionDarren Pfeffer, 41, executive vp, MSG Live Pfeffer didn’t have time for a learning curve when he joined the Garden in May after a 20-year stretch at iHeartMedia. “We made history this summer with 13 nights of Phish,” says the Texas native, “and at the same time, we did 16 nights of Dave Chappelle at [MSG-operated] Radio City Music Hall.” Residencies and multi-night shows are the focus right now, with Billy Joel in the fourth year of his monthly residency. “It’s important that artists know that they can park a production here,” he says. “MSG is no longer just a venue for one night -- it’s really a place where you can stay and feel at home.” 3. T-MOBILE ARENA, LAS VEGAS$52.5 millionDan Quinn, 41, VP/GM The mass shooting at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 took place only a mile down the Las Vegas Strip from the T-Mobile Arena. Although Las Vegas law allows carrying a concealed firearm with a permit, all weapons and large bags have been prohibited at the arena since the day it opened in April 2016. In comments he made before the shooting, Quinn said that the biggest issue facing venues now “is the ability to [ensure] guest and employee safety.” 4. MANCHESTER ARENA, MANCHESTER, ENGLAND$48.1 millionJames Allen, 44, GM It was the right song from the right artist in the right place. The Oasis hit “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” performed by Oasis co-founder and Manchester native Noel Gallagher, was an emotional highlight of the benefit concert that reopened the Manchester Arena on Sept. 9, nearly four months after a suicide bomber killed 22 people outside the venue during an Ariana Grande show. Like the all-star One Love Manchester benefit concert for the bombing victims, co-headlined by Grande and broadcast worldwide on June 4 from the Old Trafford cricket ground, the September event at the arena promised healing through the power of music. “All the industry has rallied around us to understand what we have gone through,” says Allen of the SMG-operated venue. “Not just as a building, but as a city. Manchester’s a music city, and it very much needs live music.” Manchester Arena, one of the top-grossing venues in the world, is refilling its calendar. Neil Diamond played the building on Oct. 1, and upcoming concerts include Lady Antebellum on Oct. 4, J. Cole on Oct. 21 and Metallica on Oct. 28. As the venue once again welcomes fans, Allen reflected on what followed the attack on May 22. On loss and coping: “When you’re an arena manager, you can do as much training as you like, but you don’t know how you’re going to react at the time. This was the ultimate test. I’m pleased I’ve been able to offer support to my team. Everyone there on the night did a fantastic job. I’ve been able to deal with all the issues that have come through. And I’m coming out the other side.” On shutting down the arena: “Canceling one show is tricky. Canceling 23 shows across 14 promoters, like we had to, is really tricky. The support from promoters was great. Not just promoters, but other arena managers, artists and managers, agents, friends from all around the world.” On protecting music fans: “Our business is to sell tickets, and if someone doesn’t feel comfortable coming to the arena, then they won’t buy a ticket. So, a lot of what we do, and what all the industry is doing, [is taking security measures] to give a bit more confidence to people.” On reopening: “One of the nice things about getting back to business is that I’m now finally starting to find the time to get back to people and say thanks. SMG World in America, AEG, Live Nation, SJM Concerts, the National Arenas Association -- and the general public -- have all been hugely supportive.” 5. BARCLAYS CENTER, BROOKLYN$38.2 millionBrett Yormark, 51, CEO, Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment From downtown Brooklyn, Yormark is building a small venue empire. The New Jersey native and father of two has earned two spots on the Arena Power Players list, overseeing the Barclays Center and the newly renovated and reopened NYCB LIVE: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., both top-grossing arenas in their respective capacity classes. “We’re in this business to grow,” says Yormark. As Barclays marks its fifth anniversary this fall, Yormark will soon take on oversight of Brooklyn’s reopened Paramount Theater and Manhattan’s Webster Hall, a joint venture with AEG. 6. STAPLES CENTER, LOS ANGELES$32.9 millionLee Zeidman, 62, president, Staples Center/Nokia Theatre/L.A. Live Adele’s eight-night run at the Staples Center in July 2016 (grossing $13.8 million) and Drake’s three nights in September 2016 were just two recent high points for the arena, which, notes Zeidman, hosts up to 250 events a year, including some 35 concerts. It’s also home to four professional sports teams -- “and still has the schedule flexibility” for major events like the Grammy Awards and the NHL All-Star Game. A Detroit native who has lived in California since age 9, Zeidman is overseeing a $20 million renovation of all concession areas, suites and VIP seating “without losing any events or shutting down the venue.” 7. PRUDENTIAL CENTER, NEWARK, N.J.$32.7 millionScott O’Neil, 46, CEO, Philadelphia 76ers/New Jersey Devils/Prudential Center On O’Neil’s watch, the Prudential Center, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has become an unexpected hotspot for K-pop in the New York area, presenting both KCON and multiple nights of supergroup BTS among the venue’s 22 recent sellouts. Next up, on Oct. 20, the arena will open the Grammy Museum Experience, the first East Coast outpost of the Los Angeles-based museum. When he’s not hosting concerts, O’Neil oversees the NHL’s Devils and the NBA’s 76ers. “I’m constantly on the move,” he says. (Off hours, he’s devoted to other teams, coaching basketball for his daughters, ages 10, 14 and 17.) 8. AMERICAN AIRLINES CENTER, DALLAS$30.1 millionDave Brown, 57, CEO/GM Don Henley may be forever identified with songs of Southern California, but the Eagles co-founder celebrated his 70th birthday in his native Texas with a concert at the American Airlines Center. “If we had a house entertainer, it would be Don Henley,’’ says Brown, noting the Eagles opened the Dallas arena in 2001. During the past year the venue hosted 43 concerts -- a facility record, says Brown, a native of Houston. “If there was a major show out there,” he says, “we had it go through our building.” 9. SPORTPALEIS, ANTWERP, BELGIUM$27.4 millionJan Van Esbroeck, 54, CEO, Sportpaleis Group “Like the whole of Europe, we are now facing new and different safety and security issues,” says Van Esbroeck, a father of two, who notes that terrorist attacks in Brussels in 2016 caused the Sportpaleis to tighten its procedures. “People feel more comfortable knowing that their safety is being taken care of.” With a capacity of 23,000, Sportpaleis remains an essential tour stop “for every big act who wants to collect a nice gross, often more than once.” Among those playing multiple-night runs in 2017 were Depeche Mode, Drake and Belgian pop group Clouseau. 10. THE FORUM, LOS ANGELES$26.6 millionShelli Azoff, 61, managing partner, Azoff MSG EntertainmentNick Spampanato, 49, senior vp/GM, West Coast, Madison Square Garden Company It has been four years since concerts by the Eagles christened the reopened Forum, and the Brooklyn-born Spampanato still recalls the late Glenn Frey calling the renovated arena “the best-sounding building in the business.” For Azoff, The Forum is a music landmark whose legacy she closely guards. “We care so much about this building,” says Azoff, the wife of Irving Azoff, chairman/CEO of the firm that runs The Forum. “Every night we want the fans to have a great time and know that we’re in this for the long term.” Top 10 Venues, 10,001-15,000 Capacity 1. SSE HYDRO, GLASGOW, SCOTLAND$53.8 millionDebbie McWilliams, 46, head of live entertainment sales and ticketing, Scottish Event Campus Since the SSE Hydro opened its doors in 2013, “Glasgow has become a must-play destination on any major tour,” says McWilliams, who joined operator Scottish Event Campus in 1989 fresh out of college and climbed the ranks to become head of live entertainment in 2015. She credits a recent 15-concert run over 11 nights of Scottish comedy show Still Game, alongside sellouts from Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber, with contributing to the venue’s stellar box-office results. Her favorite show at the SSE Hydro? “I’ve got to say Prince,” in 2014. “It was like an amazing ’70s disco club night.” 2.HALLENSTADION, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND$36.7 millionFelix Frei, 57, CEO Hallenstadion’s booking calendar is equally divided among sporting events, corporate functions and concerts, but “the most volatile part is the music and shows,” says Frei, who splits his time between Zurich and the Alpine region of Lenzerheide. The venue executive is concerned that the Swiss touring market may be saturated as artists book festivals on top of arena dates. Yet Frei reports that Hallenstadion just had its second-best year with “140 shows and more than 1 million attendance.” 3.BARCLAYCARD ARENA, HAMBURG, GERMANY$27.5 millionSteve Schwenkglenks, 45, GM, Anschutz Entertainment Group The loss of its two sports teams as tenants in 2016 prompted Barclaycard Arena to rethink its booking strategy. “We have been very successful with that,” says Schwenkglenks, who was promoted to GM in March after seven years at the AEG-owned venue. He credits investment in the building, allowing 12 different audience configurations, with helping make up for any booking shortfall. “That brought us a lot of new content,” says Schwenkglenks, a native of Reutlingen in southwest Germany. Recent performances from Iron Maiden, Shawn Mendes and German rocker Udo Lindenberg boosted the arena’s grosses. 4. NYCB LIVE: HOME OF THE NASSAU VETERANS MEMORIAL COLISEUM, UNIONDALE, N.Y.$18.7 millionBrett Yormark, 51, CEO, Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment (See Barclays Center entry.) 5. PERTH ARENA, PERTH, AUSTRALIA$16 millionMichael Scott, 50, GM, Perth Arena/AEG Ogden Challenged to bring tours to one of the globe’s most remote capital cities, Scott says Perth is “spoiled for choice.” Three nights this past January by Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band and spring dates by Green Day, Santana and the Dixie Chicks helped Perth Arena’s standing. Scott, a native of the capital of Western Australia, says “fans are still buying plenty of tickets despite a softer economy. But they are more discerning about what they attend -- and more sensitive to ticket price.” 6. VAN ANDEL ARENA, GRAND RAPIDS, MI$12 millionRichard MacKeigan, 50, regional GM, SMG/Van Andel Arena Performances at the Van Andel Arena by Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Tim McGraw & Faith Hill, Eric Church and others contributed to what MacKeigan reports was the “best fiscal year ever” at the 20-year-old venue. A Montreal native and father of three, MacKeigan says that even at his Midwest venue, security is his most pressing issue, “given what the world is witnessing these days.” For venue management firm SMG, he says, “safety -- for our employees, the guests and the artists -- is always our first concern.” 7. BRISBANE ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA$12 millionTrish McNamara, 47, GM Hosting Australian tours this past year by Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood would be bragging rights for most arena managers. But ask McNamara about the highlight of her year, and the Queensland native describes arranging group tickets to Disney on Ice: Frozen for 60 girls under age 15, all with autism. For many, it was their first time at an arena performance. “I spoke with a mother who was crying and asked if I could help,” recalls McNamara. “All she said was, ‘I never thought my child would see a show like all the other kids.’ It was overwhelming to her.” 8. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA, LAS VEGAS$11.8 millionNathalie Binette, 51, executive director “MGM Resorts has always held the safety of our guests at the highest level,” said Binette, in comments she made before the Oct. 1 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest festival site, a five-minute drive from the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Like its sister venue, the T-Mobile Arena, the MGM Grand prohibits all weapons, including firearms carried with permits, inside the venue. In her earlier comments, Binette added: “We aggressively pursue the leading-edge technology to stay ahead of any potential threats to our venue, our guests and employees.” 9. INFINITE ENERGY CENTER, DULUTH, GA$9.3 millionDan Markham, 54, executive director of booking At the Infinite Energy Center, 30 miles northeast of Atlanta, Markham checked a major item off his career bucket list by booking Paul McCartney’s July 23 performance. “It broke the single-night gross ticket sales record for the facility, at $2.3 million,” says Markham, a native of Troy, N.Y., who has been at the Georgia venue since 2009. A rising concern? Growing competition for acts from an increasing number of concert facilities, including amphitheaters, says Markham. “I joke that anybody with an acre of grass and some lawn chairs has decided to become a venue.” 10. 3ARENA, DUBLIN$8.1 millionCormack Rennick, 55, GM, Live Nation Entertainment “The cranes are back in Dublin’s skyline,” says Rennick, remarking on the rebounding Irish economy, which is prompting multiple-night bookings at the 3Arena by acts including comic Billy Connolly, Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran. “Ed did two shows,” says Rennick, who started his career booking bands while studying at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. “We could have done 22 with him, or even 222.” Managing a venue just 160 miles across the Irish Sea from Manchester, Rennick says the “horrific events” of last May have “made everyone really security-aware. It’s the reality that we live in now.” Contributors: Lars Brandle, Dave Brooks, Adrienne Gaffney, Andy Gensler, Mitchell Peters, Richard Smirke ?This article originally appeared in the Oct. 14 issue of Billboard.

BLACKBURN LIKELY LANDING ON COMMERCE, JUDICIARY — Blackburn looks poised to score high-profile seats on both the Senate Commerce and Judiciary panels, which would grant her a powerful megaphone for touting her tech and telecom agenda, according to a roster circulating Wednesday among industry and on Capitol Hill. Blackburn, who chaired the House’s powerful telecom subcommittee the past two years, championed deregulation and other telecom-friendly policies she says will help close the digital divide, railed against tech giants for alleged censorship of conservatives, and signaled interest in jumping into the Senate’s debates on data privacy. A spokesman for Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said rosters aren’t finalized. ON TAP: A NEW COMMITTEE TO MODERNIZE THE HOUSE — The
rules package backed by incoming House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that’s up for debate today would create a new ""Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress"" tasked with figuring out how to upgrade the House’s use of tech, from office computers to constituent management systems to bill publishing platforms. Critics have long said Congress' often antiquated approach to technology makes it hard for constituents to contact their representatives and keep track of their legislative efforts. — One thing to watch: At least two of the committee’s 12 members must be first-term lawmakers — a rare opening for reform-minded freshmen to help immediately change how the House works and to carve out a name for themselves in the tech sphere. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who will become speaker of the House today, walks to her new office at the Capitol during a TV interview with NBC on Wednesday. | AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite THE 115TH CONGRESS’ LAST HURRAH — The Senate on Wednesday night confirmed a flurry of federal nominees, including several for key tech and telecom posts, before concluding voting for this session. Among them:
Kelvin Droegemeier, who was tapped to the lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy;
Geoffrey Starks, the newest Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission; and GOP Commissioner Brendan Carr, who was nominated for his second term at the FCC. But even with those nominations settled, the 115th Congress still adjourned with plenty of tech and telecom legislation on the table. The next Congress must decide whether to move forward with a series of long-stalled policy proposals. Here are a few items to keep an eye on: — RIP to the net neutrality CRA: Another casualty of the 115th Congress coming to a close: efforts by House Democrats to bring a vote on the Obama-era net neutrality rules to the chamber through a
Congressional Review Act discharge petition. The procedural wrinkle will officially expire with the current Congress, sending Democrats back to the drawing board after they failed to muster the 218 signatures needed to pull off the maneuver in 2018. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai celebrated the development on Wednesday, praising the House for declining to “reinstate heavy-handed Internet regulation” in a statement. — What is dead may never die? But House Democrats are signaling they will seek to move forward with efforts to restore the Obama-era rules through conventional legislation — even though any measure would face an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled Senate. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who is poised to become chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the upcoming Congress, dinged Pai’s comments in statement to MT and called the FCC’s net neutrality repeal “a disaster for consumers.” He also vowed that “the new Democratic majority will work to restore strong net neutrality rules in the House of Representatives this year.” — No dice on the Honest Ads Act: Amid
controversies over political advertising on social media, Democratic lawmakers have renewed calls for a vote on the bill (S. 1989 (115)) to require that some online platforms maintain records on political ads — but the push has stalled. A spokesperson for Sen.
Mark Warner (D-Va.), who introduced the bill in 2017 along with Sens.
Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and the late John McCain (R-Ariz.),
told POLITICO the bill will remain a “priority” for Warner going forward. The measure has been backed by several top tech firms, including Facebook and Twitter. TECH RIPS TARIFFS AFTER APPLE FORECAST SHIFT — Tech leaders are speaking out against the Trump administration’s tariff actions after Apple cited trade tensions with China in
announcing its projected revenue will be lower than expected. In response, Information Technology Industry Council’s Josh Kallmer called the tariffs a “direct threat to American workers and companies, hindering economic growth and slowing hiring for tech and other sectors.” And Information Technology and Innovation Foundation President Rob Atkinson said the economic “headwinds” in China “may be a result of the Trump administration tariff.” The groups have urged the Trump administration to reverse course in its dispute with Beijing. — Patrick Halley, a partner at law firm Wilkinson Barker Knauer, has joined USTelecom as its new senior vice president of advocacy and regulatory affairs. …

Filed under: The music-driven drama provided the major critique of culture in 2018 In the U.S., the unspeakable carnage of a mass shooting is usually followed by thoughts, prayers, government inaction, and public outcry over said inaction. In Vox Lux, actor-turned-director Brady Corbet trades the standard post-mass shooting discourse — after gunmen fire assault rifles indiscriminately at beachgoers in Croatia — in favor of pop scrutiny. Rather than the NRA and Republican politicians, responsibility for the violent episode is placed on Celeste, a mononymous singer deified by her fans, as well as the artist herself, as she kicks off a comeback tour tied to the release of her new record (which is also the source of the film’s title). Though calling it a comeback is a touchy subject. “I never stopped making music,” she hisses acidly at a journalist during a roundtable, “so I don’t consider it a resurgence.” Why Celeste? When the attackers make their entrance in Vox Lux — marking the start of the film’s second act (“Act II, Regenesis”) — they’re wearing the same masks Celeste wore in her first big music video, shot nearly two decades prior when she was a teenager. The association is reason enough for the media, who hold Celeste captive at a press conference to demand she answer for the killers’ actions and make amends to the public: “Why do you think they chose you?” “Are there any links between you and central Europe?” “Are you and the band still going forward with the show tonight?” The answers, in order: Maybe because she’s a woman; no, she’s never played a show there; and yes, because there’s no point in postponing joy. But she shouldn’t have to say so in the first place. She isn’t the one who had her finger on the trigger. Vox Lux, along with Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born remake and the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, is the third movie of 2018 to contend with the delicate matter of what artists owe the culture they live in. Of the three it’s also the bluntest troll, a stiff middle finger aimed at a Twitter-fueled culture of self-congratulatory star shaming. Art is of less interest to gatekeepers of discourse than the artist’s disposition, Vox Lux suggests, and Celeste’s is under constant litigation by journalists, tabloid vultures, and social media. They’re all so busy litigating her culpability, her art isn’t even in question. [Ed. note: The following contains spoilers for A Star Is Born and plot points for Vox Lux.] It’s fitting that Celeste, played as a teen by Raffey Cassidy and as an adult by Natalie Portman, is called to the stand for others’ atrocities. Years after expending her sympathy card — her career began with a school shooting, which she survived and commemorated in a song she wrote with her sister, Ellie (Stacy Martin) — she attracts more chagrin than charity. “Maybe they think I’m a floozy,” she supposes to the press corps regarding why the shooters picked her as the symbol of their violence, “but maybe you guys think that too. I mean, the way I’ve chosen to live my life goes against some people’s views on things.” Fall out of lockstep with what the herd deems appropriate, and your persona is called into question, too. Celeste’s trial in the court of public opinion contrasts with the rags-to-riches tale of A Star is Born’s Ally Campana (Lady Gaga). She has ambitions she keeps mostly to herself and talent she shares with small audiences. It so happens that one night her audience includes Jackson Maine (Cooper), a famous country singer, who, dazzled by her vocal gifts, takes Ally under his wing and propels her to center stage. It’s an American dream come true. Eventually, his battles with alcoholism weigh her down, and while he gets the help he needs, it’s not enough. His demons get the best of him. His story ends in a garage. It’s a lonely death, but one that does for Ally the inverse of what Celeste’s own battles with past trauma do to her. From darkness, pop culture ushers her toward the light. Ally and Celeste have much in common. The pop culture industrial complex forces evolution in both of them (Ally from country to pop, Celeste from a gentler form of pop to a gothic synth mutation of her original sound) they both achieve godlike status in pop culture, though A Star is Born leaves this as subtext where Vox Lux makes it text. “I used to believe in God, too, and if they ever come to their senses, and they want something new to believe in, they can believe in me, ’cause I’m the new faith,” Celeste declares while offering her murderous imitators a staggeringly ill-advised invitation to her concert. Ally’s godhood instead towers over cities from billboards. By comparison, she’s downright humble. Their transformations are tolls paid to the culture. Ally owes listeners what her producer Rez (Rafi Gavron) thinks will sell records: vapid pop that betrays her roots. Celeste owes listeners an explanation to help them make sense of the senseless, a burden she’s unequipped to shoulder. Galling insensitivity to Celeste’s history with mass shootings aside, she’s not the right messenger to deliver a dispatch for hope in the wake of tragedy. It’s not because she’s a woman, or a successful woman, or that she had a kid when, in her words, she was a kid — it’s because her life’s a luxurious mess, the result of her experiences in an industry that both holds her in contempt and expects her to be the figurehead to speak words of healing. She needs to heal, too, and no one affords her the chance. Such is the fate of public figures posing as divine beings. This is arguably as true for Freddie Mercury, portrayed in Bohemian Rhapsody by Rami Malek. But instead of wrestling with the morals and duties of stardom, the greatest hits biopic spells out in block letters what Vox Lux and A Star is Born write in cursive. “We’re four misfits who don’t belong together, playing to the other misfits, the outcasts right at the back of the room, who are pretty sure they don’t belong, either,” says Mercury to John Reid (Aidan Gillen), Queen’s new manager. “We belong to them.” Later, Freddie sits before a press conference, too, but handles the pressure like a man cornered and not a woman falsely accused. He breaks down, but she blows up. Next to Freddie and Celeste, Ally’s the lucky one. Only Jackson is dragged in the press; she’s treated like a victim. Pop culture denies Celeste the same privilege, and Vox Lux makes careful note of the denial. It’s a bratty, taunting movie, but compared to Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born, it’s unfailingly honest. Corbet’s abrasive filmmaking affords him a clear-eyed take on the transmutative effect of pop commercialism, as stardom washes honest musicians away in a flash. Tempt a young, earnest songwriter with a record contract, and they’ll stop singing country tunes or heartbreaking personal anthems, trading their spirit for electronic glitz, buried in synth and reverb. A Star Is Born shrugs off the ramifications of Ally’s change in persona; Vox Lux observes those ramifications in anger. Celeste’s innocence is stolen from her over the course of her life, starting at the very beginning of the film and ending as she seeks oblivion in the choreography of her stage show. Having long ago appropriated Celeste’s earnest expressions of pain and remade them as edgy entertainment, the culture is happy to throw her pain back at her in her adulthood. Corbet, a student of Michael Haneke (Amour, Funny Games), understands the dynamic well. Violence happens in the world, and pop music synthesizes it. At best, that births a No. 1 hit for Celeste. At worst, it makes her culpable in the killings that open Vox Lux’s second half, all while picking over the details of the pop life foisted on her as a kid. Entertainment culture makes her into a symbol and rejects the symbol when it suits the culture’s needs. Ultimately, pop culture is violence.

81,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/gun-control-democrats-background-check-bill,"House measure to close longstanding loopholes is key step for advocates but is likely to be blocked by Senate First published on Tue 8 Jan 2019 11.00 GMT Five days after taking over the majority in the chamber, House Democrats unveiled a bill that would significantly expand the requirements for background checks on gun sales. In a major victory for gun control advocates, the legislation aims to close longstanding loopholes in federal law, which requires criminal background checks when guns are sold by licensed dealers but allows private citizens to sell and transfer guns to each other without any background check.  Closing these loopholes has been the top priority of the growing American gun control movement since the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, which left 20 children and six educators dead. “Stopping gun violence takes courage – the courage to do what is right,” said the former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at an event on Capitol Hill. “We must never stop fighting. Fight. Fight. Fight,” she added, her speech slow but clear. Giffords survived being shot in the head exactly eight years ago in an attack that left six people dead. She now leads one of the country’s leading gun control groups. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who joined Giffords, said: “Today is also a day of action.” Pelosi recalled recalling hearing the news of Gifford’s shooting. “We say enough is enough by finally bringing bipartisan, commonsense background check legislation to the floor of the House.” Also at the signing was David Hogg, one of the students who have advocated for reforms since the shooting at his Parkland, Florida, high school last year. While the new bill – a top priority of the new House Democratic majority – is expected to pass the House, it is likely to be blocked from becoming law by the Republican-controlled Senate. Still, even the partial passage of what Democrats are calling a “universal background checks bill” represents a significant step forward for American gun control advocates, as well as a sign of how far the Democratic party has moved to embrace gun control as a winning issue. Early in the Obama administration, national Democratic leaders avoided getting involved in the gun control debate, following the Bill Clinton-approved strategy that saw gun control as the toxic “third rail” of American politics. In 2016, after a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub that left 49 people dead, House Republican leaders refused even to allow a debate on gun control legislation, prompting a dramatic protest by Democrats, who staged a 26-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives. The new legislation is significantly stronger and more comprehensive than the background check compromise that advanced after the Sandy Hook shooting, which would have closed the background check loophole for gun sales on the internet and at gun shows but left other private sales unregulated. That compromise failed to gain enough votes to overcome a potential filibuster in the Senate. The stronger bill would not have seen the light without the continued activism by gun violence survivors, Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords’ gun control group, told the Guardian. “We’ll do everything we can to get this across the finish line,” he added. “This is going to be a happy moment – a celebratory moment – and it allows us to see our hard work on the ground every single day actually being put into action,” said Jaclyn Corin, a Parkland student and one of the founders of March for Our Lives. Student activists are already planning how they will fight for the passage of the legislation in the Republican-controlled Senate, Corin said. “If they don’t support it or bring it to the floor, it really shows people that they value profits and money over their constituents’ lives,” she said. Public opinion polls routinely find that overwhelming majorities of American voters, including Republicans and gun owners, support requiring background checks for all gun buyers. But the policy has been opposed by the National Rifle Association, gun manufacturers, and other gun rights advocates, who argue that increased legal regulations on gun buying is not an effective approach to deterring gun crime, and who also oppose most governmental regulation of guns on principle. An estimated 22% of Americans who bought a gun in recent years did so without a background check, according to the best recent survey data. Nearly 40,000 Americans were killed with firearms in 2017, the majority of them gun suicides, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",2019-01-08 06:00:07,Gun control: Democrats to unveil landmark background check bill,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Gabby Giffords returns to Congress Tuesday to help introduce a bill that would expand background checks on private gun sales, her hometown gathered to remember the shooting that almost killed her. A memorial ceremony Tuesday morning at a fire station in downtown Tucson marked the eight-year anniversary of the shooting. At 10:10 a.m., exactly eight years after the shooting began, Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild rang a bell 19 times — one for each person killed or injured in the shooting. The Jan. 8, 2011, attack at a Tucson-area Safeway killed six people and injured 13 others. Giffords, then a third-term congresswoman meeting with constituents, was shot in the head. In the years since the shooting, Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, have emerged as some of the country’s most influential gun-safety activists. Their political organization, Giffords, has racked up legislative victories at the local and state levels, but its progress has stalled on Capitol Hill. It will try again Tuesday in the newly Democratic U.S. House. Giffords and Kelly joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at an event to introduce the background-check bill, called H.R. 8. Newly elected Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a co-sponsor of the bill, planned to lead a moment of silence on the House floor to honor the victims of the attack. Giffords noted the anniversary in social media posts Tuesday morning. ""I'm in Washington today, but my heart is in Tucson,"" she wrote. ""Though I will never make sense of that day, I've dedicated my life to making our communities safer,"" she said in the post. ""Speaking is still difficult for me, but I don't think I can make myself more clear: Congress must act to make our country safer from gun violence."" I’m in Washington today, but my heart is in Tucson. Eight years ago, six lives were stolen outside a Safeway. I was shot in the head. Another 12 were injured. Though I will never make sense of that day, I’ve dedicated my life to making our communities safer. pic.twitter.com/aFijC3QOvj The Tucson remembrance was likely the final such event before a permanent memorial to the shooting is finished. Last year, Giffords was in Tucson to dedicate the ground on which the January 8th Memorial will eventually stand. Once finished, the memorial will guide visitors below the city’s surface, down ramps on either side of a reflecting pool. They’ll end up in El Presidio Park, facing the county courthouse and Tucson City Hall. “Most of all, it will remind future generations how our community came together at an important moment in history,” the January 8th Memorial Foundation said in a description, “and how we can all continue to build a better democracy through active participation and civil discourse.” The $2.5 million memorial, which is funded by a combination of public and private money, is expected to be completed in time for the shooting’s nine-year anniversary.

86,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/house-democrats-gun-control.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by transcript “We say enough is enough by finally bringing common sense, bipartisan background check legislation to the floor of the House.” “I’ve seen great courage when my life was on the line. Now is a time to come together— be responsible: Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting. Fight, fight, fight — be bold, be courageous. The nation’s counting on you.” By Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON — Emboldened House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation on Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. By introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress. The measure, and a companion bill introduced Tuesday in the Senate, also reflects the changing politics around gun laws, an issue many Democrats once shied away from. The bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but will face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the internet. There would be limited exceptions, including for law enforcement officers and for guns transferred between close family members. Polls have shown that a vast majority of Americans — by some estimates, 90 percent — support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Many Democrats, including Representative Lucy McBath, a freshman from Georgia whose son was shot and killed at a Florida gas station, were elected last year after promising to address gun safety. “Today we take a decisive step to help save lives right away,” said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and the bill’s chief sponsor, adding, “From public polling to the ballot box, the American people have spoken up and demanded action.” By limiting the bill to background checks — and keeping out other provisions such as a ban on assault rifles or high-capacity magazines — gun safety advocates hope to pressure Republicans on a policy that has broad public support. In the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will have to decide whether to bring up the bill. In the House, Republicans will be forced to vote on it. “It will show us who’s with us and who’s against us,” said Patricia Maisch, 69, who survived the Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting in Tucson that killed six and grievously injured Ms. Giffords. But by narrowing the bill so dramatically, Democrats may also limit its utility. Suspects in many recent high-profile mass shootings — including those in Pittsburgh; Parkland, Fla.; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. — had passed background checks when purchasing their weapons. Even modest gun law changes rarely make it through Congress. The measure is similar to one written by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, in response to the mass shooting that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. That bill, pressed hard by President Barack Obama and the parents of Sandy Hook victims, fell to a bipartisan filibuster in 2013 in a Senate controlled by Democrats. Then as now, the National Rifle Association opposed the measure. “So-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the powerful gun lobby. She noted that the gunman who shot Ms. Giffords passed a background check. His name did not come up in the federal database even though he had mental health issues. The Democrats’ measure was unveiled at a news conference featuring Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Thompson, who helped write the House companion bill to Toomey-Manchin in 2013, and Ms. Giffords, as well as gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence from around the country. Mr. Thompson escorted Ms. Giffords, who as a former member is still permitted on the House floor, into the chamber so she could formally drop the bill into the “hopper” — the bin, located on the rostrum, where all legislation has its start. Ms. Giffords, 48, a Democrat who once opposed gun control, was shot in the head during a constituent meeting she was holding in a supermarket parking lot. Those who died included a 9-year-old girl and a young staff member for Ms. Giffords; 13 were injured, including Ms. Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury that makes conversation difficult. “It’s been a long, hard haul, but I’m getting better,” Ms. Giffords told reporters at a breakfast Tuesday, reading from a prepared statement. She said she was still undergoing “speech therapy, physical therapy — and yoga, too.” Current law requires only federally licensed gun dealers to perform background checks. Gun safety advocates say the law is riddled with loopholes that allow felons, domestic abusers and others who would ordinarily be prohibited from buying guns to purchase them through private sales, including online and at gun shows. For gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence, Tuesday’s bill introduction represents an important shift in Washington after a year of devastating massacres, including the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last February, which spawned a powerful youth movement. “Successful legislative change follows cultural change,” said Emily Nottingham, whose son, Gabriel Zimmerman, then an aide to Ms. Giffords, was killed in the Tucson shooting. She added, “When more and more people recognize that this is a national issue that can affect all of us, not just a few people somewhere else, then cultural change happens, and that’s what we’re seeing now.” Under the Thompson bill, anyone who wanted to sell a gun but lacked a license would have to take the weapon to a licensed dealer, who would then conduct a background check on the purchaser. Transfers between law enforcement officers and military personnel acting in a professional capacity would be exempt, as would “a loan or bona fide gift between spouses, between domestic partners, between parents and their children, between siblings, between aunts and uncles and their nieces or nephews or between grandparents and their grandchildren,” according to the text of the bill. Transfers to executors of estates would also be exempt, as would temporary transfers of weapons for the purpose of hunting or to “prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.” Advertisement",2019-01-08 17:35:55,"House Democrats, Making Guns a Priority, Unveil a Background Check Bill",,1,http://nytimes.com

89,https://www.bustle.com/p/david-hogg-wants-trumps-national-emergency-dialogue-to-start-with-tackling-gun-violence-15727034,"News  Recently, President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that he might declare a national emergency in order to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. On Tuesday, Parkland survivor and gun control activist David Hogg suggested he wants Trump's national emergency dialogue to prioritize tackling gun violence instead, noting the alarming numbers of gun deaths in the United States. Hogg made these remarks during an interview on CNN's New Day. Amidst a discussion about the effectiveness of background checks in curbing gun violence, Hogg implied that Trump needs to shift his focus away from the border wall and toward the problem of gun-related fatalities in America. As Hogg told host Alisyn Camerota: The gun control activist also added that he believes that Democrats and Republicans need to work together to help curb gun deaths. ""It is an issue that is non-partisan,"" Hogg said. ""At least I would hope so considering ... both Democrats and Republicans die from gun violence. Bullets don't discriminate and neither should our legislators."" The gun control activist also called out legislators for being reluctant to vote for gun control legislation due to pressure from the National Rifle Association. ""No legislator should look at these laws and think to themselves, 'Oh I canât vote on that because Iâve taken campaign contributions from the NRA [National Rifle Association],'"" Hogg noted. ""And thatâs what theyâre thinking."" He also implored the American public to be more aware of the influence of the gun lobby in Congress. ""The American people need to wake up and realize â again and again, [this is] the reason these laws are not getting passed â¦,"" Hogg asserted. The Parkland student's appearance on CNN came as Democrats introduced a new gun control bill in Congress on Tuesday. As the New York Times reported, the bill would significantly increase background check requirements, mandating them for almost all firearms purchases. The paper noted that, presently, background checks are required when individuals purchase guns through federally-licensed gun dealers. However, background checks are typically not required for private gun sales, including those conducted via the internet and at gun shows. Generally-speaking, outside of a few very limited circumstances, this bill would no longer allow these exceptions for private sales. The bill was introduced to coincide with the eight-year anniversary of a mass shooting in Arizona that seriously wounded former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and killed six individuals, CNN reported. The New York Times noted that it is very likely that the bill will pass the House, which now has a Democratic majority. However, its fate is much more uncertain in the Senate, which has a Republican majority. It's certainly clear that Hogg believes that gun control legislation, like the aforementioned bill, needs to be more of a priority in the United States. As the Parkland survivor pointed out, as the president is focusing on seeking to characterize border security as a ""national emergency,"" a gun violence crisis that kills or injures dozens of Americans every day is continually unfolding within the country.

90,https://www.inquisitr.com/5241901/house-dems-unveil-bill-to-expand-background-checks-on-guns/,"On Tuesday, January 8 — the anniversary of a mass shooting that occurred in Tuscon, Arizona — Democrats in the House of Representatives unveiled a new bill that seeks to address the issue of background checks on all gun sales. Presently, not every gun sale requires a background check. According to one study conducted in 2017, more than 1-in-5 of the most recent gun purchases by gun owners across the country were conducted without looking into the background of the buyer, according to reporting from the Center for American Progress. Many individuals who are prohibited from buying guns, such as violent felons and others, could feasibly do so while skirting the background check system that's put in place to prevent them from getting a weapon. The bill submitted by Democrats on Tuesday sought to address that gap by requiring every gun transfer — including private sales online or at gun shows as well as gifts from friends or family members — be subjected to a background check. Individuals who are not licensed dealers, for instance, would be required to bring their gun to someone who was. ""Today is a day of action. We say, 'Enough is enough,'"" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday, according to reporting from NBC News. Pelosi was joined by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was the victim of a mass shooting incident in Tuscon, Arizona, in 2011. Giffords narrowly survived the event, which saw six other individuals killed and dozens more injured.House Democrats introduce bipartisan bill that would require all gun sellers, including private vendors, to conduct background checks on buyers https://t.co/3dOP2NA3Yf— Roll Call (@rollcall) January 8, 2019""Now is the time to come together, be responsible.

House Democrats introduce bipartisan bill that would require all gun sellers, including private vendors, to conduct background checks on buyers https://t.co/3dOP2NA3Yf The bill faces many challenges preventing it from becoming law. The Senate, which must also approve the bill, also saw Democrats in that chamber submit a similar proposal on Tuesday. However, that chamber of Congress is currently led by Republicans, which have historically opposed measures to tighten gun restrictions in recent years. As recently as last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) made clear that he was not willing to do much on the issue. ""I don't think at the federal level there's much that we can do other than appropriate funds,"" he said at an event in Kentucky late in December, per reporting from the Daily Beast. He further added that gun laws are ""basically a local decision."" Gun deaths for 2017, the most recent year for which there is data on the issue, found that almost 40,000 people died from firearm-related injuries last year, the highest year on record since 1968, according to a report from the New York Times.",2019-01-09 10:13:57,House Dems Unveil Bill To Expand Background Checks On Guns,,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com

93,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-big-problem-his-reality-tv-shtick-is-getting-boring?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH Tuesday night’s Oval Office address illustrated how unimaginative the president's approach truly is. Last night, America was treated to an extremely boring episode of the Trump show. The recycled half-truths, outright falsehoods, and weird snuff-film descriptions of crimes committed by immigrants were to be expected. So was the stale repetition of the case—if you can call it that—for a wall. But the low-energy monotone? The incessant snuffling? The distractingly puffy under eye bags that suggested someone was in desperate need of the antidote? Maybe someone, someday, will make Oval Office addresses great again. But it won’t be Donald Trump. It would be easy to pretend this primetime national embarrassment never occurred. But Trump’s inability to say anything new is a symptom of a serious problem. Our president appears to have run out of whatever limited intellectual capital he brought with him to Washington. He’s the proverbial old dog incapable of learning new tricks. And while that may hurt him politically in the short run, in the long run, we all pay the price. Thirteen years ago, Stephen Colbert delivered the perfect one-liner at George W. Bush’s expense. “He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday – no matter what happened Tuesday.” Yet President Bush’s stubborn insistence on clinging to failing strategies has nothing on President Trump’s. Tuesday night’s Oval Office address contained only the briefest of mentions of a government shutdown. With that one exception, you’d be forgiven for thinking the president doesn’t realize 800,000 federal workers aren’t getting paid. Or that we just had a campaign that featured this exact same set of arguments, only more frequently and with more enthusiasm, and the president’s side lost. Or that a ferociously anti-immigrant State of the Union Address didn’t increase public support for a border wall. Or that a ferociously anti-immigrant 2019 address to Congress didn’t increase public support for a border wall. Or that a ferociously anti-immigrant Inaugural Address didn’t increase public support for a border wall. If demonizing immigrants and blaming Democrats was going to work, it would have worked by now. But it hasn’t. And it won’t. President Trump is like the football coach who, going into the second half down by 20, remains determined to establish the run. So why won’t he try a new approach? The answer is sadly obvious. He can’t. For starters, he’s backed himself into a rhetorical corner. His build-the-wall speeches have little basis in reality, which is why most Americans remain unconvinced by them. But enough Americans are convinced by them that there’s no way for President Trump to pivot. A more dexterous politician might be able to bring his base along with him as he switches to plan B. But dexterity is not the Donald’s forte. The great irony is that President Trump claims – and perhaps even thinks – that he has a snake-charmer’s hold over his supporters. He famously boasted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and they wouldn’t care. Yet apparently the president’s confidence, which encompasses murder, does not extend to backing down from a campaign promise, even when he has very good policy and political reasons to do so. To his credit, I guess, Trump briefly tried to assert his independence, act like a sensible leader, and fund the government without a wall. But then Ann Coulter and Fox and Friends got mad at him and he meekly fell in line. President Trump’s speech was repetitive, in part, because his own voters won’t allow him to say something new. It’s also repetitive because the real crisis facing America, a government shutdown with no end in sight, doesn’t really interest President Trump. The British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan famously (and perhaps apocryphally) replied, when asked what he most feared, “Events, dear boy, events.” But this only holds true if politicians recognize urgency when they see it. President Trump, frighteningly, does not. Asking him to think through a new issues is like asking Right Said Fred to come up with new original hits. He has his setlist. It’s not going to change. Above all, and most disturbingly, what we saw last night was a person who’s empathy is in very limited supply. If you’ve been murdered by an immigrant, preferably an undocumented immigrant, President Trump will mutter “So sad, so sad,” after sharing your story. But if you’ve been gunned down in a mass shooting; or driven to suicide by an inept response to a hurricane, or left to die in the custody of Border Patrol, the president just doesn’t seem to care about you. What is true for lives is equally true for livelihoods. Most economists don’t think America loses jobs due to immigration, yet President Trump still managed to lament those lost jobs in his big speech. But how about the very real TSA agents working without pay? Or the federal workers wondering how they’ll pay their February rent? Or the contractors who will never make up their lost wages, even after the government reopens? The president did not say even a single world about them. That’s remarkable. And it’s part of a pattern. To a truly unprecedented degree, President Trump seems not to care about, or even notice, a vast number of the people he has sworn an oath to serve. This helps explain his low approval numbers. But until he’s no longer in office, it also puts us all at risk. Which is the really interesting, and really frightening, lesson we learned from Donald Trump’s speech last night. His team included the mistruths. They included the fear mongering. They included the pandering to his base. But in a setting where the president was in theory addressing all of “My fellow Americans,” what they left out was us. Got a tip?

And the latest word on this is that the Knicks are reportedly exploring a potential deal involving Zach Randolph, someone who played for the ballclub in the past. According to the NY Post, the deal makes sense. However, the Knicks may need to add a future asset as well and find a willing third team for the trade to materialize. With so many factors involved, this trade could take some time to polish. Kanter is a notable double-double machine, someone who could provide the Sacramento Kings a big boost. On the other end, the Knicks would be getting players with expiring contracts, which would no longer be a concern come the 2019-20 season. This should give New York added flexibility as far as salary cap concerns. Randolph, 37, is at the twilight of his NBA career. Once his contract expires at the end of the season, he is likely to get short-term deals at best. Right now, he has hardly been utilized in Sacramento. Further, returning to the Knicks would make sense since the head coach, David Fizdale, is pretty much familiar with how to use Z-Bo, unless New York has other plans such as a waive or buyout, the NY Daily News reported. Kanter is due to make $18.6 million this season, while Randolph will be getting $11.6 million. Despite limited action, Kanter said that he is happy in New York. But when one looks at the ploys that the Knicks are using, it seems that focus is more on the younger players and planning ahead. Hence, the likely scenario is the Turkish center getting shipped, but his next destination remains unknown. As mentioned in a previous post, there are several unidentified teams interested in trading for Kanter. But among the teams that could put him to good use include the Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio Spurs and the Brooklyn Nets. The list of interested teams could swell in the coming days as the February trade deadline nears. Zach Randolph could be returning to New York if the NBA trade deal involving Enes Kanter materializes.

On October 1, Stephen Paddock killed at least 58 people and injured more than 450 after he opened fire on a large crowd at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The massacre is one of the deadliest mass shooting events in U.S. history. Los Angeles won 75-69.  Photo: Getty Images/Ethan Miller Kanter made it clear that he wants to win.

99,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy7azb/how-to-deal-with-cops-who-believe-wild-conspiracy-theories-like-qanon,"Last year, Matt Patten, a sergeant with the Broward County, Florida, sheriff’s office, set off a minor scandal when he posed for a photo with Vice President Mike Pence while wearing an agency-issued SWAT vest bearing a ""QAnon"" patch that read ""question the narrative."" Depending on who you ask, QAnon is either an amorphous, continually shifting pro-Trump conspiracy theory or possible anti-Trump prank that has been percolating in the cultural ether for well over a year. Among other views, many adherents hold (incorrectly, of course) that the president is secretly working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to expose high-level Democrats’ involvement in a murderous, Satanic pedophile ring. About a month ago, the sheriff’s office disciplined Patten for violating its employee conduct and uniform policies. (The 31-year vet was removed from the local Homeland Security branch and SWAT team and chided for breaching official practices of political neutrality.) But Patten is hardly the only cop who has voiced, shown solidarity with—or shared materials related to—a conspiracy theory. Famously, after the Umpqua Community College mass shooting in 2015, reporters found that local sheriff John Hanlin had previously shared content on his personal Facebook page suggesting the feds may have staged the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting—and even the 9/11 terrorist attacks—as pretenses to disarm the public by way of gun control laws. The posts Hanlin engaged with—seemingly approvingly—also advanced the idea that the parents of murdered Sandy Hook children were, in fact, “crisis actors.” Likewise, notorious (albeit pardoned) criminal and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio used his office, and public resources, right up until his ouster in a 2016 election, to promote the racist anti-Obama “birther” conspiracy theory. Neither Arpaio nor Hanlin appear to have faced real pushback for their conspiratorial alignments (though Hanlin later denied believing the crisis actor theory).And those are just the high-profile, national cases. It is tempting to brush off most instances of cops aligning themselves with conspiracy theories. After all, according to some research, the majority of Americans believe in some kind of conspiracy theory, and usually that belief doesn’t amount to very much. But the last two years have demonstrated that conspiratorial beliefs can morph into concerning—or worse—real-world actions. The presence of unabashed conspiracy theorists in the White House, the president chief among them, has also arguably emboldened peddlers of these toxic or just not-factual ideas. In the case of law-enforcement officers, it is not unreasonable to worry that a clear adherence to a conspiracy theory—an honest belief, say, that the Democratic Party is one big pedophile ring, that many mass shootings are “false flag” operations, or that liberal protestors are paid actors—may seriously bias their interactions with the public or compromise criminal investigations. At the very least, their open association with these ideas could spread misinformation, or (further) erode public trust in law-enforcement institutions. So what can be done about law-enforcement officials who, in one way or another, align themselves with conspiracy theories? VICE reached out to Samuel Walker, a prominent expert on police law and conduct and emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, for perspective. VICE: In general, is it appropriate for law enforcement officers, given the place of authority they hold in their communities, to voice belief in or share stuff related to conspiracy theories?
Samuel Walker: Basically, off the job, police officers enjoy the same free speech rights that the rest of us do. If they’re publicly putting out conspiracy theories about a case that they or the department are working on, that is different. That would be a violation of department policy; an officer can’t publicly discuss the background of a robbery suspect or someone who has been arrested, for example. But in terms of things unrelated to department activities, how are conspiracy theories different from most religious beliefs? Where do you draw the line? Are you saying there are some theories of how the world and universe operate that are acceptable and some that are not? Where it gets trickier is when you get into areas of race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual [identity]. What if a police officer is a member of the Ku Klux Klan? Is that person disqualified from being a police officer? I think it depends on the officer’s actions. If there is evidence of discriminatory actions in, for instance, traffic stops or uses of force, the officer should be disciplined for that. And a person’s membership in a racist organization then becomes relevant to the extent of his or her [racist] beliefs [and thus the discipline meted out]. But if a person is a member of whatever group and that officer’s conduct on the force is without any serious blemish, I don’t think it’s relevant. Threats against the president of the United States are a crime. So an officer can express his or her opinion about whoever happens to be president. But if it verges into the territory of incitement, as in “somebody ought to take care of that guy,” well, that’s a crime, and that person is not fit to be a police officer. So there are a bunch of different areas and some are clear and some are grey. Officers may have the same private free speech rights as anyone else. But is the situation different if one is using their position with a law enforcement agency, or the resources of an agency, to broadcast a conspiracy theory, or broadcasting it while on the job?
Yes, very much so. A police officer is a public servant. Their commitment is to neutrality, dealing with all people on an equal basis. So a police officer cannot be communicating a political message on the job. I regard that as pretty serious. On public policy issues, such as legalizing marijuana or gun control, there are a number of police chiefs who are very active as advocates. Chiefs regularly testify before state legislatures and city councils on these public policy issues. As a group, they have a right and responsibility to comment on what is in the best interest in terms of community safety. Obviously, people are going to disagree on, say, guns. But if there’s a public policy issue and they have direct, professional expertise, they should have a First Amendment right there. So I would make an exception there. What if a conspiracy theorist in law enforcement honestly believes that, say, a massive, Democrat-run pedophile ring is a real and major public safety concern? Does that open a free speech window to use a position in law enforcement to speak on the QAnon theory?
I don’t think so. We can draw some lines between those [issues] that have some—and it’s very difficult—legitimacy [as public policy issues], and others that are verging over into issues unrelated to the law enforcement profession. In the whole world of First Amendment law, there are some things that are very clear, and some things that are very difficult and murky. For conspiracy theory-related actions that clearly violate on-the-job, official-capacity neutrality, or other codes of conduct, are there clear standards for discipline?
We have no national standards for policing. We have 18,000 separate local police departments—15,000 city police departments and 3,000 county sheriffs. The only applicable national standard would be Supreme Court decisions. The Miranda decision is a national standard. But 99 percent of police work involves issues where there is no national standard. On some issues, some states have statutes that cover areas of policing. Since Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, there’s been a real rash of laws about police accountability in terms of open records and transparency. But one of the real problems in this country is that we have these 18,000 separate, independent, local law enforcement agencies. And they do most of the work in policing. So for something like the QAnon patch incident, it’s essentially just local discretion, or local law if relevant, that dictates discipline for a flagrant violation of on-the-job neutrality?
Right, that’s the current situation. Should the law enforcement official be disciplined and they appeal [and] that discipline and that appeal goes all the way to the Supreme Court, that decision, one way or the other, would be a definitive national standard. Or, if it just went to the state Supreme Court, it would be a statewide standard, but would have no applicability in any other state. What if an official espouses or shares content related to a conspiracy theory that has nothing to do with legitimate public safety policy concerns, and makes many under their jurisdiction feel uncomfortable, but there is no clear reprimand for their blatant political maneuvering while on the job—like with Joe Arpaio (who had no ""boss"" per se, as an elected cop)? Or what if their constituents feel like a reprimand that comes down is insufficient for the scale of the breach of trust or neutrality involved?
There is some room for challenging some kinds of political actions. What I think happened with Joe Arpaio was, he was so bad in so many ways, and the profiling [of Latinos] issue was so dominant, that a lot of these things went unchallenged, just swamped by so much other stuff. So some of this just comes down to how salient something an official says or does seems in relation to other concerns about a given department at a given time?
Yeah, especially in an extreme situation, which that was. What about situations in which a law enforcement official shares conspiracy theory content on their personal social media channels, while off duty, but that private speech is visible enough that it causes concern among those under their jurisdiction about how they might act on the job, potentially influencing public faith in, or interactions with, law enforcement?That’s a good question, and a difficult one. I hadn’t really thought about this too much. It seems like a concern that might grow more prominent in the coming years, as there is increasingly room online for people in positions of power to technically privately express their views, but still have them become very public expressions that might seem to many to have some relevance to how they could potentially approach official, on-the-job matters.
If it involved derogatory comments about immigration, for example, then it’s touched upon equal protection issues. It would be the same if it was about a particular religious group. Here’s what needs to happen: One of the law enforcement professional associations needs to set up a working group on all of these related issues and come up with recommended national standards. Would any professional group take this on, though? When this issue comes up, it’s usually an isolated case in one jurisdiction, while other sources of misconduct or decreased public trust in law enforcement relate to more apparently systematic and major issues. Isn’t this issue so sporadic that it would be functionally difficult to mobilize professional group action on it?
I don’t see it as being that farfetched an issue. Maybe there needs to be one high-profile case to spark work on it. But I can see it happening. And it is really needed.

101,https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-tears-of-despair-and-defiance?mbid=social_twitter,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By John Cassidy For advocates of greater gun-control measures, the buildup to Tuesday's announcement by President Obama of a series of administrative measures designed to prevent gun violence, including expanded background checks for gun sales, wasn't promising. In a New York Times report that previewed the new policy moves, an official from the National Rifle Association was quoted as saying, ""This is it, really? This is what they have been hyping for how long now?"" On Wall Street, stock prices for gun manufacturers, such as Smith & Wesson, rose, evidently reflecting a belief that the new policies wouldn't hurt sales, and might even boost them. Despite this dismissive attitude from the gun lobby and investors, the event, which took place in the East Room of the White House, turned out to be a memorable one. At turns scornful, hopeful, and angry, Obama delivered an emotional peroration on the issue that has perhaps frustrated him more than any other. Toward the end, recalling the massacre three years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, he cried openly, and was forced to gather himself. Perhaps the speech wasn't the greatest that the President has delivered, but it was among the most direct and heartfelt. At the very least, it should lay to rest portrayals of him as a cold and distant figure, a Mr. Spock in the Oval Office. This was Obama with his humanity, and his despair, all too visible. But it was also a defiant Obama—a President who had decided that in his last months in office he would do what he could, even as he knew that it wouldn’t be enough. Appearing before an audience that included Gabby Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was gravely wounded during a mass shooting in Tucson in 2011, the President was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Recalling his initial meeting with Barden, which took place shortly after the December, 2012, massacre, Obama said quietly, ""That changed me, that day, and my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country."" Obama's hopes, and the hopes of the entire gun-control movement, were to be disappointed, of course. Acknowledging that he’d been defeated in his efforts to overcome the gun lobby after Newtown, the President didn't try to oversell his new proposals, which are modest and sensible measures that Congress should have approved years ago. They include expanding the definition of ""gun dealer,"" so that more people buying guns online, or at a gun show, have to undergo a background check; allowing the background-check system to access information about a prospective buyer’s mental health; providing more resources to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and sponsoring research into ""smart"" guns, which can be tracked and disarmed remotely. As he often does, Obama gave the impression that he was bemused by the opposition to such simple, potentially life-saving measures. He cited evidence from Connecticut and Missouri to support his case that requiring background checks can have an impact on gun deaths. He mentioned polling data showing that the vast majority of Americans support mandatory background checks, as do a majority of Republicans, and even a majority of N.R.A. supporters. Pointing to the Republicans' refusal, in the wake of the attack last month in San Bernardino, California, to approve a law that would have prevented people on the federal no-fly list from buying firearms, he said, simply, ""That's not right. That can't be right."" In the first part of his speech, Obama kept it together. He was playing his usual role as the most reasonable man in the room, twinning an appeal to reason with some basic morality. Quoting Martin Luther King, Jr., he referred to ""the fierce urgency of now, because people are dying."" But when the President turned to the larger theme of why America can't come to terms with the conflicting interests, and conflicting rights that the gun issue presents, the moment and the memories of past shootings started getting to him. ""Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about as well,"" he said, citing the right to worship freely and safely that was ""denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina; and that was denied Jews in Kansas City; and that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill; and Sikhs in Oak Creek. They had rights, too."" ""Our right to peaceful assembly, that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette,"" Obama went on. ""Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara, and from high schoolers in Columbine, and from first graders in Newtown."" At this second mention of Newtown, the President started to tear up, and he had to stop for a few seconds. ""First graders,"" he repeated, trying to steady himself. It didn't work. After resuming his speech for a sentence, he stopped again, this time for longer. He wiped away a tear, this one from below his left eye, and then he pressed his lips with his thumb and forefinger. Finally, he spoke. ""Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,"" he said, gesticulating with his index finger and brushing away another tear, this one from below his right eye. ""And, by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day."" Seeing the President's display of emotion, the crowd applauded, which gave him a bit more time to pull himself together. ""So,"" he went on, the wetness on his face still clearly visible, ""all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand governors and legislators and businesses do their part to make our communities safer."" The denunciation of the N.R.A., which went unnamed in this part of the speech, seemed to rouse the President and get him back on track for the climax of his speech. The best way to defeat the gun lobby, he insisted, was at the polls. ""And, yes, it will be hard and it won't happen overnight,"" he said. ""It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my Presidency. But a lot of things don't happen overnight. A woman's right to vote didn't happen overnight. The liberation of African-Americans didn't happen overnight. L.G.B.T. rights, that was decades' worth of work. So, just because it's hard, that's no excuse not to try."" Obama was only being realistic about the prospects for further progress. He was also serving notice for those who agree with him.

Donnie Romero, the leader of the anti-gay Stedfast Baptist church, stepped down on 2 January, saying he had been “a terrible husband and father”.  The now former pastor made headlines in 2016 following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people died. Romero said God should “finish the job” and kill the survivors of the shooting. Stedfast has been labelled an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The church is part of the New International Federation of Baptists, a group of 29 mostly US-based churches which adhere to a literal interpretation of the Bible. In addition to his comments about the victims of the Orlando shooting, Romero has said gay people are “all pedophiles” and that they should be executed. Romero, who has a wife and seven children, told members of the church that he had “not been ruling my house well”, but did not initially elaborate on why he had resigned. Steven Anderson, the leader of an associated church, said in a YouTube video that Romero had committed “grievous sins”. “The major sin involved was being with prostitutes, and then there were also marijuana and gambling,” Anderson said. After Anderson’s statement Romero elaborated on his behavior in a video of his own. “I went to Jacksonville, and I went to a casino, and I was drinking,” Romero said. “There were girls there that were prostitutes, and I committed adultery on my wife multiple times. “I drank and gambled multiple times. I even smoked weed.” ﻿Stedfast has two churches, one in Fort Worth, Texas, and another in Jacksonville, Florida. Adam Fannin, a member of the Jacksonville congregation, told the Guardian the situation was “a mess” and said Romero’s actions had caused people to quit. “It’s already caused a church split in Jacksonville,” Fannin said. “A majority of people have decided to walk away from the church.” Fannin said he served as Romero’s deputy in Fort Worth for two years. He said did not know whether anyone else from the Jacksonville church had accompanied Romero during his activities. Fannin said he had been “calling for an investigation” into Romero. Prostitution is illegal in Florida. The Jacksonville sheriff’s department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",2019-01-10 16:01:46,Pastor who called Pulse victims 'scum' resigns amid prostitution scandal,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Filed under: The Facebook CEO has promised a series of public debates about the evolution of tech’s role in society. We asked Ringer staffers who they’d most like to see spar with Zuck. Like many people, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes New Year’s resolutions. In years past, those have included such goals as killing his own meat, automating his home, and visiting people in Middle America. For 2019, Zuckerberg has resolved to “host a series of public discussions about the future of technology in society.” In the past few years, Facebook went from being heralded as a crucial social fabric connecting the world to derided as the very thing tearing it apart. The consequences of Facebook’s original “break things and move fast” ethos are unfolding in real time, and now the CEO is trying to find ways to reckon with reality. It’s unlikely that Zuckerberg’s idea will yield much more than good-natured philosophical debate—broadcast on either Facebook or Instagram, naturally. It’s also difficult to imagine that Zuckerberg will invite any of his most fervent detractors. But … what if he did? Here, we let Ringer staffers imagine who we’d want to see invited to Zuckerberg’s forum. —Molly McHugh Victor Luckerson: The Russian propaganda campaign on Facebook was both the spark for the ongoing implosion of the company’s image and a distraction from the core problems with the Facebook platform. Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Information and Library Science and a columnist for The New York Times, has consistently and astutely seen past the political spectacle of the past two years to identify Facebook’s fundamental failings. Ahead of the midterms, as Facebook showed off its “war room” aimed at preventing foreign influence, she noted in an essay that “we’re focusing too much on the foreign part of the problem … and not enough on how our own domestic political polarization feeds into the basic business model of companies like Facebook and YouTube.” Tufekci has the training and the tenacity to see beyond the small-scale debates Silicon Valley would prefer. She began her professional career as a computer programmer before studying sociology, which gives her a broad perspective on the problems that tech companies often try to solve via code. She was warning about the possible corrosive influence of social media on politics long before President Donald Trump’s election made it fashionable to dunk on Facebook. And she’s good at goading the Great Entrepreneurs of Our Time into dumb moments—Elon Musk’s idiotic joke accusing one of the Thai soccer team rescuers of being a pedophile was part of a back-and-forth with Tufekci on Twitter. Zuck vs. Zeynep would not only be entertaining to watch—it would be illuminating for the lawmakers who still can’t see past the digital forest for the trees. Molly McHugh: The former Google employee has staked his reputation on trying to reverse the effects of his industry. Harris founded the Center for Humane Technology and the Time Well Spent initiative to try to encourage developers and designers to rethink how they’re creating technology platforms. Regarding the 2016 election, Harris called Facebook “a living, breathing crime scene.” Harris has been critical of Facebook’s own “time well spent” campaign, which does little more than tell users when they’re “all caught up” on Facebook and Instagram. Of course, Harris is still a technologist he’s an engineer and developer. But his specific critique of Facebook is that it’s an advertising business, not a social network. Facebook is constantly skirting that issue, but Harris wouldn’t let the CEO divert away from the topic. Also, as a developer, Harris has the requisite knowledge to question Zuckerberg specifically about mechanisms that are designed to intentionally “hijack” and exploit people. It’s not often that Zuckerberg is questioned about Facebook functions by someone who could offer exact alternatives. The other benefit of putting Harris in front of Zuckerberg, of course, is that it would give an industry insider who’s critical of his peers the opportunity to take one of them to task, face to face. If Harris—an admired anti-Facebook advocate—rises to the occasion, then perhaps other Silicon Valley exiles will step up to turn on the monsters they’ve created. Alyssa Bereznak: In 2012, Lenny Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa lost their child, Noah, in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since then, they have endured harassment both online and in person, perpetuated by fringe, anti-government conspiracy groups that claim the event was a hoax. In an open letter published in The Guardian this past July, they detailed the ways that Facebook has allowed these groups to continue operating and how the company failed to offer any significant protection for their family. Pozner and De La Rosa’s story is an excellent (and incredibly disturbing) example of how lives can be ruined when a massive online platform takes no responsibility in moderating information, and prioritizes growth over the well-being of the communities it’s meant to serve. Based on the many other examples we’ve seen in this vein, the way in which social media platforms plan to deal with similarly delicate situations should be a major topic when discussing the future of technology. And who better to challenge Zuckerberg on this conversation than the people who have suffered from his platform’s carelessness? Justin Charity: Kate asks me rude, profound questions in public spaces all the time. She keeps me accountable. As the cohost of our very own podcast, Damage Control, she’s as insightful about terminal ethical lapses and subsequent public relations fiascos as she is about technology, culture, and the disastrous intersection of these two phenomena in general. Kate knows her way around the goddamn internet, unlike Mark Zuckerberg, who has largely ruined the internet. If anything, Mark should ask Kate questions. Maybe he’ll learn a thing or two. Mark, come on Damage Control. Kate Knibbs: There are many incisive technology critics and analysts who make very compelling critiques of Facebook and big tech, several of whom have been named by my colleagues. But I don’t think their participation in Zuckerberg’s resolution would do anyone but Zuckerberg any good. This debate series is nothing more than a calculated attempt to launder his public image. His company’s role in society has been heavily and consistently scrutinized for years, and Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to undergo course corrections at the expense of the bottom line. In fact, Facebook’s most recent controversy was connected to its antipathy toward critics; according to The New York Times, Facebook attempted to discredit them by employing a Republican research team to investigate and create inflammatory content about its opposition. Why should critics—who have already written and spoken publicly about their issues with Facebook and big tech’s roles in society—agree to rehash their arguments on Zuckerberg’s terms, when there’s absolutely no indication Facebook will take them seriously? I suppose Zuckerberg’s plan could give the invited participants some decent publicity, but they’d have to accept that publicity in exchange for participating in a cynical spectacle that benefits one of tech’s most damaging monopolies. I’d rather see Zuckerberg abandon his series of talks after no one takes him up on the offer so he can return to his unfulfilled 2018 resolution: fixing Facebook.

104,https://www.dailynews.com/2019/01/11/90-year-old-songwriter-burt-bacharach-talks-about-school-shootings-and-lady-gaga/,"Trending: Songwriters Burt Bacharach and Rudy Pérez had known each other’s music for years but never met nor collaborated until last year when a few writing sessions in Los Angeles led to “Live To See Another Day,” a song inspired by the frequency of gun violence in American schools. Bacharach, 90, is best known for an impressive run of pop classics including “Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,” “I Say A Little Prayer,” “Close To You,” and “One Less Bell To Answer.” The Cuban-born Perez, 60, is one of the most successful and prolific composers and producers in the world of Latin music, and has worked with artists such as Julio Iglesias, Jose Feliciano, Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera. Despite their different musical backgrounds the two award-winning songwriters found common ground in their dismay of the toll of gun violence on schoolchildren, their teachers and families in recent years, Bacharach said by phone from his home in Los Angeles recently. “How it came to be we would write (the new song), we had just averaged a one-year period where you could say there was a shooting every week in a school,” says Bacharach, who with his band will play concerts at the Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa in Rancho Mirage on Saturday, Jan. 12, and Pala Casino Resort & Spa on Feb. 23. “I’m thinking very seriously about trying to do ‘Live To See Another Day’ with my band,” he says of the possibility it will make its live debut at one or both of the casino shows. “Say a little something about why it was written. “We’re not preaching. We’re not going after the NRA. We’re not making it blatantly political in any way. We’re just saying, ‘This is crazy; it’s got to stop.’” Many of Bacharach’s best-known numbers, often co-written with lyricist Hal David, are love songs such as “Wishin’ and Hopin’ ” or “This Guy’s In Love With You.” But occasionally Bacharach and David were inspired by weightier concerns, such as the Vietnam War, which served as the spark for one of their biggest hits, “What The World Needs Now Is Love.” “It’s just got to be good,” Bacharach says of the importance of balancing music and message no matter the topic of a song. “And be melodic. Melodic always helps. You got a message to convey. If you can tailor it to an emotional, warm-feeling melody you’re in a better place than if it’s just a series of words and anger and things like that.” All of the net proceeds from “Live To See Another Day” are going to the Sandy Hook Promise foundation, a non-profit dedicated to the prevention of gun violence that was started after a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. To promote the song, a video was made, and then another, Bacharach says. The first video was shot during a live performance in Miami with two teenage singers, Haven Star and Angelina Green, and the Miami Symphony Orchestra, which also played on the recording. “It’s beautiful and the whole song is there, but is it enough to tell a real story?” Bacharach says he wondered after that version was finished. “Then we had some people out here get involved, and they found an empty school, and moved the voices into that school, and used the props that you see in the video. Empty desks, things laying around. “It made it much more interesting, much more telling, much more relevant.”  Bacharach says he’s proud of the song, the statement it makes and the feelings it elicits. “You can’t predict things like that, how relevant they’re going to be 20, 30 years down the line,” he says. “But I have always had the attitude that what you write should be, unless it’s frivolous, should be important.” Bacharach’s attention to the video made for the new song is nothing new – many of his songs and scores have been composed for films, and in addition to six Grammy Awards he’s won three Academy Awards and two Golden Globes for his score to 1969’s “Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,” that film’s original song, “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head,” and “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do)” from the 1981 movie “Arthur.” Given that this year’s Golden Globes had just taken place we wondered what Bacharach thought of this year’s crop of Globe-nominated and potential Oscar-nominated songs, including “Shallow,” from “A Star Is Born,” which won the Golden Globe for songwriters Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt. “That’s a pretty great song,” Bacharach said. “That’s a damn good song. Some of the (other) songs are very good.” As he’d earlier noted about songs with serious messages, a great movie tune first must simply be a worthy song and then also serve the movie for which it’s written. “A good song usually will have a life somewhere,” Bacharach says. “But you’re writing it specifically for a situation in a movie, so it’s important that it be quite relevant to the situation and why that songs even there.” Saturday, Jan. 12: 8 p.m. at Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa, 32-250 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage.

Ron DeSantis on Friday, following days of speculation. “Sheriff Israel has repeatedly failed and has demonstrated a pattern of poor leadership,” DeSantis said in a statement on Friday, accusing Israel of demonstrating “repeated incompetence and neglect of duty.” “He failed to protect Floridians and visitors during the tragic Fort Lauderdale International Airport shooting in 2017,” DeSantis said. “He failed in his duties to keep our families and children safe during the devastating shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.” The two-term sheriff came under fire for his handling of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed by gunman Nikolas Cruz, who has confessed to the shooting. An investigative report released last week by a public safety commission detailed the failings of law enforcement officers in response to the shooting. In his executive order suspending Israel, DeSantis detailed the failure of the sheriff’s office to follow up on potential warnings about Cruz, as well as its policy for dealing with an active shooter, which said that a deputy “may” confront an active shooter, but could use their discretion. Surveillance video released in March showed Broward County Sheriff’s Office school resource officer Scot Peterson approach a school door as the shooting was happening, never entering the building. He then ran toward another building and took up a “tactical position.” Peterson’s actions were heavily criticized, leading to an internal affairs investigation led by Israel. Peterson later resigned. Shortly after the shooting, Republican lawmakers called on then-governor Rick Scott to suspend Israel for “incompetence” and “neglect of duty.” Write to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com and Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.",2019-01-11 17:39:26,Embattled Florida Sheriff Scott Israel Suspended for Response to Deadly Parkland Shooting,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

Families of the Sandy Hook victims are suing Jones, saying he promoted lies about the school shooting to profit from their pain. By
      
        Claudia Koerner Posted on January 11, 2019, at 9:11 p.m. ET Alex Jones will have to turn over his tax returns, business plans, and marketing data in a lawsuit with families of Sandy Hook victims, who say he pushed conspiracy theories about the school shooting to get rich. Six families of children and teachers killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School sued Jones and associates of his site Infowars last year, accusing him of defamation, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress. The families argue that Jones never believed the mass shooting was a hoax, but he promoted conspiracies online and on his radio show in order to make a profit. Infowars and Jones’ conspiracies are motivated by a desire to convince people to buy supplements, survival gear, and male-enhancement products, not inform or even entertain people, their lawsuit’s complaint said. “Rather, [Jones and his associates] deliberately stoke social anxiety and political discord in their listeners, because distrust in government and cultural tribalism motivate those listeners to buy their products.” With a judge’s order this week, Jones will have to recount how he made his money as well as provide all documents, emails, and other communication about topics including Sandy Hook, mass shootings, and Infowars as a whole. Through the lawsuit’s discovery process, he’ll have to provide his tax returns, business and marketing plans, contracts, and business relationships, as well as data and analytics related to the revenue on online platforms. The victims’ families say that information will prove that Jones didn’t believe in his own hoaxes, and intentionally exploited the families and their tragedy to make millions of dollars. “The Jones defendants and their co-conspirators’ conduct is based on a simple motive: greed. The defendants’ business model is based on their fabrication, propagation, and amplification of conspiracy-minded falsehoods like those about Sandy Hook,” their complaint said. “It is a very lucrative business model.” Attorneys for Jones have dismissed the families’ requests for information as a “fishing expedition,” but this week, a judge agreed it was relevant to the lawsuit. The victims’ families defended their right to Jones’ business materials. “[His attorneys] know just how damaging it will be to reveal that their revenue stream is from product sales, their business plan is to sell products, and their web marketing data confirms that is what they do every day,” a court filing said. In the past, Jones’ attorneys have defended his work as “performance art” and said he was playing a character. As such, his statements and online stories should be protected by free speech, they’ve said. The Sandy Hook families, in their court filing, pointed to what Jones said in an Infowars video in April 2017. “They’ve got articles out today that say I’m fake, all of this other crap. Total bull,” Jones said. “The media is deceiving everywhere. I 110% believe what I stand for.” Claudia Koerner is an editor and reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

112,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/12/parkland-shooting-florida-governor-suspends-sheriff-over-high-school-attack,"Ron DeSantis accuses Scott Israel of leadership failures in shooting that left 17 dead Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.13 BST Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, has suspended the local sheriff criticized for the police response to last year’s mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. DeSantis said Broward County sheriff Scott Israel showed leadership failures in the shooting that left 14 students and three adults dead at the hands of a lone gunman on 14 February 2018.  “The massacre might never have happened had Broward had better leadership in the sheriff’s department,” DeSantis said during a news conference outside the Broward Sheriff’s Office headquarters in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. Israel, a Democrat who has served as the elected sheriff of the agency with 5,800 employees since 2013, accused the newly elected Republican governor of a power grab. He said he was suspended only because his outspoken gun control stance angered the National Rifle Association. He vowed to defend his record in court and before the state Senate, which may hear his case. “There was no wrongdoing on my part,” Israel told reporters after he was removed from office. “This was about politics, not about Parkland.” DeSantis, sworn into office earlier this week, criticized the sheriff during his campaign and had signaled that he would likely remove Israel from office. He was joined on Friday by some parents of slain students at the high school who supported his move. “My daughter would have lived if somebody could have just given her one more second,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was among the mass shooting victims. A state-appointed commission has identified multiple failings in Israel’s agency’s response to the shooting. Some Broward County sheriff’s deputies held back too long as shots were fired at the school in the massacre, instead of rushing toward the gunfire, according to a 439-page report released last week by the commission. Broward County Sheriff’s Office training on active shooters was inadequate, according to the report, which recommended arming teachers and spending more on school security and mental health to prevent similar mass shootings.",2019-01-11 22:13:04,Parkland shooting: Florida governor suspends sheriff over high school attack,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
113,https://splinternews.com/judge-orders-alex-jones-to-turn-over-financial-docs-to-1831702626,"InfoWars founder and blathering conspiracy theory peddler Alex Jones was handed yet another legal setback on Friday. Jones is being sued by several family members of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, CT, for claiming the mass shooting was a hoax. In one of those cases, six families of victims killed at Sandy Hook and the family of a former FBI agent are accusing Jones of profiting from lies he continuously told on his radio and online networks about the killings. A Superior Court judge in CT ruled Friday that Jones must turn over discovery material, including internal financial and marketing documents, to the plaintiffs in the case. According to the Hartford Courant: Among the documents to which Judge Barbara Bellis granted the families access are business and marketing plans for Infowars, contracts between Infowars and organizations such as Facebook and Twitter, and all communications and/or documents, including letters, memos, emails, text messages, instant messenger logs, regarding Sandy Hook, crisis actors, shooter Adam Lanza and mass shootings. In other words, the veil is about to be pulled back once and for all on Jones’ abusive tactics. Next week, the judge will decide whether lawyers representing the families can depose Jones and his associates in the case. “From the beginning, we have alleged that Alex Jones and his financial network trafficked in lies and hate in order to profit from the grief of Sandy Hook families. That is what we intend to prove, and today’s ruling advances our effort,” Christopher Mattei, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement. “We look forward to gaining access to Infowars’ internal marketing and financial documents to show that Jones has built an empire as nothing more than a conspiracy profiteer, as alleged in our complaint.” Attorneys also noted that families of the victims were subjected to “physical confrontations and harassment, death threats and personal attacks on social media” because of Jones and InfoWars’ alleged conspiracies against them, ABC News reported. Jones and his attorney argue that his actions are protected by the First Amendment. The families of additional Sandy Hook victims also are suing Jones in separate cases in Texas. Last August, a Texas judge ruled that those cases could move forward after rejecting Jones’ request to have them dismissed. The CT lawsuit “alleges that Jones knew the claims were false but kept perpetuating them because it was good for his ratings, drew advertisers and made him money,” the Courant reported. In recent months, InfoWars and Jones have been banned from various social media sites, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, among others. However, his horrendous programming has made its way back onto some of those networks through splinter accounts and other users, The Daily Beast reported. In December, former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone settled a defamation lawsuit brought against him by a Chinese businessman. As part of the settlement, Stone was required to admit that he lied about the man, Guo Wengui, on Jones’ show.",2019-01-12 12:17:00,Judge Orders Alex Jones to Turn Over Financial Docs to Families of Sandy Hook Victims ,,4469,http://gizmodo.com

And how does a small town like Barron  recover? Those questions have drawn experts and resources from around the country to the city of fewer than 4,000 people in northwest Wisconsin since Jayme Closs went missing three months ago. For 88 days, the community has worked to remain optimistic that despite long odds Jayme would come home. Students and teachers wore their green ribbons to school, lit up a tree of hope, snuggled with therapy dogs and threw concerts. Her sudden escape Thursday afternoon brought a flood of joy and validation. Despite the harrowing details sure to come, those around her are resolute. More: Jayme Closs abduction suspect was a quiet student who hoped to join Marines More: 'She is doing as well as circumstances allow': Jayme Closs reunited with aunt “I’m told that the kiddo woke up smiling,” said Diane Tremblay, superintendent of Barron Area School District, who met with Jayme’s family Saturday morning. “None of us really said anything but how happy we are,” Tremblay said. “We were all talking about the courage Jayme showed everyone and the impact she’s had on the nation.” Of course, Tremblay knows there will be hard work ahead. She’s changed her mind about the outsiders who’ve visited Barron, who’ve called and emailed with advice. At first, it seemed intrusive. She’d done the training and knew how to handle crises. “I was a little uncomfortable with it,” Tremblay said. “I felt like we really have our ducks in a row with crisis. But once I realized there’s no manual for this type of crisis, I dropped that mama bear thing and said OK, let’s let these people take a look at what’s going on.” One of those people was Michele Gay. She lost her 7-year-old daughter, Josephine, six years ago in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. An organization she co-founded, Safe and Sound Schools, helps districts prepare for and respond to crises. ""One of the things we know all too well is it’s very difficult to think clearly and attend to the important details mid-crisis,"" Gay said. ""It's incredibly helpful to have some clear heads, fresh eyes and trusted relationships."" When Jayme went missing, Safe and Sound Schools tapped its network to assemble a team of six experts from around the country to advise the district. One of the first recommendations was to bring in dogs from the Wausau Police Department to provide therapeutic cuddles for students. ""There's tremendous value in that,"" Tremblay said. ""I wouldn’t have thought of that. It wasn’t in the toolbox."" The members of the team, whose identities are confidential, include three school psychologists and three educators. They've driven to Barron and helped advise from afar with their own experience responding to tragedies. The organization is seeking grant funding to cover travel expenses for the group to continue helping. ""It's a great honor to put some of our pain toward a positive future,"" Gay said. ""We’re here for Jayme, her family and community for the long haul."" More: Missing Wisconsin teen found alive: What we know about the kidnapping suspect, Jayme Closs' escape More: Elizabeth Smart: 'What a miracle!!! Jayme Closs has been found' After the news of Jayme's escape, the team is pivoting. It's too soon to say whether or when Jayme will return to Riverview Middle School. But Tremblay wants to be ready for it — ""if we are lucky enough to have that child in the hallways,"" she said. ""She’s a loyal friend, a sweetheart to have in the classroom, the kid every teacher wants in the front row,"" Tremblay said. Tremblay said staff will move at whatever pace Jayme and her caregivers decide is best. If she does return to school, she would be free to have a flexible schedule with plenty of opportunities for breaks. ""Our job is to be prepared to be responsive to anything she needs,"" Tremblay said. ""And we’re not going to be too proud to reach out for help.” For Jayme, experts say the first step will be finding a new sense of normalcy, routine and security with the help of family. Supporters have set up a fundraising page to help them. ""This is as horrific a trauma as any child could experience,"" said Dimitri Topitzes, who teaches trauma counseling at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Topitzes said it will be important for Jayme to have time with family who can ""shower her with affection, love and safety."" ""It'll take time and lot of effort but there’s no reason for despondency over her future,"" Topitzes said. ""We all have very strong and innate tendencies for resilience."" Adrianne Walschinski, who oversees outpatient mental health services at SaintA, agreed. She said safe relationships are the most vital component of healing from trauma. Their predictability can help her overcome the hypervigilance she may be feeling. SaintA is a Milwaukee-based organization that provides social and behavioral health services. After a traumatic experience, Walschinski said it's common for victims to be on high alert, to have trouble eating and sleeping regularly and to be triggered by certain scents or sounds that remind them of the event. Walschinski said alternative forms of therapy can be especially helpful for some survivors. Activities like petting animals, riding horses or painting pictures in therapeutic settings can help regulate mental well-being. ""Different brush strokes or materials can be regulating to us from a sensory perspective,"" Walschinski said. ""Same thing with petting an animal — we're using a rhythm to pet them and they’re breathing and we’re responding to their calm breathing."" Walschinski said it will be a challenge to find a balance between making sure Jayme has the extra support she needs while also allowing her to feel normal.

""There’s going to come a time where she’ll want to be a typical teen and not be treated differently than other teens."" Tremblay is already thinking about how to prepare students for greeting Jayme in a way that isn't overwhelming. ""We don’t want the kids uncomfortable,"" Tremblay said. ""We’ll have to talk about what to ask, what not to ask. And continue to keep our pulse on the kids.” Tremblay wants to do everything at Jayme's pace. But Tremblay is clearly excited to celebrate, already dreaming up ideas for a community event in Jayme's honor. ""She’s a hero,"" Tremblay said. ""The mission of our district is for kids to reach their dreams and make a positive impact and this kid has made a positive impact on the world already. We've been talking about hope, love and prayers for 88 days. ""What next, Jayme? What else would the kid ever have to conquer more challenging than what she just did? We’re so happy she’s home.” More: Suspect's goal was kidnapping Jayme Closs, not killing her parents, police say More: Jayme Closs kidnapping suspect Jake Patterson accused of killing her parents Follow Rory Linnane on Twitter: @RoryLinnane ",2019-01-13 10:56:24,"After 88 days of horror, how Jayme Closs and her small town of Barron can heal",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Music we know — that’s spanned generations of harmony-loving, guitar-strumming, pop-appreciating fans who know a great rock anthem when they hear one. REO Speedwagon headlined a benefit concert at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Center in what has been the band’s ongoing effort to bring relief to an area of Southern still so wounded from the hell that hit it in November of last year. RELATED STORY: REO Speedwagon taking it on the run to help victims of the Borderline shooting and the Woolsey Fire It was Nov. 7 when a gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks – one of the safest cities in America. When the bullets stopped, 13 were dead. The next day, the Woolsey Fire broke out, scorching thousands of homes and acres on its furious path of destruction from Agoura Hills to Malibu. It ultimately led to the deaths of three people.

Music we know — that’s spanned generations of harmony-loving, guitar-strumming, pop-appreciating fans who know a great rock anthem when they hear one. REO Speedwagon headlined a benefit concert at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Center in what has been the band’s ongoing effort to bring relief to an area of Southern still so wounded from the hell that hit it in November of last year. RELATED STORY: REO Speedwagon taking it on the run to help victims of the Borderline shooting and the Woolsey Fire It was Nov. 7 when a gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks – one of the safest cities in America. When the bullets stopped, 13 were dead. The next day, the Woolsey Fire broke out, scorching thousands of homes and acres on its furious path of destruction from Agoura Hills to Malibu. It ultimately led to the deaths of three people. People still hurting … lives trying to get pieced back together … that was the backdrop to two night when hearts, minds, ears were open to a band that brought hits like “Take It On the Run,” “Roll With the Changes,” “Ridin’ the Storm Out,” “Don’t Let Him Go,” Keep On Loving You” and “Can’t Fight This Feeling.” Cronin is one of three band members who live in the Thousand Oaks area.

120,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/yWTG3lzko5A/woman-arrested-for-threatening-mass-shooting-at-pbso-k9-memorial,"Menu PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. -- A Boca Raton woman was arrested for threatening to conduct a mass shooting at a recent memorial service for slain PBSO K9 officer Cigo. Deputies arrested 66-year-old Jill Hoffman after she posted over 100 comments on the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) Facebook page, many of them aggressive and threatening. On December 24, 2018, the Sheriff's Office announced the passing of K9 Cigo, who was killed in the line of duty while attempting to apprehend a wanted fugitive. Following the posting, an individual assuming the identity of ""Michael R Reed"" on Facebook began making comments that were aggressive in nature and blaming the death of the police canine on members of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Deputies say over 100 comments were made by ""Michael R Reed"" to the Sheriff's Office, most of which were negative, accusatory, and filled with name calling. The following direct threats were made by Hoffman under the Facebook moniker ""Michael R Reed"": Regarding a post where the Sheriff's Office announced active shooter training for civilians, ""I hope all of you are the first to be shot!!"" ""Your post 'thank you for your support during this extremely difficult time' makes me want to spit in all your faces and rip those badges off your chests."" Regarding a post where a Sheriff's Office deputy built a North Pole mailbox for children, ""How about building yourselves coffins and jumping in them. You're doing to need them."" ""I swear if I see one more story about this on the news or elsewhere you'll be seeing MY story splashed across every news outlet in the country. I think you know me well enough to know when I am determined to do something it gets done."" After the Sheriff's Office announced the memorial service location, ""Great venue for a mass shooting. You don't have the sense you were born with."" PBSO investigators were able to determine that the moniker ""Michael R Reed"" was Jill Hoffman. The URL for the ""Michael R Reed"" profile is https://www.facebook.com/jill.hoffman.1466. A PBSO Sergeant made contact with direct family members of Hoffman, who confirmed that she uses that screen name. They said they were aware of threatening comments posted by Hoffman under the Facebook moniker ""Michael R Reed"" and saw them prior to being contacted by law enforcement. Hoffman was located on Saturday and taken into custody. She was charged with making written threats to kill or conduct a mass shooting, which is a felony.

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. Working for CNN used to be like working for any other cable news station or other media outlet. But in 2018, it was one of the targets of a serial mail bomber, who was seemingly trying to hurt people they perceived as critical of President Trump. “There were a lot of people who were genuinely and understandably freaked out by it,” CNN.com Editor in Chief Meredith Artley said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. “[They said] ‘I didn’t know this was what I was getting into. I thought I was getting into journalism because it’s a valued profession. It’s a profession that serves the public good and has gained public trust. I didn’t think I was getting into it to be called the enemy of the people by the president of the United States and that that would result in threats, that my family is calling me, crying, wondering if I’m okay.’” Artley said for her, the experience “underline[d] why it’s so important for us to do our jobs well.” On the new podcast, she told Recode’s Kara Swisher that the CNN Digital property used to rush to cover the president’s every tweet, believing them to be automatically newsworthy, but is now trying to slow down and do less “stenography journalism.” She also suggested that CNN and other media outlets need to do more to undo the perception that they are “enemies of the people,” as Trump has said while in office. “In 2019, we [should] go beyond the marketing campaigns of ‘Facts First’ and ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’ and all of that,” Artley said. “That’s great. That’s really good stuff. We need to go further now. We need to actually do better about showing our work ... Dial up the efforts to be transparent about when we get things wrong or when we change things, why have we done that. I think there’s so much of the journalistic process that audiences don’t understand and we need to lay that bare. I think that will increase the trust.” You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Meredith. Kara Swisher: Hi, I’m Kara Swisher, editor at large of Recode. You may know me as someone who likes CNN a little better just because Donald Trumps hate it, but in my spare time I talk tech and you’re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast Network. Today in the red chair is Meredith Artley, the editor in chief of CNN.com and the senior vice president of CNN Digital Worldwide. That’s a big title, Meredith. Previously, she worked at the New York Times, the International Herald Tribune and the Los Angeles Times. Meredith, welcome to Recode Decode. Meredith Artley: Thanks for having me. I’m sorry, I was late today because I lost my phone of all things, and I feel terrible. I’ve had Meredith waiting. It’s tragic. It’s tragic, it’s a tragic moment for Kara Swisher, I can tell you that because I’m married to my phone, it’s the best relationship I’ve ever had. In any case, I’m here because I’m really interested in what’s going on at CNN and a lot of the different large websites because a lot of ... I want to go sort of into your back ... You wrote me a really fantastic email about where news is going digitally. Obviously, so much news now is digital, period. The whole business is digital. So, I wanted to sort of talk a little bit about your background, how you got to where you got. Then, people don’t know this, CNN is the largest purveyor of news on the planet, is that correct? That’s right. How is that measured? Explain how that’s measured. I’ve seen the charts and different things. Yeah. Well, there’s a lot of ways to measure it. There’s apples and screwdrivers in terms of how you ... Right, I’ve seen your apples. ... how you track. That’s right, we do have our apples. I’ve seen your apples, advertisements, yeah. That’s right, we do have our apples. Yeah, that was a product placement there, I guess, sorry. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, listen, we get 200 million unique users a month just across digital, right? Right. This is not on the TV business. That’s right. That’s not on the TV business and we’re addicted to data and audiences and what do we know. The data is a proxy for the audience, right? Right, right. So, that’s kind of how we operate our day, digitally. And this is digital sites across the world. You’re collecting digital sites across the world or just a single ... How do you look at it? That’s right. So, there’s CNN.com on mobile and desktop, there’s the app. There’s everything we do across social, right? So, that’s just everything and off-platform too. So, YouTube, Amazon, whatever it is. So, we calculate — and things like Apple News, all of that. So, that 200 million unique users a month or sometimes it’s 22, 23 million unique users a day. We calculate this down to the hour. I mean, there are people who are just on the team and addicted to it. That includes everything: CNN.com, CNN International, CNN Business, CNN Politics. Right. Just everything we do under the sun. The stuff that’s on the television, on the cable. That data I’m giving you is just the digital data. Just yours. But this is not the video views that you put also, that you do also on cnn.com. Yeah. Well, the unique users will include the video streams, right? The video streams also. All right, talk a little bit about your background, how you got to this, got to CNN.com. You’ve had a long interesting journey in the digital news space. Yeah. I’ve been at this for a long time. Yeah, yeah, you have. I’ve been at this for a really long time. So, I started at ... My first job was at nytimes.com. That was in ‘96. Right, early. Early. Right. Months after launch. Who was that, Bill Grueskin, who was it? No, he was at the Wall Street Journal. Yeah, that was ... Well, my boss was Bernie Gwertzman. Yeah, that’s right. Who’s incredible. Bernie was the former foreign editor of the paper, he was like the Moscow correspondent during the Cold War and I think they were kind of looking ... He wanted to know what he could do next. He was getting close to retirement age and they’re like, “Go do this web thing.” Right. That was early, early. People don’t realize, ‘96 was super early. It was early. The site actually launched February of ‘95, so I got there after launch. What was that about? Talk about that launch and what you guys were trying to do there. It was incredible. We were first ... Me and a handful of others were hired because we were kids with a journalism degree and knew a little bit about the internet. They wanted someone to come copy and paste the paper onto the internet. Right. Right. So, some of us worked on the web, some of us worked on the AOL whole thing. Right. They shipped us down to learn Rainman and all that crazy stuff, right? Rainman was AOL’s programming language. Exactly. Early days, the technology and the journalism were really heavily intersected. Right. They are now too, but now digital’s so big, right? You can fit the entire New York Times electronic media company staff in 1996 on one page and it was the journalists where were the web producers and editors like I was. It was the sales team and the HR team and all of that. Bernie was amazing, but we were essentially without adult supervision. Right. Where’d you come from? You were just a journalist? Did you just study journalism? I studied journalism at Mizzou. Then, you just decided this was a job you wanted to do. Yeah, I took one of the ... I think it was ... It was one of their first classes on, “There’s the internet and there’s journalism. Maybe the two things could intersect.” We learned about all the internet service providers and Prodigy and ... All of it. So, I was a broadcast major and I really got this idea of, wow, I could actually graduate and go work for the New York Times out of school, instead of working in local market 532. Going to some small, yeah. It seemed like a no-brainer. It was a magnificent career path. Back then it was only the newspapers who were hiring in digital. So, broadcast wasn’t even an option, right? Absolutely not. Right. You were there, there were ... I was covering it. I started covering it ‘92, early AOL and early stuff like that. I remember when the New York Times went on AOL and went on the various services. We were doing some cool stuff then, right? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. There were some really big innovative projects and ways that we were talking with users and the chats and all of that. It was good. Listen, I sound like such an old person now and I am, but I think if anything, looking at the trajectory of my career and what I’ve learned along the way, gives me this perspective and experience that none of this is permanent that we’re going through right now. So, when you have the conversation as you often do about what’s going to happen with Facebook, where are we going to be at in a year or two or three, etc., you just know it’s all going to keep on changing. So, you were at the Times. You were putting stuff up on the web. There was not the New York Times, after it was not the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal was trying things too, if you remember at the time. Early with the paywall. Early with the paywall and selling things. There was no apps or any other way to access it besides the internet site, kinds of things. It was just an amalgamation of what was in the paper, essentially. Exactly. Right. Exactly. But, we were doing ... We started experimenting because we didn’t have that ... Because the paper wasn’t paying attention to us, that’s what I mean by no adult supervision. We were experimenting with breaking news. We were experimenting with ... Martin Nisenholtz was there, right? Totally. Yeah, yeah. Martin was the big boss, right. So, Martin just kind of encouraged that. We were very much a separate entity ... Yes, you were upstairs, I remember. We were across Times Square. Ah! You were across the way, which a lot of them were. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, we were ... That’s back when the paper was at a different location and the site was at a different location and every now and then somebody from the paper would come over to observe what we were doing. It was great! We really got to experiment and play and it’s also where I got to kind of grow up as ... I just grew up there. I was at the New York Times for seven years at digital and then later I went to Paris and worked for the International Herald Tribune, which had that Times connection. But it was one of my favorite things, very early, their people asked me to do the schedule. “Can you please just ...” We were getting more than 10 people on the team and we needed to schedule out, so we had 24 or 27 coverage and that was a big lesson for me because of course I didn’t want to do the schedule. I came here to do journalism and play. Right, right, to do journalism. So, you were putting stuff up on the website. Say, what was the thing ... So, then you move to the International Herald Tribune to do the same thing, because that was a paper you got in Europe when you couldn’t get any other news, you got the International Herald Tribune, which was an amalgamation of the New York Times, the Washington Post, I think LA Times was in there too. Yeah, that’s right. So, that’s why I tell the story about doing the schedule piece because that’s what led to do the work that other people don’t want to do and learn how everything is set up and that’s how I got into the management piece of it. So, by the time it had been seven years and Bernie had left and there was an opportunity, I wanted to run the site. They were like, “No, you can’t yet. We need to bring someone at the paper.” Right. ”We need to bring someone over from the paper because ...” They know journalism. In 2002, it was very clear that the website wasn’t going away, the internet wasn’t going away. It was going to grow in importance. “So, we’re going to bring in someone from the paper.” I was like, “Oh, that’s a ceiling. That’s what this feels like.” Right, right, right. So, that’s when this job opened up at the IHT. I was like, “I can work and live in Paris.” Yeah, you could. Okay, let’s do that, right? So, that was great. That was in some ways kind of a ... It was a smaller team, I wasn’t just doing journalism there, right? I ended up running the technology piece and the sales piece. Just tiny, tiny team, but that was great because I got to see life outside of the American lens and we experimented with Nokia on mobile stuff, and language and translation software. It was super, super fun and super creative. What was the attitude still at the main newspapers? This was the New York Times because that’s one of the owners, the International ... It ended up being the only owner of the International Herald Tribune. What was the attitude of them towards digital still, even during these years? This was after the fall, right? That’s right. So, this is 2002 to 2007 when I was at the IHT and I was there for a hot second when it was co-owned by the Post and the Times, to your point. Then, the Times took it over fully. I feel like it was friendlier there, frankly. I think, once some time had passed and you didn’t have to evangelize about the importance of the internet and newsrooms as much. Two was ... there was something about being outside of the US and some more just experimentation that was happening across parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia, and mobile was early there. Right. So, there were some interesting ways to play with what was happening internationally, and plus the people at the IHT, I just set up a bunch of blogs for, “Let’s have a Formula One blog and let’s talk about foreign affairs.” Everyone was kind of game, it was smaller and it felt like we were kind of in it together. So, that to me was like the first taste of, “I can now see what a modern newsroom might look like where people aren’t — one is digital and one is print. We’re actually kind of doing some kinds of things together and hey, that actually works.” Right. So, you worked there and then moved back to Los Angeles to work for the Times. Then, I got a call from LA saying, “Do you want to run latimes.com as the top editor?” and I said, “Absolutely.” So, that was ... I’d never been in LA before, I’d never worked at the LA Times. I thought this was going to be crazy, we’re going to go in the land of traffic and smog and all of that, but I fell in love with it. I was in LA Times for two years running digital there. What was the challenges there? This was, again, a time where newspapers were still slow to get there, it seemed like. They didn’t until, I would say, five years ago. I think that’s right. I mean, I feel like there’s so many increments and steps along the way. The LA Times was ... It was awesome because that was local. As big as LA is, it was still local. I got to go from just global in general with the IHT to let’s see what it’s like to serve at community and that was just a really fun exercise, to use the internet for that purpose. If there was an earthquake, we would just tweet out, “Did you feel it?” Then, we’d do a story of what people felt and they’d send us photos. Some very rudimentary things, but they were actually interesting ways to tell a story that the paper had never done before. So, yeah. There were three or four rounds of layoffs at the LA Times. There were … Sam Zell came in and out. It was complete chaos, but it was so much fun, I loved it there. Making the stuff. What were the challenges of moving into the digital age? Because all these companies, when Sam Zell came in, the idea was that it was going to be a more digital Los Angeles Times. They were going to serve different communities. There was lots of talk about how digital was going to transform the LA Times, which it never really did. Yeah. Yeah, I don’t know that it’s been transformed, you’re right. To me, the LA Times ... The big lesson there was ... Personally, it was a story of they want me ... They’re going to name me as one of the managing editors of the paper. They’re going to put me in the newsroom. This continued story of you’re starting to get it. You’re starting to get it. They were like, “We need you to run like the morning news meeting for the whole organization. Oh, that means we actually need the newspaper people to come in before 11:00 in the morning.” There were some of these shifts that were so ... The things you wouldn’t see, unless you were just inside the beast, that were really important steps along the way. So, I feel like all of the story for newspapers has been this momentum that’s been slowly, slowly building and have seen it. Then, I think you’re right, four, five years ago was when it was, “Ah. No, the future is digital. It’s right here, you can see it on the spreadsheets. You can see it in the audience, in the revenue. It’s there.” But, that broke open because of the work that was done to get there. That’s how those things work. So then how did you end up at CNN? I got back from maternity leave in LA. I’ve got a 9-year-old son now. There was one voicemail and a little light on my desk phone and it was from the executive recruiter at Time Warner. I was like, “Time Warner? I don’t want to go to a cable company.” Then I was like, “Oh, right, that’s CNN.” Right. That was always ... CNN was a brass ring job. Why was that? I love … Again, going back to the early days, any of the competitive data you saw, CNN was always No.1. I loved their global reach. I love that video was baked into the DNA. I love breaking news was baked into the DNA. I felt as not just a journalist, but a human, that if something happened in the world, that’s where you went. I was like, “God, wouldn’t that be incredible, to run CNN Digital?” To just do everything, all the journalism and distribution and programming that you can possibly think of, it’s always been strong. But I felt like there were more things that could be in. So, talk about what your job is. Explain what CNN.com ... I don’t think people do realize how widespread it is because most people think of Yahoo. I’m trying to think of the news sites that people think are big. NYTimes.com. What would it be? Yahoo News, some version of Yahoo, Yahoo Finance. There’d be Wall Street Journal, there’d be ... What else? I mean, we’re all kind of battling it out. You can look at all these different metrics. Right. We’ve been battling it out, not to sound overly cocky, but it’s not that close. We’ve had moments where it’s been close. In the last year or so, it’s been ... The Times, the Post, it’s great. Washington Post, yeah. I love to see the newspaper sites and brands resurgent on digital, that’s a really good thing. It was BuzzFeed for a while, it’s not BuzzFeed so much anymore. Yeah, it’s just ... There’s a lot of different ways to kind of slice and dice it, about just every metric, we’re No. 1 in everything. Social, millennial reach, video, time spent, it just goes on and on. So, you are in charge of all the ... Not the reporters themselves or the entire ... Everything that comes out of CNN.com. So, I’ve got ... If you were to look at an organizational chart, I’ve got 350-ish people or so on my team proper and those are writers, reporters, editors, producers, who might work in politics or business or out of our London or Hong Kong teams for international. Or work on our social media teams. I have those people, but I think of “my team” because it’s way bigger than that because my job is actually to run the journalism and work with the journalists who fuel CNN digitally worldwide. So, there’s thousands of journalists at CNN. A lot of them these days, continuing that story of integration, there’s so many people that aren’t on my team technically, but they spend 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent of their time working for digital. Right. Making stuff for you. Making stuff for digital, right? So, that’s one of the most fun things. The thing that CNN is known for as a video, as a video company, essentially, that’s how it’s done. How is that running a website that has so well known for television? Yeah. The plus side is video is in our DNA, right? That’s just who we are. So, the whole pivot to video conversation, we can just stand in the same place. This is where we’ve been and it’s really good. You didn’t pivot to video. We did not have to pivot. You just turned around, “Oh, here we are.” Yeah, we’re right here. So, that’s just wonderful, right? There’s different ways to think about video, right? So, there are video journalists who do video just for CNN Digital. There are video journalists who kind of specialize in doing video for social, or YouTube, or whatever it might be. Then there are video editors who pull the right moments from air or who go in and tap into the archives. We’re sitting on, since 1980, a goldmine of archive video, history of the world, right? So there’s all these different ways that we can kind of play with video. In what you’re doing. Yeah. We’re here with Meredith Artley. She’s the editor in chief of CNN.com and the senior vice president of CNN Digital Worldwide. We’re talking a little bit about how she got to where she got, but talk a little bit about the news business now, because a lot of the way people get their news and how people consume it has changed pretty drastically in the past couple of years. Talk a little about where you think it’s going and how you all are thinking about how you deliver it to people, because obviously mobile’s probably the most important part, but perhaps. Maybe it’s Facebook, maybe it’s Twitter, maybe it’s other places. It’s changed so much in terms of how we ... it used to be the super-popular thing to be like, let’s be where audiences are. Almost at every cost. Right. So let’s be out on every single social platform. It was a trend two years ago, right? It was a trend two years ago. Two-and-a-half years ago. Be where they are. That was the mantra. And we had that mantra a little bit too, and it’s a short-sighted mantra, because if you do that and you’re just where the people are and you’re not actually thinking about your owned and operated properties, it doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t grow a business that supports journalism that you exist to do. So that was where it used to be. I think where it’s going now, especially in light of what’s happened with the social platforms, we’re gonna be way more focused. We’ve already been in this space for a while now, but we’re gonna be way more focused on what we can actually control, what we own, our sites, our apps, partnerships and relationships that we have with social platforms and other companies that are on our own terms. CNN’s so huge that we’ve got that leverage. Right. Right. So that’s good, and that’s a benefit that you can’t take for granted. There’s a lot of other smaller sites that are doing great work that don’t have that leverage and don’t have that benefit, and we have it and we’d better use it. So what does that mean? It means pushing people to your website. What is the most important way people get news right now from CNN.com, right? Not from the website, typing it into a browser or is that the way? There’s still a lot of people who do that. Right. That’s one of ... Everyone was saying a while ago that the homepage is dead, or people wouldn’t have homepages. That has just not been our experience. It’s so old school. People go to CNN.com, they type it in. Right. That’s a huge amount of audience. But there’s also, again, to the point about being addicted to what audiences do and the data, we do a lot of, okay, let’s talk about what we’re doing on SEO, or what we’re doing with Google on AMP, or what we’re doing on social that does more than cause someone to hit a thumbs up or a thumbs down. So when you’re thinking about distributing your news, you think about your owned and operated properties then, correct? Yeah. What you want people on them ... Which of those are the most important? Is that it the app? Is it just a mobile enabled website or what do people use more? It’s kind of like your “favorite children” question, because the app has a smaller audience but the audience is super loyal. Most of the app users are really in it. They open it often, they’re signed up for alerts, they’re super engaged. Some of the web audience, web audience is way bigger. That’s our scale. That’s our ubiquity. But some of that audience is like a one and done. It’s a fly-by. So something, Michael Flynn gets indicted, they want to see what CNN has. Exactly. Exactly. So they just, they’re not loyal to you in particular, it’s just whatever pops up first. Some of them might come to CNN.com, which is like a good loyalty sign, but some of them might just see something in a feed pop in on whatever story it is, and be like, “Oh, I’m on CNN.” So how do you manage to that, when you’re thinking about your writers and how to deliver news to them? What goes into the thinking behind how to catch those people? Because other people have news just like yours. Well, the scale is super important, right? So we talk about, I think it’s a common construct these days, but we think about a funnel, right? So that wide funnel with these massive audiences, millions and millions of people a day. That’s good, we’ve got that. You got to start there. And so then what can you do to get people further down the funnel? I mean, No. 1 is you can just do really good essential and engaging journalism and do it well. That’s kind of it. But then there are other tools and techniques. You can make sure that you’re optimized for SEO, that you are thinking about, like, if there’s a story that we see that’s doing really well, that’s a sign that our audiences are interested, maybe we should do more, right? So that might mean developing that story a little bit more. That might mean doing another piece or two, sidebars, whatever techniques to understand what our audiences are looking at and what audiences that we might get might be looking at, and then thinking about the journalism that we need to do to support it. It’s really nice. These days, I feel like the news business is in ... most of us are in a really healthy place when it comes to the art and science. Mixing those two things. Right. Explain that more. What do you mean? It used to be, we’re just gonna do a story because the editor says we’re gonna do a story and that’s the end of it. And sometimes that happens, like I will do it. Zucker orders up a million stories all the time. The big boss of CNN. “I want to see more on ...” Yeah, fine. And a lot of times those are really good ideas, but a lot of times, what we can do now for example is, this is one of my favorite and least favorite things that happened. I will have a really good idea for like, “Let’s go with that headline. Let’s use this.” Right? Right. And the team will be like, “We ran it through some A/B tests, boss, and we found that these two other headlines work better than yours did.” It’s like, “Great! I’m glad we’re A/B testing... Dammit, my headline didn’t work,” but again, these are really, I’m joking, these are really good, healthy examples of how can we make sure that what we’re doing reaches people? It’s a little bit of a battle. There’s so much out there. And so we’ve got this big scale. We don’t want to be seen as this ubiquitous blah. So in that blah, what is working today? Because I mean a lot of people talk about this idea, we’ll get into fake news and things like that, but what works with the user at this moment in time, because that obviously will change. But what is the best way to reach, say, a qualified reader with a strong story? The thing that works, we were actually talking about it in the news meetings this morning. The thing that’s working really well these days is context and analysis, because the world is so, things are so crazy. What happened in the news cycle three days ago, you have no idea. I have no idea. Things are just moving at such a fast clip. So this morning we have this excellent writer, his name is Stephen Collinson. A lot of times, you will see on mobile or our app or mobile web or desktop or wherever, you will see him ranking one of the big stories in the morning usually. And he does analysis for us. And you will see, it used to be a few months ago, his stories would do pretty well. They’d be doing okay. We’ve got our Chartbeat app. Can I get geeky here for a second? Yeah, sure, please do. We have a geeky audience. Anything over 10,000 concurrents for us is considered really good. And Stephen Collinson is getting 20,000 concurrence this morning before 9:00 am on an analysis piece about Trump’s rage-y weekend. Another one. Right. And that’s interesting to me, because what it says to me, especially as a CNN-er, our DNA is breaking news. If the world’s falling apart, this is where you go to let people know what’s going on. This is, we’re now seeing this huge thirst from audiences for context and analysis. So that as just a journalistic technique and marrying the art and the science together, we see that working in really big ways. It’s kind of a basic thing that, no duh, and frankly there were times, even earlier this past year where people didn’t want context and analysis, they just wanted the recent pop. Right, what the recent news is. The recent, I want it, the refreshing constantly kind of thing. Exactly. How do you build a news and culture that’s like that, that when we are in this sort of fast-paced news culture, because it’s changed again in the last two years, for sure in the last year it’s been dramatic, the amount of shifting of the news, and when you have a constant breaking news site, you have that happening. It’s been tough, right? I think we’ve done it. I think there are ways that we’re still kind of figuring it out, to be honest. You know the first, when Trump started tweeting, it was this conversation inside our newsrooms, and I think others as well, do we cover every tweet? We should. It’s the president, we should cover every tweet. It’s the president of the United States. It’s by definition, newsworthy. Then it became like, hold on, wait, slow down. We’re doing stenography journalism right now. Right. Let’s chill out. We’re just writing down everything he says and just saying it back. Precisely. So that’s not what you want to do. You want to just pause for a second. Right. So there are some moments where something is said. It could be Trump, it could be another story. We should say what we know when we know it, and then publish and then layer on the context as we can. As you learn it. But there are some moments where we just need to pause. We’re not ... That’s interesting. I just did an interview with Andrea Mitchell on a podcast I did with her and Chuck Todd and Hallie Jackson, and she had the same thing, is that some, they get, this is at NBC News, that she’s the head of her show and she’s like, “I don’t want to hear his latest. You don’t even tell me his latest tweets, because I don’t want to lead with it, or I don’t want that to be the story.” And what’s really interesting, she said, “Every time I ignore it, he says something that actually is pertinent, because he is president.” There are certain tweets or whatever utterances that are pertinent and there’s others that aren’t, and it’s really hard in this cycle of fast twitch to immediately go to the fast twitch. Yeah, I agree. I would assume you get rewarded for that at CNN.com, fast twitch kind of stuff. Maybe we used to, a little bit. I mean, listen, we like to be early or first on things, that is true. But I think these days we’ve shifted into, that doesn’t mean just repeating everything that Trump or the White House says. It means, let’s just take a breath, take a beat. Is this newsworthy? If so, why? Let’s get that first version ... But how do you then slow down a newsroom? How do you then, when you have a newsroom on this fast-twitchy-instant-publish-publish-publish cycle? You just talk to people and tell them it’s better to be right than it is to be first, which in some cases is about the fear of getting something wrong if we push it out there too early. In other cases, these days it’s the fear of not doing our jobs as well as we can as journalists, if we’re just pushing things out there so early. Right. People want to know CNN’s take on things. If you are a consumer of news, at some point you will be, I want to know what CNN has to say on it. So at some point, while there’s still this mentality of, let’s get it out, let’s get it out, there’s also this recognition in this fast twitch cycle, as you say, that, hold on, everything’s moving really fast. It’s not gonna matter an hour from now, a day from now, a year from now, if we were like No. 1 or No. 2. What’s gonna matter is that we did our jobs well and we got it right. Right. Except if you’re the leader and this is how you grow, is there a pressure from within CNN to do that, to get bigger? Because the more you do, I assume the more people come to your site. Or that’s not true? Listen, growth is good, right? There’s a pressure to continue to grow the audience and do good work that that audience wants, and that grows the business, all of that stuff. But I don’t think the path to that is more caffeinated, constant publishing. I think it’s just smarter, high-quality work that’ll break through. One of the things we’re talking about is you do still have these relationships with social networks. You have big ones. Describe which ones you have now and how you look at them, because everybody was striking these big instant publishing deals or different things with either Google or Facebook. Typically Google or Facebook. That’s pretty much the two ways. And Twitter, I guess. Talk about each of them right now, how you look at them, how do you look at them as entities? The umbrella on that is we look at everything we’re doing there as something that is nice to have and that we do by choice, and that we don’t put our eggs in the basket of any of these networks. They don’t really care about us. It’s not our business model. And they don’t share the values that we have. So just in general, it’s not ... What do you mean by that? What do you mean they don’t share the values? They’re not journalists. And we saw this with Facebook in and out. You could talk about this for a long time and I know you have. This idea of you can’t even get them to say that they’re a media company. So they’re not thinking about what’s appropriate, what’s not appropriate, upholding some basic standards of democracy or other free governing principles elsewhere in the world. It’s just a different mindset. And we’ve seen the problems with that in the news cycle, left and right. And so I think there was so much, since the model for news has been in such a tumultuous state ever since forever. For a long time, I think there was just this hope of like, “Ah, this is it, this is where I can get those audiences. Let me be where they are.” And then what, it becomes is a volatile thing where people were spinning up editorial and business strategies based on something that they didn’t control. Right? Right. And like the old AOL days. Totally like the old AOL days. So what then is left? So you have Facebook. Which still matters. Facebook, Twitter, same thing. They all matter to some degree, but nowhere near as much as like the same ... CNN has a big presence on Twitter, for example, as do your CNN personalities. And your CNN reporters. Yeah, I mean, you know, Twitter. I mean, yes. Yeah, Twitter. It’s Chinatown, Jake. Yes. And @CNNBRK has been the No. 1, it’s like this monster account that’s been around forever, that’s essentially an alerting service of what we know when we know it. And that’s fun and that’s great. And we do some great things, by the way, there’s an incredible social team and other people around CNN that lead the strategy of what we’re doing in these places. And it’s good. We learn a lot. Is it the thing that we’re going to stake our future on? Absolutely not. So yeah, Twitter is important to us. It’s important to us for breaking news. There’s a little bit, there’s some monetization that’s happening there, a little bit with Twitter. Facebook, yes. We have the Facebook Watch thing we do with Anderson and others. That show has been a hit, and that’s been great. And that was a deal. We got money, we are paid money for that. Right. They paid you. I wonder if you’d do it without the money they paid you. Yeah, probably not. I mean, we might, we’ve experimented on Facebook for ages without getting ... Paid. Without getting paid, and I think the experiments are good in that we learned something, we learned something about, maybe it’s vertical video. We learned something about audience engagement on a certain topic on that platform. But yeah, Facebook Watch, that’s Anderson Cooper, that’s our star talent. We’re not gonna just do that for free. No, not at all. So yeah. So Facebook, they’re moderately important, the Facebook Watch show was a highlight. They’d been problematic in so many other ways, just again in the news cycle. We did have a deal with Snapchat. We had our own show on that. That was fine, but then it turned out that there were a lot of things that we weren’t getting in terms of information about our audiences, and I think the revenue deal, I didn’t drive that piece of it, but I think it wasn’t as promising as we thought it was going to be. And so we were like, we’re going to take a pause, we’re out. And then now we’re kind of playing with them in some corners in some ways, but that’s how I think it should go, right? We’re open to partnering with platforms, with companies that want to play. What about VR? Do you think that, you said the Cheddar thing was kind of kooky, with Magic Leap. We’ve done some good. We had some fun VR stuff. It seems like it’s, I mean, what do you think about it? I think it’s such a high bar for someone to do all this stuff. Oh, not yet. It’s games. I think it’s games. I just was playing a bunch of games with my kids, and it’s fine. If you have a 9-year-old, your 9-year-old would like it. Like a pirate game or something like that, but for news? No. Yeah. I just don’t see. Yeah, the equipment still is subpar for what the experience ... Yeah. It sounds promising. Eventually, you’ll go home and put on some glasses at night and watch TV that way. Yeah, sure. There was a project recently about, okay, I’m gonna feel bad that I can’t remember who did it. Maybe the Guardian published it, but like what it’s like to be in a detention cell, right? Solitary stuff like that. Oh yeah, that kind of stuff. That kind of stuff is truly experiential. Yes, yes. But you have to get everybody with one of those devices wearing them. You have to go home and put on glasses. Everyone has to go home and put on the glasses every night. That kind of thing. It’s a high bar. It’s a high bar, which if the glasses are easy enough or if it’s a surround, sort of like in a “Black Mirror” episode where you’re in the room and all the screens are everywhere. Sure. Why not? That’s how you would get your news, and experiential stuff is kind of cool. I’ve seen some really cool stuff done with experiential, but it’s just, it’s still not ... Print works really well, you know what I mean? Yeah, it does. It’s a good technology. Yeah, it’s a good technology. Not print, not stuff you printed out, but text. Text on a screen or whatever seems to work really well. Video works really well. Audio obviously works really well for us. It’s always like there’s nothing new under the sun but I do try to think, “Where is news going? How does news gathering ...” Well, obviously news gathering changes over time, you know, how people bring stories to people and how quickly they do is one thing. The other part is how much, if I was running a huge organization like yours, I wouldn’t even know what to think of where it’s going, how it’s going or where it’s coming from or how people gather news or how you do things. It’s certainly not in the way they’ve done it in the past. When you talk about news gathering that brings to mind thousands of journalists who are, the way that they literally go out and get and capture the news has completely changed. I guess it’s happened to print as well. The infrastructure has gone from these massive pieces of equipment and expensive and only a few people know how to operate them to everyone can do it. You need to be a good journalist and know how to tell the story and who to talk to, but the technology is no longer a barrier, and that’s been a wonderful thing for news. Yeah, but has it changed the way we tell stories, and that’s the thing. When you’re at a big organization like yours, I would think you change more slowly, but maybe not. I think it’s changed… It’s given us a broader menu. It’s not like the TV package is the end-all be-all for video. There’s so many different ways to use images, still and moving, with text, with motion graphics, with whatever it might be to tell a story in a super-compelling way. That’s the fun part about being a journalist these days is there’s so many different ... You can be just an expert in a particular format. You can be like, “I know vertical video. I know this about mobile. I know this about AR/VR,” or whatever it might be. It’s gotten so diverse in terms of the different ways to tell a story. So the challenge is — and this really is the fun piece — okay, we have this story to tell. How many different ways shall we tell this story? What is the best way to tell it? Right? There might be something really quick right now that we can do on a social network or a quick take or put something in a newsletter or a video and that might grow into a beautiful interactive narrative series that we can do that will go across basically everything CNN does, including TV. So there’s a lot of that work and exploration that’s just happening across all of CNN. I want to finish up talking about how you got dropped into the backdrop of anti-news news. You work for an organization that’s been attacked. It’s been ... pipe bombs, everything else. The whole organization, not just CNN.com, but the entire organization. You’ve all been the focus of this idea of attacks on the news and “fake news.” What is that like, working in that environment now? You had Maria Ressa on not that long ago. She’s amazing. She is. She’s at Rappler, in the Philippines, for those didn’t listen. She’s a journalist who is undergoing a great deal of stress from the murderous regime who runs the Philippines. Exactly. And she said it really well, that this is in some ways the toughest time to be a journalist and in some ways it’s the most important and invigorating time to do it. I think that’s true and well said. The thing about the bomb threats was, it’s one thing if you’ve worked in journalism for a while and worked in bureaus or been out in the field. Certainly if you’re a war correspondent or anything like that, certain kinds of journalists get used to living with these threats and they deal with it. Right, and dangers. And dangers and they deal with it in all kinds of ways, right, and that’s tough. It’s another thing if you are relatively new at CNN, like it’s one of your first or second jobs and you’re in the newsroom and there’s a threat. And you have to leave. And you have to leave. So we’ve got a very diverse mix of staff, in every single sense of the word. People processed it differently. There were a lot of people who were genuinely and understandably freaked out by it. “I didn’t know this was what I was getting into. I thought I was getting into journalism because it’s a valued profession. It’s a profession that serves the public good and has gained public trust. I didn’t think I was getting into it to be called the enemy of the people by the president of the United States and that that would result in threats, that my family is calling me crying wondering if I’m okay.” So yeah, those things were tough this year. I think at the end of it it kind of underlines why it’s so important for us to do our jobs well. Where do you imagine the news business going with the attacks that go on continuously across the globe? Obviously, Maria and others were on the cover of Time magazine, which was kind of nice to see. How do you think about the news business amid that threat, when it’s continuing ... Do you see it continuing or do you think people will be like, “That’s enough. We value the press. This is just a political attack meant to disable us, essentially.” I think we’re in a moment in time. I think it’s going to abate. I think we’ll be ... I don’t know how long this is going to last. I don’t think it’s going to be over in two to three months. I think we’re going to have to live with this for a little while, but I think it’s just a moment. Again, looking through all the cycles of history after having experience and some knowledge of how these things can go, you get old enough and you can think about those things. I think we are definitely in a moment and it will pass, but it’s a hard moment. I’m doing this work. I’ve been working on this report that’s going to come out at the start of the year. The Knight Foundation and the Aspen Institute have this group of people. We’re working on trust and media and democracy and exploring that topic. There’s been a lot of studies done and conversations we’ve had with smart people around the nation and the world about what’s happening at this moment. One of the things that I think is the leading theory — and it’s been said before — is this idea that there is this complete lack of trust in institutions and those institutions include the news media, media writ large, governments, businesses, that this whole infrastructure of these institutions that many of us growing up kind of had faith in these institutions and would rely on them or maybe would aspire to work for them. Now so many of them have failed people. That’s resulted in this dark moment that we’re in, to some degree, where there’s been this decaying of trust on a large scale. And that’s when you get these people who are like, “None of this has worked for me and I don’t care if the system burns down.” I think one of the things we will see in 2019, in thinking about, you asked where this was going, I know one of the things that is really important for me, for CNN Digital, and I think that everybody else at CNN would agree with me on this, is that in 2019, we go beyond the marketing campaigns of “Facts first” and “Democracy dies in darkness” and all of that. That’s great. That’s really good stuff. We need to go further now. We need to actually do better about showing our work. That’s interesting. Showing who we are as journalists. Dial up the efforts to be transparent about when we get things wrong or when we change things, why have we done that. I think there’s so much of the journalistic process that audiences don’t understand and we need to lay that bare. I think that will increase the trust. Showing how we do it. Showing how we do it. I mean, you’re good at this. You kind of are like showing your process on the podcast all the time. Yeah. But you don’t always see that. Right. You don’t always see how they do it. If you had to predict where news will be gotten from five years from now, where would you think? Where news’ll be gotten from? Where people will consume their news on. Still the mobile device? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I think it just has to get more and more convenient. We see now, you can see it in every ... whether it’s network television or cable television, the numbers of people sitting down to watch TV in that traditional model is declining. Then it kind of raises the existential question about what do we mean by when we mean TV? What do we mean when we are talking about video? How can we make it as easy as possible to get news that’s relevant to people wherever they are and whatever device they’re on, in a way that supports ... Right, the business. The business. That’s the key thing. That’s the pivot from, “Let’s just go on all these social platforms and see how it happens, see how it works.” Do you see a new one emerging? Not yet but I think there will be, don’t you? I don’t know. I keep, I’m asking everybody. I’m not asking this out in the middle of the dark, because I literally don’t know what’s next. It seems like Facebook and the others are declining in some way. Do you know what I mean? It’s just not the way ... It’s exhausting. I just don’t know how people are going to ... Maybe you’re right. It goes back to, they’ll come to the individual sites that are the strongest and they will go back to their old practices. I don’t know. I think the brands matter so much. Yeah. Innovation needs to continue. Oh, by the way, did you hear who got off Facebook today? No. Walt Mossberg. Really? What did he do? Oh, no. He said he’s not on Facebook anymore. Oh, no. Thank you for that news. I lost my phone, so I did not find this out. But I myself am not on Facebook so I don’t ... I mean, I’ve used Facebook, of course, but I don’t use it. I’m not off of Facebook. Oh because he’s mad, is he mad at them? Yeah, he made some kind of, it was a good statement about how he doesn’t feel like it’s an appropriate place to be. Oh, wow. Good for Walt. There you go. There you go.  Well, what are you going to do now? CNN’s going to stay on Facebook for now. CNN will stay on Facebook. For me, personally, I’m not, it’s just ... the second I’m out there dealing with that, I’m not dealing with the work that we need to do at CNN. That’s true. My last question is news cycle speed. How do you deal with it? You must be on high alert all the time. Nothing is not news, right? It helps ... Nothing is not news and the internet is infinite. Yes, exactly. As sometimes people like to think. It helps to have a global team of journalists. We all have each other’s backs. There are moments where someone might be like kind of last minute, like, “I need to step out of this one. I’m good. I need to step away from this mass shooting coverage for a little while. Okay, you guys got it?” That’s what I’m saying, one thing after the next, after the next, after the next. Yeah. We thought the midterms, we were so focused on doing a good job covering the midterms and all the complexities of doing that just because of the story of the midterms and then add on the complexity of all of CNN’s digital platforms and all these journalists around the world, and we did it. It went really well. And we were like, “Yay, we can take a break.” And then Pittsburgh, the synagogue, and then the California wildfires. Yes. That was one of those this weekend. There were six at a time. Yeah, yeah. I don’t know why things have sped up so much. It is not all politics, but they really have. Sometimes, it’s really exhilarating and sometimes you’re like, “I need a break.” For me it means right now, my outside interests are pretty limited. I’ll get there one day. I’ll have some rich creative life. Moment of quietude. One day. I kind of prioritize quiet time and going to bed early and getting some sleep and if people need me because something big happens, I’m there. We kind of trade off with each other, me and the rest of the leadership team. It’s good. We have each other’s backs. I can’t imagine the news cycle at CNN, because you’ve got to cover everything. Yeah. I can ignore most of the things. There’s a lot. I just have Facebook all the time to whack at. Anyway, Meredith, thank you so much.  We’ve been here with Meredith Artley. Thank you for coming on the show. She is the editor in chief of CNN.com and the senior vice president of CNN Digital Worldwide. Thank you for coming on the show. Thanks for having me.

122,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/01/14/janeane-garofalo-asks-for-compassion-for-disgraced-comedian-louis-c-k/,"Trending: Louis CK announces shows at San Jose Improv on Jan. 16 and 17. Details here.  Give Janeane Garofalo credit for being consistent. After saying that it was fair to question the accusers in sexual abuse cases, Garofalo then stuck out her neck for longtime friend and disgraced comedian Louis C.K., as reported by Vulture. “Leave Louis C.K. alone,” she said during an interview for Bust Magazine’s “Poptarts” pop culture podcast. “Enough with that.” In November 2017, the New York Times published an article in which several women accused C.K. of sexual misconduct. A day later, the comedian admitted to having exposed himself to the women and masturbating in front of them. The subject of C.K., whom Garofalo said has been her friend for more nearly 35 years, set off a tense exchange with podcast hosts Emily Rems and Callie Watts. At the very least, Garofalo argued, C.K.’s critics should consider his family’s feelings. “He’s been my friend — and I stand by that — he’s been my friend since 1985, and I think he has suffered,” she said. “And when he performs at the Comedy Cellar and people get all irate, if nothing else, care about his daughters. If nothing else — if you can find no compassion for him, which I think you should — think about how his daughters, who hear all of this stuff, feel. Why don’t you leave him alone for them if you’re so women-empowering?” Garofalo added that C.K. has “paid heavily, heavily, and his family has paid heavily.” She tried to change the course of the interview, but the hosts pressed on with questions about C.K. When they said that he “chose to be a public person, and then he chose to take advantage of that,” Garofalo didn’t back down. “Also, I don’t think you know the full story … and nobody talks onstage in their stand-up more than him (about) everything he’s ever done throughout that whole time,” she responded. “I don’t want to get caught up in this, because clearly you take a strong position on this, and it doesn’t win me any friends. This is like talking about Israel. But I do believe when you’re a friend with someone, and if you think that they have suffered — I don’t believe in kicking a person when they’re down.” C.K. laid low for a few months following the Times article, but he began his return to the stand-up stage in August 2018. Some comedians criticized him for making too early a comeback. Last month, C.K. drew more ire after leaked audio of a set showed him mocking the survivors of the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla. high school mass shooting, which left 17 people dead. “You’re not interesting,” he said, “because you went to a high school where kids were shot.” He then asked, “Why does that mean I have to listen to you?” Garofalo knew that her defense would be controversial, telling the hosts that “there’ll be nothing but vitriol coming at me about this.” Earlier in the podcast, Garofalo, who is scheduled to appear at SF Sketchfest 2019, gave her opinion on the #MeToo movement.

Details here.  Give Janeane Garofalo credit for being consistent. After saying that it was fair to question the accusers in sexual abuse cases, Garofalo then stuck out her neck for longtime friend and disgraced comedian Louis C.K., as reported by Vulture. “Leave Louis C.K. alone,” she said during an interview for Bust Magazine’s “Poptarts” pop culture podcast. “Enough with that.” In November 2017, the New York Times published an article in which several women accused C.K. of sexual misconduct. A day later, the comedian admitted to having exposed himself to the women and masturbating in front of them.

January 14, 2019 The firearms banned under Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s bill are not military-grade at all, even if they mimic military appearances.

@AmySwearer Amy Swearer is a legal fellow in the Edwin Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation. Peyton Smith Peyton Smith is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. Democrats promised that if they retook control of the House, gun control would be a top priority. They have wasted little time in seeking to restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced the latest version of the so-called assault weapons ban with 26 other Democrats as co-sponsors. The bill would prohibit the future sale, transfer, manufacture, and importation of “military-style assault weapons” and “high-capacity” magazines—in other words, it would keep law-abiding Americans from buying many of the most popular firearms used for hunting, shooting sports, and self-defense. The bill appears to be similar to ineffective legislation passed in 1994, in California and in Canada. If passed, it would have the same ineffective results. The bill’s text is not yet available to the public, but the senators’ press release indicates that the bill would prohibit, among other things, the purchase or transfer of: Furthermore, Feinstein’s bill would require universal background checks for the future purchase or transfer of the firearms covered by the bill. That’s a bit baffling, given that their future purchase or transfer would be prohibited entirely. And while the tens of millions of Americans who already own these firearms would have them “grandfathered in,” the bill would require the guns to be kept with a trigger lock or in some form of “secure storage” when not in use. Finally, the bill apparently would exempt 2,200 guns for “hunting, household defense, or recreational purposes.” It is unclear which types of guns would be exempted or why, but given the bill’s purpose and the rhetoric surrounding certain firearms, it’s unlikely that the exemptions would include the most popular “assault weapons,” such as the AR-15 or full-size Glock handguns. Fallacies of the Ban If the press release is any indication, Feinstein’s bill is premised largely on anti-gun rhetoric and isn’t based on facts. It uses purposefully misleading terminology and focuses on the firearms least likely to be involved in firearm-related deaths. Most importantly, it uses a framework that has already failed to save lives in the United States. 1.) Misleading terminology:  The title of the bill itself uses language that has no technical value, but is intended solely as a scare tactic. There’s no such thing as an “assault weapon,” and the use of the term is intended to associate these commonly used semi-automatic firearms with “assault rifles,” which have long been heavily regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and are not commonly owned by civilians. Actual assault rifles are military-grade, fully automatic firearms. In fact, the term “assault rifle” is a military term, and is defined by the U.S. military to mean a compact weapon capable of selective fire and utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge. In other words, an “assault rifle” can fire in fully automatic, burst, and semi-automatic modes, and uses a bullet caliber higher than that of a typical handgun. But the firearms banned under Feinstein’s bill are not military-grade at all, even if they mimic military appearances. While the popular AR-15 may fire an intermediate-power cartridge, it is a civilian gun that cannot fire in burst or fully automatic modes. Further, many “AR-15-style” rifles prohibited by the bill can be purchased in lower calibers that are no more lethal than a handgun—a fact the bill does not take into account when defining “assault weapon.” Instead of focusing on lethality, the bill focuses on cosmetic features. Ironically, this means that law-abiding civilians will be stripped of the very features that enable them to fire safely and more accurately. A pistol grip, for example, helps inexperienced or smaller shooters maintain a more stable base—something of vital importance when making a life-or-death shot. 2.) It doesn’t address real problems: The fact of the matter is that banning future sales of “scary-looking” guns won’t save lives. Simply put, semi-automatic rifles and factory-standard magazines holding more than 10 rounds are not the problem. Consider the following: 3.) It doesn’t work in states that already have it: If those numbers aren’t enough, similar “assault weapon” bans have failed to prevent mass public shootings in places where they already exist. California has long prohibited the purchase and possession of these firearms, and yet experiences a higher ratio of mass public shootings relative to its population than do other, less gun-restrictive states. Finally, the United States already tried Feinstein’s solution with the 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004 and on which her current bill is based. The official assessment of the ban was less than glowing, noting that the relative rarity of deaths involving these types of firearms made it impossible to attribute lower firearm-related crime rates or homicide rates to the ban. How to Actually Save Lives Gun violence is a serious problem, and just because Feinstein’s bill doesn’t offer an effective solution doesn’t mean solutions don’t exist. So, what can policymakers do without broadly infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens? The worst part of Feinstein’s bill isn’t that it picks an unnecessary fight with law-abiding gun owners or demonizes the firearms least likely to be involved in crime. It’s that this unnecessary fight turns the public focus away from actual solutions to very real problems. In the meantime, lives will continue to be lost.

Jamie Foxx makes urgent appeal to politicians to stop ‘our side versus your side’ mentality on gun violence and and urges them to come together in the face of tragedy. MALIBU – Actor Jamie Foxx is urging politicians to table vitriol toward opposing political parties when it comes to gun violence and to come together in the face of tragedy as was seen in the deadly wildfires in California in late 2018. “You wish that everyone would have cooler heads and just erase the lines in the sand when it comes to politics, and just really get into a room and try to figure out how can we live in our society, protect our rights and protect ourselves and not be so overly ambitious or overly, ‘It’s about our side versus your side,’ Foxx told reporters Sunday at the California Strong Celebrity Softball game at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. The “Beat Shazam” host addressed the topic of gun violence and last year’s Borderline Bar & Grill shooting in nearby Thousand Oaks before taking the field. He urged policymakers to “adjust” to the times. CALIFORNIA BAR SHOOTING LEAVES 12 DEAD, INCLUDING SHERIFF'S SERGEANT, POLICE SAY “It doesn’t have to be an argument. It doesn’t even have to get as high as the way I’m speaking right now, but that really troubles you. To live in the fourth safest city in the world and to watch things like that happen — and anywhere it happens,” he said. “This is the one time I can say in our history that nobody on either side of the political whatever, has taken a step towards saying, ‘Hey, we’re smart enough — how do we prevent these things from happening?’” Foxx, 51, speaking on the catastrophic mass shooting where a former marine armed with a Glock 21 .45-caliber handgun with an illegal extended magazine opened fire on a packed country music bar, killing 12 people, including a veteran sheriff’s sergeant – expanded on his sentiment telling reporters that just talking about these tragedies during the course of the media cycle isn’t enough. KATIE HOLMES, JAMIE FOXX'S ALLEGED SECRET ROMANCE EXPLAINED “People will say, why don’t you talk about Chicago or why don’t you talk about these other places — wherever it is. If we can do something and make one step towards it – if you think about our life in America, which is the greatest place in the world to live – anytime that something tragic happens, what do we do? We adjust. We adjust,” said Foxx, who added that he hopes the California Strong event ""will be not only a day to have fun and raise money for the fires and raise money for those victimized in Thousand Oaks but also another blip on the media cycle to say, ‘Hey, don’t forget about the suffered.” Foxx was one of the many celebrities who showed up over the weekend to play in an inaugural softball game hosted by California Strong — a non-profit response effort to the recent California tragedies — created by California natives LA Rams’ QB Jared Goff, MLB players Christian Yelich, Ryan Braun and Mike Moustakas, in partnership with the Southeast Ventura County YMCA. Jamie Foxx attends a charity softball game to benefit ""California Strong"" at Pepperdine University on January 13, 2019 in Malibu, California.
      (Rich Polk/Getty Images for California Strong) KATIE HOLMES, JAMIE FOXX ENJOY DINNER DATE IN NEW ORLEANS AFTER ENGAGEMENT RING RUMORS The father of two girls struggled to hold back emotions when asked about the effect the Thousand Oaks shooting and the California wildfires had on himself and his family. “You can look at #BostonStrong and all of the different places where something tragic has happened, and you just want to be strong,” he lamented. “It just means that I think of people in America and all over the world. I think the will of good people is always strong. We always want to do good. And, it’s sad that a lot of times it takes tragedy to bring us together, but I think if we can hold on to some of this a little more to where it just doesn’t become #CaliforniaStrong, or that’s #BostonStrong because then we become numb to it. Foxx continued: “California is a resilient place as is every other place that goes through tragedy.  And like I said, my whole thing is always keeping the thoughts on the things that are going bad so that we can try to adjust.” “You see my kid's over there, 10-years-old. What do I tell my daughter [about] how we’re living? What do I tell my oldest daughter [about] how we’re living? I mean, what are we supposed to say? We used to grow up and look at either our government officials or our preachers and feel like, ‘OK, I know they’ve got it.’ What do we say now? So, it’s up to us not to keep looking towards them, but to do everything that we can — raise the money, stay #CaliforniaStrong, stay #BostonStrong, stay #AmericaStrong, stay #TheWorldStrong.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX News Network, LLC.

Filed under: How tech workers are coming together to fight forced arbitration The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here. Last week we wrote about a pair of new lawsuits against Google’s parent company, Alphabet, alleging that the board acted improperly in which it agreed to pay out tens of millions of dollars to executives who had been found to have committed sexual misconduct. The plaintiffs are seeking a variety of internal reforms at Google, starting with an end to the forced arbitration agreements that limit employees’ legal rights when they are the subject of workplace discrimination. The plaintiffs — who represent shareholders — have a natural ally in Alphabet employees. And those employees will pick up the baton today when the mount a new public awareness campaign, along with a daylong protest on social media. Nitasha Tiku has the details in Wired: From 9am to 6pm eastern time on Tuesday, the group will post information about arbitration on a dedicated Twitteraccount, while a companion Instagram account will post testimonials from both experts and survivors of sexual harassment and assault. The purpose of the social media blitz is to bring awareness to the fine print in arbitration clauses, mobilize workers to call on Congress to act, and encourage employees at other companies to demand changes. “This isn’t just a Google issue. If they all have these arbitration agreements, then there is really is no way for employees to negotiate,” says Vicki Tardif, a staff linguist on Google’s search team, who organized and spoke at the Google walkout in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mandatory arbitration agreements, often signed as part of an employment contract, have come under fire during the #MeToo movement for silencing survivors, while shielding serial predators, because the agreements force employees to take their claims to a private arbiter, rather than public court. In part, the move comes out of Googler frustration that the company has not ended arbitration agreements as it promised to after November’s Google walkout, organizers wrote in a Medium post today: The change yielded a win in the headlines, but provided no meaningful gains for worker equity … nor any actual change in employee contracts or future offer letters. (As of this publication, we have confirmed Google is still sending out offer letters with the old arbitration policy.) So in December 2018, we launched an industry-wide effort focused on ending forced arbitration. This practice affects at least 60 million workers in the US alone. Ending forced arbitration is the gateway change needed to transparently address inequity in the workplace. Tiku says the anti-arbitration campaign represents a watershed moment for tech’s budding labor movement, because it involves multiple companies. Googlers crowdsourced employment contracts from Facebook, Uber, and other companies, she reports, as well as contractors. They found that none of the companies surveyed made arbitration optional, allowed employees to bring class-action suits, or permitted them to discuss their cases. So much of the past two years has been about reckoning with the power that the biggest tech platforms have over their users. The Googlers’ work here offers a reminder of how much power tech workers — by virtue of the high demand for their skills — have over their companies. And if the movement to end arbitration proves successful, that power could ripple across whole industries. German antitrust watchdog to act against Facebook: report Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday that Germany’s Federal Cartel Office plans to order Facebook to stop gathering certain kinds of user data: The German watchdog objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps — including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services as well as games and websites — and its tracking of people who are not members. The paper said it is still not clear how strictly Facebook will have to comply with the German order, noting that the watchdog looks likely to set a deadline for compliance rather than insisting on immediate action. Congressional staff investigating Facebook are getting really annoyed by the company’s answers Some Congressional staff members are complaining — anonymously — about Facebook’s answers to their questions about data privacy, Ali Breland reports: “They’re very good at running out the clock on you. They get on the line, they do their intro, they talk for 15 minutes without stopping. Then you ask your question, then they spend 10 minutes answering, and before you know it, the call is over,” one aide told Mother Jones. Four congressional sources Mother Jones spoke with, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, said Facebook often provided unsatisfying or incomplete answers when pressed by lawmakers and their staff. When Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) asked what the company was doing with users’ private messages, according to an aide on the call, Facebook responded that it doesn’t do anything users don’t allow. PH company banned by Facebook spread lies, used fake accounts On Friday Facebook banned a digital marketing group in the Philippines named Twinmark Media Enterprises, which operated 220 pages with a combined following of 43 million people. Rappler reports that it had ties to the government and frequently spread pro-Duterte propaganda: In December of 2017, Rappler ran a series of stories on Trending News Portal (TNP), a website that brands itself as a”digital news outfit”, specializing in viral stories. Apart from viral content, bulk of its stories in 2016 are on President Duterte, among them questionable stories against his critics. Then Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Margaux “Mocha” Uson posted more than 500 posts linking to the site (trendingnewsportal.net.ph or tnp.ph) which has since changed URLs. This is despite the fact that early versions of the site had a disclaimer that said they can’t vouch for the accuracy of their reports. Full Fact to start checking Facebook content as third-party factchecking initiative reaches the UK - Full Fact Facebook’s fact-checking initiative has come to the United Kingdom. GoFundMe Is Refunding All $20 Million In Donations To Build Trump’s Wall After The Plans Changed An Iraq War veteran known for pushing fake news leveled himself all the way up with a viral, bait-and-switch crowdfunding campaign in which he first said that the $20 million he raised would go to the government — and then later said that it would go to “a private nonprofit he said he had established in order to construct a wall himself.” Here’s David Mack and Brianna Sacks: Kolfage has repeatedly said he would not take any money from the wall donations. He has started another GoFundMe campaign with a $100,000 goal that he says will be used to help him “Fight 4 Free Speech” and take action against Facebook, which deleted several of his pages in October during a major purge of inauthentic accounts. Shortly after he established the wall fundraiser last month, Kolfage updated the webpage to include a separate website that included a Colorado P.O. box, where he said donors could mail personal checks to support the cause. Searching for news on RBG? YouTube offered conspiracy theories about the Supreme Court justice instead. When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was sick, hoaxsters gamed YouTube search to spread conspiracy theories, Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report: More than half of the top 20 search results for her initials, “RBG,” on Wednesday pointed to false far-right videos, some claiming doctors are using mysterious illegal drugs to keep her alive, according to a review by The Washington Post. Ginsburg has been absent from oral arguments at the Supreme Court this week as she recuperates from recent surgery to remove cancer from her lungs. Tests revealed Friday that she will need no further treatment and that her recovery is on track. The falsehoods, most of which originated with the fringe movement QAnon, dramatically outnumbered results from credible news sources. Only one of the top results came from a mainstream news site, CNN, and it was an 11-month-old interview about her career. The algorithm rewarded the conspiracy videos over reliable news based on what it calculated was their “relevance,” signaling that the videos were probably new, popular or suitable to the search. Research finds heavy Facebook users make impaired decisions like drug addicts Taylor Hatmaker writes about a new study that attempted to find a correlation between use of Facebook and performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, which assesses decision-making skills. The study has some big flaws — a small sample using self-reported data about Facebook use, to name two — but it suggests further research could be warranted: Study participants who self-reported as excessive Facebook users actually performed worse than their peers on the IGT, frequenting the two “bad” decks that offer immediate gains but ultimate result in losses. That difference in behavior was statistically significant in the latter portion of the IGT, when a participant has had ample time to observe the deck’s patterns and knows which decks present the greatest risk. The IGT has been used to study everything from patients with frontal lobe brain injuries to heroin addicts, but using it as a measure to examine social media addicts is novel. Along with deeper, structural research, it’s clear that researchers can apply to social media users much of the existing methodological framework for learning about substance addiction. A Seattle TV station aired doctored footage of Trump’s Oval Office speech. The employee has been fired. Here’s a legitimate and deeply unfortunate case of fake news from a local TV news station. Every single implication of this story is bad: The city’s Fox affiliate, Q13, beamed out doctored footage of Trump’s Tuesday address, according to the Seattle Times. The station’s broadcast showed Trump with a larger-than-normal head. His skin had a Cheetos-orange tint. And during his speech, the president’s tongue hung out of his mouth between sentences. It is unclear whether the footage ran live as Trump was giving his speech, or was replayed in later broadcasts. The Art of Being an Instagram Husband Taylor Lorenz chronicles the evolution of the “Instagram husband,” which is a millennial term meaning “photographer.” Though people have almost always relied on other people to take photos of themselves, Instagram and influencer culture has transformed that duty into a near-full-time job. In 2015, a fake PSA produced by Jeff Houghton solidified the term and went massively viral. With nearly 7 million views, the video profiles the men “behind every cute girl on Instagram.” They bemoan having to delete all the apps on their phone to make room for more photos and transforming into “a human selfie stick.” In the three years since that video was shot, however, the term has evolved. The joke of the Instagram-husband video was that these men are miserable. You’re meant to sympathize with the men, who are presented as begrudging participants, and laugh or scoff at the women for forcing them to do something as “trivial” as taking endless photos. But Instagram and the digital landscape it created have shifted massively since the video was released. Those women people laughed at for taking endless photos in front of a brick wall are now influencers—people who leverage a social-media following to influence others and make money—and are worth millions. And while men used to be seen as begrudging participants, more so-called Instagram husbands are embracing the term and becoming an integral part of their partner’s business. Your Old Tweets Give Away More Location Data Than You Think Issie Lapowsky has me rethinking my decision to geotag all my tweets: AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP of researchers has developed an algorithmic tool that uses Twitter to automatically predict exactly where you live in a matter of minutes, with more than 90 percent accuracy. It can also predict where you work, where you pray, and other information you might rather keep private, like, say, whether you’ve frequented a certain strip club or gone to rehab. The tool, called LPAuditor (short for Location Privacy Auditor), exploits what the researchers call an “invasive policy” Twitter deployed after it introduced the ability to tag tweets with a location in 2009. For years, users who chose to geotag tweets with any location, even something as geographically broad as “New York City,” also automatically gave their precise GPS coordinates. Users wouldn’t see the coordinates displayed on Twitter. Nor would their followers. But the GPS information would still be included in the tweet’s metadata and accessible through Twitter’s API. WeChat’s Star Founder Seeks Second Act for China’s Super-App Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only social media magnate navigating treacherous waters. In some ways, the challenges of running WeChat are completely different. But even for an app that has been more or less endorsed as the official social network of China by an authoritarian regime, Zhang, too, has to manage competition. A revealing story from Lulu Yilun Chen: While WeChat has been the star of China’s internet for years, newcomers like Bytedance Ltd. are now making things harder. The owner of Toutiao, Douyin and Tik Tok has become the world’s most valuable startup. “The much-reported cannibalisation of screen time from Bytedance’s apps are obviously hurting WeChat, and with little wonder,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based research and marketing company China Skinny. “WeChat needs to stay relevant for those hundreds of millions of users who just want something simple to use, that looks good and is entertaining and are used to newer, shinier things being launched.” Aaron Sorkin Says “There Should Be a Sequel” to ‘The Social Network’ Aaron Sorkin won an Oscar for pretending that Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook to meet girls. (In fact, Zuckerberg was already dating the woman who would become his wife, Priscilla Chan.) Sorkin’s next fictional reverie about tech, Steve Jobs, was a relative flop. And so now he plans to go back to the well for a movie that is already my least anticipated film of whatever year it comes out. Obnoxious! In a new AP Entertainment video, the Oscar-winning screenwriter revealed that he thinks it might be time for a follow-up to the hugely successful 2010 David Fincher film. “First of all, I know a lot more about Facebook in 2005 than I do in 2018 — but, I know enough to know that there should be a sequel,” said Sorkin, laughing. Facebook’s new Stories feature for event sharing actually sounds useful You can now share events to your Facebook story in order to encourage friends to go, Nick Statt reports: The company said today that it plans to start testing a way “to share the events you’re interested in and coordinate to meet up with friends IRL” using Stories. The test will take place in the US, Brazil, and Mexico, and it should be available for mobile users on both iOS and Android. Unlike your standard Stories feature, which Facebook initially cribbed from Snapchat for use on Instagram to help it become exceptionally more popular, this specific implementation is designed to share the details of an event with your friends. That way, you can see who may want to come to an upcoming show or some other activity that has a corresponding event page. The stories will come with tappable stickers for revealing event details, and friends can toggle themselves as “interested” or “going” to the event right from within the story. There’s also a link to the event page built in and a way to start a group chat on Messenger with friends who responded. The YouTube app now lets you swipe through videos so you can watch forever Sure, why not: Previously, YouTube viewers had to active tap to move between videos, both on the site and on the app; now, app users can swipe left to see the video they were just watching, and swipe to move to the next recommendation in the queue. The main motivation? Ease of use. Better Worlds: a science fiction project about hope Better Worlds is a fun project from The Verge that comprises 10 original fiction stories, five animated stories, and five audio adaptations from a diverse roster of science fiction authors. The creative constraint we gave all of them was to write sci-fi about a world in which things are going better than today, rather than worse. Finally, contrarianism that’s relaxing! Who Should Mark Zuckerberg Debate About the Future of Technology? As you will recall, Zuckerberg’s personal challenge for 2019 is to do more content marketing. The Ringer staff has some provocative ideas about who he should meet with as part of his planned series of public discussions, including this one from Alyssa Bereznak: In 2012, Lenny Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa lost their child, Noah, in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since then, they have endured harassment both online and in person, perpetuated by fringe, anti-government conspiracy groups that claim the event was a hoax. In an open letter published in The Guardian this past July, they detailed the ways that Facebook has allowed these groups to continue operating and how the company failed to offer any significant protection for their family. Pozner and De La Rosa’s story is an excellent (and incredibly disturbing) example of how lives can be ruined when a massive online platform takes no responsibility in moderating information, and prioritizes growth over the well-being of the communities it’s meant to serve. Based on the many other examples we’ve seen in this vein, the way in which social media platforms plan to deal with similarly delicate situations should be a major topic when discussing the future of technology. And who better to challenge Zuckerberg on this conversation than the people who have suffered from his platform’s carelessness? Egg picture beats Kylie Jenner as most-liked Instagram post of all time Until this weekend, the most-liked Instagram photograph of all time was a picture of Kylie Jenner being beautiful (18 million likes). As of today, the most-liked Instagram photo of all time is now a photograph of an egg (33 million likes). The fact that the most-engaged photo is now a satire of the entire idea of engagement seems like a New York Times Magazine essay waiting to happen. If and when it does, we’ll post it here!

Steve King of his positions on House committees Monday after he lamented in an interview with The New York Times that the term ""white supremacist"" had become offensive. The Iowa Republican tried to clarify that he rejects white supremacy, but with his long history of creating uproar across the nation with his racially-charged comments, those objections largely fell on deaf ears. While defending his remarks in the past, the Iowa Republican has claimed he is regularly misquoted and that he doesn't trust most media outlets. Before his recent re-election, King was under fire for reports that he met with members of the Freedom Party, a political organization founded by a former Nazi SS officer, during a trip to Europe funded in part by a Holocaust memorial nonprofit. Here's a history of some of King's controversial remarks. More: House Democrats to vote on rebuke of Rep. Steve King over white supremacy comments; GOP strips him of committees On the U.S. House floor in July 2006, King suggested building a border wall along the country's southern border and said the top of the fence could be electrified, not to kill a person, but instead discourage them from ""fooling around with it."" ""We do that with livestock all the time,"" King said. Excellent Trump appointment for Secretary of Homeland Security, General John Kelly & I discuss border security with my wall model on table. pic.twitter.com/OGkBcN6NjU In March 2008, King said terrorists would celebrate a Barack Obama presidency and that al-Qaeda ""would be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11 because they would declare victory in this war on terror."" King also said terrorists would be gleeful about Obama's pledge to pull U.S. troops from Iraq and that Obama's father had Muslim roots in Kenya and gave his son the middle name Hussein. While talking about ""Dreamers"" in a July 2013 interview for Newsmax TV, King claimed that for every young immigrant who becomes a school valedictorian there are ""100 out there that, they weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."" While discussing immigration at a May 2012 town hall in Pocahontas, King said the U.S. should select the best immigrants, a process he likened to choosing hunting dogs. ""You want a good bird dog? You want one that’s going to be aggressive,"" King said. ""Pick the one that’s the friskiest &mldr not the one that’s over there sleeping in the corner."" King created an uproar on social media after he questioned the contributions of non-white people during a cable television appearance in July 2016 In response to a comment about the lack of diversity seen at the Republican National Convention, King questioned who has made more contributions to civilization than white people. ""I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you're talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"" he said. King came under fire for displaying a Confederate flag on his office desk during an interview with Sioux City television station KCAU in July 2016. Following the death of two Des Moines-area police officers, King said he removed the flag after learning that Scott Michael Greene, the perpetrator, had displayed it at a Urbandale High School football game, according to the Sioux City Journal. In a tweet posted in March 2017, King was criticized across the political spectrum for a tweet supporting Geert Wilders, a far-right candidate for prime minister in the Netherlands widely interpreted as racist. King further explained to CNN that ""You've got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values. In doing so, you can grow your population, you can strengthen your culture, and you can strengthen your way of life."" Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO In a tweet posted September 2016, King warned that ""cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end."" He later defended his comment during a candidate forum and said uncontrolled immigration in the U.S. could lead to ethnic strife similar to that experienced in Europe. @FraukePetry Wishing you successful vote. Cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end. @geertwilderspvv pic.twitter.com/Kp6uieaMDG In a speech on the House floor in July 2017, King compared the use of taxpayer money on hormone therapies and gender reassignment surgery for U.S. service members to the castration of Ottoman Empire slaves. In a meme posted on King's campaign Facebook page, the congressman ridiculed Emma Gonzalez, an outspoken survivor of the Parkland school shooting and gun control advocate. Posted in March, the meme referenced Gonzalez's Cuban heritage and said ""your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense."" King was recently criticized in October following reports that he met with members of an Austrian far-right political party associated with neo-Nazi movements after visiting Holocaust sites. ► PREVIOUSLY:",2019-01-15 11:20:57,Iowa Rep.

130,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-chicago-mercy-hospital-shooting-reports-20190115-story.html,"Chicago’s police watchdog agency on Tuesday said it would not release video footage from last year’s mass shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center, citing an exemption in state law that allows government agencies to keep information under wraps if they think disclosing it would lead to privacy issues. The gunman in the November shooting at the Near South Side hospital killed an emergency room doctor, a pharmacist and a Chicago police officer. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability is conducting a routine investigation into whether proper procedures were followed by the officer who shot the gunman. The wounded killer, Juan Lopez, 32, died after he turned his gun on himself. On Tuesday, COPA said it has not found any footage that shows the SWAT team officer shooting Lopez. A COPA spokesman could not say whether any footage of the SWAT officer’s confrontation with Lopez exists. Lopez killed Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28, Dr. Tamara O’Neal, 38, and pharmacist Dayna Less, 24, at the hospital. “While there has typically been video releases of officer-involved shootings per the city’s video transparency policy, in this case we have not reviewed any video that captures a Chicago police officer firing a weapon that led to the death of a shooter,” COPA spokesman Ephraim Eaddy said. “If we had that video, we would have that to release. But in the absence of a video that actually captured the shooting, we have decided to use the exemption as stated in the Freedom of Information Act (for other video from the crime scene). “Our commitment to transparency involves an analysis of the public’s right to know against the privacy of those involved,” Eaddy said. The city has a policy calling for the release within 60 days of audio and video recordings and police reports related to shootings, deaths in police custody or other major uses of force by officers. The policy also allows law enforcement agencies to seek an additional 30-day delay. Gunman in Mercy Hospital shooting fired about 40 shots before dying in shootout with SWAT officer Despite the policy, it’s not unusual for COPA to decline to release video. In cases where the person shot by the police is arrested and charged, Cook County prosecutors often seek to withhold the release of video and other material, arguing that making it all public would jeopardize the defendant’s right to a fair trial. In other instances, COPA may withhold material if the person arrested is younger than 18, citing state law prohibiting the agency from publicizing information about minors. However, Eaddy said the Mercy Hospital shooting marks the first time COPA has cited the state’s privacy exemption in the FOIA law as the reason for deciding against releasing video or audio recordings. “As an administrative investigative agency, we remain sensitive to the families impacted as a result of this incident,” he said in the statement. “However, we will continue to ... review and assess any new audio or video received in the future to determine if release of those materials would similarly constitute such an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” COPA did release some police reports related to the incident. According to several so-called tactical response reports, which document whether force was used by or against the police, Lopez, the gunman, fired at as many as 11 Chicago police officers as the carnage unfolded, though only Jimenez was struck. One of the bullets fired by Lopez, however, hit the holster of one of the other officers and ricocheted off his gun. The shooting happened on the afternoon of Nov. 19 after Lopez confronted O’Neal, his ex-fiancee, in the hospital parking lot over their broken engagement. Lopez shot and killed O’Neal outside the hospital before going into the building, where he fatally shot Less, the pharmacist, and Jimenez. Jimenez was one of four Chicago police officers killed in the line of duty in 2018. The only gunfire from police during the roughly 20-minute confrontation came from a SWAT team officer — identified in the police reports provided by COPA as Elvis Turcinovic — who fired five shots with a carbine rifle, striking Lopez in the abdomen. After he was wounded by that officer’s gunfire, Lopez shot himself in the head and died. About 40 bullet casings from Lopez’s 9 mm Glock 17 handgun were found throughout the crime scene, and he had also been carrying multiple firearm magazines. jgorner@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-01-15 22:00:00,Chicago's police watchdog agency declines to release video from Mercy Hospital shooting,,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

""While the vast majority of all streaming on our platform is mainstream entertainment, voices on all sides of an issue or cause are free to operate a channel. We do not curate or censor based on viewpoint,"" a Roku spokesperson said. ""We're not promoting or being paid to distribute Infowars. We do not have any commercial or advertising relationship with Infowars."" The service clearly decided to abandon this approach, since it announced that Infowars would be removed hours later. Infowars and Jones' other accounts were widely banned last year. In August, he was kicked off YouTube, Facebook, Spotify and  iTunes for violating their policies. Twitter permanently banned Jones and his accounts in September. The same month, Jones was also kicked out of Apple's App Store. ""While open to many voices, we have policies that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities or violates third-party rights, among other things,"" said the Roku spokesperson prior to the decision to remove the channel. ""If we determine a channel violates these policies, it will be removed. To our knowledge, InfoWars is not currently in violation of these content policies."" Jones is a right-wing conspiracist who's promoted false claims about tragic events such as the 9/11 attacks and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. He's faced at least five defamation lawsuits, including three filed by families of Sandy Hook victims. Just last week a Connecticut judge ruled that the families of Sandy Hook victims could review the internal marketing and financial documents of Infowars, according to the Associated Press.

133,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/592238622/0/phoenix/politics~State-of-the-State-lesson-Arizona-Gov-Doug-Ducey-may-be-losing-his-clout/,"Now we know the primary reason Doug Ducey didn’t offer a second-term agenda during the campaign: He doesn’t have one. Or, at least, not much of one. A kind way of describing Ducey’s State of the State address would be: steady as she goes. The state’s economy is doing well. People are moving here. The finances of state government are very healthy. Don’t rock the boat. Another word that comes to mind is: unambitious. The boldest proposal in the speech was making a gigantic deposit in the state’s savings account. Beefing up the state’s rainy-day fund is a prudent thing to do. But it’s hardly the sort of thing to make the toes curl with excitement. More significant than what was in the speech was what wasn’t there. There was no ringing endorsement of the state’s besieged charter schools, pointing out how they have driven student achievement, expanded opportunity for low-income and minority students, and the importance of entrepreneurial incentives in that success. Instead, there was a pedestrian nod toward the benefits of school choice and an equally languid gesture toward reform. Charter operators who think they have a hold card against destructive reforms in Ducey are probably miscalculating. There was no call for tax reform moving toward his 2014 pledge to make income taxes as low as possible. No call to revamp the state’s K-12 education finance formula to enhance competition through backpack funding. Since the 2014 election, in Ducey’s world, political brand management has been king. And it has been highly successful, as the thumping margin of his re-election bid documents. But, early in this legislative session, cracks in Ducey’s image of being a competent manager of state government are breaking out. The first order of business, according to Ducey, is for the Legislature to pass his Drought Contingency Plan to keep water in Lake Mead. But he is demanding that legislators reduce themselves to mere clerks. Just sign the paperwork, no questions asked. And, by the way, cut a check for $40 million or so. Again, no questions permitted. The reason for the bum’s rush is that the Ducey administration blew the first attempt to craft a DCP, turning it into a power struggle between the Department of Water Resources and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which operates the Central Arizona Project. There was plenty of time to develop a DCP that didn’t rely on self-emasculation by the legislative branch of state government. Although Ducey didn’t mention it in his address, another urgent matter before the Legislature is conforming Arizona income taxes to changes made at the federal level as part of the Trump tax cut. The federal changes were adopted in 2017. Arizona conforming to them wasn’t addressed in 2018 because Ducey didn’t want to. Conforming would increase what the state collects, raising the question of whether to pocket the money or return it to state taxpayers somehow. That apparently wasn’t a question that Ducey’s brand managers wanted to address before the election. However, reaching the end of a calendar year without deciding what tax is owed on income earned during it is irresponsible management. Perhaps this is too harsh an assessment. The electorate didn’t give Ducey a Legislature conducive to the kind of bold reforms on which he ran in 2014. A period of quiet, small-ball politics has its merits. And small-ball politics can produce meaningful results. Ducey’s proposal to separate the mentally disturbed from guns is too cumbersome and limited to do any good. But a more robust proposal, such as legislative Democrats have advanced in the past, might stop a mass shooting in Arizona. If more of an emphasis on rehabilitation of the incarcerated reduces recidivism, that’s a gain in public safety. Limiting the extent to which occupational licensing is a barrier to work is a very worthwhile effort. Harsh or not, it’s tough to escape the conclusion that Ducey is a diminished force in state policy. Not due to the rise of competitors. Oddly enough, due to his own volition.

135,https://www.inquisitr.com/5251771/the-killers-release-politically-charged-new-song-land-of-the-free-attacking-trumps-america/,"U.S. indie rock band The Killers has released a new politically charged single titled ""Land of the Free,"" which is an unashamed attack on Donald Trump's America. The song touches on the issues of gun violence, racism, mass incarceration, and the border wall and is accompanied by a video directed by filmmaker Spike Lee, according to the Daily Mail. The song was released on Monday and lead singer of The Killers, Brandon Flowers, wrote a long note on the band's official Instagram page explaining the inspiration behind the song. In the statement, Flowers explains that the idea for the song first came about after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012, which left 26 dead. ""The news [of that attack] was devastating. Heart wrenching. A gut punch. But, sadly not as shocking as it should have been,"" Flowers explained. ""If there was a single moment that I mentally began to assemble Land of the Free, that was it."" ""In the months and years that followed, America would be hit with an onslaught of more mass shootings of innocents and too many examples of racial prejudice to ignore,"" he continued. One verse of the song goes, ""So how many daughters, tell me how many sons do we have to have to put in the ground before we just break down and face it, we got a problem with guns.""Other inspirations cited by Flowers are as diverse as director Ava DuVernay's film 13th, which is about race and mass incarceration, along with talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's powerful opening monologues. Flowers also raises the example of his own grandparents who emigrated to the United States from Lithuania to escape the tyranny of the Communist Soviet regime when discussing the treatment of asylum seekers attempting to enter to the U.S. at the moment. In another verse of the song, he writes, ""Down at the border, they're gonna put up a wall. Concrete and rebar steel beams (I'm standing crying). High enough to keep all those filthy hands off of our hopes and our dreams."" The Spike Lee-directed video which accompanies the song includes harrowing footage of immigrant children and families at the U.S.-Mexico border being fired on by border guards as they try to cross into the United States. ""I love my country,"" Flowers added at the end of his statement. ""I know that these are complicated issues but whether you stand to the left, right, or straddle the line, you've gotta believe that we can do better.""",2019-01-16 08:18:57,The Killers Release Politically Charged New Song &#8216;Land Of The Free&#8217; Attacking Trump&#8217;s America,,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com

137,http://www.startribune.com/lawsuit-city-did-nothing-when-minneapolis-k-9-officer-complained-of-harrassment/504429692/,"After her supervisor started hounding her at work and following her around in his police squad car, Yvonne “Bonnie” Edwards complained to his bosses, who ordered him to stay away from her. Instead, his campaign of harassment and intimidation continued unchecked for months, the veteran K-9 trainer alleges in a lawsuit accusing the city of Minneapolis of failing to rein in the supervisor, Sgt. Andy Stender. Stender’s conduct not only left her emotionally spent, but forced her to work in a hostile environment, after her unit colleagues started shunning her for fear of getting on his bad side, the suit alleges. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court, seeks $50,000 in damages. A 34-year veteran of the force, Edwards said Stender’s “hostility toward women” kept her from pursuing lucrative off-duty assignments and alienated her from her fellow unit members. Edwards has been a K-9 officer for 19 years, after stints in seven other units, including nine years on the SWAT team, during which time she became the first female police sniper in the country, the suit says. On several occasions, Edwards alleges that Stender demanded that she retire or made disparaging remarks about her age or gender. One time, he reportedly told her, “We’ve had enough women,” while denying her request to become a dog trainer. Another time, he took the “unprecedented” step of taking away her K-9 partner two days before they were scheduled to graduate from a three-month handler class, the suit claims. Edwards remains in the unit as its only female officer, but Stender is no longer there, police records show.

                                            Officer Bonnie Edwards A message left for Edwards’ lawyer, Nicholas G.B. May, wasn’t immediately returned. Police spokesman John Elder said the department could not comment on pending litigation, referring questions to City Attorney Susan Segal, who said through a spokesman that her office was reviewing the suit. Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Federation, the union that represents rank-and-file officers, declined to comment Tuesday because both officers are represented by the union. He also declined to make Stender available for an interview. Since joining the force in 1992, Stender has received numerous commendations, including twice being awarded the Medal of Commendation and also receiving the Medal of Valor for his role in the police response to the mass shooting at Accent Signage. He was also one of the officers involved in the 2013 fatal police shooting of Terrance Franklin. According to Edwards’ lawsuit, other women in the unit were also targets of his “animosity,” as were male officers who spoke up in defense of Edwards, she alleged. Other times, Edwards contends she was passed over for assignments in favor of less experienced male colleagues. According to the lawsuit, Edwards complained up the command chain and to the police union, eventually reaching Assistant Chief Mike Kjos and Chief Medaria Arradondo. She said she transferred to a different shift to get away from Stender. But over a two-month period in late 2017, he started following her around in a marked squad car while she was on duty, the lawsuit contends. After one such episode, in November of that year, Stender was served a no-contact order, instructing him to stay away from Edwards during work hours, the suit says. But he continued showing up at places where he knew she would be, often forcing her to leave, according to the suit. “The lawsuit claims that Stender began referring to Edwards as a snitch to other officers in the unit after learning that she had lodged a complaint against him. The matter was referred to the department’s HR division in late 2017, but nothing was ever done, Edwards said.  Libor Jany is the Minneapolis crime reporter for the Star Tribune.

141,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jan/17/lr-man-linked-to-teen-program-says-he-s/,"A Little Rock man, who helped found a youth outreach program to discourage teenagers from getting involved with gangs after he said he gave up a life of crime, pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal drug and gun charges for which he is facing 10 years in prison. Chris Lamont Alexander, 42, admitted to charges of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute between 40 and 50 kilograms (88 to 110 pounds) of marijuana and possessing a 9mm Kel-Tec rifle in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. He told U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. that the reason he sold marijuana was to support the youth group, which was called Better Community and Family Values, using the initials of local gangs called the Bloods, Crips, Folks and Vice Lords. ""I didn't take any funds from the city for my business,"" Alexander said. He added, ""It cost me $150 a week to feed the kids, so I had to turn elsewhere, sir, even though I didn't want to."" After Marshall sought to clarify that Alexander was in the marijuana business to fund his youth group, Alexander replied affirmatively, saying, ""Everything I gained I spent for the youth."" Alexander has acknowledged being a former gang member, though federal investigators characterized him as an active member after his arrest in late October 2017, when 7.5 pounds of marijuana and an armored vest were found in a car he owned at his auto detailing business at a Little Rock carwash. Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Givens told the judge that law enforcement officers had been familiar with Alexander for a number of years when they ""developed a source"" through which they were able to arrange small marijuana buys from Alexander. Givens said a confidential informant bought a pound of marijuana from Alexander in front of a residence on 22nd Street in August 2017, during which Alexander asked the informant to go to Texas to pick up some marijuana for him, which the informant declined to do. On Sept. 11, 2017, Givens said, the informant called Alexander, who arranged to sell him 10 pounds of marijuana for $7,000, saying he would meet him in an hour at the carwash. Givens said detectives watched Alexander's red Dodge Charger leave the carwash and drive to his rented business space at 515 S. James St. in Jacksonville, where an associate of his, 41-year-old Kenya Davis, entered the storage unit and emerged carrying a black bag, then got in the car, which went back to the carwash at 1102 Daisy Gatson Bates Drive in Little Rock. There, Givens said, a police dog alerted to marijuana in the Dodge and in a white Ford Mustang, which Alexander admitted was also his, and officers found marijuana and Alexander's wallet in the Dodge. In the Mustang, Givens said, officers found the Kel-Tech alongside pamphlets for Alexander's youth organization. Givens told the judge that a search later carried out at the Jacksonville building resulted in the seizure of a small amount of marijuana, more body armor and two more rifles -- a Ruger .22-caliber and an Alexander Arms AAR-17, both unloaded -- that were sitting in plain view in the closet, which didn't have a door. Alexander, addressing the judge from a table where he wore a bright pink jail uniform and sat beside defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig of Little Rock, said, ""I had the gun with me that was loaded, given the history of people trying to take my life."" He said his best friend was killed in 2015, and he was shot twice in 2016. In July 2017, Alexander's 14-year-old son, Cyncere, was found shot to death in Alexander's apartment at an apartment complex on Green Mountain Drive in Little Rock. Police reported finding a white plastic bag containing 1.8 pounds of marijuana lying open on a bed in the apartment. In July, Little Rock police arrested four men -- Tyler Jackson, 19; Machita Decosta ""Frog"" Mitchell Jr, 42; Kenwan ""Booman"" Sherrod, 21; and Keterrioun Deshon Chandler, 20 -- on charges of capital murder and aggravated robbery in connection with the boy's death. Police have also said that Jackson, Mitchell and Sherrod were together inside the Power Ultra Lounge on July 1, 2017, during a mass shooting that left 25 people injured from gunfire. Jackson told police that he, Mitchell and Sherrod arrived together and that he fired the first shot in the club, according to reports. A Pulaski County investigator's testimony in a federal hearing last year indicated that Mitchell and Chris Alexander, who is also known as ""Murder,"" and ""Murda,"" were in an argument over missing marijuana before the boy's slaying. The investigator read aloud text messages between Mitchell and Sherrod that indicated that Chris Alexander had ""ripped off"" Mitchell and possibly Sherrod. In a message about a week before the slaying, Sherrod told Mitchell that Alexander ""ain't got nothing but a bad-a** little son."" Alexander told the judge Wednesday that just three weeks after his son was killed, ""my 18-year-old little brother was killed on Asher"" Avenue. ""I've just been a man afraid for his life,"" he said. Davis is also facing charges of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Alexander's sentencing was set for 9 a.m. May 7 before Marshall. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, while the firearm charge is punishable by a consecutive sentence of five years to life. Givens said he agreed to recommend, in exchange for Alexander's guilty plea, that he be sentenced to five years on the conspiracy charge, to be followed by five years on the gun charge. Marshall agreed, at Givens' request, to dismiss four other charges Alexander faced: two counts of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and single counts of distribution of marijuana and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Alexander was sentenced last April to six years in state prison after pleading guilty to felony fleeing and possession of body armor.

142,https://deadspin.com/report-richie-incognito-fled-to-a-safe-house-after-jon-1831840820,"Former NFL offensive lineman Jonathan Martin will stand trial over a threatening photo he posted on Instagram in February 2018, the New York Daily News reported. According to the Daily News, an Los Angeles County Superior Court judge said the post—a photo of a shotgun and ammunition which sparked fears of a mass shooting at his former prep school—was enough evidence to justify a trial on three felony counts. Martin’s lawyer argued his client never intended to hurt anyone, but an LAPD detective testified that on Feb. 9, Martin looked up a story on his former Dolphins teammate Richie Incognito hours before he ordered a shotgun. When Incognito learned of Martin’s post later that month, he went into hiding. From the Daily News report: Det. Peter Doomanis further testified that Incognito was so freaked out when he learned about the post on Feb. 22, he hopped in a car with his dad, brother and dog and drove north from Scottsdale, Arizona, for two hours to meet an FBI agent at a safe house. “He described being in a state of panic. He was in fear,” Doomanis said. Martin was taken into custody after posting the photo of the gun, on which he had written the name of the former private high school he attended in Los Angeles (the school was shut down because of the threat). The post included the names of people Martin said had bullied him, including Incognito, along with the words, “When you’re a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge.” He was charged in March with  four counts of making criminal threats and one count of possessing a loaded firearm. Martin, who is free on $210,000 bail, will be back in court on Jan. 30.",2019-01-17 13:03:00,Report: Richie Incognito Fled To A Safe House After Jonathan Martin's Threatening Instagram Post,,22389,http://deadspin.com

144,https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/17/islamic-terrorist-isis-gizmodo/,"REUTERS/Joshua Roberts A Georgia man who recently expressed support for the Islamic State was arrested Wednesday after threatening to attack the White House and other major landmarks. The man’s detention spoiled one media outlet’s carefully crafted narrative. Officials told reporters that Hasher Jallal Taheb, 21, of Cumming, Georgia, allegedly intended to attack federal buildings in Washington, D.C., according to U.S. Attorney Byung Pak. Taheb was charged with attempts to use bombs to blow up any building owned by the U.S. federal government. “All potential threats have been neutralized, and they have been under control from the inception of this case,” Pak said at a brief news conference in downtown Atlanta announcing the arrest. The suspect was snagged after Taheb and an FBI informant met in a parking lot in Georgia to exchange a car for an anti-tank weapon and explosives, according to the criminal complaint. Federal authorities in the court documents said that he had sent two collaborators a link to a video by Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who was killed in Yemen in 2011. An FBI source met in October 2018 with Taleb, who said he wanted to travel to an area controlled by ISIS but couldn’t because he lacked a passport. Taheb’s arrest also comes on the same day that Gizmodo Media Group’s Lifehacker website published a video explaining the true meaning of jihad as told by Muslim Americans. Participants in the video argue that jihad is merely an internal struggle that people go through, be it an internal or external fight. One person said: “My jihad is, you know, sometimes biting my tongue if my mom is saying something funny.” (RELATED: Israel Responds To Hamas Mortar Barrage With Airstrikes In Gaza Strip) A Syrian national flag flutters next to the Islamic State’s slogan Syria in this April 1, 2016 file photo. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki/Files/File Photo While still another person attempted to flesh out the differences between what he described as the different kinds of jihad: “There’s the inner struggle, the outward struggle, there’s the military component, of course.” The video then cuts to another man explaining the “military component” as a type of jihad that is old and outdated, something best left in the dustbin of history. “We’re not in that context today,” he claimed. The rest of the video shows jump-cuts of TV personalities using Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S. and abroad to paint jihadism in a negative light – the participants in the video explained that all these narratives bastardize what they call real jihad. Taleb’s case is one of a handful of recent instances where investigators thwarted potential attacks. Police in New Mexico, for instance, found multiple firearms and evidence in August 2018 suggesting adults at a so-called jihad farm were training children to commit some kind of mass shooting, according to court records. Prosecutors said a handwritten note titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack” was among the documents seized at the compound.

The federal indictment came a month after prosecutors alleged that medication prescribed by Dzung Ahn Pham was found in the system of a driver suspected of fatally striking a Costa Mesa fire captain and in the hands of a gunman who carried out the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. Pham, the owner of the Irvine Village Urgent Care, is facing six counts of distribution of Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Amphetamine Salts, according to a federal grand jury indictment filed this week at the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. Federal prosecutors, in a lengthy court filing in early December, alleged that Pham routinely gave out large quantities of powerful narcotics to dozens of patients, oftentimes the exact medications, and in the exact quantities, the patients specifically requested. In an earlier statement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office described Pham as “flooding” Southern California with huge quantities of prescription drugs that “he knew would be diverted to the street.” The indictment specifically alleges that Pham prescribed mediation “without a legitimate medical purpose” to several individuals in August, October and November 2018. Pham, who was released from custody on an $80,000 bond, is scheduled to return to court on Tuesday morning to be arraigned on the charges outlined in the indictment. Prosecutors say at least five people suspected of receiving and filling prescriptions from Pham died of drug overdoses. According to a sworn statement by a federal agent, narcotics prescribed by Pham were in the system of Stephen Taylor Scarpa, when Scarpa is suspected of veering into a bike lane while driving along Alicia Parkway in Mission Viejo and killing Costa Mesa fire Capt. Mike Kreza. Text messages obtained by investigators also indicated that prescription bottles of Pham’s that he had given someone else were found in the possession of Ian David Long, the gunman who carried out the Borderline shooting that left 13 dead, prosecutors allege. Pham, of Tustin, is not facing any criminal charges tied to the overdoses, the death of the fire captain or the Borderline shooting. Get the latest news delivered daily!

See Offers  Activists told on Saturday of hardships they've endured in central Maine, gratitude for support they've received and hope for a better future; the event was linked to nationwide commemorations of the Women's March in 2017. WATERVILLE — A handful of central Mainers — many of them of high school age or younger — spoke to a crowd of over 80 people gathered by Waterville’s City Hall to promote the rights of various marginalized groups at the city’s first-ever Equality Rally on Saturday morning. The Waterville event was coordinated to take place around the anniversary of the national 2017 Women’s March that followed President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Eight other groups in Maine — and many others nationally — held similar social justice-oriented rallies this weekend. A Facebook group called Central Mainers for Change, led by Stryker Adams and Mary Dunn, organized Waterville’s event and started advertising it about a month ago. It ran from 11:30 a.m. to about 1 p.m. On Saturday, Dunn said she “thinks it’s time we all speak up” and hoped the rally would inspire citizens to take action on injustices they observe. “Something else that inspired me to do this was listening to what’s happening in Skowhegan with the ‘drop the mascot,'” Dunn said, referring to an ongoing debate over the appropriateness of Skowhegan High School’s use of the word “Indians.” “I’m floored by the things that I read, and so that encouraged me to speak out.” Lisa Savage, one of the leaders calling on the high school to stop using the “Indians” nickname for its sports teams, was the event’s opening speaker. “The world is changing, yet (Skowhegan Area High School) steadfastly refuses to change with it,” Savage said, quoting a piece of writing drafted by her sister, Hope Savage, who could not attend the rally on Saturday. “It is no longer acceptable to mock minorities by using them for mascots.” Savage said people must listen to the experiences of those who have been historically oppressed, even though they are unable to change their ancestors’ transgressions. “I have nothing to offer monetarily that would make up for hundreds of years of abuse and unfair treatment,” Savage said. “I can’t force our government to honor the treaties made with the Native Americans, which are broken whenever the government wants back what they agreed to give. But I listen. Listening is what I have to offer as a descendant of those who murdered, as a descendant of those who raped, of those who stole from the people living here long before we showed up.” Alongside Savage’s “Retire the Indian Mascot” sign, there was visible support for a variety of causes among the bundled-up audience. Elayne Richard displayed a yellow “Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights” T-shirt on a pole while flaunting a matching hat. The Maine Gun Safety Coalition and Planned Parenthood’s Generation Action program set up informational tables nearby in Castonguay Square. From the steps of City Hall, Tyler Duval, a transgender man and board member of MaineTransNet, told his story and noted the importance of supporting people who are struggling with their sexual orientation and gender identity. Duval said that he was kicked out of his parents’ home when he was 15 years old, after his mother confronted him about his sexuality. “If my parents couldn’t even love me as a queer person, who could? Was it even fair for me to expect them to?” Duval recalled thinking. “As trans people, we see our families as well as our government trying to tear us from our support systems and our greatest chance to survive,” he added, later saying, metaphorically, “I’m here to tell you that our oil tanks are running low and our pilot lights are going out. A little bit of help does go a long way.” Duval said that attending events like Saturday’s Equality Rally is important. “Social change and political action happen in real time, face to face,” he said. “Thank you for being here in person today. I know it’s really cold. Thank you for looking at me and listening to me.” Waterville High School student Amaryllis Charles described challenges she has faced as a person of color living in rural Maine. She said that attending Seeds of Peace, a summer leadership camp focusing on building inclusive spaces, gave her a new perspective. “During the summer before Seeds, I … didn’t think my voice was valid or my opinions mattered,” she told the audience. “I felt small and closed-in being a person of color in a small Maine town. I had so much anxiety I couldn’t even walk six houses down to my friend’s house because people driving by would stare at me. … At Seeds, I was taught to speak up when something is wrong, and if they don’t listen, speak louder. I can’t say life has gotten easier, but I know how to handle it, from confronting and educating people about using racial slurs to sitting down with a homophobic man and talking about gay rights.” Thomas College student and Central Maine Pride member Mathew Crane also told the audience how hard it has been for him to feel as though his voice matters. “I often question my validity and what meaning my story has for people,” he said. “And I’m also aware that part of my story comes from a place of privilege, because I’m a white cisgender man, and that’s allowed me certain opportunities. However, I also realize that in not telling my story, that I’m diminishing myself, and I do that too often. And I diminish myself for fear of making other people uncomfortable. … So the main thing I wanted to share with you today and the main part of my message is that we cannot and should not diminish ourselves for the sake of others. We are each important. We each have a valid and meaningful story to tell. Be yourself, speak your truth and let others do the same. … We listen to others and that’s how we learn.” Several elementary school students from the Albert S. Hall School Civil Rights Team gave their reflections on active citizenship and today’s political climate. “The equal rights that all deserve are wroth fighting for,” said Penelope Graham, who is in the fourth grade. “We have built this America to be free, but we have not granted this wish of freedom to all of our growing American family.” Riviera Hernandez, another fourth-grade student, presented a message of hope for the future. “When I look out the window into the world, I sometimes see unkindness and cruelty,” Hernandez said. “When I look back into the mirror, I see someone who can change that. When I look into the mirror, my inner voice tells me, ‘Go change the world.’ I listen. I listen to that voice and I change the world. You can too. You can fight for justice — not with violence, but with words.” Dunn said that incorporating young voices was essential to her. “I used to be a teacher at the Hall School, so we decided to bring in the voices of the youth because they need to be heard.” Abi Bloom, another Waterville High School student and member of Beth Israel Synagogue, talked about America’s mass-shooting epidemic, and, in particular, how the shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue affected her as a Jewish American. Midway through the speeches, Colby College professor Elizabeth Leonard warmed the audience up by leading the group to sing and stomp along to a folk song called “Somebody’s Hurting My Brother.” The lyrics include repetitions of the line: “Somebody’s hurting my brother and it’s gone on far too long and we won’t be silenced anymore.” Leonard swapped out “brother” with “sister,” “family” and “planet” in successive verses. Leonard represented the Poor People’s Campaign at the rally. Rep. Colleen Madigan also spoke briefly. The event concluded with a drumming performance by Tracey Tinyhouse Elohi. Sheila Osborn, a Winslow resident who attended the Equality Rally, said she braved the cold weather Saturday because she finds such events empowering. “I just like the feeling of community and people who want to do something,” Osborn said. “There’s so much going on in the world today.” Irene West, also from Winslow, agreed. “Each time anyone organizes something like this, it’s important to show up because there’s so much happening that’s not of our choice,” she said. “We’re somewhat powerless-feeling.” Dunn said she was pleased with the turnout. “I think it went fabulous,” she said. “The kids brought me to tears several times and they inspired many of us, I think. I think it went great for a cold, cold day.” Meg Robbins — 861-9239 [email protected] @megrobbins Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

155,https://www.inquisitr.com/5257426/heather-locklear-instagram-post-2019/,"Actress Heather Locklear had a rough 2018. She had serious troubles with the law, her fiancé, substance abuse, and her overall mental health. After a stint in rehab late in the year, friends, family, and fans are hoping that she can pull herself together and be happy again. One thing that always puts a smile on the 57-year-old's face is her Maltese dog, Mister. The 4-year-old snow-white pup is featured in the majority of pictures on Locklear's Instagram page and often travels with her when she leaves her home state of California. So, when it came time for the Dynasty alum to post her first photo of 2019 on the social media site, it makes sense that it would be a shot of the adorable fluffball. The Instagram photo features Mister sitting on top of a big blanket adorned with his likeness that is spread out on the sofa.

Mayfield will join the likes of MLB players Christian Yelich, Ryan Braun and Mitch Moustakas as well as NFL star Jared Goff and actor Charlie Sheen — all California natives — at a charity softball game this coming weekend. The game will take place at Pepperdine University and is under the umbrella of the California Strong campaign. Some of those partaking in the charity game shared their thoughts with TMZ Sports. Yelich is a native of Thousand Oaks, where a mass shooting killed 12 people back in November. He frequents the spot of the shooting, Borderline Bar, and has suggested he’d be more than open to donating his NL MVP Trophy. The likes of Reggie Miller, Justin Turner, Mira Sorvino, Rob Riggle and Patrick Schwarzenegger will join the above-mentioned stars for the great cause this coming Sunday.

158,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jan/20/senator-review-police-shootings-2019012/,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A South Carolina state senator has proposed that state authorities review all shootings that involve law enforcement officers. Sen. Gerald Malloy of Hartsville, about 70 miles northeast of Columbia, noted that state police investigated all but one officer-involved shooting in South Carolina in 2018 -- but that one was the deadliest encounter of all. The case that sparked Malloy's legislation happened in October, when five law enforcement officers were wounded and two were killed after a suspect opened fire on them at a home in Florence County, the neighbor to Malloy's Darlington County. County deputies had gone to the home on Oct. 3 to serve a warrant in a child sexual assault case when someone opened fire on them from a second-story window. During the firefight, a SWAT team and other agents from the State Law Enforcement Division were headed to the scene to assist, but the Florence County sheriff's office called them off, according to State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry. Florence County Sheriff Kenney Boone then turned the investigation over to Richland County -- 60 miles from the crime scene -- rather than to the division. Boone did not respond to a request for an interview. He said at the time that Richland County deputies had the expertise and equipment to conduct a thorough investigation. Boone also has a history with the law enforcement division. State agents investigated messages that he left last summer with county officials who questioned his expenses. Prosecutors at the state attorney general's office reviewed the division's report and determined that while the messages were unprofessional, rude and could be interpreted as threats, no crime was committed. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott has fought previous bills that would require the State Law Enforcement Division to investigate his officers if they shoot at suspects. He said he has an advisory council of citizens that can review shootings and dispute the findings of investigators. A spokesman for Lott said the Florence County incident isn't a routine police shooting case. ""We did not classify the Florence County shooting as an officer-involved shooting. It was a murder; a premeditated mass shooting against the officers. We investigated it as such,"" said Capt. Maria Yturria. Many states lack a law specifying which agency investigates police shootings, said Philip Stinson, a professor at Ohio's Bowling Green State University. Wisconsin and New Jersey, however, adopted specific guidelines after a rash of high profile killings. Among the largest cities in the U.S. and Canada, 49 percent report having their own agencies investigate shootings by their officers, according to a 2018 report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Stinson said independent investigations with set guidelines reduce the appearance of impropriety, but that many jurisdictions resist because ""police chiefs and county sheriffs are sometimes very territorial and want to take care of things on their own."" Since the beginning of 2014, there have been 231 police shootings in South Carolina. Local agencies have asked State Law Enforcement Division agents to investigate all but eight of them. The only agencies to not ask for the division's help were Richland County and Florence County, Berry said. The widow of one of the officers killed in Florence County said there was ""chaos"" during the investigation. She said she believes the county lacked the experience to handle such a case and that neither the victims nor their families got the help or the information they needed. ""It felt like we got pushed aside because of confusion or complications about the investigation,"" Allison Carraway said at a public hearing on Malloy's proposal. Her husband, Florence city police Sgt. Terrence Callaway, was killed, as was Florence County sheriff's investigator Farrah Turner. Turner's family issued a statement in response to Carraway's remarks, saying their experience with investigators doesn't reflect hers. Carraway says she still has scores of questions. She wants an explanation as to why the State Law Enforcement Division isn't leading the investigation into her husband's death, a timeline of what happened from when he arrived at the shooting scene, how he was shot and how long it took to get him medical help. ""I simply want an explanation,"" Carraway said. ""I think that is something we deserve.""

159,https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/20/in-superdomes-silence-rams-take-giant-step-to-the-super-bowl/,"Trending: NEW ORLEANS — The silence was deafening. It filled every nook and cranny of the cavernous Mercedes Benz Superdome, a low din bouncing from sideline to sideline and up and down towering bleachers filled with twirling white towels, where tens of thousands here – and millions more elsewhere – held their collective breaths. 
Up until that point, before kicker Greg Zuerlein would line up for an improbable 57-yard kick that would send the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl, this vast football cathedral was filled to its brim with a thunderous, unrelenting roar, one so powerful that it literally shook hunks of loose drywall from the stadium’s bowels. 
It was no wonder that, until Zuerlein’s kick, the Saints hadn’t lost a playoff game here since 2000 when the Rams wunderkind coach Sean McVay was merely a high school freshman. His young quarterback, Jared Goff, spent most of the game cupping his hands over his helmet to hear McVay’s play calls, before eventually taping the holes shut on either side. The Rams offensive linemen struggled to hear anything outside of the lineman next to him, who was left to scream audibles into those same ear holes, before passing the message down the line for others to hear. 
“I’ve never played in anything louder than that ever,” said Andrew Whitworth, the Rams left tackle, who hadn’t won a playoff game in his 13 NFL seasons until last week. 	


But as they stood on the sideline, their hearts beating through their chests, the noise that rung in their ears for hours melted away. As Zuerlein lined up for a game-winning field goal that will assuredly go down in the annals of franchise history, only the silence remained. And in that silence was an aura of self-assurance that so few teams would prove capable of mustering. 
For the Rams, it had been well earned. That process began three years earlier, when the team moved across the country to a city that wasn’t sure yet how to feel about its presence. It continued a year later, when team president Kevin Demoff and general manager Les Snead walked out of an interview, convinced they’d found the coach that could lift the franchise from the league’s lowest rungs. 
						
But this year, it was earned in more subtle, but powerful ways, through the trials and tribulations that pile up over the course of a season spent in contention. The first bit of adversity had struck here, in fact, in this very stadium, as the Saints dealt the Rams their first defeat back in November. From there, the obstacles, big and small, seemed to come in coordinated succession. 
Massive wildfires that displaced players and staff. A mass shooting not far from their team facility. A city consumed by heartbreak. On the field, the Rams dropped two games in a row, and the bandwagon emptied. Still, their resolve stuck. “We’ve been through it all,” said cornerback Sam Shields, who just a year ago . “We’ve fought, and we’ve fought.” 
Through it all, the disasters and the heartbreak and the usual Sisyphysian slog of a season, the Rams were still standing, watching from the sideline as the kick soared in what seemed like silent, slow motion. 	


Center John Sullivan had been here before, in this exact moment, almost a decade prior. He’d watched as Drew Brees and the Saints drove the field on the Vikings defense, and he’d stared in disbelief as the Saints lined up for a game-winning field goal in overtime. 
That would be his last meaningful chance at a Super Bowl until Sunday, and the memory came surging back in those final moments as Zuerlein’s kick hung in midair. 
“It feels like it was a long time coming back around,” Sullivan said. 
John Johnson could only understand in theory what the long wait had felt like for Sullivan and other veterans like him in the locker room. This was only the young safety’s second season, after all, and as he came down with the floating, overtime interception that would soon lead to Zuerlein’s field goal, he only had an inkling of what it meant. “It took forever for that ball to come down,” he said. But as he grinned from aside his locker, his teammates buzzing around him, he let the glory of a moment he won’t soon forget sink in.

“That’s a play you have to make,” Johnson said. “You have to make it. I didn’t want the moment to get bigger than making the play.” 
But the moment that came soon after, as Zuerlein’s kick split the uprights, as the roar of the Rams elated sideline cut through the silence, felt bigger than life, as if it’d been fated all along. 
An hour later, in the afterglow of a cramped visitor’s locker room, after winning a game they so easily could have lost, after stamping their tickets to the Super Bowl, two weeks from now in Atlanta, Sullivan sat back at his locker. “I’m just breathing this all in,” he said, and with that, the 34-year old center let the buzz of a Super Bowl-bound celebration wash over him.

Center John Sullivan had been here before, in this exact moment, almost a decade prior. He’d watched as Drew Brees and the Saints drove the field on the Vikings defense, and he’d stared in disbelief as the Saints lined up for a game-winning field goal in overtime. 
That would be his last meaningful chance at a Super Bowl until Sunday, and the memory came surging back in those final moments as Zuerlein’s kick hung in midair. 
“It feels like it was a long time coming back around,” Sullivan said. 
John Johnson could only understand in theory what the long wait had felt like for Sullivan and other veterans like him in the locker room. This was only the young safety’s second season, after all, and as he came down with the floating, overtime interception that would soon lead to Zuerlein’s field goal, he only had an inkling of what it meant. “It took forever for that ball to come down,” he said. But as he grinned from aside his locker, his teammates buzzing around him, he let the glory of a moment he won’t soon forget sink in.

But the moment that came soon after, as Zuerlein’s kick split the uprights, as the roar of the Rams elated sideline cut through the silence, felt bigger than life, as if it’d been fated all along.

Report an Error But this year, it was earned in more subtle, but powerful ways, through the trials and tribulations that pile up over the course of a season spent in contention. The first bit of adversity had struck here, in fact, in this very stadium, as the Saints dealt the Rams their first defeat back in November. From there, the obstacles, big and small, seemed to come in coordinated succession. 
Massive wildfires that displaced players and staff. A mass shooting not far from their team facility. A city consumed by heartbreak. On the field, the Rams dropped two games in a row, and the bandwagon emptied. Still, their resolve stuck. “We’ve been through it all,” said cornerback Sam Shields, who just a year ago . “We’ve fought, and we’ve fought.”

165,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jan/22/king-condemns-two-americas-20190122/,"ATLANTA -- A commemorative service for Martin Luther King Jr. was held Monday morning in Atlanta at a church called King's ""spiritual home."" King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, said in her remarks that the annual service at Ebenezer Baptist Church came during a moment of crisis in America. She condemned the gridlock and partisanship in Washington that led to the shutdown that organizers said had nearly imperiled the service. ""Our humanity is literally on the verge of digressing to two Americas and becoming the dis-United State of America,"" she said. King also criticized what she called ""the powerful resurgence of nationalistic and white supremacist ideologies"" around the world. She also accused President Donald Trump's administration of appropriating her father's legacy for its own agenda. Her remarks were aimed at Trump's push for a border wall and at comments by Vice President Mike Pence, who during an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, said: ""One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was 'Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.' ""You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union,"" Pence said. ""That's exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do. Come to the table in the spirit of good faith. We'll secure our border, we'll reopen the government and we'll move our nation forward."" On Monday, Bernice King said: ""If we really want to make real the promises of democracy, now is the time on this King holiday to stop quoting King out of context and misquoting him to suit our own purposes."" Bernice King also called for action on problems facing the country, saying that the concern for human welfare is being threatened. ""When prejudice and bigotry are emboldened ... when schools continue to be unsafe spaces because of impotent gun control laws.... this is a humanitarian crisis, and we are in a state of emergency,"" King said. Ebenezer Church's current pastor, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, also took aim at the government shutdown, calling this ""a time of narrow vision and petty politicians."" The event was attended by two Georgia lawmakers -- Republican U.S. Sen. David Perdue and Democratic U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath -- and Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February. Perdue, who is white, recounted growing up in Georgia during segregation and praised King as an inspiring leader who changed the world. ""He gave us hope during some of this country's darkest days,"" Perdue said of King. ""Our country has overcome a lot, but there is much left to be done."" Gonzalez sat just behind the speaker's podium throughout much of the televised and livestreamed service. The high school student turned gun-control activist said that King had paved the way for future generations of peaceful protests. The annual service at Ebenezer Baptist was in doubt until Delta Air Lines, headquartered in Atlanta, gave the National Park Service a grant to reopen the site. In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said the grant would keep the sites open through Feb. 3, the day of the Super Bowl game in Atlanta. ""These historic landmarks represent the strength of our community and should always be made available for the public to enjoy,"" Bastian said. The church is part of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park located in the ""Sweet Auburn"" district of downtown Atlanta. The civil-rights leader, who would have turned 90 this year, was co-pastor with his father at the church from 1960 until his assassination in 1968. The church is often referred to as King's ""spiritual home"" because his father was the pastor there for four decades and King was born around the corner, grew up in the neighborhood and delivered some of his first sermons there. Trump and Pence, who did not have any ceremonies honoring King on their public schedules, made an unannounced visit Monday at a Washington memorial erected for the slain civil-rights leader. The president laid a wreath at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in a visit that observers said lasted 90 seconds. ""It's a great day, a beautiful day,"" Trump said. ""Thank you for being here."" Trump also issued a proclamation in King's honor. ""Today we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for standing up for the self-evident truth Americans hold so dear, that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God. #MLKDay,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning.

166,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/gun-sales-down-shifting-political-climate,"When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry’s largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn’t envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office. Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called “silencers” — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future. Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it’s from a gun dealer or a private sale. Even without Democrats’ gains in November’s midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called “Trump slump,” a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Background checks were at an all-time high in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year in office, numbering more than 27.5 million; since then, background checks have been at about 25 million each year. Gary Ramey, owner of Georgian gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year’s SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He’s expecting the same this year. “There was no one to beat up. You didn’t have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say ‘He’s the best gun salesman, look what he’s doing to our country,'” he said. “Numbers are down,” he added. “You can’t deny it.” Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall. “After the Parkland shooting, (gun rights’ initiatives) were kind of frozen in their tracks,” Spitzer said. “Now there’s no chance that it’s going anywhere.” It’s easier to drive up gun sales when there’s the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. “It’s harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn’t have the same galvanizing effect.” The National Shooting Sports Foundation’s SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 will attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There’s a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. Last year’s show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons. Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year’s show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend. Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry’s misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders. “Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Joe Bartozzi, the new president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry isn’t disturbed by the drop in gun sales or the shift in federal politics. While Democrats who ran on gun-control platforms made huge gains in the House, he sees the Senate shifting to the other end of the spectrum. “Having been in the industry for over 30 years and seeing the trends of gun sales ebb and flow over time, it’s very hard to put your finger on any one specific issue as to why this happens. It’s just the cyclical nature of the business,” he said. Trump’s campaign was bolstered by about $30 million from the National Rifle Association and when he took office, the industry had hoped that a host of gun rights would be enacted. The Trump administration quickly nixed an Obama-imposed rule that made it more difficult for some disabled people to purchase and possess firearms. But other industry priorities, such as reciprocity between states for carrying certain concealed firearms and a measure that would ease restrictions on purchasing suppressors that help muffle the sound when a gun is fired, failed to gain traction. For now, Bartozzi said his organization is focused on a measure that would expand public gun ranges, funded by an existing tax on firearms and ammunition sales that supports conservation, safety programs and shooting ranges on public lands. The hope is that increasing the number of public ranges will encourage more people to become hunters. (This post has been updated.) A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things.

          / AP When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry's largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn't envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office. Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called ""silencers"" — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future. Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it's from a gun dealer or a private sale. Even without Democrats' gains in November's midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called ""Trump slump,"" a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Background checks were at an all-time high in 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in office, numbering more than 27.5 million; since then, background checks have been at about 25 million each year. Gary Ramey, owner of Georgia gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year's SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He's expecting the same this year. ""There was no one to beat up. You didn't have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say 'He's the best gun salesman, look what he's doing to our country,'"" he said. ""Numbers are down,"" he added. ""You can't deny it."" Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall. ""After the Parkland shooting, [gun rights' initiatives] were kind of frozen in their tracks,"" Spitzer said. ""Now there's no chance that it's going anywhere."" It's easier to drive up gun sales when there's the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. ""It's harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn't have the same galvanizing effect."" The National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 are expected to attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There's a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. Last year's show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons. Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year's show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend. Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry's misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders. ""Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The episode will air almost a year after the high school named after Douglas was the site of a mass shooting that claimed the lives of 17 people (and injuring 17 more) in Parkland, Florida. In the months since, may of the surviving students have become outspoken advocates for gun control. Derek Waters, the creator of the Comedy Central series, sees a connection between those students and Douglas herself, explaining it was one of the main reasons he wanted to tell her story. ""I want people to know what she stood for, and that's what those kids were taught,"" Waters said to reporters during a press day at Viacom's Los Angeles office earlier this month. ""We should know why a school is called [after] her name."" Also Read: 'The Daily Show' Gives Trump the 'Drunk History' Treatment (Video) Also Read: 'The Daily Show' Gives Trump the 'Drunk History' Treatment (Video) The episode tells the real-life story of Douglas (Jayma Mays) and her successful campaign -- alongside Ernest F. Coe (Waters) -- to save the Florida Everglades, which were in danger of being drained and reclaimed for land development in the late 1920s. The Everglades National Park was eventually established in 1934. ""Marjory Stoneman Douglas is a name we all know because of that school, but why don't we find out who [she] was?"" Waters continued. ""It's a really important story for us."" Stoneman's story is part of a larger episode named ""National Parks"" that also tells the stories of the time Native Americans attempted to occupy Alcatraz and turn it into a national park, as well as John Muir's camping trip with President Theodore Roosevelt in Yosemite, a 3-day trip that many argue led to the creation of the National Parks System. ""[National Parks] is the political thing that I will stand for all the time."" Despite the comedic premise of the show -- where inebriated celebrities recount mostly-accurate historical events (the stories are true, but the dialogue is made up) -- Waters said that he gets most excited when he gets to learn something he didn't previously know, especially if it's a small fact about a very well-known historical figure. ""I find you get the most attention when people don't know what something is,"" he said. ""It's obviously why I chose this, because of what is important and those kids, and the very important issue."" Watch a clip from the show above.

172,https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/song-of-parkland-hbo-documentary-trailer-782418/,"Welcome, New doc set to premiere on HBO in February Reporter A new trailer for HBO’s upcoming documentary, Song of Parkland, offers a poignant look at how Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School drama teacher Melody Herzfeld helped students cope with the aftermath of the mass shooting that left 17 people dead. The film is set to premiere February 7th. The day of the shooting, Herzfeld and her students were rehearsing for their annual children’s musical when the alarm went off. Herzfeld famously rushed 65 kids into the closet in her classroom to keep them safe, and in the following weeks, she and her students continued to prepare for the show, recognizing it as an opportunity to both heal and bring back joy to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The Song of Parkland trailer offers a behind-the-scenes look at the exuberant children’s musical rehearsals that followed the mass shooting, while it also juxtaposes those sequences with footage of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students leading protests for new gun control laws. The clip also features interviews with several students and Herzfeld, who recalls at the end of the clip, “When they came back to school, I said, ‘I promise you, life is so good.'”  Herzfeld’s work during and after the shooting earned her the Tony Awards’ annual Excellence in Theatre Education Award last year. The show also featured her students performing the Rent hit “Seasons of Love.” Want more Rolling Stone? Sign up for our newsletter. Newsletter Signup Have a Tip?

The new HBO documentary “Song of Parkland” shows how the school’s drama department returned to school in the wake of the tragedy to put on a production to help unite the school. In addition to chronicling the efforts of the students to finish the production, the film also follows a number of Stoneman Douglas classmates as they became prominent activists throughout the rest of 2018. In addition to working to finish the last of their rehearsals, the newly released trailer for the film shows the students marching in demonstrations.

The students’ work looks to be the focus of the film, but “Song of Parkland” also features Stoneman Douglas drama teacher Melody Herzfeld as she rallies her class to finish the show they started. (“It is the most important show that you’re doing, probably ever,” she tells a packed stage.) Herzfeld was eventually honored at the 2018 Tony Awards, where she won the Excellence in Theatre Education Award. “Song of Parkland” comes from Amy Schatz, director of the Emmy-winning “An Apology for Elephants,” which also aired under the HBO Documentary Films banner.

Foster Male drag is a staple of the theater. Female drag, uh, not so much. So it's good news to report that Amy Staats' new bio-comedy, ""Eddie and Dave,"" makes spectacular use of its female actors in male roles, in this case, the rockers Alex and Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth. ""Eddie and Dave"" opened Tuesday at the Atlantic Theater Company. Yes, the men of Van Halen are being played by women, although that fourth band member, Michael Anthony, gets an entirely different kind of stage treatment, which will not be revealed here but is worth more than a few hearty laughs. Two summers ago, the Public Theater staged a disastrous ""The Taming of the Shrew"" with an all-female cast at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. When men play women, it's inherently funny because what you get are a lot of larger-than-life women. Going in reverse with the Bard, the female actors of ""Shrew"" simply turned themselves into a lot of little men trying to be gruff and vulgar, and coming up, well, short.

They startle us by being the little boy that is at the heart of every rock-and-roll star. They're not playing men. They're playing petty, pampered, spoiled, solipsistic little boys who only occasionally resemble adults, but for the most part spend their time trashing hotel rooms and showing up late for an important recording session. These female actors also have that androgynous thing down pat, what Mick Jagger personified before he turned 30. Hill, especially, sports Jagger's obscene mouth, and she uses it and the rest of her body for magnificent semi-virile effect. Vanessa Aspillaga, playing an MTV VJ, narrates the rise and fall and semi-resurrection of the band known as Van Halen, starting with their disastrous reunion at the MTV Music Awards in 1996. I'm not sure if Aspillaga is playing male or female, but unlike most narrators in the theater, she's worth watching in her own right. Also Read: 'Trick or Treat' Theater Review: Everything Bad Happens on Halloween Also Read: 'Trick or Treat' Theater Review: Everything Bad Happens on Halloween The credits includes the following line: ""The only thing real about this play is the author's love for a certain band.""

Included here is Eddie's unlikely marriage to erstwhile TV star Valerie Bertinelli, whom everyone simply calls Val in ""Eddie and Dave,"" and is played with hysterical feminine charm by Omer Abbas Salem. He towers over Staats, but they don't let that get in the way of showing tender love for each other. Staats hasn't found quite the right ending for ""Eddie and Dave."" The comedy and the chaos tend to dribble off in the last 10 minutes of this 90-minute play.

Tuesday, 22 January 2019 05:14 PM When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry's largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn't envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office. Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called ""silencers"" — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future. Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it's from a gun dealer or a private sale. Even without Democrats' gains in November's midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called ""Trump slump,"" a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Background checks were at an all-time high in 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in office, numbering more than 27.5 million; since then, background checks have been at about 25 million each year. Gary Ramey, owner of Georgian gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year's SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He's expecting the same this year. ""There was no one to beat up. You didn't have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say 'He's the best gun salesman, look what he's doing to our country,'"" he said. ""Numbers are down,"" he added. ""You can't deny it."" Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall. ""After the Parkland shooting, (gun rights' initiatives) were kind of frozen in their tracks,"" Spitzer said. ""Now there's no chance that it's going anywhere."" It's easier to drive up gun sales when there's the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. ""It's harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn't have the same galvanizing effect."" The National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 will attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There's a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. Last year's show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons. Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year's show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend. Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry's misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders. ""Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Joe Bartozzi, the new president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry isn't disturbed by the drop in gun sales or the shift in federal politics. While Democrats who ran on gun-control platforms made huge gains in the House, he sees the Senate shifting to the other end of the spectrum. ""Having been in the industry for over 30 years and seeing the trends of gun sales ebb and flow over time, it's very hard to put your finger on any one specific issue as to why this happens. It's just the cyclical nature of the business,"" he said. Trump's campaign was bolstered by about $30 million from the National Rifle Association and when he took office, the industry had hoped that a host of gun rights would be enacted. The Trump administration quickly nixed an Obama-imposed rule that made it more difficult for some disabled people to purchase and possess firearms. But other industry priorities, such as reciprocity between states for carrying certain concealed firearms and a measure that would ease restrictions on purchasing suppressors that help muffle the sound when a gun is fired, failed to gain traction. For now, Bartozzi said his organization is focused on a measure that would expand public gun ranges, funded by an existing tax on firearms and ammunition sales that supports conservation, safety programs and shooting ranges on public lands. The hope is that increasing the number of public ranges will encourage more people to become hunters. © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

179,https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/22/fbi-arrests-santa-ana-man-accused-of-sending-threatening-messages-to-parkland-shooting-victims/,"Trending: A Santa Ana man accused of posting a series of Instagram messages harassing relatives and friends of victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass shooting that killed 17 people last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School has been charged with cyberstalking. Federal prosecutors allege that, for more than a year, Brandon Fleury, 21, harassed and taunted some who knew the shooting victims, at times cheering the death of their loved ones, asking them to cry or threatening to kidnap them. Fleury was arrested Friday, two days after agents carried out a search warrant at his Santa Ana home, said Laura Eimiller of the FBI. Fleury was released on a $200,000 bond after a hearing in Santa Ana, Eimiller said, but was ordered to appear before a federal magistrate judge in Florida on Monday. A criminal complaint filed with a federal courthouse in the Southern District of Florida accuses Fleury of cyberstalking and making threats in interstate communications. Neither Fleury nor his family could be reached for comment on Wednesday, and no attorney representing him was listed in court records. According to the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Fleury’s father, Patrick, told a reporter “Sorry, better luck next time” and “Bunch of nonsense” when reached by phone on Tuesday night. A sworn statement by an FBI agent, filed along with the complaint, describes the alleged social media threats Fleury is suspected of making from several different Instagram accounts and usernames between Dec. 22 and Jan. 11, as well law enforcement’s use of an IP address to track the accounts back to a Santa Ana home that Fleury shares with his father and brother. Fleury told investigators that he posted the messages “in an attempt to taunt or troll” the victims and gain popularity, according to the affidavit from FBI Special Agent Cameron McDowell. Fleury admitted specifically targeting family members of victims he considered to be activists, and who had a large social media presence, the agent wrote. In December 2018, several people contacted the Broward County Sheriff’s Office to report receiving online threats. They included the father of one student killed in the mass shooting, and the brother, father and best friend of another victim. The posts were written by an Instagram user named “nikolas.killed.your.sister,” an apparent reference to Nikolas Cruz,  the Parkland school shooter. Among a series of messages sent in rapid succession on Dec. 22, 2018 were “I killed your loved ones hahaha,” “Your grief is my joy,” “They had their whole lives ahead of them and I (expletive) stole it from them,” and “I took a (expletive) on your sister’s grave,” the last two of which were paired with “crying while laughing” emojis, according to the FBI. More messages were sent Dec. 24 from other Instagram accounts, including “Nikolas took your loved ones away from you, doll,” and “I stole you sister’s future, buddy, with the power of my AR-15.” Similar series of messages were sent to the loved ones of the shooting victims through December and early January, including on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. In talks with investigators, those receiving the messages said they were most concerned by a Dec. 25 message stating “I’m your abductor, I’m kidnapping you fool.” The direct threats led Instagram to voluntarily reveal to law enforcement the IP address used by the poster, according to court records, which led investigators to an account assigned to Fleury’s father. Brandon Fleury did not seem surprised when investigators arrived at his home, the agent wrote, spontaneously saying they were there due to “some stupid (expletive)” he had “done” on the internet. According to the affidavit, Fleury claimed the messages were not threats but “more like taunts.” Asked if he could see how some of the messages could be taken as threats, Fleury responded “I guess so,” the agent wrote. Fleury said he used multiple Instagram accounts, since he expected the company to shut some of them down due to complaints, according to the affidavit. He also acknowledged having a “fascination” with Cruz, mass shooters and serial killers such as Ted Bundy, the agent wrote. According to court records, a tablet Fleury is believed to have used to write the messages was collected by law enforcement. “Fleury did not show remorse for posting the comments but explained he would not follow through on the threats he communicated,” the FBI alleged. Each charge Fleury faces carries a fine or a maximum jail sentence of five years. The Register’s Robert Gundran and the City News Service contributed to this story.

181,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/23/congress-guns-legislation-purchasing-age-1119920,"In most states, anyone 18 or older can buy what’s known as an assault-style weapon, even though the federal purchasing age for handguns is 21. Utah, where the pictured AR-15 semiautomatic rifles are on sale, is one of those states. Congress By HEATHER CAYGLE and SARAH FERRIS 01/23/2019 05:04 AM EST Democrats are introducing a bill that would raise the minimum age to buy assault-style weapons, the latest in a multipronged effort to address a string of recent mass shootings and stifle the gun lobby’s sway since taking back the House majority. The bipartisan bill, expected to be introduced by Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.) Wednesday, would prohibit anyone younger than 21 from buying semi-automatic rifles, with exceptions for active duty military personnel and some police officers. In most states, anyone 18 or older can buy what’s known as an assault-style weapon, even though the federal purchasing age for handguns is 21. Brown’s bill is a repeat of legislation the Maryland Democrat and others offered in the previous Congress after the mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., left 17 students and school staffers dead. That effort failed to pass, but this time Democrats have the House majority on their side. Brown acknowledged that creating age restrictions is far from his ideal, and he would prefer an outright ban: “I’m all about banning assault weapons,” he said in an interview. But Brown first introduced the bill in the House last year because President Donald Trump himself endorsed it in the days after the Parkland shooting. “Where’d I get this idea from? I got it from President Trump,” Brown said. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Brian Mast of Florida and Peter King of New York. The one other Republican who backed the effort last year, Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, has retired. Last March, Trump told a group of lawmakers in a meeting that aired live on cable news that he supported raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21. “It doesn’t make sense that I have to wait until I’m 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18,” Trump said then. The remark stunned Capitol Hill. Within weeks, however, Trump reversed his position after a high-profile meeting with the National Rifle Association. The Raise the Age act is part of a high-profile effort by House Democrats to combat both gun violence and the NRA’s influence over Congress; the latter has effectively prevented any meaningful gun safety legislation from moving in years despite a string of high-profile massacres. Brown hopes his bill will be among several gun control measures that get a floor vote this summer. The first measure expected to come up for a vote on the House floor is a bill to mandate universal background checks for most gun purchases, including private transactions. Rep. Mike Thompson of California, chairman of the Democratic “gun violence prevention task force,” introduced that bill in early January shortly after Democrats took control of the chamber. Brown said he has had only “informal conversations” with Democratic leaders about his bill but hopes it will be included in a broader Democratic effort that will likely be centered around the background checks proposal. That bill has 221 co-sponsors, including five Republicans. So far, Brown’s bill has dozens of co-sponsors, including high-profile gun control supporters like Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), whose 17-year-old son was killed in a shooting in 2012. The bill mirrored a measure in the Senate, co-authored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). With Flake gone, Brown said it’s unclear which Republican may fill his spot, though he said he plans to target Senate Republicans who are up for reelection in 2020. “I believe that there is a majority in the Senate that would view this as very reasonable to raise the age on assault weapons,” Brown said. Across the U.S., the vast majority of states allow young people younger than 21 to purchase semi-automatic weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center. Government Shutdown By BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADE A handful of states moved to act in 2018 after the suspect in the Parkland shooting, then 19 years old, used a semi-automatic rifle he had legally purchased in the attack. Among the states was GOP-dominated Florida, where the NRA is now suing the state over the restriction. Brown’s home state of Maryland is among the few that already ban semi-automatic sales to people younger than 21. When he served as the state’s lieutenant governor, Brown was knee-deep in its gun control overhauls in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shooting in 2012: He personally helped whip votes for the one of the strictest measures in the country. For Brown, the battle for gun control has long been personal. Eleven years ago, his cousin, Cathy, was shot and killed by her estranged boyfriend. “That’s when I decided that I really needed to step up my involvement,” Brown said. Brown and other supporters of the bill argue that the legislation would simply bring parity to federal regulations that currently diverge when it comes to handguns versus semi-automatic weapons. The Brown bill — like the background checks legislation — is unlikely even to be considered in the Senate, much less signed in to law by Trump. But passage by the House would still be a major win for gun safety advocates, who have tried for years to enact stricter laws only to be rebuffed constantly by Republicans and gun-rights groups. congress By ANDREW DESIDERIO and HEATHER CAYGLE The NRA has opposed such efforts in the past, including when Brown introduced the same proposal last year. And Brown said he’s not naive about the influence the organization still has in Congress. “I think more and more people are viewing the NRA with more cynicism and suspicion. But let’s not kid ourselves, they continue to have a very, very strong grip on far too many Democrats,” he said. Still, the high-profile effort by House Democrats shows just how much the political conversation around guns has shifted in recent years. Several Democrats — some of whom would have shied away from the issue in the past — piggybacked on a national effort to enact stricter gun laws led by the Parkland students last year and openly campaigned on gun safety in the election. Fitzpatrick, one of the lead Republican co-sponsors, said he hopes several of his GOP colleagues will end up supporting this “common-sense measure.” “By raising the age restrictions for military-style semiautomatic weapons, this bipartisan bill provides parity with handgun purchases,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “While continuing to support Second Amendment rights, this Congress can take meaningful action to protect our children and keep our communities safe.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

Filed under: As the collaboration comes to a seeming end, the latest entry into the franchise has all the glaring flaws of its predecessors The Punisher’s second season begins with Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal) grabbing a beer at a dive bar in some nondescript Michigan town. He was holed up in the neighboring motel but, by his own admission, felt compelled to check out the bar because he overheard some good live music. (I don’t mean to nitpick, but this small town somehow booked country singer Shooter Jennings for several nights, and no one seems to care.) Frank—who’s going by Pete—flirts with the bartender; his rugged charisma eventually wins her over, and he spends the night at her place. Considering where we left off last season—Frank found out his military bestie Billy Russo (Ben Barnes) was involved in his family’s murder, prompting him to rack up a staggering body count in revenge—this is the closest the show could get to a happy ending (I swear, no pun intended). Of course, because this is The Punisher, the tranquility is short-lived. Returning to the bar for a second night, Frank sees a shifty teenage girl being stalked and then ambushed by a handful of strangers. Frank intervenes before she’s killed; among the well-choreographed carnage, this happens: Hell yes, I shouted to no one in particular, resisting the urge to drape myself in a giant American flag or shotgun a protein shake. Frank hasn’t lost his instinct to protect people or his willingness to leave anonymous goons in a pool of their own blood. He’s still the Punisher—and now he’s taken it upon himself to protect this girl, Amy, who holds something so valuable that people are willing to kill for it. If this sounds familiar, well, you’ve probably watched Logan or You Were Never Really Here—or played The Last of Us. The Punisher’s second season doesn’t get any points for creativity, but this is a formula—violent antihero vows to protect girl at all costs, goes through the wringer to ensure that happens—that has satisfying returns. In the first three episodes of its second season, The Punisher delivers some of the best television the soon-to-be-discontinued Marvel-Netflix enterprise has made in years. Frank and Amy (played by Giorgia Whigham, who—fun fact—is the daughter of renowned That Guy Shea Whigham) hit the road to fight off more henchmen in motels and deal with an Assault on Precinct 13–esque standoff at a local sheriff’s station. It is fast-paced and brutal, and even though it riffs on familiar action movie tropes, it feels like a breath of fresh air for this stale television universe. It’s depressingly on-brand, then, that The Punisher quickly reverts to everything that’s made the Marvel-Netflix shows so infuriating in the first place. Frank, with Amy in tow, returns to New York City. Once again, Billy Russo is up to no good—and now he has some scars that allow him to fully lean into the comics’ Jigsaw persona. Once again, characters spend a lot of time in the same four rooms talking about what motivates Frank and Billy and why they feel motivation to fight or protect them. (Characters in this world just love to talk about motivations in weirdly plain terms.) Once again, there are perhaps eight hours worth of story drowning in 13 increasingly derivative hours of television. The Punisher Season 2 may be the penultimate Marvel season we get from Netflix. Iron Fist, Daredevil, and Luke Cage have already been canceled; the chance of another season of The Defenders is slim, making Jessica Jones’s third chapter, expected later this year, the only holdover. It’s a microcosm of why it seemed like these shows never lived up to their full potential. The Punisher isn’t the most glaring example, but as a cog in an enterprise interested in portraying “grittier,” more grounded Marvel characters who fight crime in New York, it seems particularly strange that the show wasn’t willing to shake up the formula for more than a handful of episodes across middle America. If The Punisher is going to be canceled regardless—or if anyone involved wants to leave an impression that’s different from every Marvel entity that preceded it on Netflix—why keep hitting the same narrative threads? When the Netflix-Marvel TV universe was in its infancy in 2015, with the first seasons of Daredevil and Jessica Jones, those kinds of missteps were to be expected. And even still, despite losing some momentum over its first 13 episodes, Jessica Jones won a Peabody. But four years and 11 seasons of TV have passed, and the flaws that were there in the beginning are still present. Season 2 of The Punisher isn’t a game changer: It’s a relic of a Netflix-Marvel institution that hasn’t ever been able to get out of its own way. For whatever reason, Marvel characters haven’t been able to make an impressionable transition to the small screen, despite myriad attempts. ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. might be five seasons in, but it’s an unspectacular procedural; Iron Fist never recovered from an abysmal freshman season and a controversial casting choice; and the less said about the failed Inhumans experiment, the better. (Even the surrealist charm of FX’s Legion took a step back in the second season, and, if we’re going to nitpick, X-Men characters aren’t technically part of the MCU, anyway.) As much as Marvel dominates the cultural conversation around blockbusters—with other franchises attempting to establish their own cinematic universes—it’s been largely inconsequential in the era of Peak TV. Granted, the Punisher was always going to be a tricky character to adapt to the screen: The show’s first season was delayed in 2017 after the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 59 people. That kind of violence is an intrinsic part of the character’s DNA; in lieu of superpowers, Frank Castle is defined by the things he kills people with, and his arsenal comprises mostly assault weapons. The excesses of gore and violence are part of the package; Frank rarely, if ever, spares people he considers amoral. Even so, The Punisher deserves credit for its initial conceit: The violence was there, but it was expressed through the lens of Frank, Billy, and other characters’ service in the military and the displacement they all felt returning home without any resources to start their postwar lives. (There’s a reason the character has strongly resonated with veterans and law enforcement since his comic book inception.) They are—perhaps irreversibly—broken men, and even Frank’s persistence as a gruff antihero is conveyed as tragic more than anything else. It’s possible that whatever has ailed Marvel’s efforts on television will be fixed once more heroes are adapted for Disney’s upcoming streaming service, Disney+. It’s already been reported that the company will be making its own slate of stand-alone six-to-eight-episode miniseries featuring characters from the current MCU, such as Loki and Scarlet Witch, and a Falcon–Winter Soldier team-up, with blockbuster-type budgets to match those ambitions. All told, a miniseries starring characters from the MCU will probably resemble something closer to Game of Thrones in its scale than that of Daredevil, Luke Cage, or The Punisher. So while The Punisher offered some good through two seasons—namely, impressive fight scenes, an empathetic approach to veterans, and a nuanced lead performance by Bernthal—its presumed cancellation on Netflix isn’t just strategic cost-cutting by a company that knows it can’t compete with Disney’s impending Marvel roster. The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency. It’s only apt that the second season ends with Frank Castle imitating most viewers of the series and letting out one final primordial scream into the night. Check your inbox for a welcome email.

A criminal complaint filed in federal court says Brandon Fleury of Santa Ana, California, began the taunts Dec. 22 using different accounts which were traced to an IP address in Santa Ana, where Fleury lives with his father and brother. He was arrested Friday. Special Agent Cameron McDowell wrote in a 12-page report filed Friday that Fleury showed no remorse when questioned Jan. 16. He admitted to a fascination with the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Students lost friends and siblings, while some parents will never be able to welcome their children home from school again. Nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz entered the school with an assortment of deadly weapons and took the lives of 17 people. As if the school and Parkland community have not already been through enough, someone has been virtually harassing them and poking fun at that tragedy, according to ABC News. Brandon Fleury of Santa Ana, California, is believed to be behind the threatening messages. Fleury reportedly dedicated time and work to the cruel prank. He allegedly created multiple Instagram accounts to ""troll"" the family members and friends who lost loved ones in the shooting. The username he used to send the messages was titled ""nikolas.killed.your.sister."" Fleury later admitted that he specifically targeted the relatives that have been outspoken about the incident, advocating for change and gun control. The heartless messages included ""I killed your loved ones hahaha"" and ""With the power of my AR-15, I erased their existence."" To add insult to injury, he purportedly included emojis of handguns and smiley faces. He may have enjoyed the pain he was causing, writing, ""Your grief is my pleasure.""California man charged with threatening to kidnap and intimidate friends and relatives of Parkland shooting victims. https://t.co/raVCe9Xq7y pic.twitter.com/GEMcRxFMd8— ABC News (@ABC) January 23, 2019Fleury's pranks have been going on for months, even reaching out to the victims on Christmas Day.

He was later arrested and charged. Upon his arrest, he confessed to using his computer to send the messages, calling them more like ""taunts"" than ""threats."" Fleury also admitted to having an obsession with school shootings. He will make an appearance in a Fort Lauderdale court on January 28. Limited information is known thus far regarding Fleury's life or his motivation behind the cruel pranks. However, investigators did discover that he has been through trauma of his own during his life. Reports say that Fleury lost his mother from an illness at a young age. He was also involved in a critical drunk driving accident as a child with his brother. Still, law enforcement has a lot more research to do before they can find further insight into his heartless actions.",2019-01-23 10:31:40,Brandon Fleury Arrested For Impersonating Nikolas Cruz And Harassing The Family Of Parkland Shooting Victims,,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com

187,https://www.theroot.com/who-broke-a-record-for-extremist-killings-in-2018-spo-1831987223,"In 2018, as President Donald “Both Sides” Trump continued to equivocate about white supremacist terrorists, and while former Justice Department Chief and heir to the Keebler Elf empire Jeff Sessions hunted down Black Identity Extremists (who proved to be as elusive as the mythical Bigfoot), radicalized white racists enjoyed a banner year for killing Americans. Welp...So much for that whole reverse racism “black supremacist” nonsense. The Anti-Defamation League released its annual report, “Murder and Extremism in the United States 2018,” on Wednesday, which tracked murders perpetrated by all types of domestic extremists over the past year. According to their research, right-wing extremists killed more Americans in 2018 than they have in any year since 1995. The 50 extremist-related murders also made last year the fourth-deadliest year since 1970. The murders were overwhelmingly linked to white Americans. Only three deaths (or 6 percent of the extremist-related murders in 2018) were perpetrated by a black person. And despite what the anti-immigrant Trump administration would have you believe, none of the people charged with an extremist-related death snuck into the country with a Mexican caravan. In fact, in 2018, a grand total of zero killer radicals were born outside of the United States. Some other notable findings in the ADL report, paraphrased: “It’s time for our nation’s leaders to appropriately recognize the severity of the threat and to devote the necessary resources to address the scourge of right-wing extremism,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL. The organization urges that policies are needed to combat extremism, including political leaders and law enforcement authorities speaking out against it. The group notes that civics and anti-bias education can help fight this pervasive trend, as well as better responses to hate crimes. The report does not list all hate crimes and mass shootings—only ones with “positive evidence connecting the murderer to an extremist group or movement.” For instance, the October shooting deaths at a Louisville, Kentucky, Kroger were not listed because there is no evidence tying the killer, Gregory Bush, to an extremist group or movement. Even though Bush reportedly told a witness that “whites don’t kill whites,” he was probably just a run-of-the-mill crazy, racist white man. The ADL’s list of domestic extremist groups also did not include the terrorists who give out candy corn on Halloween, Nicki Minaj fans, Tucker Carlson, lunatics who like sugar on grits, R. Kelly, people who write checks in the 10 items or less line, the Chicago Police Department, or Covington Catholic’s Future Racists of America club. This nations spends billions to try to stop ‘radical islamist terrorists’, raise all sorts of red flags when anyone of the muslim faith is anywhere close to an American, and will devote days of airtime if any ‘radical muslim terrorist’ actually does something, when it is very rare to find said radical (you’re more likely to find ‘radicals’ who’ve been turned radical by the FBI). Meanwhile, we have an education secretary who supports spending public money sending kids to places like Covington Catholic School of Racism and Bigotry, discuss how the ‘lone wolfs’ are responsible for an act of violence, and have interactions trying to determine how the victims somehow instigated the incident (you know, by being black and nearby). A country with it’s priorities in order.",2019-01-23 13:23:00,Who Broke a Record for Extremist Killings in 2018? (Spoiler Alert: It Was White People),,368082,http://theroot.com/

The arrest comes just weeks ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Feb. 14, 2018, rampage, which sparked a renewed debate over gun violence and turned students into activists. Siblings, parents and friends of several of the victims were tagged in posts on Instagram from Dec. 22 to Jan. 11, including posts on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The posts were initially shared under the username @nikolas.killed.your.sister, referencing Nikolas Cruz, the man charged with killing 17 students. ""With the power of my AR-15, I erased their existence,"" one post said, followed by ""smiling, applause and handgun emojis."" Jesse Guttenberg, whose sister, Jamie, died in the shooting, also received direct messages on Instagram, The Washington Post reported. The family members and friends of the victims mentioned in the criminal complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida, are only referenced by their initials. ""I killed your sister. It was fun(.) She had her whole life ahead of her and I (expletive) stole it from her,"" one of the messages said, according to the complaint. Others threatened the victims' family and friends: ""I'm your abductor I'm kidnapping you fool."" Federal authorities charged Brandon Fleury on Friday with ""transmitting in interstate commerce a communication containing a threat to kidnap a person"" and ""using an interactive computer service"" to ""harass and intimidate another person."" Fleury also used Instagram usernames like bullseyetauntsyou_, nik.taunts_, teddykillspeople and nikolasthemurderer, the complaint said. In one post, he said ""I killed Janice Ott and Denise Naslund,"" two of serial killer Ted Bundy's victims, according to the complaint. Authorities searched Fleury's home in Santa Ana, California, after subpoenaing Instagram for the account information and IP addresses linked to the posts and messages. All of the accounts were used on the same IP address, registered to Fleury's home where he lives with his father and brother. The FBI and did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Instagram confirmed to USA TODAY that the platform ""routinely responds"" to law enforcement requests but declined to comment on specific cases. Fleury admitted to ""creating at least some of the Instagram profiles"" and ""targeting family members who were 'activists' who had a large social media presence."" ""Fleury did not show remorse for posting the comments,"" the complaint said. He will appear in front of a federal magistrate on Monday. Fred Guttenberg, Jamie Guttenberg's father and a high-profile gun control advocate since the Parkland shooting, was tagged in some posts, The Washington Post reported. Guttenberg tweeted Monday about his daughter's tombstone unveiling, which occurs approximately a year after a person's death in the Jewish tradition. Yesterday we had the unveiling of Jaime's tombstone. In the Jewish religion, it is a ceremony that happens approx one year after burial. For us, it was reliving this pain all over again.

Reacting to word that the U.S. Supreme Court has approved the Trump administration's ban on new transgender military recruits, CNN correspondent Jessica Dean ran a piece which deceptively edited a clip of Donald Trump from the 2016 campaign to make it appear he had made a general promise to support ""LGBTQ"" rights which he is now allegedly breaking. In fact, the clip of Trump in question was responding to the Pulse night club mass shooting as then-candidate Trump promised to prevent more such attacks on LGBTQ Americans by Muslim terrorists -- a specification which was carefully cut out for the CNN piece.    Nearing the end of The Lead on Tuesday afternoon, host Jake Tapper informed viewers of the Supreme Court decision and then added: ""You mght recall that during the 2016 presidential campaign, LGBTQ allies of then-candidate Donald Trump pledged that Trump would be great for their community."" He then recalled that transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner had praised Trump for allowing him to use the women's restroom during a trip to Trump Tower. Tapper continued: ""So, two years into the Trump presidency, with measure after measure suggesting administration hostility to LGBTQ equality, how are those allies explaining today what the President is doing?"" After bringing aboard Dean, Tapper further recounted: ""The President even used the term 'LGBTQ' at the Republican Convention -- the first time a nominee ever did that -- but I guess actions speak louder than those five letters."" Introducing the pre-recorded portion, Dean claimed that ""it is hard to find evidence that he (Trump) is making good on some really big promises.""  The piece began with Dean: ""Promises made, promises kept? Candidate Donald Trump was quick to promise his advocacy for the LGBTQ community."" Then came a clip of Trump from his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention: ""As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens."" After an obvious jump, Trump was then seen adding: ""Believe me."" The quote makes it sound as if candidate Trump made a general suggestion that he would side with gay rights activists on such issues, but an unedited clip of that portion of Trump's speech demonstrates that he was merely promising to protect homosexuals from terrorist attacks rather than imply anything beyond that for other gay rights issues. The full quote was: ""As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful, foreign ideology. Believe me."" Trump was reacting to the attack on the Pulse night club in Orlando from 10 days earlier that left 50 dead and more than another 50 injured. The quote came from within an eight-minute segment when he was speaking about his plans to combat terrorism by jihadists. Suggesting that this abridged quote meant that Trump was making a more expansive promise about supporting gay rights, Dean continued: ""A handful of high-profile members of that community tried to assure peers that Trump would be in their corner."" She then recalled that Ambassador Richard Grenell and Caitlyn Jenner were LGBTQ activists who spoke in favor of Trump at the time.  After noting that Jenner praised Trump for siding with allowing transgenders to use the public restroom of their choice, Dean spent the rest of the report fretting over Trump's decision on transgenders in the military without presenting any evidence that he had ever promised to side with liberals on that issue. In October, when the policy change was first announced, several CNN shows similarly utilized the same quote while slicing off the part showing that Trump was referring to protecting gays from violence by terrorists.    By contrast, when MSNBC covered the issue in October, even while they made essentially the same argument using the same quote, at least they did not edit the quote and deceive viewers about the context.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Wednesday officially took his name out of the running in the 2020 presidential race, slightly thinning a herd of progressive White House hopefuls that is expected to rapidly become a stampede. Murphy, a left-wing Democrat who suggested last year that tech giants like Facebook should censor more content because the  “survival of our democracy” depends on it, would have been among the lesser-known Democrats to declare his candidacy. ""I’ve been pretty transparent about this, but let me be 100% clear: I’m not running in 2020,"" Murphy wrote on Twitter. ""I love the job I have now. And at least 2 or 3 Democrats in the Senate need to stay behind to keep the fight going here!"" The 45-year-old Connecticut Democrat took office in 2013, succeeding longtime Sen. Joe Lieberman post-retirement. Murphy defeated former professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who spent about $50 million of her own money on the race, in the 2012 election. Murphy was easily re-elected in last year's midterms, and campaigned fiercely against President Trump's agenda across the board. “He’s got strong supporters here in Connecticut,” Murphy said, referring to Trump, at the only debate held in the 2018 Senate race in Connecticut. “But the vast majority of people in Connecticut know that what he’s doing is not good for the United States or for Connecticut. The vast majority of people that I talk to want me to be fighting the president, especially when he’s trying to take health care away from us or trying to raise our taxes.” GOP ADOPTS TAKE-NO-PRISONERS APPROACH TO EVEN LESSER KNOWN DEM CANDIDATES Murphy's relatively low profile likely would not have insulated him from much GOP criticism. Former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- widely considered longshot candidates with little national name recognition -- have faced a withering barrage of attacks from the Republican establishment since declaring their candidacies in recent weeks.

      (The Associated Press) In August, Murphy found himself on the receiving end of harsh social media blowback: after he tweeted, “Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it."" TOP DEM ADMITS HE'D REALLY LIKE TO REGULATE SPEECH Jones and his Infowars content were removed from Facebook, YouTube, Apple and Spotify earlier that month. Jones is a notorious conspiracy theorist who has been widely criticized for polarizing content, including discredited claims about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Murphy’s Twitter account was immediately filled with negative reaction to his call for additional censorship.

The Guardian spoke to five victims whose lives were wrecked by falsehoods Last modified on Mon 18 Feb 2019 15.49 GMT Conspiracy theories used to be seen as bizarre expressions of harmless eccentrics. Not any more. Gone are the days of outlandish theories about Roswell’s UFOs, the “hoax” moon landings or grassy knolls. Instead, today’s iterations have morphed into political weapons. Turbocharged by social media, they spread with astonishing speed, using death threats as currency. Together with their first cousins, fake news, they are challenging society’s trust in facts. At its most toxic, this contagion poses a profound threat to democracy by damaging its bedrock: a shared commitment to truth.  Their growing reach and scale is astonishing. A University of Chicago study estimated in 2014 that half of the American public consistently endorses at least one conspiracy theory. When they repeated the survey last November, the proportion had risen to 61%. The startling finding was echoed by a recent study from the University of Cambridge that found 60% of Britons are wedded to a false narrative. The trend began on obscure online forums such as the alt-right playground 4chan. Soon, media entrepreneurs realized there was money to be made – most notoriously Alex Jones, whose site Infowars feeds its millions of readers a potent diet of lurid lies (9/11 was a government hit job; the feds manipulate the weather.) Now the conspiracy theorist-in-chief sits in the White House. Donald Trump cut his political teeth on the “birther” lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and went on to embrace climate change denial, rampant voter fraud and the discredited belief that childhood vaccines may cause autism. Amid this explosive growth, one aspect has been underappreciated: the human cost. What is the toll paid by those caught up in these falsehoods? And how are they fighting back? The Guardian talked to five people who can speak from bitter personal experience. We begin in a town we will not identify in Massachusetts where a young man, who tells his story here for the first time, was asleep in his bed. Valentine’s Day 2018 was Marcel Fontaine’s day off. They slept late into the afternoon, having worked a double shift the day before. When they woke up, a wave of happiness washed over them – they were in a relationship, had a job they loved at a local concert venue. Their life was good. By the time they roused themselves, the deadliest high school shooting in US history was already over. A 19-year-old with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle had entered the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, and opened fire. Seventeen had been killed, though Fontaine, who has no cable TV or radio, was oblivious to the tragedy. Then they received a text from a friend. A photo of Fontaine was flying around the internet and they were being accused of carrying out the terrible Florida shooting. Their immediate response was bewilderment. What shooting? Where? Fontaine was in Massachusetts, 1,500 miles away. It would take a four-hour flight to reach the school. They’d only visited Florida once when they were a little boy to see Mickey Mouse. Fontaine, 25, describes themselves on Twitter as a “non-binary gay queer autistic commie that loves horror movies and metal!” They were diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum as a child and for years has struggled with anxiety and a debilitating stammer. At moments of heightened stress, they flap their hands like a bird. In short, Fontaine is a vulnerable leftwing individual who would not harm a flea, which apparently makes them perfect fodder for the sadistic mockery of 4chan, the anonymous message board that hosts alt-right activists and other extremists. A few days before the Parkland shooting, a photo of Fontaine wearing a T-shirt of Marx, Lenin, Mao and other communist luminaries dressed in party hats had been grabbed from his Instagram feed and posted by an anonymous user on 4chan, where they were promptly derided as a “lefty dimwit”. The T-shirt, Fontaine protests, was a joke, a pun on Communist party. In the conspiratorial bubble of 4chan, it was but a small step from ridiculing Fontaine to casting them as the Parkland shooter. Within two hours of the massacre, the image had been reposted on the bulletin board, now saying: “Florida Shooter Was A Commie!” From there, Alex Jones’s conspiracy theory site, Infowars, leapt into the fray. Its “reporter” lifted Fontaine’s photo directly from 4chan and, without any attempt at verification, ran with it on the front page. “Shooter is a commie. Alleged photo of the suspect shows communist garb,” the outlet screamed. The false rumor quickly spread from Miami to Beijing. Fontaine was horrified. “I knew a lot about the Alex Jones fanbase – that they were radical extremists who believe every word he says, and that a lot of them hold firearms. I knew my life was at risk.” The first death threats landed via Facebook messenger by nightfall: “I hope someone throws you out of a rotary aircraft, you commie!” Another made a direct reference to the concert venue that employed them. “They knew where I worked, what I did. It just got me so afraid.” Death threats and autism spectrum conditions make poor bedfellows, and exacerbated Fontaine’s condition, ramping up their anxiety, insomnia and social isolation. “I wasn’t able to function, to cook, do basic tasks. I went days without taking a shower. I didn’t want to go out, I just wanted to be with myself.” Soon, they started having frequent panic attacks. Over the past six months, Fontaine has slowly pulled themselves back together. They are in therapy to combat the bouts of panic and sleeplessness that still trouble them. But they have become less trusting of people and freezes whenever they see someone dressed in camouflage or wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Do they read Infowars? Fontaine wonders. “I get very nervous because they might recognize me and want to actually pull something out on me. Or like beat me to a pulp.” As the anniversary of the shooting approaches, they find it hard to understand why they were singled out. “It makes me sad. This event got me to a point where I just can’t be myself again.” Lenny Pozner, 51, is preparing to pack his bags, again. A few weeks ago, “hoaxers” – as he calls conspiracy theorists – reproduced a map of his Florida neighborhood with a dropped pin marking the precise location of his apartment. It will be the eighth time in five years he will have been forced to move home as he strives to keep one step ahead of the fanatics who relentlessly hound him. Pozner’s crime, in the eyes of conspiracy theorists, is being the father of one of the 20 children who were gunned down in the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Noah was the youngest of all victims. He had just turned six. Within months, conspiracy theorists, egged on by Alex Jones and Infowars, went to work. They generated thousands of web posts and a 426-page book called “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook”. Their thesis: the shooting at the elementary school never happened. The 20 kids who died were “crisis actors”. The tragedy was a con. Noah had never even existed, he was a construct of Photoshop. Within a year, it had reached such a pitch that Pozner knew he had to do something. “I agonized about the situation for several weeks. But ultimately I felt I owed it to my son to protect his memory.” He posted on his Google+ page his son’s birth and death certificates and kindergarten report card. “I was extremely naive. I believed that people were simply misinformed and that if I released proof that my child had existed, thrived, loved and was loved, and was ultimately murdered, they would understand our grief, stop harassing us, and more importantly, stop defacing photos of Noah and defaming him online.” Instead, he watched his deceased son buried a second time, under hundreds of pages of hateful web content. “I don’t think there’s any one word that fits the horror of it,” Pozner says. “It’s a phenomenon of the age which we’re in, modern day witch-hunts. It’s a form of mass delusion.” Pozner is extraordinarily controlled. His voice is flat and preternaturally calm, as though all emotion has been pummeled out of him. His apartment has the same pared-down, antiseptic quality. “I’ve gotten good at moving, I’ve adapted to it,” he says. He left Newtown for Florida in 2013 with Noah’s mother, his now former wife Veronique De La Rosa, and their two daughters in the hope of rebuilding their lives. (He asked the Guardian not to identify the town he now lives in.) He has deliveries sent to a separate address and has rented multiple postal boxes as decoys. The most serious of death threats came from Lucy Richards, a Florida resident who was so fervent in her belief that the Sandy Hook massacre was fake that she left messages on Pozner’s cellphone saying: “You’re going to die. Death is coming to you real soon, and there’s nothing you can do about it.” In June 2017, Richards was sentenced to five months in prison, followed by a further five months under house arrest. Pozner sees this outpouring of hatred as a product of digital technology running ahead of society’s ability to contain it. “Social media hasn’t matured. We lack a segment of law enforcement specializing in it. There really is no one to help.” But he reserves his staunchest criticism for Alex Jones, who he blames for amplifying conspiracies in the pursuit of profit. In a lawsuit suing Jones for defamation for more than $1m, lawyers for Pozner and De La Rosa chronicle how Infowars baited them over many years: the shooting was “staged”, a “giant hoax”. The school was an elaborate film set. It was all a “soap opera”. But in targeting Pozner, Jones picked on the wrong guy. Since 2014 Pozner has made it his life’s work to confront the conspiracy theorists. Through his organization the Honr Network, Pozner has systematically challenged those who he believes cross that line, forcing moderators to delete posts. In 2018 alone, he reported 2,568 videos to YouTube and had 1,555 of those expunged. Pozner’s lawsuit against Jones, which mirrors a similar legal case brought by Fontaine, is making its way through a federal court in Austin, Texas. Earlier this month they received a legal boost when the judge granted them access to Jones’s financial and marketing documents under discovery. Jones denies defaming anyone, though he has so far failed in having the suits dismissed on free speech grounds. Regarding the free speech argument, Pozner says: “You have the right to express yourself and your opinions, no matter how offensive they may be, until your chosen form of expression impedes my rights to be free from defamation and harassment.” What shocks Pozner most, he says, was how alone he was when he began this fight. “I was the only one standing up to the hoaxers, and other than the loss of my son that was my biggest disappointment at the time.” At least he has brought his son’s memory back to life. If you search Noah Pozner on Google you will find hundreds of articles about the boy’s life and death, and virtually none of the bile from those who questioned his existence. By Pozner’s reckoning, one in five people around the world are suggestible to conspiracy theories, and their obsessions are amplified by the crude logic of digital algorithms. “There is just no more truth, there is just what’s trending on Twitter,” he says. “Used to be, you had to burn books to keep people from finding out the truth, now you just have to push it to page 20 of a Google search.” Dr Paul Offit strode into a dispute over the safety of children’s vaccines in 1998. Twenty years later, he is still embroiled in it. His latest death threat arrived only about a month ago, when someone wrote on a forum frequented by vaccine skeptics that Offit was “dead already so they might as well assassinate him”. Offit’s worldview, as a pediatrician at the Children’s hospital of Philadelphia who has himself created a vaccine against rotavirus, had always revolved around the scientific method and evidence-based reality. “The assumption was that if you publish good papers in good journals, truth emerges and people abandon ill-founded beliefs. Didn’t work that way.” In 1998, the since-discredited British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published a paper in medical journal the Lancet linking the MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) to autism. Wakefield went on to advise parents to avoid MMR immunization for their children, spreading pandemonium across Europe and the US. In 2000, Offit decided to act, shocked that nobody was standing up for science. He set up the Vaccine Education Center to give the public a basic appreciation of vaccines which globally prevent up to 3m deaths each year. The backlash came almost immediately. It began with a flurry of emails calling him Satan, a Nazi. “It was devastating. It hurt, it always hurt, it still hurts. I never got so thick-skinned that when people assume my motives are evil it doesn’t hurt me.” He was stalked by a man who followed him from from one speaking engagement to the next. Protesters appeared outside medical meetings bearing placards with Offit’s face above the word “TERRORIST”. A voicemail was left for him at home. The man mentioned he had young children the same age as Offit’s. “We all want what’s best for our children, I’m sure you want what’s best for your children,” the man said, before going on to name Offit’s kids as well as the school they attended. It was the one time that Offit considered dropping it all. That night, he talked to his wife, Bonnie, and offered to quit standing up for vaccines. “If Bonnie had said stop to me that night, I would have stopped.” Bonnie told him to hang in there. You’re doing the right thing, she said, for science, for children. You mustn’t let them shut you up. Offit, 67, is hanging in there, sustained by two powerful motivations. The first is anger: although at least 17 major studies have found that MMR does not cause autism, conspiracy theorists continue to propound the falsehood. Offit is angry in particular at what he calls the “small group of professionals who do this as a living, the media-savvy, politically connected, lawyer-backed group” of anti-vaxxers who have become all the more vocal by using the internet as an organizing tool. “I think they’re evil, to be quite frank. I think they hurt children, they put children in harm’s way and to me they have to be defeated.” His second motivation: children. As the Guardian reported last month, anti-vaccine movements spurred on by rightwing populism are on the rise across Europe and immunization rates are plummeting as a result. The World Health Organization has included such movements – which it called “vaccine hesitancy” – among its top 10 global health threats for 2019. The result of this surge in conspiracy theories around vaccines is that measles outbreaks are at a 20-year high. In 2018 there were more than 60,000 European cases with 72 deaths, twice the number from the year before. Offit has seen at first hand what that means. One of the cases that haunts him is that of a mother who decided not to vaccinate her infant son against influenza, having read some fallacious material about the treatment. The little boy was brought in to the hospital and went through a progression of increasingly invasive care as his body was ravaged with flu. First the child was given an oxygen face mask, then put in a ventilator, then an oscillator and heart-lung machine, until finally he died. “The mother watched her child die in slow motion, like falling off a cliff slowly. It was very hard.” After the boy’s death, Offit asked the mother if she would be willing to talk to other parents wrestling with the decision to vaccinate as a way of preventing further tragedy. She politely declined. “She said to me she still thinks she made the right choice – the vaccine would have been more harmful.” As a developer of video games, Brianna Wu is well placed to judge the stakes involved when someone becomes caught up in the real-world fantasy that is a conspiracy theory. To her trained eye, the chances of prevailing within the maelstrom are passingly low. “If you address the conspiracy theory head-on, you just amplify the message you are trying to disprove. If you ignore it you just get screamed at and harassed until your career is over. It’s a no-win scenario,” she says. Wu, 41, speaks from brutal experience. “I will never forget the day it happened,” she says, recalling when she tweeted a collage of comments lampooning male conspiracy theorists in her industry. “My Twitter caught on fire with all kinds of threats and nasty comments. I knew I had a choice to make: I could sit down and say nothing, or I could take a stand.” She did take a stand, and by doing so, propelled herself into Gamergate, the misogynistic conspiracy theory that ran riot through 4chan, its sister imageboard 8chan, Reddit, Twitter and other social media platforms. The blow-up began in 2014 when fellow video game developer Zoe Quinn became the target of hundreds of anonymous male trolls propagating the false claim that she had sought to advance her career by having an affair with a video game journalist. The conflagration spread like wildfire, engulfing several other women in and around the gaming world. The bedlam could not have come at a worse juncture for Wu, erupting just weeks after she had launched her first video game, Revolution 60. Wu believes that women are targeted by conspiracy theorists more frequently than men, and yet they’re rarely heard. “The cost of speaking out is so high for women, I understand why most decide not to. I’ve heard hundreds of times over the last few years women with children saying ‘I am afraid to speak up because I don’t want my children to be targeted’. That is an utterly rational position – many women are correctly scared to talk.” Wu was scared, too. Her frivolous internet meme ridiculing the male trolls of Gamergate triggered an assault that continues to this day. At its peak, a woman turned up at her alma mater, the University of Mississippi, impersonating her in an attempt to acquire her college records. Someone else surreptitiously took photos of her as she went about her daily business. Wu was unaware of it until she received anonymous texts with pictures of her in coffee shops, restaurants, at the movies. An accurate floor plan of her house was assembled and published online, along with her address and pictures of her car and license plate. And then there were the death threats – up to 300 by her estimate. One message on Twitter threatened to cut off her husband’s “tiny Asian penis”. The couple evacuated their house and took refuge with friends and in hotels. Wu now devotes her time to running for Congress from her home in Dedham, Massachusetts. She sees her candidacy as a way of pressing federal authorities to take the problem of online conspiracy theories and harassment seriously. “The FBI employs about 30,000 agents in the US. As best as I can tell there’s no division that is specifically tasked with prosecuting extreme threats online – it’s simply not a priority for them,” she says. Wu looks back on Gamergate and is torn over its legacy for her. On the positive side, “it did show me there’s a toughness and resilience inside myself, it gave me almost rhinoceros-thick skin.” Then she quickly corrects herself. “Let’s not glamorize abuse. I came to a conclusion that having to read every day about people wanting to rape or kill me did permanent damage.” In October 2016, a month before Trump was elected, James Alefantis hosted a party to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Comet Ping Pong, his Washington DC pizza restaurant. Within days, his establishment was under siege and he found himself at the center of the mother of all modern conspiracy theories: Pizzagate. Hillary Clinton, so the narrative went, was masterminding a global child-trafficking ring that was holding kids as sex slaves in his basement. The rumor-mongering began when private emails of John Podesta, Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, were stolen allegedly by Russian agents and released through WikiLeaks. In them, Podesta mentioned his brother Tony’s friend and their occasional cooking companion, Alefantis, as well as a fundraising dinner they were planning together at Comet Ping Pong. Soon, photos of Alefantis’ godchildren were being lifted from his Instagram page and repackaged to support claims of hideous pedophilia. Conspiracy theorists were arguing that “James Alefantis” was a bastardization of “j’aime les enfant” (I like children) and that cheese pizza, “cp” for short, was a code for child pornography. The heinous notion that Alefantis was a pedophile working with Hillary Clinton to abuse children in the basement of his restaurant (Comet Ping Pong has no basement) hurtled around the internet. Abusive messages were posted on the restaurant’s Facebook page and in Yelp reviews; one online critic claimed to have found a child’s hand in his pizza. But it was not until bigger beasts got involved that it became truly dangerous. Trump’s pick for national security adviser, retired army general Michael Flynn, fanned the flames by tweeting about Clinton’s “sex crimes w children”. Then up popped Alex Jones once more, telling his thousands of Infowars listeners that “something’s going on, something’s being covered up”, exhorting his devotees to “go investigate it for yourself”. So they did. The self-appointed “investigators” stepped out of the computer screen and began turning up at Comet Ping Pong. “There was this break into the physical world that began to happen,” Alefantis recalls. “People came into the restaurant to film or look around. They came by my house, asking neighbors questions. Suddenly you look around and you don’t know who to trust.” In December 2016, Edgar Welch answered Jones’s call to investigate the satanic child sex ring. He drove 350 miles from North Carolina and burst into Comet Ping Pong armed with three guns. He went table to table, terrifying customers and staff, then shot into a locked closet before giving himself up to police. Six months later, he was sentenced to four years and is still behind bars in Elkton federal prison in Lisbon, Ohio. Alefantis finds it impossible to talk about that day without tearing up. For a full year after the gunman’s appearance, armed guards were posted at both doors of the restaurant, which remains equipped with multiple security cameras and panic buttons. Alex Jones eventually apologized for promoting Pizzagate, and in August was barred from YouTube, Apple and Facebook and other leading social media platforms. Last week the streaming device Roku joined the ban having granted Jones and Infowars access to its content for less than one day. But for Alefantis this is too little too late. The damage has gone too deep. His extraordinary, petrifying ride has taught him a lot about the modern world. At one point, against the advice of friends, he reached out to some of his assailants and asked them why they hated him so much. “I communicated with them. I realized that they also live in fear. That there’s a sense of abandonment and powerlessness where young people online believe the government is conspiring against them or stealing their children which is outrageous but real for them. We have a lot of learning to do about who is disenfranchised in this country.” Through it all he has held on to positive thoughts, encouraged by the support of the community of pizza lovers that rallied around in his darkest hour. “It feels at times that things are out of control, that hate is on the rise. But I now understand the power of community. It saved this place. There’s no reason it can’t save the rest of the country, or the world.” This article was amended on 18 February 2019 to correct an interviewee’s pronoun preference.",2019-01-24 01:00:59,Trapped in a hoax: survivors of conspiracy theories speak out,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
196,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/accused-bank-shooters-ex-girlfriend-says-he-was-fascinated-by-idea-of-killing,"SEBRING, Fla. (AP) — A former prison guard trainee accused of fatally shooting five people inside  a Florida bank branch has long been fascinated with the idea of killing, but people who could have done something about it didn’t take his threats seriously, a woman who identified herself as his former girlfriend told a television station. Zephen Xaver, 21, “for some reason always hated people and wanted everybody to die,” Alex Gerlach told WSBT-TV in Indiana, shortly after Wednesday’s massacre in Sebring. “He got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he’s been threatening this for so long, and he’s been having dreams about it and everything.” “Every single person I’ve told has not taken it seriously, and it’s very unfortunate that it had to come to this,” Gerlach said. Gerlach told The Washington Post that Xaver said he purchased a gun last week and “no one thought anything of it” because he had always liked guns. Public records and neighbors say Xaver and his mother moved to Sebring in the fall from Plymouth, Indiana, a small city south of South Bend, home of the University of Notre Dame. Investigators said Xaver called police from inside the SunTrust Bank branch Wednesday, saying “I have shot five people.” Then he barricaded himself inside and when negotiations failed, the SWAT team burst in, capturing Xaver and discovering the bodies, police said. Investigators did not offer a possible motive, and a police spokesman said he did not know if the attack began as a robbery. The victims were not immediately identified. No one else was inside the bank. The bank sits between a hotel and a hair salon located in a business district of U.S. 27. The four-lane highway passes through farming communities and small towns as it connects South Florida and central Florida. Sebring, with 10,000 residents, is known internationally for its annual 12 Hours of Sebring endurance auto race that draws world-class drivers. “Today’s been a tragic day in our community,” Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said during a Wednesday news conference. “We’ve suffered significant loss at the hands of a senseless criminal doing a senseless crime.” He said more information would be released at a Thursday morning press conference. Witness Stefan Roehrig told WFLA in St. Petersburg that the SWAT team attached cables to the door handles but ended up pulling the handles off, so they drove the armored vehicle into the bank. They then led Xaver out in handcuffs. “The suspect, they slammed him pretty good I think and brought him out here,” he told the TV station. Florida Department of Corrections records show that Xaver was hired as a trainee prison guard at Avon Park Correctional Institution on Nov. 2 and resigned Jan. 9. No disciplinary issues were reported. Xaver lived in a non-descript pre-fabricated home about 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) from the bank. No one answered the door Wednesday night after police finished searching the home
John Larose, who lives next door, said Xaver kept to himself, but he could hear him playing and yelling at video games in the middle of the night. Xaver briefly was an online student of Salt Lake City-based Stevens-Henager College. A spokeswoman for the college, Sherrie Martin, confirmed that Xaver was enrolled from September 2018 until December, when he withdrew. Gov. Ron DeSantis was in the region for an infrastructure tour and traveled to Sebring after the shooting. He said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would assist Sebring police and the Highlands County sheriff’s office. “Obviously, this is an individual who needs to face very swift and exacting justice,” DeSantis said of the suspect. This was at least the fourth mass shooting in Florida with five or more dead in the last three years. A gunman killed 49 at an Orlando nightclub in 2016, five died at the Fort Lauderdale airport in 2017 and 17 died in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in a Fort Lauderdale suburb. SunTrust Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers released a statement saying the bank was “working with officials and dedicating ourselves to fully addressing the needs of all the individuals and families involved.” The bank’s “entire team mourns this terrible loss,” he said.

No one answered the door Wednesday night after police finished searching the home John Larose, who lives next door, said Xaver kept to himself, but he could hear him playing and yelling at video games in the middle of the night. Xaver briefly was an online student of Salt Lake City-based Stevens-Henager College. A spokeswoman for the college, Sherrie Martin, confirmed that Xaver was enrolled from September 2018 until December, when he withdrew. Gov. Ron DeSantis was in the region for an infrastructure tour and traveled to Sebring after the shooting. He said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would assist Sebring police and the Highlands County sheriff's office. ""Obviously, this is an individual who needs to face very swift and exacting justice,"" DeSantis said of the suspect. This was at least the fourth mass shooting in Florida with five or more dead in the last three years. A gunman killed 49 at an Orlando nightclub in 2016, five died at the Fort Lauderdale airport in 2017 and 17 died in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in a Fort Lauderdale suburb. SunTrust Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers released a statement saying the bank was ""working with officials and dedicating ourselves to fully addressing the needs of all the individuals and families involved."" The bank's ""entire team mourns this terrible loss,"" he said. AP reporter David Fischer in Miami contributed to this report.

Christopher Wayne Cleary from Denver, Colorado, was upset about the fact that all the girls he approached turned him down and he was consequently “still a virgin,” according to his Facebook post. He later deleted the post after receiving several threats from other people, the Denver Channel reported. “All I wanted was a girlfriend, not 1000 not a bunch of hoes not money none of that. All I wanted was to be loved, yet no one cares about me I'm 27 years old and I've never had a girlfriend before and I'm still a virgin,” Cleary wrote. “This is why I'm planning on shooting up a public place soon and being the next mass shooter cause I'm ready to die and all the girls the turned me down is going to make it right by killing as many girls as I see.” The message caught the attention of the Denver police department after it received calls about the post. After tracking the IP address of the computer the message was posted from — which was somewhere in Provo — Denver police contacted their counterparts in Provo. Cleary was tracked down at a McDonald's restaurant in the city after collective efforts by local law enforcement and FBI agents, and arrested citing probable cause. During the interview, Cleary told investigators he was quite upset and did not realize when he wrote the intimidating message and posted it on Facebook. He made suicidal comments while being interviewed, and said he had an impulse disorder. Police did not find any objectionable content in his phone during the investigation, according to a police report. A 27-year-old man from Colorado was arrested after he posted threatening message on Facebook to carry out a mass shooting.

He had come to Provo a day before and was staying in an Airbnb rental, and was already on probation in Jefferson County, Colorado, where he had been arrested for stalking and intimidating women, the Denver Channel reported, referring to court documents. Colorado police was planning to seek an extradition warrant for Cleary who was being held without bail into the Utah County Jail, Daily Herald reported. Before Cleary was arrested, law enforcement agencies in Colorado were on alert after receiving complaints about this post, since several Women's Marches — a march demanding equality and an end to violence against women — were happening in various locations across the nation, including in Provo.",2019-01-24 05:44:20,"Man Planned Mass Shooting Of Girls After Being Rejected Multiple Times, Arrested",,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

Customer Cynthia Watson and bank employee Marisol Lopez were among the victims, according to Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund. He said families of the other three people who died requested the names not be released. But the Associated Press reported late Thursday that two of the other victims were publicly identified by family members. They were 38-year-old Ana Pinon Willliams, a mother of seven, and 31-year-old Jessica Montague. Investigators had not determined why Zephen Xaver, 21, barricaded himself inside the bank branch Wednesday and opened fire. Xaver walked into the bank at 12:30 p.m., ""overtook the bank by force (and) shot everyone in the bank,"" Hoglund said. At 12:36 p.m., Xaver called 911 and told the dispatcher he had killed five people, Hoglund said. Police arrived four minutes later. After Xaver refused to allow officers into the bank, a SWAT team rushed in at 1:54 p.m., and Xaver surrendered, Hoglund said. The slayings did not appear to be part of a robbery, and Xaver had no apparent connection to the SunTrust branch or the victims. “We believe it was a random act,” Hoglund said Thursday at a news conference. “Aside from perhaps driving by and seeing it was a bank, we have no known evidence that he targeted this bank for any particular reason.” Sebring Mayor John Shoop said residents of the quiet, central Florida town of 10,000 were stunned by the tragedy. ""We have not changed, but our world has,"" Shoop said. ""This event will pass, but unfortunately, it will never be forgotten."" A judge ordered the former prison guard trainee held without bond on five counts of first-degree murder Thursday. Xaver was hired in November to work at the nearby Avon Park Correctional Institution but quit two weeks ago without explanation. Sharon Spillane, a neighbor of Xaver, said that she did not see him often but that he seemed normal. ""He was just quiet,"" she said. ""I am in shock. ... I never in a million years would have thought he would be that type of person. But he is."" Xaver relocated to Florida from Indiana. Alex Gerlach told WSBT-TV in Indiana she had an on-and-off relationship with Xaver for two years and had kept in contact every few months since. She said he often talked about wanting to hurt people. ""I never understood where it started,"" she told the station. ""For some reason, (he) always hated people and wanted everyone to die."" She said he bought a gun last week, but she and others had shrugged it off because he always liked firearms. “Every single person I’ve told has not taken it seriously, and it’s very unfortunate that it had to come to this,” Gerlach said. Start the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Families of the victims had the right to withhold their loved ones' names under Amendment 6, approved by voters in November, which broadens the rights of crime victims and their families. On Thursday, an Indiana police department released a 2014 report in which Xaver, then 16, said he had dreams of hurting other students in a classroom. The report from the Bremen Police Department said Bremen High School Principal Bruce Jennings contacted police on Feb. 20, 2014, after Xaver reported having the dream the previous night and again during a nap at school. The report said Xaver’s mother agreed to take him to a behavioral health center. Police took no further action. Authorities also released log entries of other incidents involving Xaver, including one in March 2017, when Michigan State Police advised that a girl was receiving messages from Xaver that indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged ""very swift and exacting justice."" He asked the public to keep the victims and families in their prayers. The shooting took place about 150 miles north of Parkland, where 17 students and teachers were killed in a 19-year-old gunman's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School less than one year ago. David Hogg, who survived that mass shooting, took notice on Twitter: ""Five people where killed today in Florida and our government continues to send their thoughts and prayers. #Enough"" The rampage marks the 19th mass shooting in 2019, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit organization that provides online public access to information about gun-related violence. The numbers include incidents in which four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooters, according to the archive.

Police identified two of the victims of the shooting at SunTrust Bank Wednesday in Sebring, Fla.: customer Cynthia Watson and SunTrust employee Marisol Lopez. Authorities said the identities of the other three were being withheld following requests from their families.

According to Hoglund, shortly after 12:30 p.m. Wednesday officers received a 911 call from Xaver, who told dispatchers he killed five people in the bank. Police negotiators, along with deputies from the Highlands County Sheriff’s Office and Sebring Police Department arrived to the scene, followed by SWAT team members. Hoglund said during crisis negotiations with Xaver, “it appeared he was not going to allow officers… access to the victims in the bank.” SWAT team members then entered the bank and took Xaver into custody. Xaver has been charged with five counts of premeditated murder. “We now begin the healing process,” Hoglund told reporters. “We attempt to make sense of a senseless act.” Write to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.",2019-01-24 12:30:15,"Florida Gunman Killed All 5 Women in Bank in ‘Random’ Mass Shooting, Police Say",,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

          / CBS/AP A former prison guard trainee accused of fatally shooting five people inside a Florida bank branch has long been fascinated with the idea of killing, but people who could have done something about it didn't take his threats seriously, a woman who identified herself as his former girlfriend told CBS affiliate WSBT-TV in Indiana. Zephen Xaver, 21, ""for some reason always hated people and wanted everybody to die,"" Alex Gerlach told the station, shortly after Wednesday's massacre in Sebring. ""He got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he's been threatening this for so long, and he's been having dreams about it and everything,"" Gerlach said. ""Every single person I've told has not taken it seriously, and it's very unfortunate that it had to come to this."" Xaver appeared in court Thursday morning wearing a black-and-white-striped jumpsuit. When a judge asked him if he had no dependents, income or assets, he responded, ""Yes, sir."" A public defender was appointed for Xaver. He was ordered held without bond on five counts of murder in the first degree. Gerlach told The Washington Post that Xaver said he purchased a gun last week and ""no one thought anything of it"" because he had always liked guns. Public records and neighbors said Xaver and his mother moved to Sebring in the fall from Plymouth, Indiana, a small city south of South Bend, home of the University of Notre Dame. Investigators said Xaver called police from inside the SunTrust Bank branch Wednesday, saying ""I have shot five people."" Then he barricaded himself inside and when negotiations failed, the SWAT team burst in, capturing Xaver and discovering the bodies, police said. Investigators did not offer a possible motive, and a police spokesman said he did not know if the attack began as a robbery. The victims were not immediately identified. No one else was inside the bank. The bank sits between a hotel and a hair salon located in a business district of U.S. 27. The four-lane highway passes through farming communities and small towns as it connects South Florida and central Florida. Sebring, with 10,000 residents, is known internationally for its annual 12 Hours of Sebring endurance auto race that draws world-class drivers. ""Today's been a tragic day in our community,"" Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said during a Wednesday news conference. ""We've suffered significant loss at the hands of a senseless criminal doing a senseless crime."" He said more information would be released at a Thursday morning press conference. Witness Stefan Roehrig told WFLA in St. Petersburg that the SWAT team attached cables to the door handles but ended up pulling the handles off, so they drove the armored vehicle into the bank. They then led Xaver out in handcuffs. ""The suspect, they slammed him pretty good I think and brought him out here,"" he told the TV station. Florida Department of Corrections records show that Xaver was hired as a trainee prison guard at Avon Park Correctional Institution on Nov. 2 and resigned Jan. 9. No disciplinary issues were reported. Xaver lived in a non-descript pre-fabricated home about 4 miles from the bank. No one answered the door Wednesday night after police finished searching the home.

Filed under: A California man has been charged with using Instagram to stalk the families of students who were killed during last year’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. Brandon Fleury confessed to taunting victims’ families and friends through multiple Instagram accounts, tagging them in posts and gloating about the students’ deaths. He’s accused of online harassment and intimidation as well as threatening to kidnap his targets. According to an affidavit uploaded by HuffPost, Fleury harassed Parkland victims’ families between late December and mid-January. FBI agents and police confronted him on January 16th, and Fleury allegedly admitted he’d made the posts to “troll” and “get reactions” from his targets. Law enforcement tied Fleury to several Instagram accounts. Several of them referenced Parkside shooter Nikolas Cruz, including “nikolas.killed.your.sister,” “nik.taunts_,” and “nikolasthemurderer.” Others referenced serial killer Ted Bundy and “movie villain” (and possibly Daredevil antagonist) Bullseye. Most of them impersonated Cruz, sending messages like “I killed your loved ones hahah” and “I killed your sister. It was fun. She had her whole life ahead of her and I fucking stole it from her. Hahaha.” Most of the posts were taunts rather than threats, but on Christmas Day, he threatened his targets through an account impersonating Ted Bundy. “l’m your abductor ... I’m kidnapping you fool,” he wrote, adding smiling and applauding emojis. “With the power of my AR-15, you all die,” he posted through a different account, referring to the gun used in the Parkland shooting. While the affidavit doesn’t name Fleury’s targets, they apparently included the brother, father, and best friend of Jaime Guttenberg, as well as the father of another student killed in the shooting. Fleury had apparently chosen people with large social media followings or ones involved in political activism, attempting to gain notoriety from the harassment. (Guttenberg’s father is a prominent gun control advocate.) The affidavit says that Fleury “did not show remorse for posting the comments but explained that he would not follow through on the threats he communicated.” Fleury described his actions as “some stupid shit’’ he’d done online, although when asked whether his kidnapping statement would feel threatening to targets, he admitted, “I guess so.” Fleury is described as 21 years old in news reports, and he made the threats from his home in Santa Ana, California, where he lives with his father and brother. As The Washington Post notes, it’s not clear what penalties he’s facing, but he’s scheduled to appear in court later this month. Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.

It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10. Will the network make changes around the episode? Here TheWrap recalls 12 other shows that have altered programming in the face of real-world violence.






40th Annual Academy Awards  
The awards show was originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, but was postponed two days out of respect for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  who was assassinated four days earlier. A number of attendees, including Sidney Poitier and Sammy Davis Jr., planned to attend the slain civil rights leader's funeral -- held on the same day as the original Oscars date -- and had said they wouldn't attend the awards show.

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Joss Whedon supernatural drama was affected not once but twice by real world events, specifically the Columbine massacre. The show's third season had two episodes that featured school violence. One, called ""Earshot,"" featured a plot concerning a student who goes to the top of a tower with a rifle. It was set to run a week after Columbine, but was pulled and postponed.
Wb





""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Season 3 finale ""Graduation Day, Part Two"" also featured violence on school grounds. Specifically (and spoilers for a nearly 20-year-old episode), the school is destroyed. Two hours before it was set to air, the WB postponed the episode, fearing fallout from Columbine. The finale's airing was delayed for two months, but fans were furious about the decision and the network ended up posting it online.
WB





53rd Annual Emmy Awards  
That year's Primetime Emmys were set to air on Sept. 16, 2001, but the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 caused it to be postponed. The awards were postponed a second time after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. The ceremony was eventually held in November, with Ellen Degeneres hosting, but it still marks the first and only time a major awards show had to be postponed twice.

""Friends""  
In the Season 8 episode ""The One Where Rachel Tells..."" a scene that originally had Chandler joking about a bomb in an airport -- leading to him and Monica getting detained -- was changed following Sept. 11. The scene was reshot with Monica complaining about another newlywed couple that got perks.

""Hannibal""  
The Bryan Fuller series about Hannibal Lecter never shied away from gore and viscera, but the show's fourth episode, ""Oeuf"" was pulled completely from the airwaves. The plot revolved around a woman who was brainwashing children to kill their families. While the episode was set to air in April 2013 -- four months after the Sandy Hook shooting -- NBC delayed airing it indefinitely due to the subject matter. The episode has never aired.
NBC





""Castle""  
""Castle"" made a small change following the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013 since the episode ""Still"" involves the team looking and trying to dismantle a time sensitive bomb. It was eventually switched with the next episode in the lineup, delaying its airing by one week.
ABC





""The Cosby Show""  
When the Bill Cosby sexual assault scandal hit a peak in 2015, many networks and people moved quickly to separate themselves from the comedian. This included TV Land, BET, Bounce TV and other networks refusing to air reruns of his sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" However, the real loss was from NBC, which decided to cancel plans to develop a new Cosby show.

""19 Kids and Counting""  
Josh Duggar, the eldest of the titular 19 kids, became the focus of a sexual molestation scandal. However, TLC took a few weeks to issue a decision on the reality show's fate. The network eventually decided to cancel the show.
TLC





""Mr. Robot""  
The Season 1 finale of USA Network's hacker thriller had to be postponed because it contained a scene similar to the events that occurred on the same day. In Roanoke, Va. on Aug. 26, 2015, a former reporter killed two of his colleagues live on air. The shooter died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In the ""Mr. Robot"" finale, somebody commits suicide during a broadcast. USA aired the episode the following week.
USA Network





""Documentary Now!""  
An episode of the IFC mockumentary series starring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen was also postponed due to the Roanoke shootings. ""Dronez: The Hunt for El Chingon,"" was about two journalists who decide to track a notorious drug kingpin despite safety concerns. The episode was replaced with ""Kunuk"" and aired it a week later.
IFC





""The Last Ship""  
The Season 3 premiere of ""The Last Ship"" was postponed following the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. The episode featured a shooting at a Vietnamese nightclub.
TNT





""Shooter""  
USA Network shelved the 2017 series premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-led sniper series ""Shooter"" for a number of months following a mass shooting in Dallas, Texas, which saw 12 police officers and two civilians shot by a sniper during an otherwise peaceful protest.

""Heathers"" 
The Paramount Network delayed the launch of its 2018 sitcom based on the 1998 high school-set dark comedy ""out of respect"" for the victims of the deadly mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The original film featured multiple high schoolers killing themselves and each other.
Paramount Network





""Alternatino with Arturo Castro""
The Comedy Central sketch show's seventh episode featured a sketch about mass shootings, and was pulled after a gunman killed three people at a garlic festival in Northern California two days before it was scheduled to air. In the sketch, Castro played a Guatemalan immigrant who is confused by the prevalence of gun violence in the United States. The network originally planned to play the episode one week later, on August 6, but after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio killed 30 people on August 3 and 4, it is possible that the episode will be postponed again.

Specifically (and spoilers for a nearly 20-year-old episode), the school is destroyed. Two hours before it was set to air, the WB postponed the episode, fearing fallout from Columbine. The finale's airing was delayed for two months, but fans were furious about the decision and the network ended up posting it online. 53rd Annual Emmy Awards That year's Primetime Emmys were set to air on Sept. 16, 2001, but the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 caused it to be postponed. The awards were postponed a second time after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. The ceremony was eventually held in November, with Ellen Degeneres hosting, but it still marks the first and only time a major awards show had to be postponed twice. ""Friends"" In the Season 8 episode ""The One Where Rachel Tells..."" a scene that originally had Chandler joking about a bomb in an airport -- leading to him and Monica getting detained -- was changed following Sept. 11. The scene was reshot with Monica complaining about another newlywed couple that got perks. ""Hannibal"" The Bryan Fuller series about Hannibal Lecter never shied away from gore and viscera, but the show's fourth episode, ""Oeuf"" was pulled completely from the airwaves. The plot revolved around a woman who was brainwashing children to kill their families. While the episode was set to air in April 2013 -- four months after the Sandy Hook shooting -- NBC delayed airing it indefinitely due to the subject matter. The episode has never aired. ""Castle"" ""Castle"" made a small change following the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013 since the episode ""Still"" involves the team looking and trying to dismantle a time sensitive bomb. It was eventually switched with the next episode in the lineup, delaying its airing by one week. ""The Cosby Show"" When the Bill Cosby sexual assault scandal hit a peak in 2015, many networks and people moved quickly to separate themselves from the comedian. This included TV Land, BET, Bounce TV and other networks refusing to air reruns of his sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" However, the real loss was from NBC, which decided to cancel plans to develop a new Cosby show. ""19 Kids and Counting"" Josh Duggar, the eldest of the titular 19 kids, became the focus of a sexual molestation scandal. However, TLC took a few weeks to issue a decision on the reality show's fate. The network eventually decided to cancel the show. ""Mr. Robot"" The Season 1 finale of USA Network's hacker thriller had to be postponed because it contained a scene similar to the events that occurred on the same day. In Roanoke, Va. on Aug. 26, 2015, a former reporter killed two of his colleagues live on air. The shooter died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In the ""Mr. Robot"" finale, somebody commits suicide during a broadcast. USA aired the episode the following week. ""Documentary Now!"" An episode of the IFC mockumentary series starring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen was also postponed due to the Roanoke shootings. ""Dronez: The Hunt for El Chingon,"" was about two journalists who decide to track a notorious drug kingpin despite safety concerns. The episode was replaced with ""Kunuk"" and aired it a week later. ""The Last Ship"" The Season 3 premiere of ""The Last Ship"" was postponed following the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. The episode featured a shooting at a Vietnamese nightclub. ""Shooter"" USA Network shelved the 2017 series premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-led sniper series ""Shooter"" for a number of months following a mass shooting in Dallas, Texas, which saw 12 police officers and two civilians shot by a sniper during an otherwise peaceful protest.

Next Week’s ‘American Horror Story’ Opens With Mass Shooting, FX Silent on Plans ""Heathers"" The Paramount Network delayed the launch of its 2018 sitcom based on the 1998 high school-set dark comedy ""out of respect"" for the victims of the deadly mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The original film featured multiple high schoolers killing themselves and each other. ""Alternatino with Arturo Castro"" The Comedy Central sketch show's seventh episode featured a sketch about mass shootings, and was pulled after a gunman killed three people at a garlic festival in Northern California two days before it was scheduled to air. In the sketch, Castro played a Guatemalan immigrant who is confused by the prevalence of gun violence in the United States. The network originally planned to play the episode one week later, on August 6, but after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio killed 30 people on August 3 and 4, it is possible that the episode will be postponed again. ""Alternatino with Arturo Castro"" is the latest show impacted by stories on the news. It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10.

209,https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/01/24/professor-nazi-salute,"By Associated Press   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A community college fired a business professor Thursday accused of comparing education officials to Nazis by shouting in German and giving a Nazi salute for more than 10 minutes at a faculty and administrators’ meeting. Paul Broadie II, president of Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, announced the firing of Charles Meyrick, saying a school investigation determined the assistant professor committed ‘‘serious misconduct.’’ Officials said the Nov. 2 disruptions at Manchester Community College, where faculty and administrators of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system were meeting about school consolidation, were part of ‘‘increasingly alarming behavior’’ by Meyrick, including his being disruptive at prior meetings.   ‘‘Mr. Meyrick’s actions took place just days after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and triggered several participants to exit the facility out of fear for their safety,’’ said Mark Ojakian, president of the colleges and universities system. ‘‘Our state colleges and universities aim to foster a welcoming learning environment, and these threatening actions go far beyond acceptable discourse.’’ Messages seeking comment were left for Meyrick on Thursday. According to the school investigation report , Meyrick acknowledged he shouted ‘‘sieg heil,’’ a German phrase for ‘‘hail victory’’ noted for its use at Nazi rallies, and gave a Nazi salute from his seat in the crowd in the auditorium, as a way to show the meeting’s leaders that their effort to silence his dissent was ‘‘tyrannical and wrong.’’   Meyrick and a college system official got into an argument about consolidating curriculum, and the official asked Meyrick to leave because of his disruptive behavior, including his calling the official a liar, the report said. Meyrick saw the request to leave as officials trying to stop him from expressing his opinion, the report said. Police said they were called to the auditorium and after the meeting asked Meyrick to leave campus. Meyrick responded by asking, ‘‘What if I don’t?’’ and a lieutenant told him he’d be arrested, police said. Two officers then escorted him from campus without incident. Investigators said Meyrick told them he characterized the salute and Nazi statement as ‘‘miscalculations.’’ Asked why he kept his hand up so long, Meyrick said he began questioning his own behavior and needed time to contemplate how to get out of the situation. He put his hand down when the official he had argued with asked him if he had a question, the report said.   Meyrick began teaching at the community college in 2009 after working in finance for IBM for 34 years, according to his biography on the school’s website.  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

Customer Cynthia Watson and bank employee Marisol Lopez were among the victims, according to Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund. He said families of the other three people who died requested the names not be released. But the Associated Press reported late Thursday that two of the other victims were publicly identified by family members. They were 38-year-old Ana Pinon Willliams, a mother of seven, and 31-year-old Jessica Montague. Investigators had not determined why Zephen Xaver, 21, barricaded himself inside the bank branch Wednesday and opened fire. Xaver walked into the bank at 12:30 p.m., ""overtook the bank by force (and) shot everyone in the bank,"" Hoglund said. At 12:36 p.m., Xaver called 911 and told the dispatcher he had killed five people, Hoglund said. Police arrived four minutes later. After Xaver refused to allow officers into the bank, a SWAT team rushed in at 1:54 p.m., and Xaver surrendered, Hoglund said. The slayings did not appear to be part of a robbery, and Xaver had no apparent connection to the SunTrust branch or the victims. “We believe it was a random act,” Hoglund said Thursday at a news conference. “Aside from perhaps driving by and seeing it was a bank, we have no known evidence that he targeted this bank for any particular reason.” Sebring Mayor John Shoop said residents of the quiet, central Florida town of 10,000 were stunned by the tragedy. ""We have not changed, but our world has,"" Shoop said. ""This event will pass, but unfortunately, it will never be forgotten."" A judge ordered the former prison guard trainee held without bond on five counts of first-degree murder Thursday. Xaver was hired in November to work at the nearby Avon Park Correctional Institution but quit two weeks ago without explanation. Sharon Spillane, a neighbor of Xaver, said that she did not see him often but that he seemed normal. ""He was just quiet,"" she said. ""I am in shock. ... I never in a million years would have thought he would be that type of person. But he is."" Xaver relocated to Florida from Indiana. Alex Gerlach told WSBT-TV in Indiana she had an on-and-off relationship with Xaver for two years and had kept in contact every few months since. She said he often talked about wanting to hurt people. ""I never understood where it started,"" she told the station. ""For some reason, (he) always hated people and wanted everyone to die."" She said he bought a gun last week, but she and others had shrugged it off because he always liked firearms. “Every single person I’ve told has not taken it seriously, and it’s very unfortunate that it had to come to this,” Gerlach said. Start the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Families of the victims had the right to withhold their loved ones' names under Amendment 6, approved by voters in November, which broadens the rights of crime victims and their families. On Thursday, an Indiana police department released a 2014 report in which Xaver, then 16, said he had dreams of hurting other students in a classroom. The report from the Bremen Police Department said Bremen High School Principal Bruce Jennings contacted police on Feb. 20, 2014, after Xaver reported having the dream the previous night and again during a nap at school. The report said Xaver’s mother agreed to take him to a behavioral health center. Police took no further action. Authorities also released log entries of other incidents involving Xaver, including one in March 2017, when Michigan State Police advised that a girl was receiving messages from Xaver that indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged ""very swift and exacting justice."" He asked the public to keep the victims and families in their prayers. The shooting took place about 150 miles north of Parkland, where 17 students and teachers were killed in a 19-year-old gunman's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School less than one year ago. David Hogg, who survived that mass shooting, took notice on Twitter: ""Five people where killed today in Florida and our government continues to send their thoughts and prayers. #Enough"" The rampage marks the 19th mass shooting in 2019, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit organization that provides online public access to information about gun-related violence. The numbers include incidents in which four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooters, according to the archive.

See Offers  Zephen Xaver slaughtered 5 women with whom he apparently had no connection, police say. SEBRING, Fla. — The man accused of fatally shooting five women at a small-town bank in Florida had dreamed of hurting classmates in high school and had long been fascinated with killing, police and a former girlfriend said Thursday. The slayings did not appear to be part of a robbery, and Zephen Xaver had no apparent connection to the SunTrust branch or the four employees and one customer who were killed Wednesday, police said. “We believe it was a random act,” Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said Thursday at a news conference. “Aside from perhaps driving by and seeing it was a bank, we have no known evidence that he targeted this bank for any particular reason.” If the gunman had driven 10 seconds farther, just one more driveway, the victims might have been Carol Davis, who manages a hair salon and spa, and her staff and customers. “He could have come here. He could have gone anywhere. It could happen anywhere,” Davis said. Xaver, 21, was charged Thursday with five counts of premeditated murder. Just months ago, he moved from northern Indiana to Sebring, about 80 miles southeast of Tampa. He had recently quit his job as a prison guard trainee. From police and witness accounts, he entered the bank about 12:30 p.m. when the five women were alone. The bank stands apart along U.S. 27, a busy four-lane highway in Sebring, a tourist and retirement city of 10,000 known for an annual endurance auto race that draws some of the world’s top drivers. Police say Zephen Xaver opened fire inside a Florida bank Wednesday, killing five people before surrendering to a SWAT team. The victims were found lying face down, their bodies surrounded by shell casings, according to court documents. Six minutes after the attack began, Xaver called 911 and told dispatchers that he had killed everyone inside, Hoglund said. Davis said she looked out her window and saw police officers everywhere, many carrying rifles. “I have never seen stuff like that except in the movies.” Xaver refused to surrender and would not allow officers to reach the victims, Hoglund said. After more than an hour of negotiations, a SWAT team used an armored vehicle to break through the front doors. Xaver was found in a back office, and all the victims were dead, the chief said. On Thursday, an Indiana police department released a 2014 report in which Xaver, then 16, said he had dreams of hurting other students in a classroom. The report from the Bremen Police Department said Bremen High School Principal Bruce Jennings contacted police on Feb. 20, 2014, after Xaver reported having the dream the previous night and again during a nap at school. The report said Xaver’s mother agreed to take him to a behavioral health center. Police took no further action. Authorities also released log entries of other incidents involving Xaver, including one in March 2017, when Michigan State Police advised that a girl was receiving messages from Xaver that indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.” Alex Gerlach, who identified herself as Xaver’s former girlfriend, said he’s long been fascinated with the idea of killing, but no one took her warnings about him seriously. For some reason, he “always hated people and wanted everybody to die,” Gerlach told WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana, near his former home in Plymouth, Indiana. An SUV is parked outside the damaged SunTrust bank early Thursday in Sebring, Fla. “He got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he’s been threatening this for so long, and he’s been having dreams about it and everything,” she said. “Every single person I’ve told has not taken it seriously, and it’s very unfortunate that it had to come to this.” Gerlach told The Washington Post that Xaver said he purchased a gun last week and “no one thought anything of it” because he had always liked guns. Xaver had no apparent criminal record in the areas where he’s lived in Indiana and Florida. Police identified three of the victims: customer Cynthia Watson, 65, and two bank employees: 55-year-old Marisol Lopez and 38-year-old Ana Pinon Willliams, a mother of seven. Tim Williams said his sister-in-law was a devout Christian “and family to everyone she knew.” She had recently started working at the bank, and she quickly came to love the job and her co-workers, he said. “We do not know what was going on in the mind of the individual who committed this atrocious act, but we do know he was influenced by the darkness in this world,” Williams said. “We will not try to understand the darkness, but with God’s help we will overcome it.” Lopez’s family posted a note on their door asking not to be disturbed. The Associated Press could find no contact information for Watson’s family. A fourth victim was identified when her husband spoke with NBC News. Maine Montague said he and his wife, 31-year-old Jessica Montague, had a 3-year-old child. In compliance with a newly passed victims’ rights law in Florida, police withheld the name of the fifth victim at the family’s request. Xaver was arrested in a beige T-shirt depicting the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. On Thursday, he wore a black-and-white striped prison uniform as he was appointed a public defender and ordered held without bond. His father said he’s “heartbroken for the victims” and that his son “wasn’t raised to be like this.” “He’s always been a good kid. He’s had his troubles, but he has never hurt anyone ever before. This is a total shock,” Josh Xaver told CNN. The AP sought interviews with both of Xaver’s parents but received no immediate response. Comments are not available on this story.

Ana Piñon-Williams was working at the bank on Wednesday when 21-year-old Zephen Xaver allegedly walked in and shot everyone he found inside. “We will never forget Ana,” Piñon-Williams’ brother-in-law Tim Williams said on behalf of their family during a news conference Thursday, WPTV reported. “She will forever live in our hearts and minds,” Williams said. Williams explained in the news conference that his sister-in-law was married to his brother and was a loving and compassionate person. He said Piñon-Williams loved her job and her coworkers. “Her life was truly a light in this world, she made it a better place,” Williams continued. “We are determined to let Ana’s memory be marked by the life she lived, the people she loved, and the difference she made.” “We do not know what was going on in the mind of the individual who committed this atrocious act, but we know he was influenced by the darkness in this world,” Williams said in the news conference. “We will not try to understand the darkness, but with God’s help we will overcome it,” Williams added.

Upon entering, Xaver allegedly took over the branch with force and opened fire on all five people inside. He then allegedly called 911 and “told dispatchers that he’d killed everyone in the bank,” Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said at a press conference Thursday. Minutes later, first responders arrived on the scene and made contact with Xaver inside. He was allegedly holding the victims hostage and would not let authorities in to give them necessary medical attention, said Hoglund. After several failed attempts to convince Xaver to let the women go, authorities sent a SWAT team in and Xaver surrendered but it was too late for the victims, who succumbed to their injuries before police entered, an emotional Hoglund said Thursday.

The names of two other victims were also released: Cynthia Watson, 65 and Marisol Lopez, 55. Watson was a customer in the bank while Lopez was an employee. RELATED: All 5 Victims of Fla.

He had moved from Indiana to Florida last fall and up until earlier this month, was training to be a prison guard with the Florida Department of Corrections.

Paul Broadie II, president of Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, on Thursday announced the firing of Charles Meyrick, saying a school investigation determined the assistant professor committed “serious misconduct.” Officials said the Nov. 2 disruptions at Manchester Community College, where faculty and administrators of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system were meeting about school consolidation, were part of “increasingly alarming behavior” by Meyrick, including his being disruptive at prior meetings. “Mr. Meyrick’s actions took place just days after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and triggered several participants to exit the facility out of fear for their safety,” said Mark Ojakian, president of the colleges and universities system. “Our state colleges and universities aim to foster a welcoming learning environment, and these threatening actions go far beyond acceptable discourse.” Messages seeking comment were left for Meyrick on Thursday. According to the school investigation report , Meyrick acknowledged he shouted “Sieg heil,” a German phrase for “Hail victory” noted for its use at Nazi rallies, and gave a Nazi salute from his seat in the crowd in the auditorium, as a way to show the meeting’s leaders that their effort to silence his dissent was “tyrannical and wrong.” Meyrick and a college system official got into an argument about consolidating curriculum, and the official asked Meyrick to leave because of his disruptive behavior, including his calling the official a liar, the report said. Meyrick saw the request to leave as officials trying to stop him from expressing his opinion, the report said. Police said they were called to the auditorium and after the meeting asked Meyrick to leave campus. Meyrick responded by asking, “What if I don’t?” and a lieutenant told him he’d be arrested, police said. Two officers then escorted him from campus without incident. Investigators said Meyrick told them he characterized the salute and Nazi statement as “miscalculations.” Asked why he kept his hand up so long, Meyrick said he began questioning his own behavior and needed time to contemplate how to get out of the situation. He put his hand down when the official he had argued with asked him if he had a question, the report said. Meyrick also told investigators he was willing to apologize and did not mean any harm.

Xaver has been charged with five counts of premeditated murder after opening fire at a SunTrust bank in Sebring, Florida. While police believe the crime was a “random act,” according to ex-girlfriend Alex Garlach, Xaver had long-fantasized about killing people. PBS reports: The shootings were not a shock to Alex Gerlach, who identified herself as Xaver’s former girlfriend. She said he’s long been fascinated with the idea of killing, but no one took her warnings about him seriously. For some reason, he “always hated people and wanted everybody to die,” Gerlach told WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana. “He got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he’s been threatening this for so long, and he’s been having dreams about it and everything,” she said. “Every single person I’ve told has not taken it seriously, and it’s very unfortunate that it had to come to this.” According to a 2014 police report from an Indiana police department, in 2014 Bremen High School Principal Bruce Jennings contacted police after Xaver reported having two dreams about hurting his classmates. The AP notes that, according to the report, “his mother agreed to take him to a behavioral health center and police took no further action.” More from the police, per the AP: Authorities also released log entries of other incidents involving Xaver, including one in March 2017, when Michigan State Police advised that a girl was receiving messages from Xaver that indicated he was “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.” “We believe it was a random act,” Police Chief Karl Hoglund told reporters on Thursday. “Aside from perhaps driving by and seeing it was a bank, we have no known evidence that he targeted this bank for any particular reason.” According to PBS, this was “at least the fourth mass shooting in Florida with five or more dead in the past three years.” In November, a far-right extremist with a history of assaulting women shot six people at a yoga studio in Tallahassee. In 2018, A gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and in 2016, a man fatally shot 49 people at an Orlando night club. One thing about Xaver’s crime that doesn’t seem random, however: it falls in line with the broader pattern of mass shootings in America, a majority of which are perpetrated by white men and enabled by an alarmingly easy access to guns. wait - i was reading on Reddit last night (so, take it for what you will) that the 5 victims were all women who had been found in the lobby laying face down and all shot execution style. doesn’t sound random to me - sounds like he wanted to kill women. the location may have been random, not the gender of his victims. but again - i read it on Reddit and have not verified the claims.",2019-01-25 13:30:00,Florida Gunman's Ex-Girfriend: He 'Always Hated People and Wanted Everyone to Die',,6154,http://jezebel.com

U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren sentenced Patrick Stein, the alleged ringleader, to 30 years in prison and Curtis Allen, who drafted a manifesto for the group, to 25 years. Gavin Wright, who authorities said helped make and test explosives at his mobile home business, received 26 years. The plot was foiled after another militia member alerted authorities. Melgren dismissed defense attorneys' request that he take into the account the divisive political atmosphere in which the men formed their plot to blow up a mosque and apartments housing Somali immigrants in the meatpacking town Garden City, about 220 miles west of Wichita, on the day after the 2016 election. ""We have extremely divisive elections because our system is to resolve those through elections and not violence,"" Melgren said. Stein's attorneys have argued that he believed then-President Barack Obama would declare martial law and not recognize the validity of the election if Donald Trump won, forcing militias to step in. Stein's attorneys noted that during the 2016 campaign, all three men read and shared Russian propaganda on their Facebook feed designed to sow discord in the U.S. political system. Attorney Jim Pratt told the judge that for years Stein had immersed himself in right-wing media and commentators, who normalized hate. But Melgren was openly skeptical, telling Pratt: ""Millions of people listen to this stuff — whether it comes from the left or the right."" Prosecutors presented video testimony from some Somali immigrants who were the targets of the bombing. In one clip, Ifrah Farah pleaded: ""Please don't kill us. Please don't hate us. We can't hurt you."" Allen, 51, choked up as he addressed the judge, prompting his attorney to step in and finish reading a prepared statement in which Allen offered ""my sincere apologies"" to anyone who was frightened and asked for their forgiveness. But Stein, 49, apologized only to his family and friends, and the judge noted when sentencing him that, unlike Allen, he had shown no remorse. Wright, 53, apologized to the court, saying the plot is ""not who I am."" He also apologized to the immigrants who lived at the apartment complex. The judge later said Wright's courtroom statement showed he was still in denial about what he did, adding and he did not buy that there was any remorse on Wright's part. Melgren sentenced Stein to 30 years for conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and 10 years for conspiracy against civil rights. He sentenced Allen and Wright to 25 years for conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and 10 years for conspiracy against civil rights. Those sentences will run concurrently. Wright also got an additional year to be served consecutively for lying to law enforcement, bringing his total sentence to 26 years. The judge told all three men that the planned attack was worse than the Oklahoma City bombing because the Garden City plot was motivated by hatreds of race, religion and national origin. The Kansas plot was thwarted when militia member Dan Day tipped off authorities to escalating threats of violence. He testified at the men's trial last year that Stein started recruiting others to kill Muslim immigrants after the June 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Recordings that prosecutors played for jurors last April portrayed a damning picture of a splinter group of the militia Kansas Security Force that came to be known as ""the Crusaders."" Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker in a news release called the sentences ""a significant victory against hate crimes and domestic terrorism."" ""These defendants planned to ruthlessly bomb an apartment complex and kill innocent people, simply because of who they are and how they worship,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said. The sentencing hearings for the men came a day after two members of an Illinois militia known as the White Rabbits pleaded guilty in the 2017 bombing of a Minnesota mosque , admitting they hoped the attack would scare Muslims into leaving the U.S. No one was injured in that attack. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2019-01-25 16:28:47,Militia member involved in foiled plot to kill Muslims sentenced to 25 years,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

229,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/las-vegas-shooting-guns-donation.html,"Advertisement Supported by By Serge F. Kovaleski A San Francisco software executive has donated more than $62,000 to try to ensure that the cache of firearms that was owned by the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre will be destroyed. In the aftermath of the 2017 shooting, loved ones of the 58 people who lost their lives in the rampage faced a difficult choice over what to do with the 50 guns and accessories that were owned by the gunman, Stephen Paddock. They could possibly sell the weapons to raise money or have the guns destroyed in a symbolic renunciation of violence. Now the families don’t have to worry about making that decision — the donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, has stepped in to cover the funds. His only condition is that the guns are destroyed. The collection of firearms and equipment was valued at $62,340 in a recent inventory of Mr. Paddock’s nearly $1.4 million estate by a court-appointed special administrator. As Mr. Paddock died without a will, his mother, under Nevada law, became the heir to his assets, which she agreed to give to the families of the dead victims last March. After reading a New York Times article about the families’ gun dilemma that was published earlier this month, the California businessman decided to write a check to the families for $62,500. He contacted a reporter at The Times so that he could get in touch with the lawyer for the special administrator of the estate. “It was tugging at my heart strings and it seemed like a horrific situation for the families to deal with this choice,” he said in an interview. “I wanted to alleviate some of the pain or at least not allow it to get worse.” The executive said that he wants the donation to be anonymous because the focus should be on the families. “No credit in the face of pain,” he said. “This was about heartbreak and wanting to help.” He said he made the donation conditional on the destruction of the firearms — which range from pistols to high-powered long arms — to ensure they do not end up back in circulation. “I think the families would feel better if the weapons are gone,” he said. Alice Denton, the lawyer for the special administrator of the estate, said the F.B.I., which is in possession of the firearms, had given a verbal commitment that it would destroy the weapons if it received a court order to do so. She said that she would seek such an order next month from the Las Vegas judge overseeing the estate case. In the meantime, no action to destroy the guns would be taken. A spokeswoman for the F.B.I.’s Las Vegas field office said the bureau was unable to comment. The executive — who said he favors stronger gun control but does not consider himself “an anti-gun activist” — said if it turns out that the F.B.I. will not destroy the firearms, he would try to find another way to have it done. Ms. Denton said that she received the check last week and was delighted about the donor’s generosity. “We are so grateful,” she said. “It shows the compassion that total strangers can have for victims of horrendous crimes, and that, in the face of such evil, there are good people.” Mynda Smith, whose sister was killed in the attack, said the donor’s gesture and his desire to see the guns destroyed would help relatives like her deal with their sorrow. “His desire to alleviate any more emotional pain for the families of the 58, and all survivors really, is what makes it a beautiful thing,” Ms. Smith said. “Closing this door in this way is the perfect gift for us.” Ms. Denton said the check has been deposited in her trust account and that it would be transferred to the estate once the guns are destroyed. Nearly half of the guns in question — 23 rifles and a revolver — were found in the gunman’s upper-floor room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, according to the estate inventory. It was from that perch at the hotel that he opened fire on an outdoor country music festival. Not only were dozens of people slaughtered, hundreds of others were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The rest of the gunman’s firearms were in his two Nevada homes. At his house in Mesquite, seven rifles, seven shotguns and five handguns were collected. The estate recently sold that property to an Oregon couple for $425,000. And two shotguns and five handguns were found at the gunman’s Reno home, which is still listed on the market for $374,900. Lawyers for some of the victims have said that distributing the money to only the loved ones of the dead meant that it could have a far greater impact on their lives than if the large number of people hurt in the attack were also beneficiaries. If the gunman’s estate were to be divided up equally, each of the 58 families would receive about $24,000 — with the firearms accounting for close to $1,100 per family. The estate also includes an investment property worth a little more than $90,000 and bank and brokerage accounts totaling $455,758. One family, who intends to sue the manufacturers of the guns used in the shooting, would like to see those weapons kept in tact rather than destroyed. Through a lawyer, the family of Carrie Parsons, who was killed in the attack, has reached out to Ms. Denton. “What we are saying is ‘Please don’t destroy these, they are evidence,” said one of the family’s lawyers, Rick Friedman, who added that he had not yet been able to identify those firearms. “Destroying guns he did not use, I have no problem with,” Mr. Friedman said. The anonymous executive said that he would not want to stand in the way of a legal action like this. “If there is a delay in destroying some of the guns for legal reasons, I am O.K. with that,” he said. “I just don’t want them back on the streets.” Advertisement",2019-01-25 22:04:02,"Anonymous Donor Gives $62,000 to Destroy Las Vegas Gunman’s Weapons",,1,http://nytimes.com
230,https://www.dailynews.com/2019/01/25/friend-who-supplied-rifles-to-san-bernardino-terrorists-wants-to-withdraw-guilty-plea/,"Trending: The man who supplied the weapons used to kill 14 people and wound 23 others in the December 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack told a federal judge Friday, Jan. 25, that he wishes to withdraw admissions he made under a plea agreement two years ago, potentially setting the stage for a trial. Riverside resident Enrique Marquez Jr., 27, pleaded guilty in February 2017 to one count each of providing material support to terrorists and making false statements in the acquisition of firearms. In exchange for his admissions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office dropped related charges of marriage fraud, immigration visa fraud and lying on a federal document. Marquez appeared with his attorney, John Aquilina, at the U.S. District Court in downtown Riverside, and during the status hearing, Aquilina told Judge Jesus Bernal that the defense will seek to have the plea agreement voided. Aquilina told City News Service the reasons for the proposed action will be established in a motion he will submit to the court in May. Federal prosecutors are expected to challenge the motion. Marquez is being held without bail in a federal detention center in Los Angeles. Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said Friday that his agency had no immediate comment on Marquez’s request. He said Bernal told the defense that it must submit its motion by May 13. After that, the government will respond, and a hearing on the motion will be held. Mrozek said he could not comment on whether prosecutors would attempt to reinstate the dropped charges until after Bernal holds that hearing. Marquez had been slated for sentencing on multiple dates in 2017 and 2018. However, after changing attorneys, his sentencing was tabled last summer for an indeterminate period. “This defendant collaborated with and purchased weapons for a man who carried out the devastating December 2, 2015, terrorist attack that took the lives of 14 innocent people, wounded nearly two dozen and impacted our entire nation,” then-U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said in February 2017. “While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center.” Ryan Reyes-Kaufman, who was engaged to be married before boyfriend Larry Daniel Kaufman was killed in the attack, said Friday that he was extremely upset that victims and survivors might have to sit through a trial after believing the case was wrapped up except for the sentencing. “We are already all dealing with this and now we are going to have to relive it all over again,” Reyes-Kaufman said. “Especially since it’s three years later; it’s ridiculous. We are trying to get on with our lives and it seems like our system is fighting against us.” Specifically, Reyes-Kaufman blamed Bernal. “This judge allowed him to do so many extensions on his sentencing because they needed quote-unquote more time to prepare for the sentencing. That opened up the whole thing to where he was able to get rid of one attorney and get a new attorney who said ‘Let’s get rid of this guilty plea,’ ” he said. Arlen Verdehyou’s wife, Bennetta Betbadal, died in the shooting. He said he understands that Marquez has a right to withdraw his plea until his sentencing. “I was looking forward to it finishing up after three years of court, going back and forth, but if that’s what his decision is, you have to accept it and deal with it.” According to prosecutors, Marquez was a close associate of 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook, who teamed with his wife, 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, to perpetrate the rampage at the IRC during an employee Christmas party. The pair had pledged loyalty to ISIS. Farook and Malik, residents of Redlands, died a few hours later in a gunbattle with police. Marquez stated on a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form that he was the actual buyer of the two high-capacity semiautomatic rifles with which Farook and Malik armed themselves. But those weapons were actually purchased for Farook, prosecutors say. Marquez, 27, had moved to Riverside and met Farook, his next-door neighbor, in 2005. Both attended La Sierra High. Under the future jihadi terrorist’s sway, Marquez converted to Islam, after which he adopted a radical philosophy, and by late 2011, the two were preparing to commit terrorist attacks, according to court papers. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said that Marquez admitted making plans with Farook to commit mass murder at the library or cafeteria of Riverside City College. The men also schemed to go on a killing spree along the eastbound 91 Freeway in Riverside during afternoon rush-hour, identifying a particular section of roadway that had no exits, according to the FBI. The defendant backed out of the terrorist plots in November 2012, after the arrests of four Inland Empire men who were gearing up to join the Taliban in Afghanistan. All four were eventually convicted and sentenced to between 10 and 25 years in prison. Marquez also engaged in a sham marriage with a Russian immigrant, who is the sister-in-law of 33-year-old Syed Raheel Farook, the terrorist’s elder sibling. Mariya Chernykh, 28, and Marquez went all-out to make their fake nuptials appear legitimate, taking staged family photos, creating a joint checking account and a back-dated lease that implied they shared a marital residence, enabling her to remain in the country and collect benefits, according to court papers. Marquez and Chernykh signed immigration documents, under penalty of perjury, falsely stating that they both lived at the same Riverside address, prosecutors said. However, Chernykh eventually moved in with another man in Ontario, while Marquez received money from her as part of the arrangement. Chernykh ultimately admitted charges of conspiracy, perjury and making false statements to federal officials. She’s free on bond and is slated to be sentenced on May 20. In a separate plea agreement, Syed Raheel Farook admitted a conspiracy charge. He’s also free on bond and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 25. His wife, 34-year-old Tatiana Farook, Chernykh’s sister, admitted a conspiracy count, as well, and is set for sentencing on April 15. Farook and his wife are each facing five years behind bars. Chernykh is facing up to 20 years. However, none are expected to receive the maximum sentences. Mrozek, the government spokesman, said he couldn’t speak Friday to how Marquez’s attempt to withdraw his plea could affect the sentencings of the Farooks and Chernykh. It’s also unclear how this would affect the resolution of the case of Rafia Farook, who is attempting to collect on son Rizwan Farook’s life insurance policy. The government is trying to seize that money, calling it the fruit of the terrorist attack. Get the latest news delivered daily!

Dakota Theriot is suspected in two shootings: three people were killed in Livingston Parish, which is south of Baton Rouge, and two died in the nearby Ascension Parish, police said. Theriot has been charged with two counts first-degree murder, illegal use of weapons and home invasion, according to a statement from the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office. In a press conference held on Saturday, Sheriff Bobby Webre said that police received a call around 8:45 a.m. about “two victims who had been shot in their trailer,” located in the town of Gonzalez. Police believe the shooting appears to have stemmed from a domestic dispute. Webre went on to identify the victims as Elizabeth Theriot, 50, and her husband, Keith Theriot, also 50. Both victims were alive when the police arrived and survived long enough to be transported to a local hospital, but they have since died. During the press conference, Webre revealed that Dakota had briefly lived in the trailer with his parents, but “was recently asked to leave the residence and not to return.” Police have a warrant for Dakota’s arrest and believe he is driving a 2004 Dodge Ram Pickup truck, which is gray on top and silver on the bottom, towards Mississippi. “This is probably one of the worst domestic violence [incidents] I’ve seen in quite a while,” Webre added. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Webre said that during the course of their investigation, he learned that the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office was investigating a triple-homicide that occurred on Saturday.

RELATED VIDEO: 3 Killed, 2 Injured in ‘Random’ Mass Shooting at Cincinnati Office Building In a statement from the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Jason Ard confirmed that deputies were dispatched around 9:00 a.m. Authorities later identified the three victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Tanner Ernest, 17, and Summer Ernest, 20. “We do not believe the suspect to be in Livingston Parish at this time. We are working in conjunction with the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office as we believe our case is connected to a homicide investigation in that parish,” Ard said in a statement. “Our investigation is ongoing.” At least one of three victims was a friend of Theriot’s, the sheriff’s office said, according to CNN.

232,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/TZRn/~3/6kn5bMCdEJg/,"Exit polls in November showed that 59 percent of voters in House races favored “stricter gun-control measures.” In July 2001, at a meeting in Indianapolis, national Democratic chairman Terry McAuliffe told party brethren that gun control was an issue they were wise to avoid. Nobody in the ballroom challenged him. The consensus at the time was that Democrats had lost the House seven years earlier, when Newt Gingrich’s GOP picked up 54 seats, because President Bill Clinton had signed a ban on the sale of assault weapons. And in 2001, many Democrats believed that Al Gore had lost the recent presidential race because southern white males had tagged him as a gun controller. There was ample evidence that the assault-weapons ban was just one of many factors that fed the Democratic wipeout in 1994, and that Gore’s concern about gun violence (which he rarely voiced) did not trigger his defeat; in fact, he won gun-friendly Michigan and Pennsylvania. But Democrats at the turn of the century lived in terror of the NRA. And McAuliffe, in his speech—which I covered as a political reporter—seemed most concerned that his party was alienating gun owners and cultural conservatives. In his words, “We’ve got to figure this issue out.” That was code for “Let’s not talk about this issue at all.” Which helps to explain why John Kerry, during his 2004 Democratic presidential bid, dressed in duck-hunting garb to convey his respect for the gun ethos and the NRA. Read: Gun control is not impossible But flash forward to the present day. Democrats have indeed figured the issue out—by morphing from wimps to warriors on gun reform. Largely overlooked during the government stasis in Washington is the news that House Democrats celebrated their return to power by touting legislation to expand background checks that would cover most firearm purchases—even those made at gun shows and online. The chief sponsor, Representative Mike Thompson of California, was once a recipient of NRA money and a B+ rating from the NRA. But now he’s hailing the gun-reform bill as “a decisive step to help save lives,” with strong support “from public polling to the ballot box.” The Democrats’ championing of gun reform is not currently a first-tier story, but a new massacre would likely make it so (although the shooting deaths Wednesday of five people in a Florida bank has barely registered). Going forward, there will be a vocal counter-narrative to the ritual Republican “thoughts and prayers,” and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision this week to take a gun case that could expand Second Amendment rights will further fuel the issue. But this time the Democrats, unlike their forebears in the recent past, will not be firing blanks. Read: America’s gun-culture problem The political winds have decisively shifted. According to the exit polls released last November, 59 percent of the voters in the congressional elections favored “stricter gun-control measures,” with only 37 percent in opposition. Of those who supported more gun control, 76 percent voted for House Democratic candidates. The NRA nevertheless insisted in a postelection statement that “gun control was not a decisive factor on election day,” but it appears that the ever-mounting national casualties—from Sandy Hook to Parkland to the Pittsburgh synagogue, with 116,000 shooting victims annually, 35,000 deaths annually, and historically high gun violence in schools—have undercut the NRA’s power and its purist defense of the Second Amendment. At ground level, perhaps the strongest electoral evidence was the race for Gingrich’s old district in suburban Atlanta. A Democrat won there for the first time since 1979, and the gun issue was pivotal. Lucy McBath, a self-described “mother with a mission,” entered elective politics to stand up for gun victims, prompted by the shooting death of her teenage son. Meanwhile, in suburban Denver, Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger, ran a gun-reform campaign and knocked off Mike Coffman, an NRA-backed House incumbent. In red Texas, the Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, armed with a long list of gun-reform proposals, toppled John Culberson, an incumbent with an A rating from the NRA. In Arizona, the Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick—who had earned an A rating from the NRA in 2010—won her House race after stumping for tougher background checks and a new assault-weapons ban. Elaina Plott: The bullet in my arm And in Pennsylvania, four Democratic women won suburban seats after touting gun reform—in districts formerly held by Republican men. Mary Gay Scanlon vowed on her campaign site to “reduce the plague of gun violence,” ranking it as a first-tier issue, with education and health care. Madeleine Dean had previously co-founded a gun-safety group, PA SAFE Caucus, and told the press in December, “Women will bring a different perspective to this [House] conversation. We are mothers, we are grandmothers—that’s what I am first and foremost when I talk about the issue of gun violence.” Susan Wild said during the campaign, “We are living in a country that is like the Wild, Wild West, but with AR-15s. To me, I hesitate to say this, but it’s only a matter of time until gun violence comes to the Lehigh Valley … I’m a huge advocate of sensible gun reform … I’m tired of all the talk, and I want action.” And Chrissy Houlahan has tweeted that she’s “still thinking of the Sandy Hook victims and their families,” and she feels a personal connection. Her cousin Peter was one of the first responders. The climate change is profound, particularly when one recalls what happened 10 years ago, when President Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, called for a restoration of the assault-weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. The NRA quickly flexed its muscle, and 65 cowed House Democrats, many from swing districts, formally protested Holder. When Obama’s chief of staff passed the word that Holder should keep his mouth shut about guns, Holder quickly dropped the idea and simply said, “I respect the Second Amendment.” Granted, new House Democratic calls for an assault-weapons ban, stronger background checks, and a lifting of the 23-year ban on federal firearms research will likely die in the Republican Senate. But Democrats—buoyed by their historic gains in suburban House districts, particularly among independents and Republican-leaning women—believe that gun-reform policy is good politics, with the goal of rebuilding the party’s brand for 2020. And Democratic confidence is abetted by the recent rise of the well-funded gun-reform movement helmed by Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was seriously wounded in a mass shooting. Democrats are clearly more comfortable talking reform, knowing that the NRA is getting pushback at the grassroots level. Indeed, the NRA (which has its own problems right now, reportedly with Special Counsel Robert Mueller) and other gun-rights groups were actually outspent by gun-reform groups during the 2018 campaign, by roughly $2.4 million—a heretofore unthinkable development. A little more than three years ago, the conservative activist Grover Norquist confidently declared, “When [Democrats] start to say … that people with guns are somehow connected to mass murders, that’s what turns voters off.” Democratic candidates will happily test that proposition in 2020. It’s a safe bet that none will wear duck-hunting clothes.",2019-01-27 07:00:53,Democrats Are Newly Emboldened on Gun Control,,1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

Shortly before 11 a.m. on May 30, 2012, Stawicki decided to stop at Café Racer in Seattle, Washington, for a cup of coffee, but he was turned down and asked to leave the establishment. Stawicki had visited the coffee shop a week prior and behaved erratically in front of elderly customers, before being thrown out. On his return trip, Stawicki didn’t leave after being asked. Instead, he reportedly sat down for a moment before he pulled out two .45-caliber handguns and opened fire, fatally shooting four patrons (Joseph Albanese, 52, Andrew Keriakedes, 49, Kimberly Lynn Layfield, 36, and 57-year-old Donald Largen) and injuring the cafe’s chef. He fled the scene, then about 30 minutes later he shot and killed a 52-year-old woman, Gloria Leonidas, in the parking lot next to Town Hall Seattle on First Hill before stealing her SUV. He then drove to West Seattle and ditched the vehicle, leaving one of his guns behind, as a city-wide manhunt began. After receiving several tips, police located Stawicki close to where he abandoned the SUV. As police were closing in on him, Stawicki fell to his knees on a sidewalk and shot himself in the head. Stawicki’s killing spree reportedly stunned relatives, although he had a history of mental health issues and violent behavior. He reportedly never wanted to talk about his issues with his family, and no one made any efforts to have him committed as he had never threatened to harm himself. However, his family were said to have regrets following the deadly mass shooting that they did not push harder to get him treatment.

234,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/how-mark-burnett-resurrected-donald-trump-as-an-icon-of-american-success?reload=true,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories With “The Apprentice,” the TV producer mythologized Trump—then a floundering D-lister—as the ultimate titan, paving his way to the Presidency. By Patrick Radden Keefe “Expedition: Robinson,” a Swedish reality-television program, premièred in the summer of 1997, with a tantalizing premise: sixteen strangers are deposited on a small island off the coast of Malaysia and forced to fend for themselves. To survive, they must coöperate, but they are also competing: each week, a member of the ensemble is voted off the island, and the final contestant wins a grand prize. The show’s title alluded to both “Robinson Crusoe” and “The Swiss Family Robinson,” but a more apt literary reference might have been “Lord of the Flies.” The first contestant who was kicked off was a young man named Sinisa Savija. Upon returning to Sweden, he was morose, complaining to his wife that the show’s editors would “cut away the good things I did and make me look like a fool.” Nine weeks before the show aired, he stepped in front of a speeding train. The producers dealt with this tragedy by suggesting that Savija’s turmoil was unrelated to the series—and by editing him virtually out of the show. Even so, there was a backlash, with one critic asserting that a program based on such merciless competition was “fascist television.” But everyone watched the show anyway, and Savija was soon forgotten. “We had never seen anything like it,” Svante Stockselius, the chief of the network that produced the program, told the Los Angeles Times, in 2000. “Expedition: Robinson” offered a potent cocktail of repulsion and attraction. You felt embarrassed watching it, Stockselius said, but “you couldn’t stop.” In 1998, a thirty-eight-year-old former British paratrooper named Mark Burnett was living in Los Angeles, producing television. “Lord of the Flies” was one of his favorite books, and after he heard about “Expedition: Robinson” he secured the rights to make an American version. Burnett had previously worked in sales and had a knack for branding. He renamed the show “Survivor.” The first season was set in Borneo, and from the moment it aired, on CBS, in 2000, “Survivor” was a ratings juggernaut: according to the network, a hundred and twenty-five million Americans—more than a third of the population—tuned in for some portion of the season finale. The catchphrase delivered by the host, Jeff Probst, at the end of each elimination ceremony, “The tribe has spoken,” entered the lexicon. Burnett had been a marginal figure in Hollywood, but after this triumph he, too, was rebranded, as an oracle of spectacle. Les Moonves, then the chairman of CBS, arranged for the delivery of a token of thanks—a champagne-colored Mercedes. To Burnett, the meaning of this gesture was unmistakable: “I had arrived.” The only question was what he might do next. A few years later, Burnett was in Brazil, filming “Survivor: The Amazon.” His second marriage was falling apart, and he was staying in a corporate apartment with a girlfriend. One day, they were watching TV and happened across a BBC documentary series called “Trouble at the Top,” about the corporate rat race. The girlfriend found the show boring and suggested changing the station, but Burnett was transfixed. He called his business partner in L.A. and said, “I’ve got a new idea.” Burnett would not discuss the concept over the phone—one of his rules for success was to always pitch in person—but he was certain that the premise had the contours of a hit: “Survivor” in the city. Contestants competing for a corporate job. The urban jungle! He needed someone to play the role of heavyweight tycoon. Burnett, who tends to narrate stories from his own life in the bravura language of a Hollywood pitch, once said of the show, “It’s got to have a hook to it, right? They’ve got to be working for someone big and special and important. Cut to: I’ve rented this skating rink.” In 2002, Burnett rented Wollman Rink, in Central Park, for a live broadcast of the Season 4 finale of “Survivor.” The property was controlled by Donald Trump, who had obtained the lease to operate the rink in 1986, and had plastered his name on it. Before the segment started, Burnett addressed fifteen hundred spectators who had been corralled for the occasion, and noticed Trump sitting with Melania Knauss, then his girlfriend, in the front row. Burnett prides himself on his ability to “read the room”: to size up the personalities in his audience, suss out what they want, and then give it to them. “I need to show respect to Mr. Trump,” Burnett recounted, in a 2013 speech in Vancouver. “I said, ‘Welcome, everybody, to Trump Wollman skating rink. The Trump Wollman skating rink is a fine facility, built by Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Because the Trump Wollman skating rink is the place we are tonight and we love being at the Trump Wollman skating rink, Mr. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.” As Burnett told the story, he had scarcely got offstage before Trump was shaking his hand, proclaiming, “You’re a genius!” Cut to: June, 2015. After starring in fourteen seasons of “The Apprentice,” all executive-produced by Burnett, Trump appeared in the gilded atrium of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, to announce that he was running for President. Only someone “really rich,” Trump declared, could “take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” He also made racist remarks about Mexicans, prompting NBC, which had broadcast “The Apprentice,” to fire him. Burnett, however, did not sever his relationship with his star. He and Trump had been equal partners in “The Apprentice,” and the show had made each of them hundreds of millions of dollars. They were also close friends: Burnett liked to tell people that when Trump married Knauss, in 2005, Burnett’s son Cameron was the ring bearer. Trump had been a celebrity since the eighties, his persona shaped by the best-selling book “The Art of the Deal.” But his business had foundered, and by 2003 he had become a garish figure of local interest—a punch line on Page Six. “The Apprentice” mythologized him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success. Jay Bienstock, a longtime collaborator of Burnett’s, and the showrunner on “The Apprentice,” told me, “Mark always likes to compare his shows to great films or novels. All of Mark’s shows feel bigger than life, and this is by design.” Burnett has made many programs since “The Apprentice,” among them “Shark Tank,” a startup competition based on a Japanese show, and “The Voice,” a singing contest adapted from a Dutch program. In June, he became the chairman of M-G-M Television. But his chief legacy is to have cast a serially bankrupt carnival barker in the role of a man who might plausibly become the leader of the free world. “I don’t think any of us could have known what this would become,” Katherine Walker, a producer on the first five seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me. “But Donald would not be President had it not been for that show.” Tony Schwartz, who wrote “The Art of the Deal,” which falsely presented Trump as its primary author, told me that he feels some responsibility for facilitating Trump’s imposture. But, he said, “Mark Burnett’s influence was vastly greater,” adding, “ ‘The Apprentice’ was the single biggest factor in putting Trump in the national spotlight.” Schwartz has publicly condemned Trump, describing him as “the monster I helped to create.” Burnett, by contrast, has refused to speak publicly about his relationship with the President or about his curious, but decisive, role in American history. Burnett is lean and lanky, with the ageless, perpetually smiling face of Peter Pan and eyes that, in the words of one ex-wife, have “a Photoshop twinkle.” He has a high forehead and the fixed, gravity-defying hair of a nineteen-fifties film star. People often mistake Burnett for an Australian, because he has a deep tan and an outdoorsy disposition, and because his accent has been mongrelized by years of international travel. But he grew up in Dagenham, on the eastern outskirts of London, a milieu that he has recalled as “gray and grimy.” His father, Archie, was a tattooed Glaswegian who worked the night shift at a Ford automobile plant. His mother, Jean, worked there as well, pouring acid into batteries, but in Mark’s recollection she always dressed immaculately, “never letting her station in life interfere with how she presented herself.” Mark, an only child, grew up watching American television shows such as “Starsky & Hutch” and “The Rockford Files.” At seventeen, he volunteered for the British Army’s Parachute Regiment; according to a friend who enlisted with him, he joined for “the glitz.” The Paras were an élite unit, and a soldier from his platoon, Paul Read, told me that Burnett was a particularly formidable special operator, both physically commanding and a natural leader: “He was always super keen. He always wanted to be the best, even among the best.” (Another soldier recalled that Burnett was nicknamed the Male Model, because he was reluctant to “get any dirt under his fingernails.”) Burnett served in Northern Ireland, and then in the Falklands, where he took part in the 1982 advance on Port Stanley. The experience, he later said, was “horrific, but on the other hand—in a sick way—exciting.” When Burnett left the Army, after five years, his plan was to find work in Central America as a “weapons and tactics adviser”—not as a mercenary, he later insisted, though it is difficult to parse the distinction. Before he left, his mother told him that she’d had a premonition and implored him not to take another job that involved carrying a gun. Like Trump, Burnett trusts his impulses. “Your gut instinct is rarely wrong,” he likes to say. During a layover in Los Angeles, he decided to heed his mother’s admonition, and walked out of the airport. He later described himself as the quintessential immigrant: “I had no money, no green card, no nothing.” But the California sun was shining, and he was eager to try his luck. Burnett is an avid raconteur, and his anecdotes about his life tend to have a three-act structure. In Act I, he is a fish out of water, guileless and naïve, with nothing but the shirt on his back and an outsized dream. Act II is the rude awakening: the world bets against him. It’s impossible! You’ll lose everything! No such thing has ever been tried! In Act III, Burnett always prevails. Not long after arriving in California, he landed his first job—as a nanny. Eyebrows were raised: a commando turned nanny? Yet Burnett thrived, working for a family in Beverly Hills, then one in Malibu. As he later observed, the experience taught him “how nice the life styles of wealthy people are.” Young, handsome, and solicitous, he discovered that successful people are often happy to talk about their path to success. Burnett married a California woman, Kym Gold, who came from an affluent family. “Mark has always been very, very hungry,” Gold told me recently. “He’s always had a lot of drive.” For a time, he worked for Gold’s stepfather, who owned a casting agency, and for Gold, who owned an apparel business. She would buy slightly imperfect T-shirts wholesale, at two dollars apiece, and Burnett would resell them, on the Venice boardwalk, for eighteen. That was where he learned “the art of selling,” he has said. The marriage lasted only a year, by which point Burnett had obtained a green card. (Gold, who had also learned a thing or two about selling, went on to co-found the denim company True Religion, which was eventually sold for eight hundred million dollars.) One day in the early nineties, Burnett read an article about a new kind of athletic event: a long-distance endurance race, known as the Raid Gauloises, in which teams of athletes competed in a multiday trek over harsh terrain. In 1992, Burnett organized a team and participated in a race in Oman. Noticing that he and his teammates were “walking, climbing advertisements” for gear, he signed up sponsors. He also realized that if you filmed such a race it would make for exotic and gripping viewing. Burnett launched his own race, the Eco-Challenge, which was set in such scenic locations as Utah and British Columbia, and was televised on various outlets, including the Discovery Channel. Bienstock, who first met Burnett when he worked on the “Eco-Challenge” show, in 1996, told me that Burnett was less interested in the ravishing backdrops or in the competition than he was in the intense emotional experiences of the racers: “Mark saw the drama in real people being the driving force in an unscripted show.” By this time, Burnett had met an aspiring actress from Long Island named Dianne Minerva and married her. They became consumed with making the show a success. “When we went to bed at night, we talked about it, when we woke up in the morning, we talked about it,” Dianne Burnett told me recently. In the small world of adventure racing, Mark developed a reputation as a slick and ambitious operator. “He’s like a rattlesnake,” one of his business competitors told the New York Times in 2000. “If you’re close enough long enough, you’re going to get bit.” Mark and Dianne were doing far better than Mark’s parents ever had, but he was restless. One day, they attended a seminar by the motivational speaker Tony Robbins called “Unleash the Power Within.” A good technique for realizing your goals, Robbins counselled, was to write down what you wanted most on index cards, then deposit them around your house, as constant reminders. In a 2012 memoir, “The Road to Reality,” Dianne Burnett recalls that she wrote the word “FAMILY” on her index cards. Mark wrote “MORE MONEY.” As a young man, Burnett occasionally found himself on a flight for business, looking at the other passengers and daydreaming: If this plane were to crash on a desert island, where would I fit into our new society? Who would lead and who would follow? “Nature strips away the veneer we show one another every day, at which point people become who they really are,” Burnett once wrote. He has long espoused a Hobbesian world view, and when he launched “Survivor” a zero-sum ethos was integral to the show. “It’s quite a mean game, just like life is kind of a mean game,” Burnett told CNN, in 2001. “Everyone’s out for themselves.” On “Survivor,” the competitors were split into teams, or “tribes.” In this raw arena, Burnett suggested, viewers could glimpse the cruel essence of human nature. It was undeniably compelling to watch contestants of different ages, body types, and dispositions negotiate the primordial challenges of making fire, securing shelter, and foraging for food. At the same time, the scenario was extravagantly contrived: the castaways were shadowed by camera crews, and helicopters thundered around the island, gathering aerial shots. Moreover, the contestants had been selected for their charisma and their combustibility. “It’s all about casting,” Burnett once observed. “As a producer, my job is to make the choices in who to work with and put on camera.” He was always searching for someone with the sort of personality that could “break through the clutter.” In casting sessions, Burnett sometimes goaded people, to see how they responded to conflict. Katherine Walker, the “Apprentice” producer, told me about an audition in which Burnett taunted a prospective cast member by insinuating that he was secretly gay. (The man, riled, threw the accusation back at Burnett, and was not cast that season.) Richard Levak, a clinical psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” and worked on other reality-TV shows, told me that producers have often liked people he was uncomfortable with for psychological reasons. Emotional volatility makes for compelling television. But recruiting individuals for their instability and then subjecting them to the stress of a televised competition can be perilous. When Burnett was once asked about Sinisa Savija’s suicide, he contended that Savija had “previous psychological problems.” No “Survivor” or “Apprentice” contestants are known to have killed themselves, but in the past two decades several dozen reality-TV participants have. Levak eventually stopped consulting on such programs, in part because he feared that a contestant might harm himself. “I would think, Geez, if this should unravel, they’re going to look at the personality profile and there may have been a red flag,” he recalled. Burnett excelled at the casting equation to the point where, on Season 2 of “Survivor,” which was shot in the Australian outback, his castaways spent so much time gossiping about the characters from the previous season that Burnett warned them, “The more time you spend talking about the first ‘Survivor,’ the less time you will have on television.” But Burnett’s real genius was in marketing. When he made the rounds in L.A. to pitch “Survivor,” he vowed that it would become a cultural phenomenon, and he presented executives with a mock issue of Newsweek featuring the show on the cover. (Later, “Survivor” did make the cover of the magazine.) Burnett devised a dizzying array of lucrative product-integration deals. In the first season, one of the teams won a care package that was attached to a parachute bearing the red-and-white logo of Target. “I looked on ‘Survivor’ as much as a marketing vehicle as a television show,” Burnett once explained. He was creating an immersive, cinematic entertainment—and he was known for lush production values, and for paying handsomely to retain top producers and editors—but he was anything but precious about his art. Long before he met Trump, Burnett had developed a Panglossian confidence in the power of branding. “I believe we’re going to see something like the Microsoft Grand Canyon National Park,” he told the New York Times in 2001. “The government won’t take care of all that—companies will.” Seven weeks before the 2016 election, Burnett, in a smart tux with a shawl collar, arrived with his third wife, the actress and producer Roma Downey, at the Microsoft Theatre, in Los Angeles, for the Emmy Awards. Both “Shark Tank” and “The Voice” won awards that night. But his triumphant evening was marred when the master of ceremonies, Jimmy Kimmel, took an unexpected turn during his opening monologue. “Television brings people together, but television can also tear us apart,” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if it wasn’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for President?” In the crowd, there was laughter. “Many have asked, ‘Who is to blame for Donald Trump?’ ” Kimmel continued. “I’ll tell you who, because he’s sitting right there. That guy.” Kimmel pointed into the audience, and the live feed cut to a closeup of Burnett, whose expression resolved itself into a rigid grin. “Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one,” Kimmel said. Burnett was still smiling, but Kimmel wasn’t. He went on, “I’m going on the record right now. He’s responsible. If Donald Trump gets elected and he builds that wall, the first person we’re throwing over it is Mark Burnett. The tribe has spoken.” Around this time, Burnett stopped giving interviews about Trump or “The Apprentice.” He continues to speak to the press to promote his shows, but he declined an interview with me. Before Trump’s Presidential run, however, Burnett told and retold the story of how the show originated. When he met Trump at Wollman Rink, Burnett told him an anecdote about how, as a young man selling T-shirts on the boardwalk on Venice Beach, he had been handed a copy of “The Art of the Deal,” by a passing rollerblader. Burnett said that he had read it, and that it had changed his life; he thought, What a legend this guy Trump is! Anyone else hearing this tale might have found it a bit calculated, if not implausible. Kym Gold, Burnett’s first wife, told me that she has no recollection of him reading Trump’s book in this period. “He liked mystery books,” she said. But when Trump heard the story he was flattered. Burnett has never liked the phrase “reality television.” For a time, he valiantly campaigned to rebrand his genre “dramality”—“a mixture of drama and reality.” The term never caught on, but it reflected Burnett’s forthright acknowledgment that what he creates is a highly structured, selective, and manipulated rendition of reality. Burnett has often boasted that, for each televised hour of “The Apprentice,” his crews shot as many as three hundred hours of footage. The real alchemy of reality television is the editing—sifting through a compost heap of clips and piecing together an absorbing story. Jonathon Braun, an editor who started working with Burnett on “Survivor” and then worked on the first six seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me, “You don’t make anything up. But you accentuate things that you see as themes.” He readily conceded how distorting this process can be. Much of reality TV consists of reaction shots: one participant says something outrageous, and the camera cuts away to another participant rolling her eyes. Often, Braun said, editors lift an eye roll from an entirely different part of the conversation. “The Apprentice” was built around a weekly series of business challenges. At the end of each episode, Trump determined which competitor should be “fired.” But, as Braun explained, Trump was frequently unprepared for these sessions, with little grasp of who had performed well. Sometimes a candidate distinguished herself during the contest only to get fired, on a whim, by Trump. When this happened, Braun said, the editors were often obliged to “reverse engineer” the episode, scouring hundreds of hours of footage to emphasize the few moments when the exemplary candidate might have slipped up, in an attempt to assemble an artificial version of history in which Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip decision made sense. During the making of “The Apprentice,” Burnett conceded that the stories were constructed in this way, saying, “We know each week who has been fired, and, therefore, you’re editing in reverse.” Braun noted that President Trump’s staff seems to have been similarly forced to learn the art of retroactive narrative construction, adding, “I find it strangely validating to hear that they’re doing the same thing in the White House.” Such sleight of hand is the industry standard in reality television. But the entire premise of “The Apprentice” was also something of a con. When Trump and Burnett told the story of their partnership, both suggested that Trump was initially wary of committing to a TV show, because he was so busy running his flourishing real-estate empire. During a 2004 panel at the Museum of Television and Radio, in Los Angeles, Trump claimed that “every network” had tried to get him to do a reality show, but he wasn’t interested: “I don’t want to have cameras all over my office, dealing with contractors, politicians, mobsters, and everyone else I have to deal with in my business. You know, mobsters don’t like, as they’re talking to me, having cameras all over the room. It would play well on television, but it doesn’t play well with them.” “The Apprentice” portrayed Trump not as a skeezy hustler who huddles with local mobsters but as a plutocrat with impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth—a titan who always seemed to be climbing out of helicopters or into limousines. “Most of us knew he was a fake,” Braun told me. “He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.” Bill Pruitt, another producer, recalled, “We walked through the offices and saw chipped furniture. We saw a crumbling empire at every turn. Our job was to make it seem otherwise.” Trump maximized his profits from the start. When producers were searching for office space in which to stage the show, he vetoed every suggestion, then mentioned that he had an empty floor available in Trump Tower, which he could lease at a reasonable price. (After becoming President, he offered a similar arrangement to the Secret Service.) When the production staff tried to furnish the space, they found that local venders, stiffed by Trump in the past, refused to do business with them. More than two hundred thousand people applied for one of the sixteen spots on Season 1, and throughout the show’s early years the candidates were conspicuously credentialled and impressive. Officially, the grand prize was what the show described as “the dream job of a lifetime”—the unfathomable privilege of being mentored by Donald Trump while working as a junior executive at the Trump Organization. All the candidates paid lip service to the notion that Trump was a peerless businessman, but not all of them believed it. A standout contestant in Season 1 was Kwame Jackson, a young African-American man with an M.B.A. from Harvard, who had worked at Goldman Sachs. Jackson told me that he did the show not out of any desire for Trump’s tutelage but because he regarded the prospect of a nationally televised business competition as “a great platform” for career advancement. “At Goldman, I was in private-wealth management, so Trump was not, by any stretch, the most financially successful person I’d ever met or managed,” Jackson told me. He was quietly amused when other contestants swooned over Trump’s deal-making prowess or his elevated tastes—when they exclaimed, on tours of tacky Trump properties, “Oh, my God, this is so rich—this is, like, really rich!” Fran Lebowitz once remarked that Trump is “a poor person’s idea of a rich person,” and Jackson was struck, when the show aired, by the extent to which Americans fell for the ruse. “Main Street America saw all those glittery things, the helicopter and the gold-plated sinks, and saw the most successful person in the universe,” he recalled. “The people I knew in the world of high finance understood that it was all a joke.” This is an oddly common refrain among people who were involved in “The Apprentice”: that the show was camp, and that the image of Trump as an avatar of prosperity was delivered with a wink. Somehow, this interpretation eluded the audience. Jonathon Braun marvelled, “People started taking it seriously!” When I watched several dozen episodes of the show recently, I saw no hint of deliberate irony. Admittedly, it is laughable to hear the candidates, at a fancy meal, talk about watching Trump for cues on which utensil they should use for each course, as if he were Emily Post. But the show’s reverence for its pugnacious host, however credulous it might seem now, comes across as sincere. Did Burnett believe what he was selling? Or was Trump another two-dollar T-shirt that he pawned off for eighteen? It’s difficult to say. One person who has collaborated with Burnett likened him to Harold Hill, the travelling fraudster in “The Music Man,” saying, “There’s always an angle with Mark. He’s all about selling.” Burnett is fluent in the jargon of self-help, and he has published two memoirs, both written with Bill O’Reilly’s ghostwriter, which double as manuals on how to get rich. One of them, titled “Jump In!: Even if You Don’t Know How to Swim,” now reads like an inadvertent metaphor for the Trump Presidency. “Don’t waste time on overpreparation,” the book advises. At the 2004 panel, Burnett made it clear that, with “The Apprentice,” he was selling an archetype. “Donald is the real current-day version of a tycoon,” he said. “Donald will say whatever Donald wants to say. He takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. It’s like the guys who built the West.” Like Trump, Burnett seemed to have both a jaundiced impression of the gullible essence of the American people and a brazen enthusiasm for how to exploit it. “The Apprentice” was about “what makes America great,” Burnett said. “Everybody wants one of a few things in this country. They’re willing to pay to lose weight. They’re willing to pay to grow hair. They’re willing to pay to have sex. And they’re willing to pay to learn how to get rich.” At the start of “The Apprentice,” Burnett’s intention may have been to tell a more honest story, one that acknowledged Trump’s many stumbles. Burnett surely recognized that Trump was at a low point, but, according to Walker, “Mark sensed Trump’s potential for a comeback.” Indeed, in a voice-over introduction in the show’s pilot, Trump conceded a degree of weakness that feels shockingly self-aware when you listen to it today: “I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won, big league.” The show was an instant hit, and Trump’s public image, and the man himself, began to change. Not long after the première, Trump suggested in an Esquire article that people now liked him, “whereas before, they viewed me as a bit of an ogre.” Jim Dowd, Trump’s former publicist, told Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the authors of the 2016 book “Trump Revealed,” that after “The Apprentice” began airing “people on the street embraced him.” Dowd noted, “All of a sudden, there was none of the old mocking,” adding, “He was a hero.” Dowd, who died in 2016, pinpointed the public’s embrace of “The Apprentice” as “the bridge” to Trump’s Presidential run. The show’s camera operators often shot Trump from low angles, as you would a basketball pro, or Mt. Rushmore. Trump loomed over the viewer, his face in a jowly glower, his hair darker than it is now, the metallic auburn of a new penny. (“Apprentice” employees were instructed not to fiddle with Trump’s hair, which he dyed and styled himself.) Trump’s entrances were choreographed for maximum impact, and often set to a moody accompaniment of synthesized drums and cymbals. The “boardroom”—a stage set where Trump determined which candidate should be fired—had the menacing gloom of a “Godfather” movie. In one scene, Trump ushered contestants through his rococo Trump Tower aerie, and said, “I show this apartment to very few people. Presidents. Kings.” In the tabloid ecosystem in which he had long languished, Trump was always Donald, or the Donald. On “The Apprentice,” he finally became Mr. Trump. “We have to subscribe to our own myths,” the “Apprentice” producer Bill Pruitt told me. “Mark Burnett is a great mythmaker. He blew up that balloon and he believed in it.” Burnett, preferring to spend time pitching new ideas for shows, delegated most of the daily decisions about “The Apprentice” to his team, many of them veterans of “Survivor” and “Eco-Challenge.” But he furiously promoted the show, often with Trump at his side. According to many of Burnett’s collaborators, one of his greatest skills is his handling of talent—understanding their desires and anxieties, making them feel protected and secure. On interview tours with Trump, Burnett exhibited the studied instincts of a veteran producer: anytime the spotlight strayed in his direction, he subtly redirected it at Trump. Burnett, who was forty-three when Season 1 aired, described the fifty-seven-year-old Trump as his “soul mate.” He expressed astonishment at Trump’s “laser-like focus and retention.” He delivered flattery in the ostentatiously obsequious register that Trump prefers. Burnett said he hoped that he might someday rise to Trump’s “level” of prestige and success, adding, “I don’t know if I’ll ever make it. But you know something? If you’re not shooting for the stars, you’re not shooting!” On one occasion, Trump invited Burnett to dinner at his Trump Tower apartment; Burnett had anticipated an elegant meal, and, according to an associate, concealed his surprise when Trump handed him a burger from McDonald’s. Trump liked to suggest that he and Burnett had come up with the show “together”; Burnett never corrected him. When Carolyn Kepcher, a Trump Organization executive who appeared alongside Trump in early seasons of “The Apprentice,” seemed to be courting her own celebrity, Trump fired her and gave on-air roles to three of his children, Ivanka, Donald, Jr., and Eric. Burnett grasped that the best way to keep Trump satisfied was to insure that he never felt upstaged. “It’s Batman and Robin, and I’m clearly Robin,” he said. Burnett sometimes went so far as to imply that Trump’s involvement in “The Apprentice” was a form of altruism. “This is Donald Trump giving back,” he told the Times in 2003, then offered a vague invocation of post-9/11 civic duty: “What makes the world a safe place right now? I think it’s American dollars, which come from taxes, which come because of Donald Trump.” Trump himself had been candid about his reasons for doing the show. “My jet’s going to be in every episode,” he told Jim Dowd, adding that the production would be “great for my brand.” It was. Season 1 of “The Apprentice” flogged one Trump property after another. The contestants stayed at Trump Tower, did events at Trump National Golf Club, sold Trump Ice bottled water. “I’ve always felt that the Trump Taj Mahal should do even better,” Trump announced before sending the contestants off on a challenge to lure gamblers to his Atlantic City casino, which soon went bankrupt. The prize for the winning team was an opportunity to stay and gamble at the Taj, trailed by cameras. “The Apprentice” was so successful that, by the time the second season launched, Trump’s lacklustre tie-in products were being edged out by blue-chip companies willing to pay handsomely to have their wares featured onscreen. In 2004, Kevin Harris, a producer who helped Burnett secure product-integration deals, sent an e-mail describing a teaser reel of Trump endorsements that would be used to attract clients: “Fast cutting of Donald—‘Crest is the biggest’ ‘I have worn Levis since I was 2’ ‘I love M&Ms’ ‘Unilever is the biggest company in the world’ all with the MONEY MONEY MONEY song over the top.” Burnett and Trump negotiated with NBC to retain the rights to income derived from product integration, and split the fees. On set, Trump often gloated about this easy money. One producer remembered, “You’d say, ‘Hey, Donald, today we have Pepsi, and they’re paying three million to be in the show,’ and he’d say, ‘That’s great, I just made a million five!’ ” Originally, Burnett had planned to cast a different mogul in the role of host each season. But Trump took to his part more nimbly than anyone might have predicted. He wouldn’t read a script—he stumbled over the words and got the enunciation all wrong. But off the cuff he delivered the kind of zesty banter that is the lifeblood of reality television. He barked at one contestant, “Sam, you’re sort of a disaster. Don’t take offense, but everyone hates you.” Katherine Walker told me that producers often struggled to make Trump seem coherent, editing out garbled syntax and malapropisms. “We cleaned it up so that he was his best self,” she said, adding, “I’m sure Donald thinks that he was never edited.” However, she acknowledged, he was a natural for the medium: whereas reality-TV producers generally must amp up personalities and events, to accentuate conflict and conjure intrigue, “we didn’t have to change him—he gave us stuff to work with.” Trump improvised the tagline for which “The Apprentice” became famous: “You’re fired.” NBC executives were so enamored of their new star that they instructed Burnett and his producers to give Trump more screen time. This is when Trump’s obsession with television ratings took hold. “I didn’t know what demographics was four weeks ago,” he told Larry King. “All of a sudden, I heard we were No. 3 in demographics. Last night, we were No. 1 in demographics. And that’s the important rating.” The ratings kept rising, and the first season’s finale was the No. 1 show of the week. For Burnett, Trump’s rehabilitation was a satisfying confirmation of a populist aesthetic. “I like it when critics slam a movie and it does massive box office,” he once said. “I love it.” Whereas others had seen in Trump only a tattered celebrity of the eighties, Burnett had glimpsed a feral charisma. On June 26, 2018, the day the Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s travel ban targeting people from several predominantly Muslim countries, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent out invitations to an event called a Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. If Pompeo registered any dissonance between such lofty rhetoric and Administration policies targeting certain religions, he didn’t mention it. The event took place the next month, at the State Department, in Washington, D.C., and one of the featured speakers was Mark Burnett. In 2004, he had been getting his hair cut at a salon in Malibu when he noticed an attractive woman getting a pedicure. It was Roma Downey, the star of “Touched by an Angel,” a long-running inspirational drama on CBS. They fell in love, and married in 2007; together, they helped rear Burnett’s two sons from his second marriage and Downey’s daughter. Downey, who grew up in a Catholic family in Northern Ireland, is deeply religious, and eventually Burnett, too, reoriented his life around Christianity. “Faith is a major part of our marriage,” Downey said, in 2013, adding, “We pray together.” For people who had long known Burnett, it was an unexpected turn. This was a man who had ended his second marriage during a live interview with Howard Stern. To promote “Survivor” in 2002, Burnett called in to Stern’s radio show, and Stern asked casually if he was married. When Burnett hesitated, Stern pounced. “You didn’t survive marriage?” he asked. “You don’t want your girlfriend to know you’re married?” As Burnett dissembled, Stern kept prying, and the exchange became excruciating. Finally, Stern asked if Burnett was “a single guy,” and Burnett replied, “You know? Yeah.” This was news to Dianne, Burnett’s wife of a decade. As she subsequently wrote in her memoir, “The 18-to-34 radio demographic knew where my marriage was headed before I did.” In 2008, Burnett’s longtime business partner, a lawyer named Conrad Riggs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Burnett had stiffed him to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. According to the lawsuit, the two men had made an agreement before “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” that Riggs would own ten per cent of Burnett’s company. When Riggs got married, someone who attended the ceremony told me, Burnett was his best man, and gave a speech saying that his success would have been impossible without Riggs. Several years later, when Burnett’s company was worth half a billion dollars, he denied having made any agreement. The suit settled out of court. (Riggs declined to comment.) Years ago, Burnett told Esquire that religion was “a waste of time.” Dianne Burnett told me that when she was married to him he had no interest in faith. “But you know what? People change,” she continued. “So I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.” When Burnett met Downey, he reinvented himself. Having made a fortune producing television that was often exploitative, he announced that he would now focus exclusively on “family-friendly franchises,” declaring, “You don’t need to be mean to create drama.” Burnett and Downey launched a production company that has specialized in Christian-themed programming, including a hundred-million-dollar remake of “Ben-Hur,” which flopped. Burnett has spoken enthusiastically to colleagues about the role that prayer and religious devotion now play in his life. He and Downey describe themselves as “the noisiest Christians in Hollywood.” Kym Gold told me she thinks that Burnett tends to adapt to his current partner. Before he married Gold, who is Jewish, he took a six-week course in Judaism. “I’ve never known Mark to be religious,” Gold observed. But she noted that “people close to him have said, ‘He follows the wind.’ ” Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor, is a friend of Burnett’s. “Mark is not at all the person he was a decade ago,” he told me. “Hollywood is built on money, sex, power, and fame. I would say that none of those things are driving forces for him anymore.” Warren assured me, unprompted, that Burnett is sincere in his Christianity—that he is a “genuine believer” who has committed to being an “ambassador” for his faith. Others who know Burnett noted to me that the Christian community is itself a significant viewer demographic. Burnett talks with colleagues about the “faith audience,” and describes the Christian community as “the largest army on earth.” In 2013, he and Downey produced “The Bible,” a History Channel miniseries that, Burnett claims, was watched by a hundred million people. The Good Book, in Burnett’s words, is “the ultimate period piece.” At the State Department, Burnett mentioned religious intolerance “throughout the Middle East,” genocide in Darfur, and the persecution of religious minorities in Myanmar. “I’m simply a TV producer,” he said, noting that he was “far less educated” than his audience. But he was good at communicating with the masses, he went on. He explained his formula for storytelling: “K-I-S-S—‘Keep it simple, stupid.’ ” Burnett said that when he and Downey travel, strangers sometimes “ask her to lay her hands upon them,” as if she were actually an angel. This, he confided, is “the power of media.” He suggested that his position in Hollywood gave him some leverage when it came to pressing politicians to do the right thing: “In the end, nobody wants to look bad in the media.” But Burnett did not cite any controversial White House policies that he hoped to change; he didn’t even mention Trump’s name. Burnett had remained close to the President. At the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, he introduced Trump, saying that there “has never been a single bad word between us,” and describing their fourteen-year friendship as “one of the greatest relationships of my life.” Over the years, Burnett and Downey have given to Democratic causes, and in 2008 they donated the maximum contribution to Barack Obama’s campaign. But Burnett has never been especially political. One longtime “Apprentice” staff member told me that Burnett did not welcome the idea of losing his star to a Presidential campaign, noting, “Trump running for President cost Mark a lot of money. He made millions on ‘The Apprentice,’ and Trump killed the franchise.” By the time Trump announced his campaign, ratings for “The Apprentice” had fallen, and the show had been repackaged as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The contestants were now D-list celebrities, including Gary Busey, the zonked-out actor, and Gene Simmons, the repellent front man of Kiss. There were the same business challenges and boardroom eliminations, but the stakes felt conspicuously lower. A lot of the drama in the original “Apprentice” had stemmed from the idea that, for aspiring entrepreneurs, competing on the show could be a career-defining opportunity. For the aging, Botoxed cohort on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” their presence was a tacit admission that their best days were behind them. Still, everyone gamely pretended to take it seriously. Describing the show in one public appearance, Donald Trump, Jr., said that it could be intimidating for Trump’s children to pass judgment on someone “as accomplished as a Gene Simmons.” In the opening episode of Season 11, the theatrical tension of the boardroom was suddenly punctured by an electronic trill. “Whose cell phone?” Trump growled. “How do I turn this off?” Busey stuttered, fumbling with the tiny buttons. “Gary, turn your cell phone off!” Trump said. It is strange to watch this kind of malarkey now and consider that only a few years later one of these men would be President. “Donald mentioned a number of times, ‘Maybe I’ll run for President one day,’ ” Burnett told the Washington Post in January, 2016. “And sad to say, politics is kind of a TV show.” When Burnett was asked whether he supported Trump’s candidacy, he deflected the question, retreating behind his conceit that politics is simply entertainment by other means. “I have no idea about the politics,” he said, adding, “I have had great fun—great fun—watching it.” After Trump won the election, he turned to his old friend for advice on the inaugural festivities. Like a starlet who keeps returning to a favorite director, Trump had always loved the way that Burnett made him look. Burnett was summoned to New York for a consultation with the President-elect and another Trump confidant, the financier Tom Barrack. Burnett pitched a few Riefenstahlian notions: a parade up Fifth Avenue; a televised helicopter ride ushering Trump from Manhattan to D.C. Barrack, who became the chairman of the inaugural committee, later said that Burnett was actively involved in producing the Inauguration, adding, “Mark is a genius, and the President-elect loves him.” I spoke to several people who recalled Burnett telling them that he was busy working on the Inauguration. A Democratic political operative who was involved in a back-channel campaign to dissuade big-name stars from appearing at the event told me that Burnett had tried to enlist musicians to perform. “Mark was somebody we were actively working against,” the operative said. Trump’s wish list included Elton John, Aretha Franklin, and Paul Anka—who, he hoped, would sing “My Way”—but they all claimed to be otherwise engaged. The event ended up with sparse crowds and a feeble roster of performers. Burnett eventually played down his role in the Inauguration. His representatives told me that “he did not produce” the event. One person who knows Burnett pointed out, “It wasn’t successful, so he probably doesn’t want to be associated with it.” On October 8, 2016, the day after the Washington Post released the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mike bantering about grabbing women’s crotches, Bill Pruitt tweeted, “As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse.” In other interviews, Pruitt said that, during his time on “The Apprentice,” he’d heard Trump make not only sexist statements but also racist ones. This was not so difficult to imagine. Trump’s natural idiom is vulgarity, and the targets of his ire—Colin Kaepernick, “shithole countries,” any African-American journalist who asks him a tough question—are clearly not chosen at random. Part of what was mesmerizing about him, to Mark Burnett and, ultimately, to the American people, was his compulsion for offensive talk. But, in the heightened political atmosphere of an impending Trump Presidency, the notional existence of more “Trump tapes” assumed a potent urgency. Last summer, Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former “Apprentice” contestant and aide to the President, reignited such speculations when she claimed to have heard a tape, recorded during the period when “The Apprentice” was made, in which Trump said the N-word. Manigault Newman produced a recording of her own, taken surreptitiously, of a conversation with two aides from the Trump campaign, in which they appeared to discuss the existence of such a tape. On the recording, one of the aides, Lynne Patton, says that she raised the issue with Trump, and that he said he had no recollection of using such language. “No, he said it,” Katrina Pierson, the other aide, interjects. “He’s embarrassed.” On August 13, 2018, Trump denied that he had ever used racial slurs, tweeting, “@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.” This was a peculiar thing to tweet: if Trump had never uttered the epithet, why would he need to be assured by Burnett that there were no tapes of him doing so? The tweet was also notable because, when the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, Burnett had taken his most definitive step toward distancing himself from Trump. In a statement, he had said, “Given all of the false media reports, I feel compelled to clarify a few points. I am not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy. I am NOT ‘Pro-Trump.’ Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.” Trump generally answers such criticism with a hyperventilating rebuttal, but he didn’t fire back at Burnett—at least not publicly—and their friendship does not appear to have suffered. Scarcely two months after issuing his statement about not being “Pro-Trump,” Burnett attended a fund-raiser for the President-elect at Cipriani, in New York, and in January, 2017, he and his two sons flew to Washington for the Inauguration. Burnett may have wanted to downplay his friendship with the President, but Trump felt no similar compunction. Last March, at a rally in Richfield, Ohio, he announced, “I got a call from Mark Burnett! He did ‘The Apprentice,’ he’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you, did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ ” (Roseanne Barr, a rare Trump supporter in Hollywood, had just rebooted her sitcom.) “I said, ‘Mark, how big were they?’ ‘They were unbelievable! Over eighteen million people!’ ” When I asked Burnett’s representatives about the President’s characterizations of his exchanges with Burnett, they declined to either confirm or deny their accuracy. Burnett’s reluctance to discuss the Trump Presidency is dismaying to many people involved with “The Apprentice,” given that Trump has succeeded in politics, in part, by borrowing the tropes of the show. Jonathon Braun pointed out to me that when Trump announced his candidacy, in 2015, he did so in the atrium of Trump Tower, and made his entrance by descending the gold-colored escalator—choreography that Burnett and his team had repeatedly used on the show. After Trump’s announcement, reports suggested that people who had filled the space and cheered during his speech had been hired to do so, like TV extras, for a day rate of fifty dollars. Earlier this year, the White House started issuing brief video monologues from the President that strongly evoke his appearances on Burnett’s show. Justin McConney, a former director of new media for the Trump Organization, told New York that, whenever Trump works with camera people, he instructs them, “Shoot me like I’m shot on ‘The Apprentice.’ ” Randal Pinkett, who won Season 4 of “The Apprentice,” told me that he had watched Trump’s campaign with a growing sense of dread. Pinkett had long since concluded that Trump was racist. When Trump named Pinkett, who is African-American, the winner, he asked him if he would consider sharing the title with another contestant, a white woman. Pinkett declined. “The only conclusion I can draw is that he didn’t want to see a black man be the sole winner of his show,” he told me. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen said Trump told him that he had not chosen Kwame Jackson, the Goldman Sachs banker, to win in Season 1, because “there’s no way I can let this black fag win.” As a winner, Pinkett went to work for the Trump Organization. “The closer I got to Donald, the less I liked what I saw,” he recalled. “It’s like a person with bad breath.” After Pennsylvania legalized casino gambling, in 2004, Trump applied for a license to build a casino in a predominantly African-American community. “The community hated Donald,” Pinkett said. So the company dispatched Pinkett as an advocate. Upon returning, he said, “I’m not going out there again to represent you folks.” The Trump Organization was using him like a prop, he felt, and he did not want to sell a project that the community so roundly opposed. The casino was never built. Even the grand prize on “The Apprentice” was a bit of a fake, Pinkett told me. His Trump Organization job was actually paid for by NBC. “It wasn’t even his money!” he said. When Trump announced his campaign, Pinkett and Kwame Jackson decided to make a public statement opposing him. “This wasn’t about policy or politics, this was about fitness for office,” Jackson recalled. “This was about basic American character and decency.” They reached out to scores of former contestants and planned a press conference. In the end, apart from Pinkett, Jackson, and two other contestants, nobody showed up. In a statement, Trump said, “How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren’t for me.” “I think the reality for Mark Burnett is he’s a Hollywood guy,” Jackson told me. “He probably feels that if he torpedoes Donald Trump he’ll torpedo a part of his own legacy. And it’s funny, because he has enough money and enough power in Hollywood that he could actually afford to speak up.” Burnett’s silence “is abdication,” Jackson said. “It’s collusion. It’s being complicit, just like an Ivanka Trump. I’m very disappointed in Mark for that.” A recent piece in the Ankler, a widely read online newsletter about Hollywood, noted that Burnett “has spent the past couple years reigning over his corner of resistance territory with nary the slightest hint of backlash.” Donald Trump was a folk devil in Hollywood, and everyone in the industry knew about Burnett’s close association with the President, yet no prominent liberals were refusing to work with Mark Burnett. It’s one thing to “take brave stands on the red carpet,” the article observed. “But you wouldn’t want to go so crazy as to . . . get on the wrong side of a mid-sized mini-studio.” Burnett was recruited to the television arm of M-G-M in 2015, by Gary Barber, the company’s chairman and C.E.O. Barber, a former accountant, had brought the studio back from bankruptcy, slashing costs and shepherding profitable titles like the James Bond franchise. In his effort to build up M-G-M, Barber wanted to augment the studio’s television business. So he bought Burnett’s company and enlisted him to oversee television production. Ostensibly, Barber and Burnett got along. But, whereas Mark Burnett Productions had been characterized by profligate dazzle, Barber was thrifty, and monitored every expense. The chairman of M-G-M’s board is Kevin Ulrich, a financier whose private-equity fund holds a controlling stake in the company. People who know Ulrich describe him as someone who relishes the flashy perquisites of Hollywood moguldom. Whereas Barber liked to spend weekends quietly tending to the racehorses he owns, Ulrich liked going to parties and premières. Barber was interested in selling the studio—a move that Ulrich opposed. According to several sources, Burnett began cultivating Ulrich, inviting him to events and introducing him to celebrities. Then, last March, M-G-M’s board informed Barber that he had been fired; he had just signed a contract extension, so the studio would pay him two hundred and sixty million dollars to leave. Despite this payment, he was incensed. Three months after Barber’s ouster, Burnett was promoted to chairman of television at M-G-M. Barber declined to speak with me, but a friend of his said that he was “blindsided” by his ouster: Burnett had made an alliance with Ulrich and got Barber kicked off the island. As a younger man, Burnett made it known that he wasn’t content to be the producer of a few hit shows—he wanted to run a television studio one day. According to someone who has worked closely with him, Burnett had always felt like an outsider, “because in the reality-TV business, you’re never part of the true Hollywood.” He had long aspired to transition to scripted television and films but did not have much talent for such storytelling. At M-G-M, he would oversee both scripted and unscripted shows, including the acclaimed series “Fargo” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” He had now achieved such a level of power that, even in reflexively liberal Hollywood, his association with Trump was discussed mostly in whispers. Many people who spoke to me for this piece would not do so on the record, citing fears of being blacklisted. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” continues to dog Burnett. In 2017, when he took the stage at the Producers Guild of America Awards to accept the award for Outstanding Producer of Competition Television, there were boos in the audience. In September, he skipped the Emmy Awards, though “The Voice” and “Shark Tank” were nominated; the night before the ceremony, however, he and Downey attended the annual gala for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, at a hotel in Century City. Walking into the event, they had a confrontation with the actor Tom Arnold. Arnold, a wild-eyed industry veteran best known for his role in the 1994 film “True Lies” and for a former marriage to Roseanne Barr, had been on a quest to uncover damaging “Apprentice” outtakes of Donald Trump. He had even launched a gonzo TV show, produced by Vice, called “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.” As Arnold relates on the show, he and Trump knew each other for years, because they had occupied “the same level of Hollywood.” Indeed, in 2010, Burnett had e-mailed Arnold, “Is there any way I can get you to do Celeb Apprentice? . . . I do think that Celeb Apprentice has an awesome brand. Trump really wants you. I REALLY want you.” Arnold was, in his own estimation, a prankster and a marginal celebrity. And it disturbed him to think that someone just like him might be entrusted with managing the country. What precisely happened in Century City is a matter of dispute, but there was a scuffle between Arnold and Burnett. Soon afterward, Roma Downey tweeted a photograph of the back of her hand, writing, “Got this bruise tonight when Tom Arnold tried to ambush my husband Mark and me at a charity event. Is your TV show worth it Tom? Please stop.” Some observers wondered whether a bruise could have emerged that quickly. Arnold himself offered a very different account on Twitter: “Mark Burnett just went apeshit & choked me at this huge Emmy party then he ran away with his torn Pink shirt & missing gold chain. I’m waiting for LAPD.” It might seem improbable that Burnett, the smiling glad-hander, would physically attack someone. But it would not be unprecedented. His second wife, Dianne Burnett, told me that one day, in Santa Monica, Mark left her and one of their sons in the car in order to fetch frozen yogurt. While he was gone, a vagrant began aggressively banging on the car window, presumably in search of a donation. When Burnett returned, Dianne recalled, he punched the man in the face, knocking him down, then drove away. Hours after the Century City event, TMZ published an account by an eyewitness, who said that “Mark had his hands on Tom’s throat, and Tom was tearing at Mark’s shirt and ripping off his crucifix.” The authorities have declined to press charges against Burnett, and several people close to him characterized Arnold as a puerile stunt artist who cornered Burnett in a bit of performance art in order to promote his lousy show. That may well be true, but there is a certain cosmic poetry in the notion that the only person in Hollywood willing to antagonize Burnett about his relationship with Trump is a figure like Tom Arnold. Someone who has worked with Burnett told me, “Mark created the world in which Tom Arnold is the only guy who can go after him. Tom Arnold is trolling Mark Burnett just like Donald Trump trolled all his opponents. And he’s doing it for a reality show!” After Season 1 of “Survivor,” a contestant named Stacey Stillman sued CBS and Burnett, claiming that he had improperly shaped the competition by whispering to contestants about whom they should vote to eliminate. In a deposition, another cast member said that Burnett “believed that certain people would make a better TV show than others, and he did what he could to have influence over those people staying on the island.” Burnett denied any wrongdoing, and the suit was ultimately settled. One consequence of the lawsuit was that, when it came time to make “The Apprentice,” producers tried to have cameras on Donald Trump from the moment he walked onto the set until the moment he left—and all that footage was preserved. When M-G-M bought Burnett’s company, it assumed ownership of those outtakes and, after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, it had to contend with public demands to unseal the “Apprentice” tapes. Marvin Putnam, a lawyer who represents M-G-M, told me, “Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes. Period. Even if Mark Burnett wanted to release the tapes, Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes.” Putnam explained that the contracts that Trump and other cast members signed contained standard industry stipulations limiting the manner in which outtakes and other footage could be used. These are binding obligations, which means that if M-G-M were to violate them—by releasing footage not just of Trump but of anyone who appeared with him onscreen—the studio could be sued. Brian Edwards, the president of television operations at M-G-M, who has worked with Burnett for more than a decade, pointed out that, even without such legal constraints, Burnett couldn’t release the tapes—if he did, talent would refuse to work with him in the future. “If everybody in reality television knew that their outtakes were going to be made public at the first sign of pressure, what do you think would happen to the business?” Edwards asked. Neither Putnam nor Edwards would comment on whether M-G-M possesses tapes in which Trump says something offensive; nor would they say how much, if any, of the archive has been reviewed. Over the fourteen seasons hosted by Trump, nearly two hundred hours of “The Apprentice” aired on NBC. If Burnett indeed shot three hundred hours of footage for each episode, there could be some sixty thousand hours of outtakes to sift through. Most of the former “Apprentice” staffers I spoke to recalled hearing Trump speak coarsely about women. “He wasn’t going around saying ‘pussy, pussy, pussy’ all the time,” Walker said. But he regularly made comments about the bodies of female contestants and female staffers. One “Apprentice” employee told me, “He’d say, ‘How about those boobs? Wouldn’t you like to fuck her?’ ” Even so, Braun said he doubted that there was any “Apprentice” tape in which Trump uses the N-word. “I was the supervising editor on the first six seasons,” he said. “I didn’t watch every frame, but in everything I saw I didn’t hear him saying anything so horrible.” Braun noted that editors on reality shows often amuse themselves by compiling “gag” reels of a cast member’s most off-color or embarrassing moments. The producers may be barred, legally, from airing such outtakes, but that doesn’t stop editors from sharing them internally. Tom Arnold told me that he has seen one such reel from “The Apprentice,” in which Trump uses the N-word. But Braun, who is dismayed that Trump is President, is dubious. “If there was a tape, it would have spread like wildfire,” he said. Another “Apprentice” staffer made the same point: “If somebody had the goods, it would have leaked long ago. There were no Trump fans on the set. I don’t know a single person who worked on the show who voted for Trump.” Whenever Trump appeared on the show, the staffer explained, there were “at least a hundred people watching him,” with a dozen cameras capturing every angle. Live feeds were transmitted to executives not just at NBC but at corporations sponsoring the episode. The staffer continued, “In the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Donald was on a bus. He thought he was alone. He never thought he was alone in the boardroom. It was a set.” To Braun, the hunt for the tapes feels like a distraction. “We’ve seen that it doesn’t matter,” he said. “He now says plenty of things that are outwardly racist, misogynist, and fascist. It just doesn’t hurt him.” After Manigault Newman made her claims about the “Apprentice” tapes, The Economist conducted a survey, and found that seventy-seven per cent of white Trump voters felt that “it is possible that a person who uses the ‘N-word’ while in office can still be a good President.” More than a third of white Trump voters admitted to using the word themselves. One day this past fall, Burnett got a call from his first wife, Kym Gold, with whom he remains friendly. Gold was upset about what was happening in the country, and asked Burnett to intervene with Trump. “We had it out,” she told me. “I said, ‘You’ve got to help our children, for the future and safety of this country.’ ” Gold implored Burnett, “Tell him this is not a reality show. This is real life. You’re the President. You’re saying things you cannot say—to reporters, to other world leaders.” Burnett heard her out. “I’m not into politics,” he told her. “I’m not even on Twitter.” But he said that he had no intention of speaking out against Trump or of releasing any tapes. “I’m just a guy who produces shows,” he insisted. Burnett may not be a policy maven, but he has long been fascinated with political star power. In 2010, he launched “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” on TLC, announcing, “With a dynamic personality that has captivated millions, I can’t think of anyone more compelling than Sarah Palin to tell the story of Alaska.” At the time, Burnett contended that the show was “completely nonpolitical.” The Daily Beast disagreed, suggesting that it “may qualify as the earliest, most expensive Presidential campaign ad ever made.” Burnett and Trump have licensed the “Apprentice” format to dozens of other countries, and Burnett once noted that, increasingly, tycoons cast in the Trump role are “people with political aspirations.” At least half a dozen hosts have held political office, including João Doria, the governor-elect of São Paulo State, who is an ally of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s strongman President-elect. Last year, Kevin O’Leary, one of the hosts of “Shark Tank,” announced his intention of running for Prime Minister of Canada, as a member of the Conservative Party, noting that he and Trump had “both worked for Mark Burnett, and we both got famous on reality television.” Burnett joked to more than one person that he was no longer simply a TV producer but a producer of political leaders. (Four months later, O’Leary dropped out of the race and returned to the show.) For nearly two decades, Burnett has also spoken about his desire to make a television show with Vladimir Putin. In 2001, he sought to enlist Putin in a project called “Destination: Mir,” a reality competition in which the winner would be sent into space. The idea was scuttled after Russia decommissioned the Mir space station. In 2015, Burnett expressed an interest in building a reality show featuring Putin—not so much a program about politics, Burnett suggested, as a hymn to the glory of Russia, “the humans, the nature, the animals of the nation.” Burnett’s myopia about politics may be selective, but that does not mean it is feigned. He would hardly be the first Hollywood chieftain with a dim grasp of current events beyond Los Angeles, but even by industry standards he can seem remarkably disconnected. Shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, this past February, Burnett attended a regular meeting of television executives at M-G-M. At one point, someone mentioned the marketing plan for a project in the studio’s film division: a remake of “Death Wish,” starring Bruce Willis. The movie, about an armed vigilante, was unabashedly pro-gun—Breitbart eventually hailed it as an “N.R.A. Public Service Announcement.” Someone asked whether M-G-M would be altering the rollout of the film, in light of the shooting. “What shooting?” Burnett said, according to someone outside M-G-M who was briefed on the meeting. When his incredulous colleagues wondered how he could not have been aware of the Parkland massacre, Burnett said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” adding, “I’m not on social media.” For all Burnett’s talk about being nonpolitical, his reluctance to disavow the President may stem, in part, from a fear of alienating Trump’s constituents. Like Republican lawmakers or evangelical pastors, Burnett is beholden to a faction of the public that, in many instances, thinks the President can do no wrong. “The moment you go political, you turn half of the nation against you,” Rick Warren told me. “And, when you’re trying to reach as many people as you can, you don’t want to do that.” The dilemma is compounded, Warren pointed out, when the occupant of the White House is so vindictive. “You know the way this President chews up people?” Warren said. “There’s a fine line in what you can say.” Katherine Walker suggested that part of the reason Burnett seems so unfazed by the role he has played in the Trump saga may be that he is British. “There is something to being American and having these visceral reactions that Mark doesn’t have,” she said. “He just doesn’t get it on that level. I don’t think he has the same sense of Oh, my God, what have I done?” For many Americans, the Trump Presidency evokes a painful feeling of dispossession, as cherished norms and national institutions are eviscerated. “People are making it seem like Mark’s ignoring evil,” Walker continued. “But I think it’s more benign than that—and scarier, in a way. He doesn’t care. He just wants to stay out of it.” “Mark is extremely smart,” Richard Levak, the psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “The Apprentice,” told me. “Mark has an eye for casting, and he cast Donald Trump.” I asked Levak what kind of personality profile he might have prepared for Trump as a candidate for the show. He said he would have noted “the energy, the impulsiveness, the inability to articulate a complete thought because he gets interrupted by emotions, so when he speaks it’s all adjectives—‘great,’ ‘huge,’ ‘horrible.’ ” What made Trump so magnetic as a reality-television star was his impulse to transgress, Levak continued, and it is the same quality that has made a captive audience of the world. “That somebody can become that successful while also being that emotionally undisciplined—it’s so macabre that you have to watch it,” he said. “And you keep waiting for the comeuppance. But it doesn’t come.” There has likely never been a man who, in his own lifetime, has been as widely spoken and written about as Donald Trump. Politics has never been so spellbinding. “It’s the reason people watch a schoolyard fight,” Levak said. “It’s vicariously watching someone act out and get away with it.” Burnett once remarked that “Lord of the Flies” is so absorbing because all the characters are suddenly transported into a world in which “the rules are changed, and convention, law, and morality are suspended.” It’s an apt paraphrase of the Trump Presidency. On Sunday afternoons, Burnett likes to pour himself a generous glass of wine and stroll out onto the balcony of his seven-thousand-square-foot home, off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. He and Downey refer to the property, which was undamaged by the recent wildfires, as the Sanctuary. It is an exquisite spot, with white couches facing an unbroken view of the ocean. Burnett likes to reflect on the fact that his mansion is not far from one of the homes where, as a young immigrant, he worked as a nanny. He is on social media, as it happens. He seldom tweets, but he’s active on Instagram. Along with family snapshots and photographs of Burnett palling around with celebrities and religious figures, there are a couple of videos he has taken of himself relaxing on the balcony. “Lazy Sunday afternoon,” Burnett says in one of them. He is barefoot, wearing a T-shirt that says “SPIRITUAL GANGSTER.” He gestures at his expansive view, with undisguised satisfaction, and says, “Look at this. Wow.” He pans the camera across the sky, which is just starting to bruise red and violet in the twilight. “So grateful,” Burnett says. He often expresses wonderment at how blessed he is, and at the magnitude of his success—which, these days, he ascribes to “God’s favor.” When I remarked to Jonathon Braun that Burnett seems eerily untroubled by the legacy of his own creation, he said that, for Burnett, the Presidency was just another game. He went on, “I think it’s a game for Trump, too. It’s a game for the audience. I think the voters like it. They’re enjoying the spectacle. It’s in the soul of who Mark is. They’re kindred spirits. There are no major causes driving them—it’s just about playing a game and winning it.” Years ago, when Burnett did publicity for “Survivor,” interviewers tried to figure out how the contestants had fared that season. Of course, he could not reveal such secrets. So when they asked Burnett who would win the game, he told them, “Me.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

During Saturday’s edition of Watters’ World, Fox News host Jesse Watters brought up a glaring double standard when it comes to the media’s treatment of children: “Remember the Parkland shooter situation where everybody was going after the students and people immediately said you cannot go after students, you cannot say anything about students, they’re minors?” Watters contrasted the media’s treatment of the Parkland children with their treatment of the Covington kids: “You had the entire mainstream media establishment and celebrities descend on these high school students, smearing them, calling them racist, digging into their backgrounds, digging into the school, and no one said anything. Huge double standard.” Watters interviewed Robert Barnes, the attorney representing several of the Covington kids and their families. Barnes went through a list of people and media organizations he was thinking of suing for refusing to retract slanderous statements about the teenagers; including Maggie Haberman of The New York Times, former CNN host Reza Aslan, Matthew Dowd of ABC News, actor Michael Rapaport, and The New York Daily News. Towards the end of the conversation, Barnes summarized the negative effect the media’s rush to judgment has had on the Covington kids: “the worst part was some of the most institutionally powerful people in the establishment press lied and defamed them and it could destroy their careers, it could destroy their reputations, it could destroy their futures, and it’s made their current life a living hell.”    Looking back at the media activism in the wake of the Parkland shooting, Watters definitely has a point. The media rushed to the defense of Douglas High School student David Hogg, who used his platform in the weeks following the mass shooting to push for gun control, when Fox News host Laura Ingraham sent out a tweet making light of a few colleges rejecting Hogg. CNN host Alisyn Camerota gave Hogg a platform to declare war on Ingraham by highlighting his successful attempts to convince advertisers to boycott her show in the wake of her controversial comment; which she ultimately apologized for. Despite the best efforts of the networks to buoy Hogg’s boycott campaign, viewership of Ingraham’s primetime show rose by 20 percent during the course of the boycott.  The media’s treatment of the Parkland students turned gun control activists, whom Camerota dubbed “influential voices,” stands in stark contrast to their treatment of the Covington kids; whom they described as “racist” and equated with Neo-Nazis and segregationists. As Watters pointed out during his aside on media bias, “it seems like all minors should be off limits.” For most of the media, that sacroscanct rule only seems to apply to minors who support progressive causes; such as gun control.  When it comes to minors who support conservative causes, such as the pro-life movement, not only are the kids themselves not “off-limits,” their schools become target of left-wing media activist movements such as #ExposeChristianSchools.  The media’s treatment of the Covington kids proves that it might be time to start a new hashtag: #ExposetheMainstreamMedia.

Watters’ World 01/26/19 08:13 PM  JESSE WATTERS: All right, here with more, Robert Barnes, an attorney representing several students and families from Covington Christian High School. All right, Mr. Barnes, there’s been some really, really horrible things said about these boys from Covington. Have you issued any warning to these people that have been trafficking in a lot of this slanderous activity on the internet? ROBERT BARNES: Yes, to a wide range of people. So, Maggie Haberman is one of the first people who was calling for the kids’ expulsion. WATTERS: The New York Times reporter. BARNES: You had the lead New York Times reporter, making false statements about these kids, calling for punitive action against these kids, whom she’s never met, who are private citizens, based on an event she didn’t even witness. It really tells you something about the standard of the New York Times that something like that could happen. But also others, Congresswoman Omar made false statements about these kids. We requested that she retract it or we would sue her. An hour later, she did retract it; to her credit. But others have not retracted. So some have; Kathy Griffin has, Jake Tapper has. WATTERS: Oh. You got Kathy Griffin to retract? BARNES: Meghan McCain has. WATTERS: That’s a big…that’s a big retraction, she often times does not retract. I see someone, Reza Aslan, this guy has appeared on The Daily Show, on CNN a lot, here’s what he said. He said, “Honest question. Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid’s?”  He has not retracted that. BARNES: That’s correct, and he’s going to get sued next week. WATTERS: Wow. BARNES: Similarly, Matthew Dowd, there’s been a request that he retract. He’s re…he’s an ABC commentator, pretends to be a Republican commentator, he’s made false statements about these kids, refused to retract it and he did it interspersing it with statements about how we should love each other consistent with the Christian tradition. If he doesn’t retract, he’s going to get sued. Michael Rapaport did a crude, a rap sort of image against these kids. He’s refused to retract, he’s a famous Hollywood actor that’s on a Netflix show about how we should avoid childhood bullying of kids, and here he is bullying kids. WATTERS: That’s ironic. BARNES: So, several…New York Daily News put a false headline out that various kids from the school had appeared in black face; totally false. They’ve been at a black out, which is very common throughout the country at high school basketball games. WATTERS: Are you going to go after The New York Daily News for that? BARNES: They are going to get sued. WATTERS: Oh, they are going to get sued. BARNES: Oh yeah, The New York Daily News will be sued. WATTERS: So everyone’s getting sued, it seems like. Now, from my limited understanding of the law, I did not go to law school, it’s a very high bar, the slander and the libel. I mean, you have to show malicious intent, knowingly that something is wrong and defamatory and it doesn’t always work in court. Are you confident that you are going to be able to secure judgments? BARNES: Yes because in this case there is a unique exception so when there is a defamation and libel of private citizens, particularly minors, then the legal standard goes way down. WATTERS: Yeah. BARNES: So you no longer have to prove actual malice or malevolent intent. All you have to prove is that a false statement was made or in Kentucky, the law is even broader; an unflattering impression given to put a person’s reputation in a false light. And otherwise, and just that it be negligent for them to do so. That’s why the whole family gave everybody 48 hours to correct all of these statements. If they still refuse do so, it’s clearly negligent for them to keep false statements out. WATTERS: Now, you know what strikes me as amazing? Remember the Parkland shooter situation, where everybody was going after the students and people immediately said you cannot go after students, you cannot say anything about students, they’re minors. Yet you had the entire mainstream media establishment and celebrities descend on these high school students, smearing them, calling them racist, digging into their backgrounds, digging into the school and no one said anything. Huge double standard. It seems like all minors should be off limits. You have spoken to these kids; I know you are in regular discussion. What, what are their spirits like?  Because I know going forward, I mean, they could have potential problems with college admissions, with their resumes. You know, their online profiles are permanently damaged as a result of this. How are they doing? BARNES: It’s been brutal. They, they described it as complete hell. They described it as one of the most difficult weeks they’ve ever lived in their lives. These are kids who have, they have been told they can’t use social media, they are being subjected to internal investigations to cover up for the failure of other people to properly identify this at the…in the school authority system. So, they have been through one of the most difficult, you know, they went to D.C. to participate in one of our greatest political traditions, expressing their political viewpoint and instead they get ambushed by lefty agitator provocateur advocates who then lie about them. But that wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was some of the most institutionally powerful people in the establishment press lied and defamed them and it could destroy their careers, it could destroy their reputations, it could destroy their futures, and it’s made their current life a living hell. WATTERS: Well, I’m glad there’s some accountability because if there’s no accountability, it’s going to continue to happen. Robert, thanks very much and keep us posted on the lawsuits, I mean, if you don’t even win, at least you’re going to grind them to dust in legal fees. I appreciate you coming on. BARNES: Yeah, the goal is to send a message that they’ll remember. WATTERS: Exactly. Robert, thank you very much.

236,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/594349230/0/milwaukee/home~MVP-ceremony-aposBrewers-On-Deckapos-cap-fantastic-hectic-first-year-with-club-for-Christian-Yelich/,"For the second time in almost exactly a year, Christian Yelich found himself on the private plane of Milwaukee Brewers principal owner Mark Attanasio, zipping across the country from Los Angeles, providing ample time to contemplate just how much his life had changed. One year earlier, Yelich had been traded to Milwaukee from the Miami Marlins, and sat quietly in the back of the corporate jet en route to “Brewers On Deck,” listening to conversations of what he called “Brewers royalty” – Robin Yount, Bob Uecker, Ryan Braun, and of course, Attanasio. On Thursday, Yelich was back on Air Attanasio, flying past Milwaukee to New York City to do some promotional work and accept the National League most valuable player award at the annual Baseball Writers Association of America dinner. The team’s traveling party came back late at night to be on hand for another “On Deck.” As trite as the phrase might be at times, what a difference a year makes, especially in the life of Yelich. What had been a whirlwind 12 months was capped by an even whirlier 24 hours or so, including an appearance Sunday at the team's annual fan festival at the Wisconsin Center. RELATED: Attanasio salutes passion of Brewers' fan base RELATED: Nelson boldly predicts he'll be on opening-day roster NOTES: Brewers likely to utilize platoon at second base RELATED: Five fun takeaways from On Deck fan experience Asked what the last 48 hours had been like, Yelich said, “Very busy, but a lot of fun at the same time. I’m enjoying the experience and everything that is included. Obviously, in New York yesterday and got here early this morning, or late at night, depending on how you look at it. Excited to be here.” Yelich’s hectic stretch actually extended far beyond the last two days, however. A few weeks after the Brewers were eliminated by Los Angeles in Game 7 of the NLCS, he was named NL MVP by a 29-1 vote of baseball writers. Almost simultaneously, wildfires in California nearly consumed his family’s home in Thousand Oaks as well as his own in Malibu. There was also the mass shooting in a nearby club that shocked the community. Rather than bask in the glory of his MVP award and take it easy, Yelich joined Brewers teammate Ryan Braun, former teammate Mike Moustakas, Mike Attanasio, son of the team owner, and others to form “California Strong,” an organization designed to raise money for victims of the fires and shooting. Those efforts included a recent celebrity softball game at Pepperdine University that Yelich said had raised $1.5 million to date. Not exactly a peaceful, quite off-season, but Yelich said he had no regrets for his busy schedule. “It’s been a lot, obviously,” he said. “Just everything that comes with the award and all the California Strong stuff that comes with that. Just taking it all in stride, learning on the fly. It has been all good things. “It’ has been busy. I’m handling it. Excited to get back to work (with spring training approaching).” #Brewers Christian Yelich talks about his very busy offseason including getting MVP Award on Saturday night in NYC. pic.twitter.com/iVVo1QbQel Of his experiences, on and off the field, since being traded to the Brewers a year ago, Yelich said, “It has been a wild ride, a crazy 12 months. Basically, all this is happening a year apart. If you told me everything that would happen in those next twelve months, I definitely wouldn’t have believed you. It definitely makes you grateful for all the experiences.” Among those in attendance at the awards ceremony Saturday night at the New York Hilton were Brewers general manager David Stearns and manager Craig Counsell, who introduced Yelich. Stearns, who swung the deal with Miami that netted Yelich, said it was a momentous occasion for both player and team. “That’s a special event,” Stearns said. “First and foremost, it’s a special event for Christian and his family. It’s a recognition of a tremendous amount of hard work he’s put in to get there. It’s also a meaningful moment for the organization. It was a privilege to be there. “It was really fun to see him go through the process and really soak it in. I think it probably hit him a little last night what he had accomplished. I think he recognized he was on a stage with a bunch of Hall of Famers and really good players. And he belonged up there. That’s pretty special.” Becoming a league MVP is a transformation moment in a player’s career, and Counsell said it was quite evident from the persistence of autograph hounds that Yelich no longer was Milwaukee's secret. “He’s a superstar in the world,” Counsell said. “We had people chasing our car down last night down the streets in New York. It’s different. He won the MVP. That makes life different. That’s a challenge in itself. “What we all feel great about is the foundation that Christian has. We know it’s a very good one. He knows how to handle it. We’re very confident because he gets it. We’re very confident that he’ll handle all these new things that get thrown at you and get thrown in front of you, and he’ll handle them well.” #Brewers GM David Stearns was asked if he had any concerns about the busy offseason of Christian Yelich. pic.twitter.com/HTdVdAie0N That being said, the Brewers’ brain trust has been mindful of Yelich’s hectic off-season, already shortened by the team’s playoff run deep into October. He’ll have a couple of weeks to kick back somewhat before the start of spring training but Stearns said Yelich will not be asked to extend himself in the early action of exhibition season. “I’ve talked to him about it a little bit,” Stearns said. “I think he understands this has been a little bit of a different off-season. I think he’s also committed to exhale for the next week and a half, or so. Then, we’ll make sure we take care of him in camp. “I think his body is ready; physically he feels great. If we need to give him some mental breaks, we’ll certainly do that.” Yelich said getting back to playing baseball actually will feel less stressful. After all, it’s what he does best, as attested by the MVP award he said was safely tucked away during the “On Deck” event. “Being a baseball player is most important, first and foremost,” Yelich said. “Obviously, there are other obligations that come with everything. You just need to balance it and take it in stride, but at the same time be mindful of your time and prioritize everything and what is most beneficial.” “Life has changed a little bit but I’m taking it all in stride and learning along the way. It’s been a blast. It’s been a lot of fun. I’m just really excited to get back to playing baseball and pick up where we left off as a team and seeing if we can make that next step.” Bucks 117, Pacers 89: A barrage of three-pointers erases any doubt  Packers at Vikings preview: Predictions, 5 things to watch  Former Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw signs with Blue Jays   FOLLOW JS SPORTS: Like our Facebook Page for the latest news DOWNLOAD THE APP: Get the latest news, sports and more ",2019-01-27 18:12:54,"MVP ceremony, &apos;Brewers On Deck&apos; cap fantastic, hectic first year with club for Christian Yelich",baseball,36,http://www.jsonline.com/

And there was some interesting insight that came out the way questions were either asked or answered or not.  ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes.  So the main focus of the  phone call was to talk about the report and the main takeaway from this was to show the direct impacts of climate change on Americans' lives.  Usually these reports are from a global standpoint, but this was really a focus on the United States.  They talked about the three industries that would be most impacted, real estate, health care, and agriculture being those.   But probably the most interesting thing about that phone call was at the end they did a question and answer segment, and they had numerous people ask about the timeline of this being issued Friday.  But one person directly asked, they said this is the official White House climate report, and it says climate change is real.  But you have the president of the United States saying it's not.  What are we supposed to believe, the White House report or the White House spokesperson? And they refused to answer it.  The moderator simply would not allow any of these panelists to answer that question.  I just found that odd that these are the scientists, they wrote the report, and they're not even really allowed to answer that simple question.   PAUL:  Did you get a sense they wanted to answer the question?  Did anybody start to answer?   CHINCHAR:  You could hear, things like that where people would start to, but the moderator, and I know that's their job is to decide who gets to answer the question.  But I did get the sense that if they were allowed, maybe not all of them, but some of them would have liked to have answered that question.   SAVIDGE:  What about the question of timing.  In other words, you release this at a time when -- CHINCHAR:  The moderator shut that one down as well.  Their response to that was simply we want the focus of this to be about the content of this, not about the timing of release.   PAUL:  So with that said, Kim, just so the viewers know, Kim Cobb, of course, with us now, that you go to Christmas Island every two weeks. This is your area of study.  Christmas Island in the Pacific, of course.  Is what you heard from this report, does it correlate with what you found in 18 years of research?   KIM COBB, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, GEORGIA TECH UNIVERSITY:  Yes, absolutely.  So as a climate scientist, some of us are in the business of digging back into the past to look at climate extremes before the rise of carbon dioxide.  And of course what we see locked into records is coming up into the present, things are getting warmer, and the natural climate extremes that I study are getting more extreme, perfectly consistent with the findings of this report.   PAUL:  And how -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Martin. SAVIDGE:  I was just going to ask, we've had a number of reports that have been done over the years.  What makes this one so important, and why should we carefully look at it?  COBB:  Yes.  I think these reports come out every several years, and  this one I think caught my eye because it has ratcheted up some impacts that we had bigger uncertainties about in the past, and now with this report they are becoming clearer than ever.  And that's unfortunately in the worst direction.  So sea level estimates have ticked up.  Our attribution of climate extremes has improved since the last report.   And so now we're really facing with a lot more certainty some of the very, very damaging types of climate exchange and impacts.  And unfortunately, this report is just another exclamation mark on a year of dizzying records with wildfires, temperature extremes, heat waves, and of course the hurricane season in the southeast.   PAUL:  So are we in the thick of this now based on what you ticked down, the list of what we're dealing with, or can you give us, Allison, some sort of a timeline when we're going to see this ratcheted up, or again, are we in it?   [10:05:01] CHINCHAR:  So you have some aspects that are already taking place.  You have coastal flooding, places like Florida, the Carolinas, up and down the east coast.  They call it sunny day flooding in Florida where it is not raining but they're getting those floods from the tides.  It is a great example of that sea level rise.   Other things, it really is, it's going to take several more decades before you really start to notice large scale issues with.  But the fact of this report was not just to chalk -- and I think that's what separates this report.  This wasn't just the here is the doom and gloom.  This specific report actually gave solutions to the problem. Here's how we can fix the ones that are happening now, and here's how we can fix the ones that we know will happen down the road.   PAUL:  What solution stood out?   CHINCHAR:  So they talk about certain things in areas of the west. They have this drought program that's already existed and it is meant for farmers and ranchers on how they can to start to prepare for drought, for heatwaves, and how it would affect their livestock.  The Acadiana Group in Louisiana that basically was created to help assess flooding risks for areas along the southeast.  So again, you have these programs that are already being established to help look into the future of what can we do to mitigate some of these issues that we know will take place.   SAVIDGE:  Professor, is it too late?  Can we still prevent it?   COBB:  Absolutely not.  We have so much work to do.  And so, as Allison was saying, some of that work is just reading into those regional reports, the report has region by region what are the expected impacts, and thinking about how scientists can work with people in their communities and policymakers to protect those communities today from the impacts that are coming down the pike today, actually.  And so the other bucket of the recommendations that they make is of course to get on top of our emissions and start to make sure that we are not baking in more risk than we need to.  It is absolutely not too late and we really have time to get to work.   But this report does stress that the time to do so is now.  And it is really important for American health and well-being and economic prosperity that we take this very seriously.   PAUL:  Allison Chinchar and Kim Cobb, we appreciate you both being here.  Thank you.   SAVIDGE:  Breaking news in Paris.  Demonstrators are taking to the streets over rising fuel costs, gathering in the French capital to express frustration with President Emmanuel Macron after tax hikes on diesel and gas.  Macron is also pushing incentives to purchase electric vehicles.   PAUL:  Police are using tear gas, and, you can see there, water cannons to combat some of the, now we're told 8,000 protesters that have assembled there.  Government officials are blaming far right extremists for inflaming the tensions there.  CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann is live in Paris for us.  And Jim, I know you are standing right above this crowd along the Champs-Elysees. What are you seeing, hearing, feeling at this hour?   JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We're now six hours into the protest today.  I'll just show you a little bit of what's going on right at our doorstep downstairs on the Champs- Elysees.  These are yellow vested protesters, people who are protesting the rise in gas prices, but they've been joined by a lot of other people that are protesting all sorts of things, high taxes in France, the high cost of living.  There are some pensioners in the crowd worried about their pensions and their retirement. And they have been going up and down the avenue, the police have been using the water cannon, you maybe able to see it in the background there in action.  And setting barricades out and then setting fire to barricades, which is what we have seen practically all afternoon long here.  It does not seem to be at this point that the crowd is dispersing, but on the other hand the overall crowd is substantially smaller than the crowds that gathered in France a week ago.  This started with a crowd of 230,000 people across the country.  Today according to the interior minister it's about 23,000.  So a substantially less number of protesters out, but these on the Champs- Elysees have been far more dramatic than we saw last week, in fact probably as dramatic as I've ever seen on the Champs-Elysees.   Authorities said they were going to try to keep people away from here because of all the high value stores and fashion boutiques and what not, and clearly that did not happen.  Christi, Martin?   SAVIDGE:  Jim, the explosions and sounds that we're hearing in the background, what are they?   BITTERMANN:  Well, they're basically -- some of them flash bombs that the police are using, and some tear gas.  But also, the other thing is the demonstrators have brought with them fireworks, and we have seen a number of demonstrators set off fireworks, that's really what the explosions are.  There's nothing that, as far as I can tell, that has caused much damage, although we did see one demonstrator injured a short while ago who was right next to one of these when they went off. And we have seen, as you can probably hear in the background, a regrouping of the protesters as the police try to move in to push them off the avenue.   [10:10:08] PAUL:  So Jim, we're listening to that as well and we're looking at these pictures, and I am wondering, President Macron has to be watching this as well.  You mentioned earlier how low his approval rating is right now.  Is there any indication how the government is going to address this?   BITTERMANN:  There is some, Christi.  In fact, President Macron said that he is going to address the situation on Tuesday.  We're not sure what he is going to do.  I would suspect there might be a decrease in the gas tax announced or something like that, but he doesn't have a whole lot of room to maneuver here, given the economy in France and that sort of thing.  And he's also been very resolute about saying that he is going to carry out government reforms.  Some of the protesters today, for example, are against the reforms he announced from the first days in his office, the reforms to the labor laws in this country.  He said that's what we have to do to get the economy moving here.  That was met very positively by a lot of businessmen in the country, but now two years after those reforms were announced, in fact this is what we are having on the streets as people feel the bite of the reforms and the high taxes and whatnot.  Christi?   PAUL:  Jim Bittermann, I'll say it again, take good care of yourself and your team there.  Thank you, sir.  We appreciate it.   All right, so while much of the focus is on climate change right now in Washington, there is a deadline looming there.  In a little more than a month, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives.   SAVIDGE:  Let's bring in CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny.  Jeff, President Trump's financial ties to Saudi Arabia is near the top of the Democrats' agenda, but it is not the only thing.   JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  It is not the only thing, Martin.  This really is the last month that the president will be enjoying a full Republican control of the House and Senate.  And he's already getting early sign of what some Democrats who will be coming into House of Representatives to assume control of their investigations and oversight, of what they're looking at.   And one of the things, Adam Schiff, he's the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said yesterday that he in fact wants to look at any links between the Trump administration, the Trump Organization, and Saudi Arabia, financial links.  Of course one thing else on the list for Democrats is the finances of the Trump Organization, his tax returns, something he has never wanted to give up.  So something is going to change in Washington.  We'll see how successful Democrats are in getting these from the president.   But without question, it is going to be a new era, a new moment for the president when the new year begins.  But before that, the president on the golf course here in south Florida, he is thinking about some changes of his cabinet.  He says he may have some before too long here.  But as of now, sunny day in Florida.  I think it's pretty much a vacation weekend for the president.   PAUL:  Jeff Zeleny, I hope you enjoy a little bit of the sunshine yourself.  Thank you.   SAVIDGE:  And breaking news this hour.  The gunman in an Alabama mall shooting Thanksgiving night still on the loose.   PAUL:  Here's the thing.  Authorities now say the 21-year-old man killed by an officer at the mall, quote, likely did not fire the rounds that injured two people.  CNN reporter Natasha Chen with us now.  So essentially they're saying there was misidentification here of who the culprit.   NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So overnight the Hoover police department released this statement on Facebook, and the statement said our department does not typically issue media updates during an internal investigation, but there was information discussed with local media last night that merits update and clarification.  The initial report was that two men gotten into a fight of some kind at the mall that resulted in a 21-year-old shooting an unarmed 18-year- old, and that victim was taken to the hospital.   The update now says the 21-year-old identified as Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim. Police say Bradford did flee the scene and brandished his weapon. That's when an armed Hoover police officer who was working mall security shot and killed him.   So if he is not the one who shot the 18-year-old, there's someone out there who did.  Police say they now believe there were more than two people involved in the initial fight.  They say at least one gunman is still at large who could be responsible for the 18-year-old victim as well as a 12-year-old girl who caught in the crossfire.  She was also taken to the hospital.   I reached out to the agency that has taken over this investigation to find out exactly how many suspects they're looking for, and whether they believe Bradford fired any rounds at all.  Last we heard the officer involved in the shooting is on administrative leave while they investigate.   [10:15:01] PAUL:  Natasha Chen, thank you for the update.   SAVIDGE:  And still to come, an American was killed during a mission trip to a remote island near India.  We talked to a leader of the organization he was affiliated with and got her reaction to the news.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAUL:  So we have some new details this morning about a letter an American missionary wrote just before he was killed on an island near India.  John Chau gave the letter to fisherman before he left their boat for the island.   SAVIDGE:  And it shows that he knew the tribes, people living in isolation there, were dangerous.  Chau wrote, ""You guys might think I am crazy in all this, but I think it is worth it to declare Jesus to these people.  Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed.""  CNN's Polo Sandoval has more details.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is one of the oldest and most isolated tribes in the world.  Authorities say they're responsible for last week's killing of American missionary John Allen Chau.   [10:20:06] This archived footage from Survival International provides some of the few existing images of the tribe known as the Sentinelese. They live in complete isolation on the tiny island of North Sentinel. According to Indian officials, Chau illegally paid fisherman to take him to the isolated island hoping to convert the tribe to Christianity.  Authorities believe he first canoed to shore on November 16th, deliberately disregarding an established perimeter around the island.   According to journal entries left with the fisherman and shared with the ""Washington Post,"" the 26-years-old wrote, ""I hollered my name is John.  I love you.  And Jesus loves you.""  He was then reportedly shot at by a member of the tribe with an arrow, piercing his bible.  The next day, Chau made a second attempt, but never returned.   The fisherman he hired later reported seeing the young man's body buried on the beach by tribe members.  Chau's last entry in his journal reads ""You guys might think I'm crazy in all this, but I think it is worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people.  God, I don't want to die.""  In 2006, the same tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing near their island.  Survival Interview, a group advocating for tribal people, believe the natives decision to be remain isolated should be respected.   SOPHIE GRIG, SURVIVAL INTERNATIONAL SENIOR RESEARCHER:  They've made it very clear they don't want contact.  Somebody comes, they have no idea what he is coming for and why.  I think it is far more self- defense than it is murder.   SANDOVAL:  On social media, Chau's family wrote their son loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people, and forgive those reportedly responsible for his death, the wrote.  All they can do is wait to do is find out when or if their son's body will be recovered.   Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.   (END VIDEOTAPE) SAVIDGE:  Earlier we spoke to Mary Ho, the international executive leader of the missionary organization John Chau worked for, and we got her perspective on the trip.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY HO, INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE LEADER, ALL NATIONS:  He has been preparing his whole life for this.  We knew he was very well prepared. There were several people who would have been happy to go with him, but this is typical of John.  I think he did not want to endanger other people's lives.  And so finally he went alone.  And that was his decision.  But there were others who were willing to go with him.   (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL:  Breaking news out of Paris right now.  Protesters clashing with police on the Champs-Elysees.  Tear gas, water cannons all being used to try to suppress the demonstrators who are angry about rising fuel prices.  We have the latest from Paris, next.   SAVIDGE:  And then a devastating government assessment warns unchecked climate change will cost thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.  What will the president do about it?   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:27:24] SAVIDGE:  We are continuing to follow breaking news out of Paris.  Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest rising fuel costs.  Police have now fired tear gas, water cannons have been brought to bear as well to try to disperse the crowd.  This has grown in the level of violence that we have been witnessing, not only the response from authorities but there are fires that are now being set on the streets of Paris.  There are the sounds of explosions, a combination of flash bangs that are being used by authorities as well as fireworks that are being used by the protesters.   All of this was sparked as a result of the government implementation of new taxes on fuel, gasoline and diesel, and this is the result of people in opposition.  But also, it appears there is a lot more to it than just fuel taxes.  Again, we'll continue to monitor the situation as you look at what is happening on the streets of Paris this morning.  Right now, President Trump is golfing at his Mar-a-Lago estate, spending the weekend talking to potential candidates for vacant positions in his administration.  Meanwhile, a new government report says if you don't do something about climate change, thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars will be lost.  Remember, the president has consistently called climate change a hoax.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.   I don't think it is a hoax, I think there's probably a difference, but I don't know that it is manmade.  I will say this.  I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars, I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs, I don't want to be put at a disadvantage.   I have a strong opinion.  I want great climate.  (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL:  President Trump hasn't responded to the assessment yet of this newest report, but some members of Congress have.  Senator Angus King tweeted in part, ""We're staring a threat in the face.  Now is not the time for denials, excuses, or equivocation.  Now is the time for action.""  Democratic strategist Kevin Cate with us, as well as CNN political commentator Scott Jennings.  Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.   Scott, I want to ask you, how do people reconcile this report by all of these scientists who are in the Trump administration with the president who continually denies the existence of it?   [10:30:04] SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, I think the president is grappling with a serious issue here, and that is how to deal with what is clearly a real thing.  I mean, I don't think climate change is a hoax.  The climate is changing.  And then on the other end of it you are trying to figure out what actions can we take that would help counteract it, but at the same time not immediately devastate people in economic regions that are more sensitive to it than others, say in Appalachia where the coal industry is still important.   So that's what a U.S. president has to grapple with.  That's what policymakers have to grapple with.  I do think that some acknowledgment that climate change is real would be a good thing, and then we can have a real debate about how to deal with it without making too many short-term changes that would displace people out of an economy they depend on.   PAUL:  Kevin, how hopeful are you that the potency of the report might bring some sort of legislation?   KEVIN CATE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I'm not optimistic.  I appreciate what Scott said because he is acknowledging climate change as a real and urgent threat.  And I think what this report does is put it in terms of the pocketbook.  It talks about the jobs that we'll lose.  It talks about the health care that is going to be lost and the complications that are going to happen.  I live in Florida.  I know Scott is in Appalachia.  It is affecting the coal industry there. It's affecting Florida right now.  This is an urgent issue.  If you go down to Miami Beach during king tide, this is an urgent issue that is costing jobs, it's costing tourism.  I think if the president, if we can get him to care, maybe it's about the electoral math in 2020 and how important Florida is, because if we don't have a candidate who understands how urgent this is in Florida and throughout the country, they're not going to win Florida because this is that important.   PAUL:  Scott, talk about that.  If there aren't some Republicans getting on board with this, what is the political ramification of that?   JENNINGS:  Well, I think if we continue to see weather events that are portrayed as being caused by or made more extreme by climate change, that will be more on the minds of voters in 2020.  Of course, any of these issues and their impact on an election really depends on if the candidates themselves make it a top priority.  My suspicion is this will be a top priority in the Democratic primary for president.  The real issue, of course, would be if either candidate makes it a top priority in the general election.   I do think it is important we look at what the United States has done over the last several years.  I think sometimes these stories are portrayed as though nothing has been done.  I did note that a report from Agriculture Department said that since 2004, North America's share of fossil fuel emissions has fallen 24 percent down to 17 percent, going up to 2013.  So I think there has been some progress made.   PAUL:  But without the president's support, can progress continue to be made?   JENNINGS:  Without the president's support, no legislation would be signed into law, if that's what you're looking for.  But that doesn't mean the free market can't continue to innovate.  Another core issue here is, will consumers demand more environmentally friendly technologies, will they demand more electric cars, for instance.  So I think there's two ends to this.  There's the government response, but then there is also will the market respond to consumers if they make it a priority in their own spending.   PAUL:  Real quickly, switching gears here, Adam Schiff has said that he wants to investigate the president and Saudi Arabia and any business ties that are in existence there.  Kevin, is this the way for Democrats to finally get what they have been looking for, the president's tax records?   CATE:  Well, I think it is important to get to the truth of any of this.  It is certainly concerning that he is coming out, defending the Saudis in relation to what potentially may have happened there and what our intelligence community, the way that we understand it, is leaning towards.  So I think it is important to get to the truth. But I don't think Democrats are going to lose focus on the pocketbook issue that got them the majority, which is super important.  We know that people don't like President Trump, we know we elected the ""National Enquirer,"" some that's womanizing, uses racist language, and denies truths like climate change or the crisis in health care.  We know all that.  We have to give people a reason to vote for something. So going down the path of why you shouldn't like President Trump, it is probably not a great strategy in the short term or the long term when it comes -- PAUL:  Scott, I have 10 seconds.  I want to give you a chance to react to that.   JENNINGS:  Yes, look, I expect Democrats to investigate anything and everything.  I think overreach is definitely possible here with this new Democratic majority.  They ought to be careful because it could back fire before the next election.   PAUL:  Kevin Cate, Scott Jennings, I'm sorry we ran out of time, gentlemen, but thank you for being here so much.   JENNINGS:  Thank you.   CATE:  Thank you.   SAVIDGE:  The NRA and doctors across the country are going head to head over gun violence, and the images being used make the point a graphic.  We talk to a doctor about it next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:39:34] SAVIDGE:  Two groups you might not expect to be at odds, doctors and the National Rifle Association.  We have to warn you, some of the images we're going to show you are graphic.  Doctors have been posting tweets like these showing themselves covered in blood from gunshot victims.  It is response to the NRA telling doctors to, quote, stay in their lane when it comes to gun violence prevention.   CNN's Brian Todd has the details.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) [10:40:00] BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In the aftermath of two deadly mass shootings, a heated political showdown between two unlikely rivals, the National Rifle Association and doctors that treat victims of gun violence.  The fight stems from a recent article published by American College of Physicians, calling firearm violence, quote, ""a public health crisis that requires the nation's immediate attention.""  Doctors shared new recommendations on how physicians can help reduce gun violence, such as counseling patients on the risks of having firearms in the home.   But the doctors also weighed in on issues of background checks and illegal gun sales.  That prompted this tweet from the NRA, quote, ""Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.  The medical community seems to have consulted no one but themselves.""  But that broadside came just hours before the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California where 12 people were gunned down.  Some doctors are outraged.   DR. JOSEPH SAKRAN, TRAUMA SURGEON, JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL:  For a group to simply dismiss the medical community that is on the front line of taking care of these patients is absolutely unacceptable.   TODD:  Joseph Sakran is a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  He not only treats many gunshot wound victims, he was one.   SAKRAN:  The bullet ruptured my windpipe right here, and then these scars are where I had the emergency surgery.   TODD:  In 1994 when he was just 17, Sakran was at a high school football game when a fight broke out and someone started shooting.  He ended up with a paralyzed vocal cord.  After the NRA tweet, Sakran responded, quote, ""I cannot believe the audacity of the NRA.""   SAKRAN:  Where is the NRA when I have to tell those loved ones their family member died and is not coming back.   TODD:  Sakran's tweet was followed by an avalanche of others from fellow doctors, slamming the NRA.  One, accompanied by an x-ray, says, quote, ""I helped save a gun violence victim in med school.  Those are my hands holding pressure on his femoral artery.  The bullet is right by my fingertips.  This is me in my lane, NRA.""   Recent accounts from weapons experts on the guns used in high profile shootings have intensified the political debate.  CBS's ""60 Minutes"" recently profiled the effects of bullets fired from an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, one of the guns used in the synagogue shooting, compared to a standard handgun bullet fired on a gelatin target, simulating soft tissue.  The AR-15 bullet is much more devastating.   That's one of many complaints from doctors, that it is harder and harder to save the lives of people hit with high power ammunition. The NRA refused to do an on camera interview with us, but the NRA is pushing back hard, telling CNN those doctors attacking the group are pushing a gun control agenda that wouldn't prevent those shootings.   When the NRA says you guys weighing in on policy issues like background checks really isn't in your lane, don't they have a point?   SAKRAN:  We have both the possibility and the responsibility to weigh in on this issue that we're having to deal with on a daily basis.   TODD:  But the NRA's pushback also includes several tweets from doctors who support the NRA's position.  One physician saying that the anti-gun doctors who write some of the articles are not practicing medicine in the trenches.  One retired physician saying that he is appalled by the leftist direction that organized medicine has taken.   Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.   (END VIDEOTAPE) PAUL:  Dr. Amy Goldberg is with us now.  She's a trauma surgeon at Temple University hospital.  Dr. Goldberg, thank you so much for being with us.  Just for our viewers, so they understand here, I wanted to show the interesting response that you had on Twitter to what we heard from the NRA when they were telling people to stay in their lane, doctors to stay in their lane.  You said ""When doctors make recommendations about salt intake, no one accuses us of being anti- sodium, no one tells us to stay in our lane.  Seeking to reduce bullet intake doesn't make us anti-gun, it makes us pro-health.""  If you could sit with somebody from the NRA today, what would you want them to understand about what your intentions are here?   DR. AMY GOLDBERG, TRAUMA SURGEON, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL:  I think it is important for everybody to recognize that what the doctors want is to increase the health of our society.  Gun violence is a public health crisis.  Just like physicians may deal with high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, and lung cancer, and heart disease, physicians are taking this on because this is what our patients and our families are seeing.  And we feel it is an obligation to care for all of these patients and to do what we can to address this issue.  PAUL:  Help us understand what it is like for you to see gunshot  victims again and again and again on a daily basis.   GOLDBERG:  These wounds are devastating.  The wounds that we're seeing now are much more devastating than wounds that we saw 10 and 20 years ago.   [10:45:04] I have been a trauma surgeon in north Philadelphia for about 25 years, and the types of guns that we're seeing, these high velocity guns with these bullets are just destroying the organs as the bullets pass through them.  And I think that trauma surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, and all doctors are doing whatever they can to try to stop sanitizing these injuries.   PAUL:  The Annals of Internal Medicine suggests new ways for doctors to reduce gun violence, regularly asking your patients if they own a gun, counseling patients on gun safety.  Do you do that, and are people receptive to that?   GOLDBERG:  Absolutely.  We surely do that at our hospital.  Our trauma outreach coordinator, Scott Charles, has gun locks, and he will ask our patients and patients' families no questions asked, if you have a gun at home, it is so important you keep it safe.  And the hospital has supported us passing out gun locks for free to our patients and their families.   PAUL:  You said in an interview prior that Sandy Hook could have been a teachable moment.  Why do you think it wasn't for some people in this country?   GOLDBERG:  I made that comment about Sandy Hook just because of the terribleness of young elementary school kids being shot, and the fact that none of them made it to the hospital, which told me as a trauma surgeon how devastating those wounds were.  And as I said, I sometimes believe that what America season their TVs is really a sanitized version.  The pictures that we see are the Facebook pictures of the victims.  And instead I think there was a teachable moment, not being disrespectful at all, but we had a teachable moment to show what those guns and what the gun did to all those kids.  And we should have had a moment to show those autopsy photos if the parents had given their permission.  I think this would have made a huge change in the debate we have now.   PAUL:  I'm sure we all appreciate the work that you do.  Dr. Amy Goldberg, thank you so much for being here.   GOLDBERG:  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.   SAVIDGE:  On a very different subject, when we come back, the match on Black Friday.  Plenty of green in Las Vegas.  More on the $9 million faceoff between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson next.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:52:26] SAVIDGE:  This week's Mission Ahead looks at new ways to power your home, and a surprising source of power, your trash.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What if you could power your home and live completely off the grid by just using your own trash.   JULIEN UHLIG, CEO, ENTRADE:  The initial vision that we had was to build a powerplant that's truly mobile, that can convert all of the waste and turn it into clean energy on sight.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  ENTRADE's powerplants can fit entirely inside a 20 foot shipping container and mainly run on biomass, anything from manure to discarded lumber to yard trimmings, and even peanut shells can do the trick.   UHLIG:  We crush it, we dry it, and then we pelletize it.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  These biomass pellets are what ENTRADE power units run on.  By taking plastic that would otherwise end up in landfills and combining it with other green waste, they claim their units can produce enough electricity to power homes and factories.   UHLIG:  And then put it into our reactor, and it only stays there a few seconds before it totally converts into a natural gas replacement.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Their newest unit a mini powerplant about the size of a frig.   UHLIG:  We were always thinking of this power unit you can bring to middle of nowhere.  Use all the waste you find around and pelletize it, and you have a complete power supply on sight.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But are these mini unit as easy to use as they seem?   UHLIG:  If you look at bags of pellets that we produce, you need two to three bags per a day.  So you can actually fill it by hand in the morning.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's a lot of pellets.  ENTRADE's off the grid vision is still in its testing phase.  The company hopes that mini powerplants like these could change the ways cities and towns source their electricity, making them self-sustaining, and in some cases cleaner.   (END VIDEOTAPE) PAUL:  So it was a showdown for the ages.  Two of golf's greatest champions, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, squaring off in what was called simply ""The Match.""  SAVIDGE:  It was something to behold.  It was neck in neck all the way, and it took about four extra holes, 22 in all to get to a winner. Darkness was setting in.  In the end, Mickelson edged out his longtime rival, earning $9 million prize money, and a fortune in bragging rights.  Not bad.  PAUL:  Amanda Boxtel was a dancer and avid skier.  All of that changed  in just a second.  And she decided to turn her pain into purpose.  Now we want you to meet one of the top CNN heroes for 2018.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) [10:00:00] AMANDA BOXTEL, CNN HERO:  Twenty-six years ago, I went out skiing, and I remember I somersaulted, and landed on my back.  And I know in that instant that I was paralyzed.  But I was determined to show that I wasn't going to give up so easily.  I was inspired to create a program that could gift mobility to anyone that has a neurological impairment.   (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL:  Isn't that great, to gift mobility to people.  You can vote for Amanda or any of you favorite top ten heroes now at CNNheroes.com, and thank you so much for doing so.   And thank you for hanging with us this morning.  We hope you make great memories today.   SAVIDGE:  There is much more news ahead in the next hour of Newsroom right after this quick break.  Have a wonderful day.

244,https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/thoughts-and-prayers-ken-liu-short-story.html,"Each month, Future Tense Fiction—a series of short stories from Future Tense and ASU’s Center for Science and the Imagination about how technology and science will change our lives—publishes a story on a theme. The theme for January–March 2019: Identity. Emily Fort: So you want to know about Hayley. No, I’m used to it, or at least I should be by now. People only want to hear about my sister. It was a dreary, rainy Friday in October, the smell of fresh fallen leaves in the air. The black tupelos lining the field hockey pitch had turned bright red, like a trail of bloody footprints left by a giant. I had a quiz in French II and planned a week’s worth of vegan meals for a family of four in family and consumer science. Around noon, Hayley messaged me from California. Skipped class. Q and I are driving to the festival right now!!! I ignored her. She delighted in taunting me with the freedoms of her college life. I was envious, but didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of showing it. In the afternoon, Mom messaged me. Have you heard from Hayley? No. The sisterly code of silence was sacred. Her secret boyfriend was safe with me. “If you do, call me right away.” I put the phone away. Mom was the helicopter type. As soon as I got home from field hockey, I knew something was wrong. Mom’s car was in the driveway, and she never left work this early. The TV was on in the basement. Mom’s face was ashen. In a voice that sounded strangled, she said, “Hayley’s RA called. She went to a music festival. There’s been a shooting.” The rest of the evening was a blur as the death toll climbed, TV anchors read old forum posts from the gunman in dramatic voices, shaky follow-drone footage of panicked people screaming and scattering circulated on the web. I put on my glasses and drifted through the VR re-creation of the site hastily put up by the news crews. Already, the place was teeming with avatars holding a candlelight vigil. Outlines on the ground glowed where victims were found, and luminous arcs with floating numbers reconstructed ballistic trails. So much data, so little information. We tried calling and messaging. There was no answer. Probably ran out of battery, we told ourselves. She always forgets to charge her phone. The network must be jammed. The call came at four in the morning. We were all awake. “Yes, this is. … Are you sure?” Mom’s voice was unnaturally calm, as though her life, and all our lives, hadn’t just changed forever. “No, we’ll fly out ourselves. Thank you.” She hung up, looked at us, and delivered the news. Then she collapsed onto the couch and buried her face in her hands. There was an odd sound. I turned and, for the first time in my life, saw Dad crying. I missed my last chance to tell her how much I loved her. I should have messaged her back. Gregg Fort: I don’t have any pictures of Hayley to show you. It doesn’t matter. You already have all the pictures of my daughter you need. Unlike Abigail, I’ve never taken many pictures or videos, much less drone-view holograms or omni immersions. I lack the instinct to be prepared for the unexpected, the discipline to document the big moments, the skill to frame a scene perfectly. But those aren’t the most important reasons. My father was a hobbyist photographer who took pride in developing his own film and making his own prints. If you were to flip through the dust-covered albums in the attic, you’d see many posed shots of my sisters and me, smiling stiffly into the camera. Pay attention to the ones of my sister Sara. Note how her face is often turned slightly away from the lens so that her right cheek is out of view. When Sara was 5, she climbed onto a chair and toppled a boiling pot. My father was supposed to be watching her, but he’d been distracted, arguing with a colleague on the phone. When all was said and done, Sara had a trail of scars that ran from the right side of her face all the way down her thigh, like a rope of solidified lava. You won’t find in those albums records of the screaming fights between my parents; the awkward chill that descended around the dining table every time my mother stumbled over the word beautiful; the way my father avoided looking Sara in the eye. In the few photographs of Sara where her entire face can be seen, the scars are invisible, meticulously painted out of existence in the darkroom, stroke by stroke. My father simply did it, and the rest of us went along in our practiced silence. As much as I dislike photographs and other memory substitutes, it’s impossible to avoid them. Co-workers and relatives show them to you, and you have no choice but to look and nod. I see the efforts manufacturers of memory-capturing devices put into making their results better than life. Colors are more vivid; details emerge from shadows; filters evoke whatever mood you desire. Without you having to do anything, the phone brackets the shot so that you can pretend to time travel, to pick the perfect instant when everyone is smiling. Skin is smoothed out; pores and small imperfections are erased. What used to take my father a day’s work is now done in the blink of an eye, and far better. Do the people who take these photos believe them to be reality? Or have the digital paintings taken the place of reality in their memory? When they try to remember the captured moment, do they recall what they saw, or what the camera crafted for them? Abigail Fort: On the flight to California, while Gregg napped and Emily stared out the window, I put on my glasses and immersed myself in images of Hayley. I never expected to do this until I was aged and decrepit, unable to make new memories. Rage would come later. Grief left no room for other emotions. I was always the one in charge of the camera, the phone, the follow-drone. I made the annual albums, the vacation highlight videos, the animated Christmas cards summarizing the family’s yearly accomplishments. Gregg and the girls indulged me, sometimes reluctantly. I always believed that someday they would come to see my point of view. “Pictures are important,” I’d tell them. “Our brains are so flawed, leaky sieves of time. Without pictures, so many things we want to remember would be forgotten.” I sobbed the whole way across the country as I re-lived the life of my firstborn. Gregg Fort: Abigail wasn’t wrong, not exactly. Many have been the times when I wished I had images to help me remember. I can’t picture the exact shape of Hayley’s face at 6 months, or recall her Halloween costume when she was 5. I can’t even remember the exact shade of blue of the dress she wore for high school graduation. Given what happened later, of course, her pictures are beyond my reach. I comfort myself with this thought: How can a picture or video capture the intimacy, the irreproducible subjective perspective and mood through my eyes, the emotional tenor of each moment when I felt the impossible beauty of the soul of my child? I don’t want digital representations, ersatz reflections of the gaze of electronic eyes filtered through layers of artificial intelligence, to mar what I remember of our daughter. When I think of Hayley, what comes to mind is a series of disjointed memories. The baby wrapping her translucent fingers around my thumb for the first time; the infant scooting around on her bottom on the hardwood floor, plowing through alphabet blocks like an icebreaker through floes; the 4-year-old handing me a box of tissues as I shivered in bed with a cold and laying a small, cool hand against my feverish cheek. The 8-year-old pulling the rope that released the pumped-up soda bottle launcher. As frothy water drenched the two of us in the wake of the rising rocket, she yelled, laughing, “I’m going to be the first ballerina to dance on Mars!” The 9-year-old telling me that she no longer wanted me to read to her before going to sleep. As my heart throbbed with the inevitable pain of a child pulling away, she softened the blow with, “Maybe someday I’ll read to you.” The 10-year-old defiantly standing her ground in the kitchen, supported by her little sister, staring down me and Abigail both. “I won’t hand back your phones until you both sign this pledge to never use them during dinner.” The 15-year-old slamming on the brakes, creating the loudest tire screech I’d ever heard; me in the passenger seat, knuckles so white they hurt. “You look like me on that rollercoaster, Dad.” The tone carefully modulated, breezy. She had held out an arm in front of me, as though she could keep me safe, the same way I had done to her hundreds of times before. And on and on, distillations of the 6,874 days we had together, like broken, luminous shells left on a beach after the tide of quotidian life has receded. In California, Abigail asked to see her body; I didn’t. I suppose one could argue that there’s no difference between my father trying to erase the scars of his error in the darkroom and my refusal to look upon the body of the child I failed to protect. A thousand “I could have’s” swirled in my mind: I could have insisted that she go to a college near home; I could have signed her up for a course on mass-shooting-survival skills; I could have demanded that she wear her body armor at all times. An entire generation had grown up with active-shooter drills, so why didn’t I do more? I don’t think I ever understood my father, empathized with his flawed and cowardly and guilt-ridden heart, until Hayley’s death. But in the end, I didn’t want to see because I wanted to protect the only thing I had left of her: those memories. If I were to see her body, the jagged crater of the exit wound, the frozen lava trails of coagulated blood, the muddy cinders and ashes of shredded clothing, I knew the image would overwhelm all that had come before, would incinerate the memories of my daughter, my baby, in one violent eruption, leaving only hatred and despair in its wake. No, that lifeless body was not Hayley, was not the child I wanted to remember. I would no more allow that one moment to filter her whole existence than I would allow transistors and bits to dictate my memory. So Abigail went, lifted the sheet, and gazed upon the wreckage of Hayley, of our life. She took pictures, too. “This I also want to remember,” she mumbled. “You don’t turn away from your child in her moment of agony, in the aftermath of your failure.” Abigail Fort: They came to me while we were still in California. I was numb. Questions that had been asked by thousands of mothers swarmed my mind. Why was he allowed to amass such an arsenal? Why did no one stop him despite all the warning signs? What could I have—should I have—done differently to save my child? “You can do something,” they said. “Let’s work together to honor the memory of Hayley and bring about change.” Many have called me naïve or worse. What did I think was going to happen? After decades of watching the exact same script being followed to end in thoughts and prayers, what made me think this time would be different? It was the very definition of madness. Cynicism might make some invulnerable and superior. But not everyone is built that way. In the thralls of grief, you cling to any ray of hope. “Politics is broken,” they said. “It should be enough, after the deaths of little children, after the deaths of newlyweds, after the deaths of mothers shielding newborns, to finally do something. But it never is. Logic and persuasion have lost their power, so we have to arouse the passions. Instead of letting the media direct the public’s morbid curiosity to the killer, let’s focus on Hayley’s story.” It’s been done before, I muttered. To center the victim is hardly a novel political move. You want to make sure that she isn’t merely a number, a statistic, one more abstract name among lists of the dead. You think when people are confronted by the flesh-and-blood consequences of their vacillation and disengagement, things change. But that hasn’t worked, doesn’t work. “Not like this,” they insisted, “not with our algorithm.” They tried to explain the process to me, though the details of machine learning and convolution networks and biofeedback models escaped me. Their algorithm had originated in the entertainment industry, where it was used to evaluate films and predict their box-office success, and eventually, to craft them. Proprietary variations are used in applications from product design to drafting political speeches, every field in which emotional engagement is critical. Emotions are ultimately biological phenomena, not mystical emanations, and it’s possible to discern trends and patterns, to home in on the stimuli that maximize impact. The algorithm would craft a visual narrative of Hayley’s life, shape it into a battering ram to shatter the hardened shell of cynicism, spur the viewer to action, shame them for their complacency and defeatism. The idea seemed absurd, I said. How could electronics know my daughter better than I did? How could machines move hearts when real people could not? “When you take a photograph,” they asked me, “don’t you trust the camera A.I. to give you the best picture? When you scrub through drone footage, you rely on the A.I. to identify the most interesting clips, to enhance them with the perfect mood filters. This is a million times more powerful.” I gave them my archive of family memories: photos, videos, scans, drone footage, sound recordings, immersiongrams. I entrusted them with my child. I’m no film critic, and I don’t have the terms for the techniques they used. Narrated only with words spoken by our family, intended for each other and not an audience of strangers, the result was unlike any movie or VR immersion I had ever seen. There was no plot save the course of a single life; there was no agenda save the celebration of the curiosity, the compassion, the drive of a child to embrace the universe, to become. It was a beautiful life, a life that loved and deserved to be loved, until the moment it was abruptly and violently cut down. This is the way Hayley deserves to be remembered, I thought, tears streaming down my face. This is how I see her, and it is how she should be seen. I gave them my blessing. Sara Fort: Growing up, Gregg and I weren’t close. It was important to my parents that our family project the image of success, of decorum, regardless of the reality. In response, Gregg distrusted all forms of representation, while I became obsessed with them. Other than holiday greetings, we rarely conversed as adults, and certainly didn’t confide in each other. I knew my nieces only through Abigail’s social media posts. I suppose this is my way of excusing myself for not intervening earlier. When Hayley died in California, I sent Gregg the contact info for a few therapists who specialized in working with families of mass shooting victims, but I purposefully stayed away myself, believing that my intrusion in their moment of grief would be inappropriate given my role as distant aunt and aloof sister. So I wasn’t there when Abigail agreed to devote Hayley’s memory to the cause of gun control. Though my company bio describes my specialty as the study of online discourse, the vast bulk of my research material is visual. I design armor against trolls. Emily Fort: I watched that video of Hayley many times. It was impossible to avoid. There was an immersive version, in which you could step into Hayley’s room and read her neat handwriting, examine the posters on her wall. There was a low-fidelity version designed for frugal data plans, and the compression artifacts and motion blur made her life seem old-fashioned, dreamy. Everyone shared the video as a way to reaffirm that they were a good person, that they stood with the victims. Click, bump, add a lit-candle emoji, re-rumble. It was powerful. I cried, also many times. Comments expressing grief and solidarity scrolled past my glasses like a never-ending wake. Families of victims in other shootings, their hopes rekindled, spoke out in support. But the Hayley in that video felt like a stranger. All the elements in the video were true, but they also felt like lies. Teachers and parents loved the Hayley they knew, but there was a mousy girl in school who cowered when my sister entered the room. One time, Hayley drove home drunk; another time, she stole from me and lied until I found the money in her purse. She knew how to manipulate people and wasn’t shy about doing it. She was fiercely loyal, courageous, kind, but she could also be reckless, cruel, petty. I loved Hayley because she was human, but the girl in that video was both more and less than. I kept my feelings to myself. I felt guilty. Mom charged ahead while Dad and I hung back, dazed. For a brief moment, it seemed as if the tide had turned. Rousing rallies were held and speeches delivered in front of the Capitol and the White House. Crowds chanted Hayley’s name. Mom was invited to the State of the Union. When the media reported that Mom had quit her job to campaign on behalf of the movement, there was a crypto fundraiser to collect donations for the family. And then, the trolls came. A torrent of emails, messages, rumbles, squeaks, snapgrams, televars came at us. Mom and I were called clickwhores, paid actresses, grief profiteers. Strangers sent us long, rambling walls of text explaining all the ways Dad was inadequate and unmanly. Hayley didn’t die, strangers informed us. She was actually living in Sanya, China, off of the millions the U.N. and their collaborators in the U.S. government had paid her to pretend to die. Her boyfriend—who had also “obviously not died” in the shooting—was ethnically Chinese, and that was proof of the connection. Hayley’s video was picked apart for evidence of tampering and digital manipulation. Anonymous classmates were quoted to paint her as a habitual liar, a cheat, a drama queen. Snippets of the video, intercut with “debunking” segments, began to go viral. Some used software to make Hayley spew messages of hate in new clips, quoting Hitler and Stalin as she giggled and waved at the camera. I deleted my accounts and stayed home, unable to summon the strength to get out of bed. My parents left me to myself; they had their own battles to fight. Sara Fort: Decades into the digital age, the art of trolling has evolved to fill every niche, pushing the boundaries of technology and decency alike. From afar, I watched the trolls swarm around my brother’s family with uncoordinated precision, with aimless malice, with malevolent glee. Conspiracy theories blended with deep fakes, and then yielded to memes that turned compassion inside out, abstracted pain into lulz. “Mommy, the beach in hell is so warm!” “I love these new holes in me!” Searches for Hayley’s name began to trend on porn sites. The content producers, many of them A.I.-driven bot farms, responded with procedurally generated films and VR immersions featuring my niece. The algorithms took publicly available footage of Hayley and wove her face, body, and voice seamlessly into fetish videos. The news media reported on the development in outrage, perhaps even sincerely. The coverage spurred more searches, which generated more content … As a researcher, it’s my duty and habit to remain detached, to observe and study phenomena with clinical detachment, perhaps even fascination. It’s simplistic to view trolls as politically motivated—at least not in the sense that term is usually understood. Though Second Amendment absolutists helped spread the memes, the originators often had little conviction in any political cause. Anarchic sites such as 8taku, duangduang, and alt-web sites that arose in the wake of the previous decade’s deplatforming wars are homes for these dung beetles of the internet, the id of our collective online unconscious. Taking pleasure in taboo-breaking and transgression, the trolls have no unifying interest other than saying the unspeakable, mocking the sincere, playing with what others declared to be off-limits. By wallowing in the outrageous and filthy, they both defile and define the technologically mediated bonds of society. But as a human being, watching what they were doing with Hayley’s image was intolerable.I reached out to my estranged brother and his family. “Let me help.” Though machine learning has given us the ability to predict with a fair amount of accuracy which victims will be targeted—trolls are not quite as unpredictable as they’d like you to think—my employer and other major social media platforms are keenly aware that they must walk a delicate line between policing user-generated content and chilling “engagement,” the one metric that drives the stock price and thus governs all decisions. Aggressive moderation, especially when it’s reliant on user reporting and human judgment, is a process easily gamed by all sides, and every company has suffered accusations of censorship. In the end, they threw up their hands and tossed out their byzantine enforcement policy manuals. They have neither the skills nor the interest to become arbiters of truth and decency for society as a whole. How could they be expected to solve the problem that even the organs of democracy couldn’t? Over time, most companies converged on one solution. Rather than focusing on judging the behavior of speakers, they devoted resources to letting listeners shield themselves. Algorithmically separating legitimate (though impassioned) political speech from coordinated harassment for everyone at once is an intractable problem—content celebrated by some as speaking truth to power is often condemned by others as beyond the pale. It’s much easier to build and train individually tuned neural networks to screen out the content a particular user does not wish to see. The new defensive neural networks—marketed as “armor”—observe each user’s emotional state in response to their content stream. Capable of operating in vectors encompassing text, audio, video, and AR/VR, the armor teaches itself to recognize content especially upsetting to the user and screened it out, leaving only a tranquil void. As mixed reality and immersion have become more commonplace, the best way to wear armor is through augmented-reality glasses that filter all sources of visual stimuli. Trolling, like the viruses and worms of old, is a technical problem, and now we have a technical solution. To invoke the most powerful and personalized protection, one has to pay. Social media companies, which also train the armor, argue that this solution gets them out of the content-policing business, excuses them from having to decide what is unacceptable in virtual town squares, frees everyone from the specter of Big Brother–style censorship. That this pro–free speech ethos happens to align with more profit is no doubt a mere afterthought. I sent my brother and his family the best, most advanced armor that money could buy. Abigail Fort: Imagine yourself in my position. Your daughter’s body had been digitally pressed into hard-core pornography, her voice made to repeat words of hate, her visage mutilated with unspeakable violence. And it happened because of you, because of your inability to imagine the depravity of the human heart. Could you have stopped? Could you have stayed away? The armor kept the horrors at bay as I continued to post and share, to raise my voice against a tide of lies. The idea that Hayley hadn’t died but was an actress in an anti-gun government conspiracy was so absurd that it didn’t seem to deserve a response. Yet, as my armor began to filter out headlines, leaving blank spaces on news sites and in multicast streams, I realized that the lies had somehow become a real controversy. Actual journalists began to demand that I produce receipts for how I had spent the crowdfunded money—we hadn’t received a cent! The world had lost its mind. I released the photographs of Hayley’s corpse. Surely there was still some shred of decency left in this world, I thought. Surely no one could speak against the evidence of their eyes? It got worse. For the faceless hordes of the internet, it became a game to see who could get something past my armor, to stab me in the eye with a poisoned videoclip that would make me shudder and recoil. Bots sent me messages in the guise of other parents who had lost their children in mass shootings, and sprung hateful videos on me after I whitelisted them. They sent me tribute slideshows dedicated to the memory of Hayley, which morphed into violent porn once the armor allowed them through. They pooled funds to hire errand gofers and rent delivery drones to deposit fiducial markers near my home, surrounding me with augmented-reality ghosts of Hayley writhing, giggling, moaning, screaming, cursing, mocking. Worst of all, they animated images of Hayley’s bloody corpse to the accompaniment of jaunty soundtracks. Her death trended as a joke, like the “Hamster Dance” of my youth. Gregg Fort: Sometimes I wonder if we have misunderstood the notion of freedom. We prize “freedom to” so much more than “freedom from.” People must be free to own guns, so the only solution is to teach children to hide in closets and wear ballistic backpacks. People must be free to post and say what they like, so the only solution is to tell their targets to put on armor. Abigail had simply decided, and the rest of us had gone along. Too late, I begged and pleaded with her to stop, to retreat. We would sell the house and move somewhere away from the temptation to engage with the rest of humanity, away from the always-connected world and the ocean of hate in which we were drowning. But Sara’s armor gave Abigail a false sense of security, pushed her to double down, to engage the trolls. “I must fight for my daughter!” she screamed at me. “I cannot allow them to desecrate her memory.” As the trolls intensified their campaign, Sara sent us patch after patch for the armor. She added layers with names like adversarial complementary sets, self-modifying code detectors, visualization auto-healers. Again and again, the armor held only briefly before the trolls found new ways through. The democratization of artificial intelligence meant that they knew all the techniques Sara knew, and they had machines that could learn and adapt, too. Abigail could not hear me. My pleas fell on deaf ears; perhaps her armor had learned to see me as just another angry voice to screen out. Emily Fort: One day, Mom came to me in a panic. “I don’t know where she is! I can’t see her!” She hadn’t talked to me in days, obsessed with the project that Hayley had become. It took me some time to figure out what she meant. I sat down with her at the computer. She clicked the link for Hayley’s memorial video, which she watched several times a day to give herself strength. “It’s not there!” she said. She opened the cloud archive of our family memories. “Where are the pictures of Hayley?” she said. “There are only placeholder Xs.” She showed me her phone, her backup enclosure, her tablet. “There’s nothing! Nothing! Did we get hacked?” Her hands fluttered helplessly in front of her chest, like the wings of a trapped bird. “She’s just gone!” Wordlessly, I went to the shelves in the family room and brought down one of the printed annual photo albums she had made when we were little. I opened the volume to a family portrait, taken when Hayley was 10 and I was 8. I showed the page to her. Another choked scream. Her trembling fingers tapped against Hayley’s face on the page, searching for something that wasn’t there. I understood. A pain filled my heart, a pity that ate away at love. I reached up to her face and gently took off her glasses. She stared at the page. Sobbing, she hugged me. “You found her. Oh, you found her!” It felt like the embrace of a stranger. Or maybe I had become a stranger to her. Aunt Sara explained that the trolls had been very careful with their attacks. Step by step, they had trained my mother’s armor to recognize Hayley as the source of her distress. But another kind of learning had also been taking place in our home. My parents paid attention to me only when I had something to do with Hayley. It was as if they no longer saw me, as though I had been erased instead of Hayley. My grief turned dark and festered. How could I compete with a ghost? The perfect daughter who had been lost not once, but twice? The victim who demanded perpetual penance? I felt horrid for thinking such things, but I couldn’t stop. We sank under our guilt, each alone. Gregg Fort: I blamed Abigail. I’m not proud to admit it, but I did. We shouted at each other and threw dishes, replicating the half-remembered drama between my own parents when I was a child. Hunted by monsters, we became monsters ourselves. While the killer had taken Hayley’s life, Abigail had offered her image up as a sacrifice to the bottomless appetite of the internet. Because of Abigail, my memories of Hayley would be forever filtered through the horrors that came after her death. She had summoned the machine that amassed individual human beings into one enormous, collective, distorting gaze, the machine that had captured the memory of my daughter and then ground it into a lasting nightmare. The broken shells on the beach glistened with the venom of the raging deep. Of course that’s unfair, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t also true. “Heartless,” a self-professed troll: There’s no way for me to prove that I am who I say, or that I did what I claim. There’s no registry of trolls where you can verify my identity, no Wikipedia entry with confirmed sources. Can you even be sure I’m not trolling you right now? I won’t tell you my gender or race or who I prefer to sleep with, because those details aren’t relevant to what I did. Maybe I own a dozen guns. Maybe I’m an ardent supporter of gun control. I went after the Forts because they deserved it. RIP-trolling has a long and proud history, and our target has always been inauthenticity. Grief should be private, personal, hidden. Can’t you see how horrible it was for that mother to turn her dead daughter into a symbol, to wield it as a political tool? A public life is an inauthentic one. Anyone who enters the arena must be prepared for the consequences. Everyone who shared that girl’s memorial online, who attended the virtual candlelit vigils, offered condolences, professed to have been spurred into action, was equally guilty of hypocrisy. You didn’t think the proliferation of guns capable of killing hundreds in one minute was a bad thing until someone shoved images of a dead girl in your face? What’s wrong with you? And you journalists are the worst. You make money and win awards for turning deaths into consumable stories; for coaxing survivors to sob in front of your drones to sell more ads; for inviting your readers to find meaning in their pathetic lives through vicarious, mimetic suffering. We trolls play with images of the dead, who are beyond caring, but you stinking ghouls grow fat and rich by feeding death to the living. The sanctimonious are also the most filthy-minded, and victims who cry the loudest are the hungriest for attention. Everyone is a troll now. If you’ve ever liked or shared a meme that wished violence on someone you’d never met, if you’ve ever decided it was OK to snarl and snark with venom because the target was “powerful,” if you’ve ever tried to signal your virtue by piling on in an outrage mob, if you’ve ever wrung your hands and expressed concern that perhaps the money raised for some victim should have gone to some other less “privileged” victim—then I hate to break it to you, you’ve also been trolling. Some say that the proliferation of trollish rhetoric in our culture is corrosive, that armor is necessary to equalize the terms of a debate in which the only way to win is to care less. But don’t you see how unethical armor is? It makes the weak think they’re strong, turns cowards into deluded heroes with no skin in the game. If you truly despise trolling, then you should’ve realized by now that armor only makes things worse. By weaponizing her grief, Abigail Fort became the biggest troll of them all—except she was bad at it, just a weakling in armor. We had to bring her—and by extension, the rest of you—down. Abigail Fort: Politics returned to normal. Sales of body armor, sized for children and young adults, received a healthy bump. More companies offered classes on situational awareness and mass shooting drills for schools. Life went on. I deleted my accounts; I stopped speaking out. But it was too late for my family. Emily moved out as soon as she could; Gregg found an apartment. Alone in the house, my eyes devoid of armor, I tried to sort through the archive of photographs and videos of Hayley. Every time I watched the video of her sixth birthday, I heard in my mind the pornographic moans; every time I looked at photos of her high school graduation, I saw her bloody animated corpse dancing to the tune of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”; every time I tried to page through the old albums for some good memories, I jumped in my chair, thinking an AR ghost of her, face grotesquely deformed like Munch’s The Scream, was about to jump out at me, cackling, “Mommy, these new piercings hurt!” I screamed, I sobbed, I sought help. No therapy, no medication worked. Finally, in a numb fury, I deleted all my digital files, shredded my printed albums, broke the frames hanging on walls. The trolls trained me as well as they trained my armor. I no longer have any images of Hayley. I can’t remember what she looked like. I have truly, finally, lost my child. How can I possibly be forgiven for that?

246,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/covington-pile-on-symbolism/580918/,"It’s ridiculous to claim that the Covington Catholic schoolboys are a symbol of what ails America. About the author: Conor Friedersdorf is a California-based staff writer at The Atlantic, where he focuses on politics and national affairs. He is the founding editor of The Best of Journalism, a newsletter devoted to exceptional nonfiction. Boys from a Catholic high school in Kentucky are hanging out near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., doing pep-rally cheers to drown out slurs and homophobic taunts from the Black Hebrew Israelites, when an American Indian man unexpectedly arrives on the scene, beating a drum as he interposes himself between the groups. It’s the sort of conflict that … virtually never happens. Yet after watching a viral video of that singular event, many observers felt that it was … a symbol of all that’s wrong with America. “The clip focused on one red-hatted boy staring directly at the man with the drum,” Katie Herzog wrote in The Stranger. “His stupid, smirking face seemed to symbolize everything wrong with America right now.” Like many, she reconsidered her initial reaction when additional video of the encounter offered context that cast the boys in a better light. Newspapers published follow-up stories. Pundits issued mea culpas. They were right to do so; and commentators who stood by their original condemnations even as new facts emerged were wrong. (Though it was fair to scold the couple of boys who acted badly by miming tomahawk chops). Even that “smirking” facial expression was more changing and nuanced than it appeared in the initial video. Julie Irwin Zimmerman: I failed the Covington Catholic test For the sake of argument, however, imagine there were a way to prove what that kid was thinking, and it turned out that his inner monologue was, Ha ha, I’ll disrespect this man approaching me by refusing to move out of his way and smiling in an irritatingly smug, conceited, and silly way. What would that signify? I have no pithy answer. But I know that this would not follow: People are responding so strongly to these videos because they are so emblematic of the violence that indigenous people have suffered for over 500 years in the United States. We have been raped, relocated, trafficked, separated, degraded, demoralized, and massacred by the United States government and a culture of media, economy, education, and religion that has dehumanized indigenous people for the entire history of this stolen country. Presently, this country continues to poison indigenous people by defiling our water and pumping drugs and alcohol into indigenous communities; regulate native bodies through tribal numbers and blood quantum laws; and force assimilation (culturally, spiritually). These are tactics of genocide. How strange to treat a smirking teen’s face, something known to every parent and schoolteacher in the world, as an emblem of “tactics of genocide”—as though the root of ethnic cleansing were adolescent insolence. Adam Serwer: The Trump-era overcorrection And that claim was not uniquely inapt. “What was happening was clear and unmistakable, not just resonant but immediately recognizable as iconic,” Laura Wagner wrote at Deadspin. “If you wanted to compress the history of relations between the powerful and the powerless in America, or the dynamics of the current moment, into a single image, you couldn’t do much better than to present a white teen in a MAGA hat, surrounded by a screaming horde of his peers, smirking into the face of an old Native American man.” I could do much better. If I were compressing “the history of relations between the powerful and the powerless in America” into a single image, I’d represent “the powerful” with someone old enough to vote, not a scrawny high-school kid. My horde would look like the Confederate army, not a pep rally. Treating a smirking teenager as a stand-in for the wanton slaughter of indigenous people, the brutal abomination of chattel slavery, the persecution of anti-war activists, the racial terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan, the exclusion of Chinese immigrants, or the internment of Japanese Americans utterly trivializes bygone atrocities. Did these commentators swallow the trendy notion that microaggressions are “violence,” and apply it backwards in history? Read: Stop trusting viral videos Were I to distill “the dynamics of the current moment into a single image,” focusing on negatives, I’d seek out photos of children forcibly separated from their parents at the Mexican border; or addicts dead from opiate overdoses; or mass-shooting victims at a synagogue; or white supremacists beating counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia; or lobbyists facilitating rent-seeking; or homeowners blocking the construction of apartments in their neighborhood; or segregated schools; or signs of climate change. If you think the better choice is a photo of a smirking white 17-year-old, I suspect that the Donald Trump reelection team would thrill at letting you define the 2020 election. And I say that as someone who hates both the MAGA caps and the vicious campaign that popularized them. Rebecca Traister wrote: It’s the easily extracted concern for these grinning boys—amidst the deportations & family separations, the harassment & assaults, the low wages, poverty & incarceration, the shootings & police brutality, the lack of access to medical/repro care—that’s going to finally do me in. Many who are sympathetic to the blue coalition’s concerns are baffled that a large faction within it spends so much energy on culture-war pile-ons, even opining that children are punchable or irredeemable or deserving of doxing. It’s the bizarre focus on these boys as what ails America, rather than on any of the many powerful people doing identifiable harm, or on any of the things that might end family separations, avert assaults, increase wages, reduce poverty, reform police, or increase access to medical care, that’s going to do in the left.",2019-01-23 15:47:57,This Is How the Left Destroys Itself,"religion and churches,jews,drug abuse and traffic,housing",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
247,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/01/new-york-times-journalist-alex-berenson-tell-your-children-marijuana-crime-mental-illness-1/,"Craig Geller It’s been a few years since Alex Berenson has “committed journalism,” as he likes to say. As a New York Times reporter, Berenson did two tours covering the Iraq War, an experience that inspired him to write his first of nearly a dozen spy novels. Starting with the 2006 Edgar Award-winning The Faithful Spy, his books were so successful that he left the Times in 2010 to write fiction full time. But his latest book, out January 8, strays far from the halls of Langley and the jihadis of Afghanistan. Tell Your Children is nonfiction that takes a sledgehammer to the promised benefits of marijuana legalization, and cannabis enthusiasts are not going to like it one bit. The book was seeded one night a few years ago when Berenson’s wife, a psychiatrist who evaluates mentally ill criminal defendants in New York, started talking about a horrific case she was handling. It was “the usual horror story, somebody who’d cut up his grandmother or set fire to his apartment—typical bedtime chat in the Berenson house,” he writes. But then, his wife added, “Of course he was high, been smoking pot his whole life.” Berenson, who smoked a bit in college, didn’t have strong feelings about marijuana one way or another, but he was skeptical that it could bring about violent crime. Like most Americans, he thought stoners ate pizza and played video games—they didn’t hack up family members. Yet his Harvard-trained wife insisted that all the horrible cases she was seeing involved people who were heavy into weed. She directed him to the science on the subject. We look back and laugh at Reefer Madness, which was pretty over-the-top, after all, but Berenson found himself immersed in some pretty sobering evidence: Cannabis has been associated with legitimate reports of psychotic behavior and violence dating at least to the 19th century, when a Punjabi lawyer in India noted that 20 to 30 percent of patients in mental hospitals were committed for cannabis-related insanity. The lawyer, like Berenson’s wife, described horrific crimes—including at least one beheading—and attributed far more cases of mental illness to cannabis than to alcohol or opium. The Mexican government reached similar conclusions, banning cannabis sales in 1920—nearly 20 years before the United States did—after years of reports of cannabis-induced madness and violent crime. Over the past couple of decades, studies around the globe have found that THC—the active compound in cannabis—is strongly linked to psychosis, schizophrenia, and violence. Berenson interviewed far-flung researchers who have quietly but methodically documented the effects of THC on serious mental illness, and he makes a convincing case that a recreational drug marketed as an all-around health product may, in fact, be really dangerous—especially for people with a family history of mental illness and for adolescents with developing brains. A 2002 study in BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) found that people who used cannabis by age 15 were four times as likely to develop schizophrenia or a related syndrome as those who’d never used. Even when the researchers excluded kids who had shown signs of psychosis by age 11, they found that the adolescent users had a threefold higher risk of demonstrating symptoms of schizophrenia later on. One Dutch marijuana researcher that Berenson spoke with estimated, based on his own work, that marijuana could be responsible for as much as 10 percent of psychosis in places where heavy use is common. These studies are hardly Reagan-esque, drug warrior hysteria. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report nearly 500 pages long on the health effects of cannabis and concluded that marijuana use is strongly associated with the development of psychosis and schizophrenia. The researchers also noted that there’s decent evidence linking pot consumption to worsening symptoms of bipolar disorder and to a heightened risk of suicide, depression, and social anxiety disorders: “The higher the use, the greater the risk.*” Given that marijuana use is up 50 percent over the past decade, if the studies are accurate, we should be experiencing a big increase in psychotic diseases. And we are, Berenson argues. He reports that from 2006 to 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the number of ER visitors co-diagnosed with psychosis and a cannabis use disorder tripled, from 30,000 to 90,000. Legalization advocates would say Berenson and the researchers have it backwards: Pot doesn’t cause mental illness; mental illness drives self-medication with pot. But scientists find that theory wanting. Longitudinal studies in New Zealand, Sweden, and the Netherlands spanning several decades identified an association between cannabis and mental illness even when accounting for prior signs of mental illness. In an editorial published alongside the influential 2002 BMJ study on psychosis and marijuana, two Australian psychiatrists wrote that these and other findings “strengthen the argument that use of cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia and depression, and they provide little support for the belief that the association between marijuana use and mental health problems is largely due to self-medication.” One of the book’s most convincing arguments against the self-medication theory is that psychosis and schizophrenia are diseases that typically strike people during adolescence or in their early 20s. But with increasing pot use, the number of people over 30 coming into the ER with psychosis has also shot up, suggesting that cannabis might be a cause of mental illness in people with no prior history of it.*” That’s what the science would predict. Back in the early 1980s, Sven Andréasson, a Swedish doctor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, launched one of the first big studies looking at the association between schizophrenia and marijuana. Andréasson was able to tap a huge database of information on Swedish men conscripted into military service, which included their drug-use history. He cross-referenced that data with national health service records to determine whether the 18- and 19-year-old men who’d used weed before 1970 had developed schizophrenia by 1983. In a study published in The Lancet in 1987, he reported that for conscripts who had used weed more than 50 times, the risk of developing schizophrenia was six times as high as for those who’d never smoked. After adjusting for confounding factors, such as a family history of mental illness or existing symptoms of schizophrenia at the time of conscription, Andréasson found that using cannabis more than 10 times in adolescence more than doubled the risk of developing schizophrenia. Berenson quotes Andréasson as saying that if people used marijuana as much as they drank alcohol, “We would see an enormous amount of morbidity from cannabis.” Before talking to Berenson, I didn’t realize it was possible to smoke your way to the ER. I smoked plenty of weed in high school and so did all my friends, and none of us jumped off a balcony or killed anyone—we could barely get off the couch. But the marijuana sold today is not what we smoked, which at 1 percent to 2 percent THC was the equivalent of smoking oregano. Today’s weed is insanely more potent, as are products like “wax” and “shatter”—forms of butane hash oil designed to be vaped or dabbed that come pretty close to 100 percent THC. And these high-potency products usually contain very little CBD oil, the ingredient in cannabis that’s supposed to account for many of its supposed health benefits. These potent products can cause hallucinations, restlessness, and, as anyone who’s smoked even weak pot is familiar with, paranoia. After reading Berenson’s book, I fact-checked it a bit, and inadvertently discovered all sorts of websites advising pot users on how to manage their paranoia and ride out the psychotic effects. I also found plenty of news stories about bad trips on pot. Such incidents are typically treated jokingly. “But a lot of the time it turns out not to be a joke,” Berenson told me. “A lot of the time it’s a 22-year-old guy who maybe has some history of aggression, and he winds up throwing himself off the balcony or beating up his girlfriend.” Paranoia and psychosis make people dangerous, so rising use of a drug that causes both would be expected to increase violent crime, rather than reduce it as pot advocates claim. Berenson looked at data for the four states that legalized weed in 2014 and 2015—Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Colorado—and calculated a combined 35 percent increase in murders in those states from 2013 to 2017, compared with a 20-percent rise nationally. This “isn’t a statistical anomaly,” Berenson writes. “It’s real.” The role of weed in rising violent crime rates in legalization states is a hotly contested question, especially in Colorado, where murders in Denver are at a 10-year high. Berenson admits he can’t say for sure whether those upswings are due to legal weed, but the raw data, he says, definitely contradicts advocates’ claims: “What I want people to stop saying is that legalization reduces violent crime. It doesn’t.” Tell Your Children rounds out the crime stats with grisly stories of people who commit suicide or kill their children while high on pot, starting with the story of an Australian woman who, in the throes of cannabis-induced psychosis, stabbed eight kids to death—seven were hers. That’s a super-extreme case, but heinous crimes are not all that uncommon. Consider Texas: In 2017, Berenson told me, “2 percent of the state probably smokes marijuana every day, and 30 percent of the deaths from child abuse or neglect were committed while people were using. And that’s a bad number. There’s no way around it.” Once Berenson started looking into links between cannabis and violence or mental illness, he started to see them everywhere, and perhaps for good reason. The stories follow a familiar pattern: A guy—it’s frequently a guy—who smokes a lot of weed starts to go off the rails, ranting about politics or his ex, posting crazy shit on Facebook, and then ends up in the news for being suicidal, killing someone, or otherwise doing something crazy. Jared Loughner, the mass shooter who killed six people and wounded congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Arizona in 2011, was such a heavy pot user that the Army rejected him on that basis. After reading Berenson’s book, I started seeing the patterns, too. In November, Jeffrey Clark, an alleged neo-Nazi, was arrested in DC for stockpiling weapons and making threats after the Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting. His story fit the profile Berenson lays out in the book, so I checked: Indeed, court records suggest he was a pot addict. (Clark was charged with possession and distribution.) And we’ve all heard about Kanye West’s and Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson’s experiences. In an observation that’s likely to earn him even more derision than his suggestion that weed can cause violent crime, Berenson raises the possibility in the book that pot use might lie at the heart of both men’s mental health problems—West and Davidson have denied this—or at least that weed might be exacerbating their issues. (When I asked Berenson over the phone whether weed was really making Kanye crazy, several of my newsroom colleagues burst out laughing—an early sign of how this all might be received.) Berenson notes in his book that West has acknowledged smoking before some of his most incomprehensible public appearances, and that the rapper’s insurer initially refused to cover his losses when West’s mental breakdown and psych hospitalization led to cancellation of a 2016 tour. The insurance company, Lloyd’s of London, argued in court documents that West’s marijuana use caused the breakdown and invalidated his insurance claim. (West sued the insurer, which eventually settled and paid most of the claims.) “I have no idea what goes on in that man’s head,” Berenson admits. But he doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that marijuana seems to be a factor when “these very high-profile figures are acting out in weird ways.” Berenson is well aware that many people won’t want to hear his message, particularly on the left, at a time when prominent figures from presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have endorsed legalizing pot nationally. There’s a huge difference, he points out, between decriminalizing weed to fight mass incarceration and turning cannabis into a recreational drug as cheap and easy to obtain as booze. “If you look at what’s happened with opioids in the last 20 years, legalizers should be looking at that and saying to themselves, ‘Maybe drugs are actually the problem,’” Berenson says. “I feel like I’m going to get jumped on just for saying that.” He finds something odd about the way Americans now view marijuana, as though it’s some sort of cool, harmless miracle drug—even though it has many of the same downsides alcohol does. A nice wine can complement a good meal. But in a different context, “alcohol can cause bar fights. It can cause drunken driving. It can cause domestic violence. It causes terrible violence,” he says. “Yet we’re able to sort of keep those two ideas in our head: that there’s one kind of alcohol consumption that can just put [people] to sleep, and there’s another kind that can cause violence. With marijuana, those two things are also true, but we’ve sort of forgotten the second thing exists.” He suspects legalization is to the left what climate change is to the right—an issue around which even the most solid facts may not change minds. “I know I’m going to fail on this, but I really view this as a book about medicine and science,” he says. “This comes out of really smart people doing really careful research and trying to figure out how to tease out correlation and causation, and they got an answer. I believe the people I talk to. They don’t have any agenda other than trying to promote the public health.” Correction: An earlier version of this article overstated the connection that NASEM researchers found between marijuana, bipolar disorder, and the risk of suicide, depression, and social anxiety disorders. It also overstated the connection between the increasing number of pot users and the number of people over 30 coming into the ER with psychosis; the researchers in that case “did not directly examine whether marijuana had led to any psychotic diagnoses.” A handful of other facts and statements in the piece have been updated for accuracy.

Leaders from around the world shared solemn statements online in honor of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which comes amid a surge of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in recent years. This year's day of remembrance marks the 74th anniversary of the liberation of those imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, where it's estimated 1 million people died. Hundreds of thousands of mentally ill and disabled people and half a million people of Romani descent were also killed in the Holocaust. Up to 15,000 LGBT people were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, was the first of America's first family to share her tribute on Twitter, writing that the day marked a chance to ""commemorate and honor the lives lost to evil and the strength of those who stood up to confront it."" First lady Melania Trump tweeted soon after to ""pay tribute to those who were lost and reflect on the tragedy of the Holocaust during World War 2."" In an official statement released Sunday morning, the White House included an American officer's account of a death camp before stating the horrors inflicted by the German Third Reich. ""Six million Jews were systematically slaughtered in horrific ways,"" the statement read. ""The Nazis also enslaved and murdered Slavs, Roma, gays, people with disabilities, religious leaders, and others who courageously opposed their cruel regime."" The statement continued: ""the brutality of the Holocaust was a crime against men, women, and children. It was a crime against humanity. It was a crime against God."" The message added that the best remembrance is to ""strive to prevent such suffering from happening again."" President Trump tweeted a link to the statement along with a picture of him at Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to Holocaust victims. Trump has been accused of dog-whistling to anti-Semites during his campaign and presidency. In 2018, he was criticized for his statement marking Holocaust Remembrence Day that didn't mention Jewish people. British Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn both announced they had signed the Holocaust Educational Trust Book of Commitment, a British Holocaust education initiative. Corbyn's involvement Sunday comes after he was accused of anti-semitism last year, based on his support for renaming Holocaust Memorial Day and involvement with a 2010 event where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Though the holiday was established by the United Nations in 2005 in part to promote Holocaust education, recent surveys have shown that many adults still lack basic knowledge about the genocide. The anniversary comes after Anti-Semitic incidents surged 57% in the US in 2017, according to figures from the Anti-Defamation League that marked the first time cases were reported in every single state since 2010 and the largest increase in one year. Fifty-two percent of Americans said incorrectly that Hitler came to power through force. Forty-one percent of Americans and 66% of millennials couldn't say what Auschwitz was. The survey also found that 22% of millennials said they had never heard of the Holocaust or weren't sure. A survey released Sunday by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust found that one in 20 British adults do not believe the Holocaust happened and one in five said they thought fewer than two million were killed, one of the most recent measures of disturbing trends among current Holocaust knowledge. A 2018 poll conducted by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany found several disturbing trends among Americans, including that 31% of the population and 41% of millennials believe that two million or fewer Jews were killed in the Holocaust. After an October 2018 mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue by a gunman who espoused anti-semitism and support for the Trump administration's anti-immigrant rhetoric online, many have connected the rise of hate in America to the president's open disparagement of immigrants and mixed messaging on incidents like the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.",2019-01-27 00:00:00,Trump and other leaders mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day amid rising anti-Semitism,"politics and government,religion and churches,minorities (us),homosexuality,jews,nazi policies toward jews and minorities",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

But such is the case for Connie Hair, chief of staff to Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) and one of the participants at what the New York Times reported was a tense White House meeting last week between President Trump and far-right activists concerned about the threat posed by transgender people and women serving in the military. The Times article focused on how the unusual Roosevelt Room summit was organized by Ginni Thomas, the longtime conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. But the other attendees mentioned by the Times are worthy of note as well. Beyond Hair, the group reportedly included veteran anti-Islam champion Frank Gaffney and Rosemary Jenks of the anti-immigrant group NumbersUSA. Crystal Clanton, who was hired as an assistant by Ginni Thomas after being booted from conservative youth group Turning Point USA for a text message saying she hated black people, was reportedly on the list of names that Thomas asked to have attend. Whether Clanton ended up actually joining the meeting is unclear. On her public Facebook page, Thomas wrote Monday that “16 conservative leaders” in total attended the meeting. Crowing about “#FAKENEWS,” Thomas said that the Times painted a “CARTOONISH and BIZARRE depiction of a fascinating, engaging and honest discussion” with the President. Thomas alleged that the White House staff were “oddly” trying to distance the activists from the President, and said the group was right to “warn the President of the sabotage within the wire” among his leaking White House team.  Spokespeople at Gaffney’s Center for Security Policy and NumbersUSA said they would share TPM’s requests for comment with Gaffney and Jenks. Clanton did not respond to a Facebook message seeking comment. Reached by phone at Gohmert’s office Monday, Hair laughed and said, “I don’t have any comment about it.” “Maybe another time we’ll talk about it, but not today,” Hair continued. According to the Times, the hour-long meeting consisted of the activists expressing concern with topics ranging from gay marriage to disloyal White House aides blocking Trump supporters from getting administration jobs to transgender people serving in the military. “Three people with direct knowledge of the events” told the Times that Trump “sat, saying little but appearing taken aback” by the activists’ criticism. The reported attendees share long histories of publicly stoking fears about undocumented immigrants and the “creeping” spread of Sharia law in the United States. Several discuss these issues openly in high-octane social media posts. Hair is particularly vocal on Facebook and Twitter, where she alternates between sharing Bible verses, posts praising Trump, and articles from obscure news sites. “Leftist Jew Hatred Comes To America,” read one recent headline shared by Hair from a site called American Greatness.  A Jan. 9 Facebook post sharing an article about Trump banning transgender people from military service is captioned “Yay!” Recent tweets include include a retweeted comment about the 2017 mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas being covered up, and an article suggesting that women could be forcibly drafted into the U.S. armed services. According to the SPLC, Hair is a longtime friend of Fox News’ Sean Hannity who started out as a B movie actress before becoming involved with various conservative causes. Hair had stints working for the far-right legal outfit Judicial Watch, serving as the official spokesperson for the Arizona’s Minuteman militia organization, and writing speeches on the communications team for Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ), who resigned in disgrace in 2017 amid reports he suggested aides have intercourse with him to serve as a surrogate for his child. Hair also previously worked as a columnist for Human Events, writing articles about the Muslim Brotherhood’s “great strides in its infiltration of American government and institutions” and stopping the spread of Sharia law. She now serves as chief of staff for Gohmert, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and one of the most conservative members of Congress. Frank Gaffney is perhaps the best known of the meeting attendees named by the Times. Gaffney founded the Center for Security Policy think tank in 1988, which he uses as a vehicle to spread conspiracy theories about the threat Islam poses to America. Gaffney has falsely claimed that President Barack Obama is a secret Muslim and that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. Though he was once considered on the fringe and banned from the Conservative Political Action Conference for baselessly accusing members of CPAC’s board of assisting the Muslim Brotherhood, Gaffney was welcomed into the fold of the modern Republican Party. He held a national security summit for 2016 presidential candidates, and advised the Trump campaign on issues like the Muslim ban. More recently, Gaffney drew headlines for denying that Hungarian Jewish philanthropist George Soros is a victim of anti-Semitism and suggesting that the string of pipe bombs sent to Democratic figures and newsrooms last year were a false flag meant to “deflect attention from the Left’s mobs.” Rosemary Jenks, another reported attendee, is a fellow traveler in the world of anti-immigrant advocacy. Since the 1990s, Jenks has devoted her career to writing papers about the untold cost of undocumented immigration and speaking to Congress about the national security threats immigrants pose. She has described NumbersUSA, where she works as the director of government relations, as a “nonprofit, nonpartisan immigration reduction organization.” This work has occasionally brought Jenks into contact with rather questionable associates. In 2008, according to the SPLC, Jenks spoke at a conference hosted by the Social Contract Press, a publication founded by nativist movement founder John Tanton that “routinely publishes race-baiting articles penned by white nationalists.” The meeting at the White House was months in the making, according to the Times, and only came together thanks to the determination of Ginni Thomas. An ardent support of Trump, Thomas’ political advocacy and disdain for political correctness has brought scrutiny from the press in light of her husband’s position. Thomas has shared posts on social media claiming that Democrats committed voter fraud in the 2018 midterms, that the gun control advocacy of the Parkland school shooting survivors represented a threat “to the survival of our nation” and suggesting that immigrants are “criminals and killers.”  Thomas has spent decades pushing a hard-right agenda as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., most recently via her one-woman Liberty Consulting and an organization, Groundswell, focused on strategizing against Democrats. Thomas has also furthered the career of Crystal Clanton, a former member of the pro-Trump youth advocacy group Turning Point USA who the Times reported Thomas tried to have included in last week’s White House meeting. Clanton was booted unceremoniously from her post as TP USA’s national field director in 2017 after the New Yorker published a text message she sent to another staffer saying, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all…I hate blacks. End of story.” Mediaite revealed that Thomas hired Clanton as an assistant in the months following this debacle, publishing photographs of Clanton relaxing with the Thomas’ at their private residence and schmoozing alongside Ginni Thomas at conservative events.

When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry's largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn't envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office. Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called ""silencers"" — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future. Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge US House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it's from a gun dealer or a private sale. Even without Democrats' gains in November's midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called ""Trump slump,"" a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Gary Ramey, owner of Georgian gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year's SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He's expecting the same this year. ""There was no one to beat up. You didn't have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say 'He's the best gun salesman, look what he's doing to our country,'"" he said. Read more: Scientists pinpointed factors that put a community at risk of a mass shooting — and found 2 gun laws that could make a difference ""Numbers are down,"" he added. ""You can't deny it."" Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall. It's easier to drive up gun sales when there's the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. ""It's harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn't have the same galvanizing effect."" The National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 will attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There's a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. Last year's show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons. Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year's show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend. Read more: Switzerland has a stunningly high rate of gun ownership — here's why it doesn't have mass shootings Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry's misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders. ""Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Joe Bartozzi, the new president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry isn't disturbed by the drop in gun sales or the shift in federal politics. While Democrats who ran on gun-control platforms made huge gains in the House, he sees the Senate shifting to the other end of the spectrum.

The Trump administration quickly nixed an Obama-imposed rule that made it more difficult for some disabled people to purchase and possess firearms. But other industry priorities, such as reciprocity between states for carrying certain concealed firearms and a measure that would ease restrictions on purchasing suppressors that help muffle the sound when a gun is fired, failed to gain traction. For now, Bartozzi said his organization is focused on a measure that would expand public gun ranges, funded by an existing tax on firearms and ammunition sales that supports conservation, safety programs, and shooting ranges on public lands. The hope is that increasing the number of public ranges will encourage more people to become hunters.",2019-01-23 00:00:00,Gunmakers are grappling with plummeting sales because Americans aren't worried Trump's going to take their guns away,"politics and government,law and legislation,finances,gun control,firearms",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

He failed in his duties to keep our families and children safe during the devastating shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. These incidents demonstrate Sheriff’s Israel’s repeated incompetence and neglect of duty. The families of the victims deserve accountability.” DeSantis, who called for Israel’s suspension repeatedly during his campaign for governor, appointed retired Coral Springs Police sergeant Gregory Tony as Israel’s successor. Tony is the first African-American to serve as Broward County Sheriff.

The commission also faulted the department for failing to respond meaningfully to multiple reports of threatening behavior on Cruz’s part.

252,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-tumblr-community-where-women-worship-killers,"SEARCH They’re young, they’re online, and they’re so into serial killers and school shooters that some have allegedly planned their own massacres. Reporter Brein Basarich called mass murderer Dylann Roof “precious” and “handsome.” She posted baby pictures of alleged school shooter Nikolas Cruz. She uploaded collages of the 20th century’s most notorious serial killers. And last week she was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill people herself. “I had a vision,” she wrote, “of a very public place, only one way in and one way out. Preferably a bar/club on a busy night. 2019 has a lot in store if my plans go according!” Basarich was part of Tumblr’s “True Crime Community” where serial killers are treated like rockstars and some fans have allegedly turned their fandom into murder plots of their own. Home to thousands of blogs cataloguing the lives of mass murderers, the TCC draws a motley crowd. Some participants are well-meaning crime researchers. Others sympathize with the popular image of school shooters as tormented loners. And another faction—mostly young women—use the community to recast killers as attractive, desirable celebrities. Three people associated with the killer-worshipping TCC sect have been arrested over the past month for allegedly planning terror attacks, including Basarich, 31, from Plant City, Florida. Elizabeth Lecron and Vincent Armstrong, both 23 from Toledo, Ohio, were arrested last month for allegedly planning to build pipe bombs and shoot up a bar. Basarich’s Tumblr was a monument to killers. She didn’t just romanticize them; she appeared to agree with some. She authored two recent posts supporting Roof and attacking African-Americans. But it was her romantic interest in Roof that made her typical of a large subset of Tumblr’s True Crime Community. She, like Lecron and a sizable population of the TCC world, uploaded posts romanticizing Roof. Kendra, who asked not to disclose her last name, is a young woman in Tumblr’s True Crime Community. Unlike Basarich and Lecron, she classifies her killer interest as purely academic. She moderates “Serial Killers Aren’t Sexy,” a Tumblr account dedicated to calling out “all the cringe, shitposts, and otherwise garbage of the TCC.” “From my experience, most of the people in the TCC are younger, probably between 12-20 and are mostly females,” Kendra told The Daily Beast. “I really like true crime and a lot of other people who are in the TCC are also interested in just that, true crime and discussing true crime (and nothing else), but, unfortunately, the TCC has earned a bad reputation thanks to the people who treat it like it's a fandom for serial killers.” She estimated that some 30 percent of the community shared her general interest in crime, while 70 percent were there to glamorize the killers. Dave Cullen, the author of books on the Columbine and Parkland high school shootings, has seen this wing of the True Crime Community evolve out of worship for the Columbine killers and into a general movement glamorizing male killers writ large. For years after the Columbine killings, young people tended to dedicate their blogs to a single mass killing, Cullen said. Only in the past five years has he observed the fandoms merging into the current True Crime Community. The romantic element of the community is “similar to the phenomenon on death row, where women want to marry them or visit them,” Cullen told The Daily Beast. He theorized that the young women worshipping killers on Tumblr believed they could have helped reform the shooters, had they been in a relationship. “The most common MO I see is the boys wanting to emulate the killers, like ‘I’m the tough guy, I’m gonna kill people’ and the girls more frequently wanting to be the killers’ girlfriends,” Cullen said. Women and girls in the community will frequently post pictures of killers “with heart halos and love poems and all that.” The killer worship usually stays online. But when it spills over into the real world, the consequences can be catastrophic. Adam Lanza, the man who murdered 20 children and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a TCC member, The Daily Beast previously reported. He posted pictures of mass shooting victims and video of school shooters on his Tumblr blogs “gayfortimk” and “queerforkimveer,” named for school shooters Tim Kretschmer and Kimveer Gill. In 2015, three TCC members were busted in a plot to commit a mass shooting at a mall in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The three people—ages 19, 20, and 23—met on Tumblr where all three ran gory blogs that glorified the Columbine murders. A blog by 23-year-old plotter Lindsay Souvannarath had the headline “School Shooter Chic; violence is the aesthetic.” Her blog and that of another plotter are still live, despite Tumblr’s crackdown on other content (specifically nudity). In December, federal authorities arrested Lecron and Armstrong, the Ohio couple. Both reportedly ran violent Tumblr blogs. Lecron’s blog included graphic pictures of murder victims, and showed a particular affinity for Roof, with pictures of the mass murderer in front of a photoshopped pink Confederate flag, surrounded by hearts. She wrote letters to Roof’s death row prison cell, and was one of only four of his fans to receive a reply, federal authorities said. She allegedly attempted to send him neo-Nazi literature. After what Armstrong described as “role-playing” that “crossed over” into real-life plans, the couple allegedly plotted mass murder with guns and pipe bombs. They were busted after Lecron purchased bomb ingredients for an undercover FBI officer. Basarich, meanwhile, was arrested last week after a tip about her Tumblr account. According to an affidavit in her arrest, police in Lakeland, Florida called the 31-year-old into the station after they were tipped off to her post alluding to an attack in “a very public place, only one way in and one way out.” When another Tumblr user asked whether Basarich had “homicidal urges,” she responded that “I feel at times a lot of us have urges, whether they will admit or not is the question. So yes, I have.” Elsewhere she posted that “I am getting an AR soonish! Pretty excited. It will be my first gun and I plan to get others.”An extended version of the conversation, not included in the affidavit, appears on Tumblr. “What do you need an AR for?” a Tumblr user asked her. “For shooting,” she replied. One True Crime Community member called the police. “We decided to not stay silent and try to find out where she lived and report her to the proper authorities,” the Tumblr user TerminatedTC wrote on the site. That user found Basarich’s real name and location through a Facebook comment she made on a livestream about the Parkland shooter. “Then I called the Lakeland PD and gave them all the information through a phone call and email and now she is off the streets and whatever she was planning to do was stopped.” Basarich had been on the community’s radar “approximately a week before she'd been arrested,” Kendra, the TCC member who opposes killer worship, said. “We were talking about some of her posts regarding Dylann Roof and the Charleston church shooting.” Unlike Lecron, who owned guns and allegedly purchased bomb ingredients explicitly as part of a bomb plot, Basarich did not own any weapons, raising the question of whether her posts constituted a legitimate threat or a homicidal fantasy. “You can never be too sure, honestly,” Kendra said. “You can't really look at a person's online persona and gauge whether or not they're going to genuinely cause harm to someone and that's why the TCC is so dangerous and toxic. I think generally the threats are harmless but it's really hard to tell in a nation where you can just up and buy a gun and shoot someone without warning, you know?” Cullen characterized most of the community as violent posturing. But that doesn’t make their posts harmless. “These kids are all posing, trying to act tough,” he said. “But if 99.9 percent of them are posing and know they’re not going to ever do anything, an Adam Lanza among them doesn’t necessarily know that. He sees all these other people who are validating him. He probably thinks they’re all for real. “That’s the really scary part of this. These other recent cases are probably the same phenomenon.”",2019-01-11 10:14:53,Inside the Tumblr Community Where Women Worship Killers,"crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders,serial murders",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
253,https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/US/2018-mass-shooting-month-us/story?id=59418185,"The list of deadly shootings continues to grow. Deadliest mass shootings of 2018 in the U.S. Some of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S. last year -- including the Parkland high school shooting and the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh -- prompted widespread national horror. News of other mass shootings, however, seemed to have only reached local audiences. There were a number of incidents where spouses or former spouses killed their partners, and sometimes their children, in Texas, Delaware, Tennessee, Maryland and California. The FBI does not have an official definition of a mass shooting. They do, however, define a mass killing as an incident in which three or more people, not including the suspect, are killed. For decades, that definition used four or more deaths as the metric, but that changed in 2013. Various groups and watchdog organizations keep their own lists, often using different criteria for what qualifies as a mass shooting and often sticking with the earlier threshold of four or more deaths. The FBI defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, not including the suspect, are killed. While there is no publicly accessible federal tracker of such incidents, various groups and watchdog organizations keep their own lists, often using different criteria for what qualifies as a mass shooting. For the list compiled by ABC News below, the incidents took place over the course of a day and involved four or more victims, not including the suspect. For instance, shooting sprees that spanned longer amounts of time were not included on this list. All told, there were at least 20 shootings in 2018 that fit these parameters. There are hundreds of other deadly shootings that took place across the U.S. this year that don't fit these conditions, including some that received national attention, like the shooting at a Maryland Rite Aid, or the shooting at a Chicago hospital. In both of those incidents, three victims were killed and the suspects in each shooting also killed themselves. But whether they made national headlines or not, the common, heartbreaking thread among the 20 incidents below was that they all happened in 2018. 1. Jan. 28: Shooting at a Pennsylvania car wash, 4 victims Four people were killed in a shooting outside a self-service car wash in a rural western Pennsylvania town when a man wearing body armor and wielding three guns, including an AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle, opened fire on them, according to Pennsylvania authorities. The shooting in Melcroft in Fayette County, about 55 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, occurred at 2:52 a.m. and was described by the local district attorney as a ""horrible and senseless event."" 2. Jan. 28: Shooting at an apartment in Pennsylvania, 4 victims The suspect in the shooting of four people at a Reading apartment complex is still at large, authorities said. ""We cannot remember any time in recent history when this many people were shot at one time,"" James Marasco Jr., the deputy chief of the Reading Police Department told the Associated Press at the time. Capt. Paul Reilly of the Reading Police Department's investigation division told ABC News that as of Nov. 26, there have been no arrests and it is still an open investigation. They do not believe it was a random shooting, Reilly said. 3. Feb. 10: Domestic shooting spree in Kentucky, 4 victims The suspect who killed his parents, his girlfriend and her mother allegedly struggled with drug addiction before the shooting, his pastor told The Lexington Herald Leader. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Joseph Nickell, killed himself after he killed his parents, James Wayne Nickell, 75, and Arlene Nickell, 70; his girlfriend Lindsey Vanhoose, 41; and her mother Patricia Vanhoose, 57. The shooter's teenage son was reportedly at his grandparents' home where the first shooting occurred and escaped before calling 911, the paper reported. 4. Feb. 14: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 17 victims The deadliest shooting of the year took place in Parkland, Florida, when a former student opened fire and killed 17 students and school staffers. The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, fled the scene and was later apprehended by authorities. He has been charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the school shooting, and is now facing new charges after allegedly attacking a deputy in jail, according to ABC affiliate WPLG. The massacre prompted survivors to launch a national movement and Florida to change its gun laws. Held a month after the deadly shooting, the March for Our Lives became a national event and some of its student organizers -- including Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg and Jackie Corin --  have become widely recognized figures in the fight for gun reform. The group also launched a national bus tour to try to get other young people involved. 5. Feb. 26: Shootings at gas station and a home in Detroit, 4 victims A man pulled up to a car at a Detroit gas station and opened fire on his child's mother, Ciera Bargaineer, after an altercation. The suspect, George Davis Jr., killed Bargaineer, another woman who was in the car with her, 21-year old Kristin Thomas, and Bargaineer's father, 60-year-old Raphael Hall, ABC affiliate WXYZ reported. Davis then reportedly fled the scene and fatally shot his cousin at a home about two miles away, according to WXYZ. Davis shot himself after leading police on a chace, the station reported. 6. April 22: Waffle House shooting in Nashville, 4 victims A bystander a deadly massacre at a Waffle House. James Shaw Jr., 29, confronted the gunman, took his gun, threw it over a counter and forced the gunman outside. The suspect, Travis Reinking, who was later apprehended by law enforcement officers and is now facing four counts of criminal homicide. Four people were killed: Taurean Sanderlin, 29, a cook at the restaurant who was on a cigarette break and was one of the first slain in the shooting; DeEbony Groves, 21, an honor student at Belmont University in Nashville; and Akilah DaSilva, 23, a Middle Tennessee State University student. The youngest victim was 20-year-old Joe Perez, whose mother wrote in a Facebook post, ""Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss. Our lives are shattered."" 7. May 17: Domestic violence incident in Texas, 4 victims A woman, identified in her children's subsequent obituary as Amanda Simpson Painter, survived a shooting where she says her ex-husband Justin Painter killed their three children and her then-boyfriend, according to The Dallas Morning News. The victims were identified as 29-year-old Seth Richardson, and Odin, 8, Caydence, 6, and Drake Painter, 4. Amanda Simpson Painter told The Huffington Post that Justin Painter told her that he was intentionally letting her alive to live with the pain of losing her children. 8. May 18: Santa Fe High School shooting, 10 victims Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting, where 10 people were killed and 13 others injured, ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools."" The suspect, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is in custody and has been charged with capital murder, officials said. The suspect allegedly wrote in journals that he wanted to carry out the shooting and then commit suicide, but he gave himself up to authorities, according to Abbott. 9. June 10: Domestic violence incident in Florida, 4 victims Four young children were fatally shot by their mother's boyfriend and the suspect shot an officer in the head after police responded to the scene. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect, Gary Lindsey Jr., was the father of two of the children -- Dove Lindsey, 1, and Aiden Lindsey, 6. He allegedly killed them along with the other two children in the home -- Lillia Pluth, 10, and Irayan Pluth, 12 -- in the altercation. Lindsey then killed himself at the scene. Orlando Police Department officer Kevin Valencia was shot in the head and remains in a coma more than five months after the incident, according to a spokesperson for the department. 10. June 28: Shooting at Maryland newspaper office, 5 victims The shooting at a Maryland newsroom that killed five people was a targeted attack, according to local police. The suspect, armed with a shotgun, looked for victims in the newsroom of the Capital Gazette, a daily newspaper in Annapolis, which is located in the first floor of a multi-office building, Anne Arundel Police Department Deputy Chief Bill Krampf said at the time. Rob Hiaasen, 59, Wendi Winters, 65, Gerald Fischman, 61, John McNamara, 56, and Rebecca Smith, 34, all were shot to death, allegedly by 38-year-old Jarrod Ramos, who had a longstanding feud with the newspaper and has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder. 11. July 9: Domestic violence incident in Delaware, 4 victims A man in Wilmington shot his wife and three children before shooting himself, the Delaware State Police reported. Julie Edwards, 41, and a 6 year-old boy, a 4 year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy were all killed by Matthew Edwards, 42, authorities said. The case was ruled a murder-suicide by the Delaware State Police. 12. July 27: Domestic violence incident in Texas, 4 victims A man killed his 85-year-old father, 60-year-old stepmother, her 41-year-old son and the couple's adopted 13-year-old son before turning the gun on himself, according to the Alice Echo News Journal. The two sons, Roel Mireles, 41, and Isaiah Starry, 13, were found shot dead at their parent's residence and their parents, Ernest Starry and Thelma Montalvo, were found dead at a nursing home in Robstown, Texas, alongside their suspect son, Richard Starry, the paper reported. 13. Sept. 12: Domestic violence incident in California, 5 victims A man shot his ex-wife and four other people, some of whom appeared to be responding to his first gunshots, in Bakersfield. ABC-owned station KABC reported that there were two separate but related shootings before the suspect shot himself when he was confronted by a sheriff's deputy. The suspect, Javier Casarez, killed his ex-wife Petra Maribel Bolanos De Casarez. Their divorce was finalized in June, months after he claimed in court that he believed his wife was cheating on him, according to KABC. 14. Sept. 17: Domestic violence incident in Maryland, 4 victims A father fatally shot his wife, his 10-year-old son and his 22-year-old stepdaughter before killing himself at their home in their Montgomery County, Maryland. He also shot his 11-year-old daughter, who died three days later, according to NBC Washington. NBC Washington reported that the suspect, Yong Mun Kim, left names and phone numbers of relatives for police, which suggests he planned the murder-suicide. 15. Oct. 13: Shooting at a birthday party in Texas, 4 victims A toddler's first birthday party turned deadly following an alleged altercation between two families attending the party. Texas Department of Public Safety officials said that four men were fatally shot and two others were wounded, with two suspects fleeing the scene, the Associated Press reported. 16. Oct. 15: Mother kills teenage children and herself in Tennessee, 4 victims A mother killed her four teenage children in their Columbia, Tenn., home before reportedly shooting herself, local law enforcement said. The Tennessean reports that the four children were Bo Li, 14, Meigan Lin, 14, Lia Lin, 15, and Kaileigh Lin, 17. Their mother, Cynthia Collier, 55, was found with self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The Associated Press reported that the bodies were discovered by an adult child who returned home from work, and a local sheriff said that the teen victims had all been adopted and home schooled. 17. Oct. 27: Shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, 11 victims Eleven worshipers, including a 97-year-old woman, were gunned down inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in America. ""Words escape me of what you can say,"" said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was officiating a service when a gunman started shooting. ""They were all beautiful, wonderful, good decent people. Hate was not in their vocabulary."" 18. Nov. 7: Shooting at a California bar, 12 victims At least 12 people, including a police officer, were killed when a gunman opened fire in a packed Southern California bar during its ""college night,"" leaving the community of Thousand Oaks in shock and in mourning. The lone suspect, 28-year-old Ian David Long, was found dead inside the Borderline Bar & Grill after the overnight shooting, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Authorities believe he shot himself. 19. Nov. 19: Drug-related shooting in Philadelphia, 4 victims Four people were killed in what was described by the Associated Press as a drug sale gone awry in Philadelphia. The victims were identified as William Taylor and Akeen Mattox, along with sisters Tiyaniah Rakele Hopkins and Yaleah Hall. ""At a minimum, three people were collateral damage in a horrific incident,"" police commissioner Richard Ross said, according to the AP. Philadelphia police confirmed that the four suspects -- Jahlil Porter, Robert Long, Nasir Moss Robertson, and Keith Garner -- are facing murder, robbery, and criminal conspiracy charges among others. 20. Dec. 28: Boyfriend kills girlfriend, her kids, and her mother in Missouri, 4 victims The suspect, Richard Darren Emery, was arrested on suspicion of killing his live-in girlfriend, Kate Kasten, her son Jonathan Kasten, 10, her daughter Zoe Kasten, 8, and her mother Jane Moeckel. Emery lived with Kate Kasten and her two children, whose father Kory died about two years ago after a years-long battle with cancer. Jane Moeckel -- Kate Kasten’s mother -- was staying with Emery and Kasten temporarily as she recovered from knee surgery, according to Kasten's father and Moeckel's ex-husband Rick Moeckel, who spoke to ABC News. “The whole thing is confusing,” said Rick Moeckel, who also lost two grandchildren. He added that he remembered Emergy as a ""nice guy."" Emery was arrested after avoiding police for several hours -- attempting to steal a woman’s car and attacking her -- before being apprehended at a convenience store. He now faces 15 charges -- including four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of armed criminal action, three counts of first-degree assault, and one count of attempted robbery.

254,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/house-democrats-gun-control.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,"Advertisement Supported by transcript “We say enough is enough by finally bringing common sense, bipartisan background check legislation to the floor of the House.” “I’ve seen great courage when my life was on the line. Now is a time to come together— be responsible: Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting. Fight, fight, fight — be bold, be courageous. The nation’s counting on you.” By Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON — Emboldened House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation on Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. By introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress. The measure, and a companion bill introduced Tuesday in the Senate, also reflects the changing politics around gun laws, an issue many Democrats once shied away from. The bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but will face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the internet. There would be limited exceptions, including for law enforcement officers and for guns transferred between close family members. Polls have shown that a vast majority of Americans — by some estimates, 90 percent — support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Many Democrats, including Representative Lucy McBath, a freshman from Georgia whose son was shot and killed at a Florida gas station, were elected last year after promising to address gun safety. “Today we take a decisive step to help save lives right away,” said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and the bill’s chief sponsor, adding, “From public polling to the ballot box, the American people have spoken up and demanded action.” By limiting the bill to background checks — and keeping out other provisions such as a ban on assault rifles or high-capacity magazines — gun safety advocates hope to pressure Republicans on a policy that has broad public support. In the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will have to decide whether to bring up the bill. In the House, Republicans will be forced to vote on it. “It will show us who’s with us and who’s against us,” said Patricia Maisch, 69, who survived the Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting in Tucson that killed six and grievously injured Ms. Giffords. But by narrowing the bill so dramatically, Democrats may also limit its utility. Suspects in many recent high-profile mass shootings — including those in Pittsburgh; Parkland, Fla.; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. — had passed background checks when purchasing their weapons. Even modest gun law changes rarely make it through Congress. The measure is similar to one written by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, in response to the mass shooting that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. That bill, pressed hard by President Barack Obama and the parents of Sandy Hook victims, fell to a bipartisan filibuster in 2013 in a Senate controlled by Democrats. Then as now, the National Rifle Association opposed the measure. “So-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the powerful gun lobby. She noted that the gunman who shot Ms. Giffords passed a background check. His name did not come up in the federal database even though he had mental health issues. The Democrats’ measure was unveiled at a news conference featuring Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Thompson, who helped write the House companion bill to Toomey-Manchin in 2013, and Ms. Giffords, as well as gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence from around the country. Mr. Thompson escorted Ms. Giffords, who as a former member is still permitted on the House floor, into the chamber so she could formally drop the bill into the “hopper” — the bin, located on the rostrum, where all legislation has its start. Ms. Giffords, 48, a Democrat who once opposed gun control, was shot in the head during a constituent meeting she was holding in a supermarket parking lot. Those who died included a 9-year-old girl and a young staff member for Ms. Giffords; 13 were injured, including Ms. Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury that makes conversation difficult. “It’s been a long, hard haul, but I’m getting better,” Ms. Giffords told reporters at a breakfast Tuesday, reading from a prepared statement. She said she was still undergoing “speech therapy, physical therapy — and yoga, too.” Current law requires only federally licensed gun dealers to perform background checks. Gun safety advocates say the law is riddled with loopholes that allow felons, domestic abusers and others who would ordinarily be prohibited from buying guns to purchase them through private sales, including online and at gun shows. For gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence, Tuesday’s bill introduction represents an important shift in Washington after a year of devastating massacres, including the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last February, which spawned a powerful youth movement. “Successful legislative change follows cultural change,” said Emily Nottingham, whose son, Gabriel Zimmerman, then an aide to Ms. Giffords, was killed in the Tucson shooting. She added, “When more and more people recognize that this is a national issue that can affect all of us, not just a few people somewhere else, then cultural change happens, and that’s what we’re seeing now.” Under the Thompson bill, anyone who wanted to sell a gun but lacked a license would have to take the weapon to a licensed dealer, who would then conduct a background check on the purchaser. Transfers between law enforcement officers and military personnel acting in a professional capacity would be exempt, as would “a loan or bona fide gift between spouses, between domestic partners, between parents and their children, between siblings, between aunts and uncles and their nieces or nephews or between grandparents and their grandchildren,” according to the text of the bill. Transfers to executors of estates would also be exempt, as would temporary transfers of weapons for the purpose of hunting or to “prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.” Advertisement",2019-01-08 00:00:00,Background Check Bill Marks Gun Control as a Priority for House Democrats - The New York Times,,1,http://nytimes.com

Night Shyamalan’s inter-sequel battle royale to Matthew McConaughey getting noir-ish — what to see at the movies this month Reporter Samuel L. Jackson, James McAvoy and Bruce Willis in 'Glass.' Jessica Kourkounis/Universal Pictures Ol’ Matt McConaughey gets caught up in a bizarre love triangle involving a fishing boat, Keanu Reeves is a scientist tampering with dark forces beyond mortal control, there’s a new blockbuster based on a popular recreational past time — it can only mean one thing. It’s January at the movies, people! Studios tend to treat the first month of the year as a lull in which they can dispose of their least-profitable properties, and this time-honored tradition is surely still in effect in 2019. But a few pleasant surprises often lurk in this no-man’s-land, as you’ll see below. Not to mention that M. Night Shyamalan’s dual follow-up to Unbreakable and Split seems like a sure thing; there’s a daring new provocation from the elder statesman of French cinema; and the director behind Attack the Block gives us his take on the YA adventure. Never mind the holdover Oscar contenders — here’s what you should check out this month at the movies. See Also

						The Best Audiophile Turntables for Your Home Audio System An Acceptable Loss (Jan. 18th)
Libby Lamm (Tika Sumpter) knows too much. The security advisor okayed a foreign strike thought to be extreme during her time under draconian mentor (Jamie Lee Curtis). It led to thousands of civilian casualties and a scandal gnawing at the fabric of her soul. Does she blow the whistle and expose a national atrocity, even if it means risking treason charges or a quiet assassination? This could be a nerve-jangling thriller or a classic January-release Bronx raspberry, but far be it from us to ignore the thrill of watching the underrated Sumpter match wits with the erstwhile Laurie Strode. Escape Room (Jan. 4th)
They are the hot new trend in team-building and grown-up recreation: Those “escape rooms” that force you to pool wits with your friends or coworkers, solve intricate puzzles and win your freedom from a locked chamber before time’s up. If the concept sounds like it’s halfway to a horror movie already, it pretty much is — see: Cube, the Saw franchise, etc. This new creepshow from Adam Robitel (director of the sixth Paranormal Activity and the fourth Insidious) takes it the rest of the way, trapping a group of strangers in a lethal obstacle course, where the stakes are closer to “being burned alive” than “disappointing your pals.” Double-check the cineplex doors on your way into the theater, just for good measure.  Glass (Jan. 18th)
Go ahead, call it a comeback. Having scored a hit with Split, M. Night Shyamalan follows the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” principle by cranking out this supersize sequel pitting multi-personality baddie “Kevin” (James McAvoy) against Unbreakable‘s David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and the enigmatic Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). It’s a bona fide Shyama-verse battle royale! Expect an on-brand twist, as well as some “Beast” mode terror and the sort of salt-of-the-earth superheroics that’s made the director’s 2000 take on comic-book storytelling so beloved. The Image Book (Jan. 25th)
Jean-Luc Godard is now 88 years old — and unsurprisingly, he’s still got plenty to say. His latest could be best classified as a free-form cinematic essay, or maybe a broadside against state-sponsored atrocity, or possibly an appraisal of the Arabic world’s sociopolitical climate. Cue a disorienting, overwhelming flurry of sampled footage and purposefully curated music, bound together by lofty philosophical narration from the man himself (and his longtime partner Anne-Marie Miéville). It’s also his first film to truly reckon with the larger artistic significance of le cinema du Michael Bay. The Kid Who Would Be King (Jan. 25th)
A bullied grade-schooler named Alex Alex (Louis Ashbourne Serkis, son of Andy) gets a grip on Excalibur and assembles his modern-day Knights of the Round Table. It sounds like kind of adventure that Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment cranked out during their 1980s heyday, only with CGI skeletons armed to the teeth, dragons rippling with spines and one pissed-off enchantress. Patrick Stewart is a shape-shifting Merlin; Mission: Impossible franchise all-star Rebecca Ferguson is the contemporary Morgan le Fay. If ever there was a film earnest enough to make the old “the real heroes were the friends we made along the way!” refrain work, it’s this one. King of Thieves (Jan. 25th)
The “one last job” movie to end all “one last job” movies stars Michael Caine as the leader of a crack team of long-in-the-tooth crooks looking to boost millions in jewels. From there, the rest pretty much writes itself: The brains behind this caper rounds up an elite squad of fellow AARP-eligible lowlifes in the form of Jim Broadbent, Tom Courtenay, Paul Whitehouse and Michael Gambon. (Daredevil’s Charlie Cox also shows up as the token under-60 exception.) Do you think their best-laid plans go horribly awry? Will they get away with the crime or end up doing their senior-level time? How many heist movies have you seen that you’re still asking these questions? Replicas (Jan. 11th)
From the reckless disregard for the laws of nature that brought us Scanners comes this sci-fi-inflected thriller about a scientist (Keanu Reeves, at his Keanu Reeviest) obsessed with bringing his deceased family back to life. But when he finally cracks it, something seems off about his wife (Alice Eve); their three kids aren’t acting quite so darling either. Also in the mix: a misbehaving robot, a sinister corporation, some comic relief courtesy of Thomas Middleditch and enough eyeball-piercing needles to last a lifetime. Paging Dr. Frankenstein …. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbrOMrjhyvI Serenity (Jan. 25th)
The erotic thriller is a dying breed in Hollywood, but Steven Knight — veteran screenwriter, and creator of such small-screen successes as Peaky Blinders — could be just the man to bring it back. Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) has built himself a quiet, decent life when his no-good ex-wife (a blonde-haired Anne Hathaway) breezes back into his life with a lethal proposition. She won’t take any more abuse from her brute of a new beau (Jason Clarke), so she pleads with Baker to kill the man. Fans of recent niche delights A Simple Favor and Unforgettable, take note.  The Standoff at Sparrow Creek (Jan. 18th)
There’s been a mass shooting. Someone from the local chapter of a nationwide civilian militia did it. So the group’s head honcho (James Badge Dale) has gathered some of his fellow don’t-tread-on-me types to figure out what went wrong. Also the cops on their way, and they’re going to want some answers. Welcome to the premise for this intense game of guess-who from rookie director Henry Dunham, in which every hot topic from police brutality to the re-emergence of white supremacist groups, then sticks it all in a pressure cooker set to Reservoir Dogs. Eventually, it has to go boom. The Upside (Jan. 11th)
So the critics didn’t favor the French film from which this big-hearted new comedy has been adapted. And maybe folks are not so happy with Kevin Hart right now. But the original — 2011’s Les Intouchables — was a gargantuan hit in Europe, and America loves a feel-good story. That’s exactly what they’ll get from the account of a real-life friendship that blossomed between a quadriplegic zillionaire (played here by Bryan Cranston) and the down-on-his-luck fast-talker (Hart) hired to work as his caregiver. Anyone enamored of Green Book is in for another outbreak of the warm-and-fuzzies. In This Article:

256,https://www.dailynews.com/2018/12/29/alexander-ten-2018-sports-stories-that-mattered/,"Trending: The type of year this was in Southern California sports probably depends on which team(s) you pull for. Hope, uncertainty for the future, despair that your (a) players, (b) coaches, (c) executives or (d) owners are going through the motions … yes, it all exists in SoCal, one more reason this is the most diverse, and sometimes fickle, market in North America. 
Amid the daily grind, some stories stood out. It’s not necessarily a Top Ten, but merely my list of Ten That Mattered. 
• Elgin’s statue. As I noted in April, Elgin Baylor was L.A.’s first pro basketball star, and the guy who invented hang time. Thus, it was rather backward that six other Laker legends got statues outside of Staples Center before he did. It was an honor long overdue, and maybe it will remind future generations that yes, there was greatness here before LeBron, or Kobe, or Magic and Kareem. 
 


• Max Muncy, hero. Nobody would have bought this story if it were submitted as a script: The guy who started the year as a journeyman minor leaguer, and finished it as the leading home run hitter for a National League champion, topped it off by ending a marathon World Series game with an 18th inning home run (after almost ending it in similar fashion in the 15th, wrapping one around the right field foul pole). 
It wasn’t a perfectly happy ending; Red Sox fans (and, of course, those who root for the Giants) got the last celebration. But if you’re a Dodger fan, your personal highlight reel for 2018 likely ends as Muncy’s Game 3 home run sails over the left field fence. And it is worth noting that at the end, 7 hours and 20 minutes after first pitch, the park was still awfully full, so tell me no more about how L.A. fans always leave early. 
						

• More than a game, but what a game. It wasn’t supposed to take place here, but the Rams-Chiefs instant classic at the Coliseum Nov. 19 — relocated when the turf at Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium was deemed unfit for NFL football — was not only a great game, and maybe the greatest of this season, but a cathartic moment for a community that had dealt with a mass shooting and a rash of wildfires in the span of a few days. 
And the performances put on by Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes that night in L.A.’s 54-51 win, while sublime, still didn’t match the way the Rams’ organization responded on a week’s notice to pull everything together. As team executive VP Kevin Demoff put it that night: “Sean (McVay, the coach) talks all the time about two things: Being connected, and being at your best when your best is required. And I think for the entire organization over the last two weeks, that explains everything.” 	




• Ohtani-san and those he inspired. The full Shohei Ohtani adventure is still on hold, because elbow surgery will restrict him to only hitting for the Angels in 2019. But the American League Rookie of the Year already is, literally, a game-changer. Because of his success at both hitting and pitching before his right elbow betrayed him, other organizations seem more willing to consider players who can do both. 
For example, Seattle claimed Angels infielder Kaleb Cowart on waivers with the idea of seeing what he can do on the mound. Third baseman Matt Davidson, a free agent after hitting 20 homers for the White Sox last year, has done well enough pitching in blowouts that he said he’d be open to trying to do both. And a generation of young players capable of doing both in high school and college may no longer be necessarily forced to choose upon signing a professional contract. 

• The Zlatan Phenomenon. Even for those who weren’t previously familiar with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as an international player with Sweden and as a club star with some of Europe’s most famous teams — Juventus, Inter Milan, Paris St. Germain, Barcelona and Manchester United — it took one goal to get SoCal’s attention. 
Entering in the 71st minute against LAFC in his Galaxy debut March 31, his swerving, dipping 40-yard shot that sailed over the head of LAFC goalie Tyler Miller and into the net was the first of his two goals in a come-from-behind 4-3 Galaxy victory, and it sent a message. 
“They wanted Zlatan. I gave them Zlatan,” the irrepressible striker said after that first game. Translation: This was going to be totally different from anything we were used to. 

• LABron. The billboard guy, personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani, had the last laugh. He was the guy who bought advertising space throughout Southern California last winter and into the spring, all intended to get LeBron James to sign with his beloved Lakers. I suspect the signs didn’t do much to sway James either way, but every little bit helps, right? 
Bottom line, regardless of what selling point was most influential: The Lakers are relevant again. 

• Tex’s impact. It is worth noting that when Tex Winter accompanied Phil Jackson to Chicago, and later to Los Angeles, resident superstars Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant had little good to say about the triple-post (or triangle) offense, which Winter spread as gospel wherever he coached. But those stars couldn’t say enough good things about Winter himself. 
“I wouldn’t be where I am today without you,” Bryant posted on Twitter and Instagram after Winter’s passing in October, at the age of 96. 
And it’s also worth noting that Winter, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, had an impact on SoCal long before getting here with the Lakers: as a kid growing up in Huntington Park, as a player at USC (where he learned the triple-post from Sam Barry, his coach) and as a coach at Long Beach State (1978-83). 

• The energy at the Banc. 
The expansion Los Angeles Football Club’s extended run-up to its inaugural MLS season enabled it to cultivate a fan group, the 3252 (add it up and it equals 12, as in 12th player), that became a story almost unto itself by the time the club finally reached its new home, Banc of California Stadium, at the end of April. 
Of course, expectations for expansion teams seem to have changed. LAFC reached the playoffs in its first season. And a club one year ahead of them, Atlanta United, just won the MLS Cup. 

• One (last) shining moment. Headed into its final rotation at the NCAA women’s gymnastics finals last April in St. Louis, UCLA was trailing two-time defending champion Oklahoma by .175 and pretty much needed a miracle on the balance beam to win. They got it: Kyla Ross scored a 9.9875, and then redshirt senior Christine Peng-Peng Lee, ignoring the score and focusing on the last performance of a college career that had been interrupted repeatedly by injuries, recorded a perfect 10 to give the Bruins their seventh national championship. 

• Adios, Sosh. Mike Scioscia lasted 19 seasons as Angels manager. He was a lightning rod for criticism in the final years of his tenure, though decisions made by those above him and the physical frailties of those under him had a lot to do with an inability to take advantage of the game’s best player, Mike Trout. 
But consider: In the time since Scioscia was hired in Anaheim, 29 other franchises have churned through 197 managers (an average of 6.79 per team), including interims but not counting the six (including the Angels’ Brad Ausmus) who will debut next spring. The point: The manager is not always the problem. 
Anyway, how many other managers can do this?

• LABron. The billboard guy, personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani, had the last laugh. He was the guy who bought advertising space throughout Southern California last winter and into the spring, all intended to get LeBron James to sign with his beloved Lakers. I suspect the signs didn’t do much to sway James either way, but every little bit helps, right? 
Bottom line, regardless of what selling point was most influential: The Lakers are relevant again. 

• Tex’s impact. It is worth noting that when Tex Winter accompanied Phil Jackson to Chicago, and later to Los Angeles, resident superstars Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant had little good to say about the triple-post (or triangle) offense, which Winter spread as gospel wherever he coached. But those stars couldn’t say enough good things about Winter himself. 
“I wouldn’t be where I am today without you,” Bryant posted on Twitter and Instagram after Winter’s passing in October, at the age of 96. 
And it’s also worth noting that Winter, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, had an impact on SoCal long before getting here with the Lakers: as a kid growing up in Huntington Park, as a player at USC (where he learned the triple-post from Sam Barry, his coach) and as a coach at Long Beach State (1978-83). 

• The energy at the Banc. 
The expansion Los Angeles Football Club’s extended run-up to its inaugural MLS season enabled it to cultivate a fan group, the 3252 (add it up and it equals 12, as in 12th player), that became a story almost unto itself by the time the club finally reached its new home, Banc of California Stadium, at the end of April. 
Of course, expectations for expansion teams seem to have changed. LAFC reached the playoffs in its first season. And a club one year ahead of them, Atlanta United, just won the MLS Cup. 

• One (last) shining moment. Headed into its final rotation at the NCAA women’s gymnastics finals last April in St. Louis, UCLA was trailing two-time defending champion Oklahoma by .175 and pretty much needed a miracle on the balance beam to win. They got it: Kyla Ross scored a 9.9875, and then redshirt senior Christine Peng-Peng Lee, ignoring the score and focusing on the last performance of a college career that had been interrupted repeatedly by injuries, recorded a perfect 10 to give the Bruins their seventh national championship. 

• Adios, Sosh. Mike Scioscia lasted 19 seasons as Angels manager. He was a lightning rod for criticism in the final years of his tenure, though decisions made by those above him and the physical frailties of those under him had a lot to do with an inability to take advantage of the game’s best player, Mike Trout. 
But consider: In the time since Scioscia was hired in Anaheim, 29 other franchises have churned through 197 managers (an average of 6.79 per team), including interims but not counting the six (including the Angels’ Brad Ausmus) who will debut next spring. The point: The manager is not always the problem. 
Anyway, how many other managers can do this?

Thus, it was rather backward that six other Laker legends got statues outside of Staples Center before he did. It was an honor long overdue, and maybe it will remind future generations that yes, there was greatness here before LeBron, or Kobe, or Magic and Kareem. 
 


• Max Muncy, hero. Nobody would have bought this story if it were submitted as a script: The guy who started the year as a journeyman minor leaguer, and finished it as the leading home run hitter for a National League champion, topped it off by ending a marathon World Series game with an 18th inning home run (after almost ending it in similar fashion in the 15th, wrapping one around the right field foul pole). 
It wasn’t a perfectly happy ending; Red Sox fans (and, of course, those who root for the Giants) got the last celebration. But if you’re a Dodger fan, your personal highlight reel for 2018 likely ends as Muncy’s Game 3 home run sails over the left field fence. And it is worth noting that at the end, 7 hours and 20 minutes after first pitch, the park was still awfully full, so tell me no more about how L.A. fans always leave early. 
						

• More than a game, but what a game. It wasn’t supposed to take place here, but the Rams-Chiefs instant classic at the Coliseum Nov. 19 — relocated when the turf at Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium was deemed unfit for NFL football — was not only a great game, and maybe the greatest of this season, but a cathartic moment for a community that had dealt with a mass shooting and a rash of wildfires in the span of a few days. 
And the performances put on by Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes that night in L.A.’s 54-51 win, while sublime, still didn’t match the way the Rams’ organization responded on a week’s notice to pull everything together. As team executive VP Kevin Demoff put it that night: “Sean (McVay, the coach) talks all the time about two things: Being connected, and being at your best when your best is required. And I think for the entire organization over the last two weeks, that explains everything.” 	




• Ohtani-san and those he inspired. The full Shohei Ohtani adventure is still on hold, because elbow surgery will restrict him to only hitting for the Angels in 2019. But the American League Rookie of the Year already is, literally, a game-changer. Because of his success at both hitting and pitching before his right elbow betrayed him, other organizations seem more willing to consider players who can do both. 
For example, Seattle claimed Angels infielder Kaleb Cowart on waivers with the idea of seeing what he can do on the mound. Third baseman Matt Davidson, a free agent after hitting 20 homers for the White Sox last year, has done well enough pitching in blowouts that he said he’d be open to trying to do both. And a generation of young players capable of doing both in high school and college may no longer be necessarily forced to choose upon signing a professional contract. 

• The Zlatan Phenomenon. Even for those who weren’t previously familiar with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as an international player with Sweden and as a club star with some of Europe’s most famous teams — Juventus, Inter Milan, Paris St. Germain, Barcelona and Manchester United — it took one goal to get SoCal’s attention.

“I wouldn’t be where I am today without you,” Bryant posted on Twitter and Instagram after Winter’s passing in October, at the age of 96. 
And it’s also worth noting that Winter, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, had an impact on SoCal long before getting here with the Lakers: as a kid growing up in Huntington Park, as a player at USC (where he learned the triple-post from Sam Barry, his coach) and as a coach at Long Beach State (1978-83). 

• The energy at the Banc. 
The expansion Los Angeles Football Club’s extended run-up to its inaugural MLS season enabled it to cultivate a fan group, the 3252 (add it up and it equals 12, as in 12th player), that became a story almost unto itself by the time the club finally reached its new home, Banc of California Stadium, at the end of April. 
Of course, expectations for expansion teams seem to have changed. LAFC reached the playoffs in its first season. And a club one year ahead of them, Atlanta United, just won the MLS Cup. 

• One (last) shining moment. Headed into its final rotation at the NCAA women’s gymnastics finals last April in St. Louis, UCLA was trailing two-time defending champion Oklahoma by .175 and pretty much needed a miracle on the balance beam to win. They got it: Kyla Ross scored a 9.9875, and then redshirt senior Christine Peng-Peng Lee, ignoring the score and focusing on the last performance of a college career that had been interrupted repeatedly by injuries, recorded a perfect 10 to give the Bruins their seventh national championship. 

• Adios, Sosh. Mike Scioscia lasted 19 seasons as Angels manager. He was a lightning rod for criticism in the final years of his tenure, though decisions made by those above him and the physical frailties of those under him had a lot to do with an inability to take advantage of the game’s best player, Mike Trout. 
But consider: In the time since Scioscia was hired in Anaheim, 29 other franchises have churned through 197 managers (an average of 6.79 per team), including interims but not counting the six (including the Angels’ Brad Ausmus) who will debut next spring. The point: The manager is not always the problem. 
Anyway, how many other managers can do this?

Report an Error • More than a game, but what a game. It wasn’t supposed to take place here, but the Rams-Chiefs instant classic at the Coliseum Nov. 19 — relocated when the turf at Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium was deemed unfit for NFL football — was not only a great game, and maybe the greatest of this season, but a cathartic moment for a community that had dealt with a mass shooting and a rash of wildfires in the span of a few days. 
And the performances put on by Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes that night in L.A.’s 54-51 win, while sublime, still didn’t match the way the Rams’ organization responded on a week’s notice to pull everything together. As team executive VP Kevin Demoff put it that night: “Sean (McVay, the coach) talks all the time about two things: Being connected, and being at your best when your best is required. And I think for the entire organization over the last two weeks, that explains everything.” 	




• Ohtani-san and those he inspired. The full Shohei Ohtani adventure is still on hold, because elbow surgery will restrict him to only hitting for the Angels in 2019. But the American League Rookie of the Year already is, literally, a game-changer. Because of his success at both hitting and pitching before his right elbow betrayed him, other organizations seem more willing to consider players who can do both. 
For example, Seattle claimed Angels infielder Kaleb Cowart on waivers with the idea of seeing what he can do on the mound. Third baseman Matt Davidson, a free agent after hitting 20 homers for the White Sox last year, has done well enough pitching in blowouts that he said he’d be open to trying to do both. And a generation of young players capable of doing both in high school and college may no longer be necessarily forced to choose upon signing a professional contract. 

• The Zlatan Phenomenon. Even for those who weren’t previously familiar with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as an international player with Sweden and as a club star with some of Europe’s most famous teams — Juventus, Inter Milan, Paris St. Germain, Barcelona and Manchester United — it took one goal to get SoCal’s attention. 
Entering in the 71st minute against LAFC in his Galaxy debut March 31, his swerving, dipping 40-yard shot that sailed over the head of LAFC goalie Tyler Miller and into the net was the first of his two goals in a come-from-behind 4-3 Galaxy victory, and it sent a message. 
“They wanted Zlatan. I gave them Zlatan,” the irrepressible striker said after that first game. Translation: This was going to be totally different from anything we were used to. 

• LABron. The billboard guy, personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani, had the last laugh. He was the guy who bought advertising space throughout Southern California last winter and into the spring, all intended to get LeBron James to sign with his beloved Lakers. I suspect the signs didn’t do much to sway James either way, but every little bit helps, right? 
Bottom line, regardless of what selling point was most influential: The Lakers are relevant again. 

• Tex’s impact. It is worth noting that when Tex Winter accompanied Phil Jackson to Chicago, and later to Los Angeles, resident superstars Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant had little good to say about the triple-post (or triangle) offense, which Winter spread as gospel wherever he coached.

I suspect the signs didn’t do much to sway James either way, but every little bit helps, right? 
Bottom line, regardless of what selling point was most influential: The Lakers are relevant again. 

• Tex’s impact. It is worth noting that when Tex Winter accompanied Phil Jackson to Chicago, and later to Los Angeles, resident superstars Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant had little good to say about the triple-post (or triangle) offense, which Winter spread as gospel wherever he coached. But those stars couldn’t say enough good things about Winter himself. 
“I wouldn’t be where I am today without you,” Bryant posted on Twitter and Instagram after Winter’s passing in October, at the age of 96. 
And it’s also worth noting that Winter, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, had an impact on SoCal long before getting here with the Lakers: as a kid growing up in Huntington Park, as a player at USC (where he learned the triple-post from Sam Barry, his coach) and as a coach at Long Beach State (1978-83). 

• The energy at the Banc. 
The expansion Los Angeles Football Club’s extended run-up to its inaugural MLS season enabled it to cultivate a fan group, the 3252 (add it up and it equals 12, as in 12th player), that became a story almost unto itself by the time the club finally reached its new home, Banc of California Stadium, at the end of April. 
Of course, expectations for expansion teams seem to have changed. LAFC reached the playoffs in its first season. And a club one year ahead of them, Atlanta United, just won the MLS Cup. 

• One (last) shining moment. Headed into its final rotation at the NCAA women’s gymnastics finals last April in St. Louis, UCLA was trailing two-time defending champion Oklahoma by .175 and pretty much needed a miracle on the balance beam to win. They got it: Kyla Ross scored a 9.9875, and then redshirt senior Christine Peng-Peng Lee, ignoring the score and focusing on the last performance of a college career that had been interrupted repeatedly by injuries, recorded a perfect 10 to give the Bruins their seventh national championship. 

• Adios, Sosh. Mike Scioscia lasted 19 seasons as Angels manager. He was a lightning rod for criticism in the final years of his tenure, though decisions made by those above him and the physical frailties of those under him had a lot to do with an inability to take advantage of the game’s best player, Mike Trout. 
But consider: In the time since Scioscia was hired in Anaheim, 29 other franchises have churned through 197 managers (an average of 6.79 per team), including interims but not counting the six (including the Angels’ Brad Ausmus) who will debut next spring. The point: The manager is not always the problem. 
Anyway, how many other managers can do this?

Report an Error • The Zlatan Phenomenon. Even for those who weren’t previously familiar with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as an international player with Sweden and as a club star with some of Europe’s most famous teams — Juventus, Inter Milan, Paris St. Germain, Barcelona and Manchester United — it took one goal to get SoCal’s attention. 
Entering in the 71st minute against LAFC in his Galaxy debut March 31, his swerving, dipping 40-yard shot that sailed over the head of LAFC goalie Tyler Miller and into the net was the first of his two goals in a come-from-behind 4-3 Galaxy victory, and it sent a message. 
“They wanted Zlatan. I gave them Zlatan,” the irrepressible striker said after that first game. Translation: This was going to be totally different from anything we were used to.

A mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, on August 3 has reignited a discussion on violence associated with white nationalism and the far right. The suspected shooter, a white male, wrote a manifesto containing blatantly xenophobic language. The manifesto cited the ""invasion"" of immigrants as the reason for the shooting, which left 20 people dead. Correspondingly, reports in the past year have pointed to unsettling trends surrounding right-wing extremism and violence. Every extremist killing in the US in 2018 had a link to a right-wing extremism, according to a January 2019 report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. The report zeroes in on incidents such as the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in October 2018. There were at least 50 extremist-related killings in the US in 2018, according to the report, making it the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970. Read more: Right-wing violence has 'accelerated' in the US since Trump took office ""The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists,"" the report states. ""Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case."" Guns were involved in the vast majority of the killings – 42 of out 50. The Anti-Defamation League's findings are consistent with other recent research on right-wing extremism in the US, which shows it's on the rise. ""The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade, more than quadrupling between 2016 and 2017,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a November 2018 report. ""The recent pipe bombs and the October 27, 2018, synagogue attack in Pittsburgh are symptomatic of this trend."" Correspondingly, a November 2018 analysis from The Washington Post on global terrorism data showed that far-right violence has been on the rise since President Donald Trump entered the White House. ""Over the past decade, attackers motivated by right-wing political ideologies have committed dozens of shootings, bombings and other acts of violence, far more than any other category of domestic extremist,"" the report stated. The report said this has occurred alongside a ""decades-long drop-off in violence by left-wing groups,"" which were considered the top extremist threat in the US three to four decades ago. Meanwhile, three men and a male high school student were earlier this month charged with plotting to attack a Muslim community in upstate New York with explosives. In a separate incident, a Colorado man was arrested last Saturday after he posted on social media that he planned to kill ""as many girls as I see."" Police reportedly feared the man planned to target a Women's March event occurring nearby. Relatedly, FBI data released in early November 2018 showed hate crimes rose 17% in 2017. Read more: Anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by 37% in 2017, according to a new FBI report The Trump administration has faced criticism over its approach to extremism, as many feel it's exaggerated the threat posed by jihadists while largely ignoring the violence perpetrated by far-right groups. President Donald Trump sparked a significant amount of backlash over his response to deadly far-right violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Trump controversially blamed the violence on ""many sides."" Far-right leaders praised Trump's response to the events in Charlottesville, and have often spoken approvingly of him. On top of concerns regarding his rhetoric, critics feel Trump isn't taking the issue seriously enough given he cut funding to programs designed to counter violent extremism. An October 2018 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute showed a majority of Americans agree that Trump has ""encouraged white supremacist groups"" with his decisions and behavior.",2019-01-15 00:00:00,"All of the extremist killings in the US in 2018 had links to right-wing extremism, according to new report",murders and attempted murders,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

The three-term California congressman Eric Swalwell announced on Monday he is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He is the 18th Democrat to join one of the most crowded primary fields in modern US history. Esquire first reported Swalwell's announcement on Monday. He was set to go public with it on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" Monday night, alongside Cameron Kasky, a cofounder of the March For Our Lives, a gun-reform activist, and a survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. Swalwell has made a name for himself in Congress as a top Democrat on the high-profile House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is now leading the subcommittee overseeing the CIA. He also holds a spot on the prestigious House Judiciary Committee. Swalwell is best known for his work on the committee's investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, frequently appearing on cable news to discuss the latest twists and turns of those inquiries. But the California congressman has also been a vocal advocate for gun-law reform in the wake of several mass shootings in the US in recent years. He said his presidential campaign will focus on combatting the issue of gun violence in America, The Atlantic first reported earlier this month. ""I see a country in quicksand,"" Swalwell told Colbert of his decision to run. ""Unable to solve threats from abroad, and unable to make life better for people here at home...none of that is going to change unless we get a leader willing to go big on the issues we take on, be bold on the solutions we offer and do good in the way that we govern."" Read more: The Trump campaign is trying to force hostile pundits off the air in revenge for their Mueller report commentary After his presidential aspirations were reported by Politico in November, Swalwell has traveled around the country and visited Democratic groups in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina to test the presidential waters. At 38 years old, Swalwell is one of the youngest candidates in the 2020 Democratic field. After graduating from law school, he served as a deputy district attorney and was on the Dublin City Council of Dublin, California, before first running for the House in 2012. Swalwell represents California's affluent and racially diverse 15th Congressional District, which is east of San Francisco. He will face a potentially uphill battle to compete for votes and donations with fellow California Democrat Sen. Kamala Harris, who has racked up dozens of home-state endorsements and raised $12 million since announcing her candidacy in January. Read more: California moved up its presidential primary and it could be the biggest factor in 2020 and beyond But Swalwell is betting on his focus on gun violence, combined with his appeal as a young politician, to help him stand out from the rest of the field. “I do believe that the country, by sending about 27 new members of Congress who are in their 40s and under, that they embraced in this last midterm election new leadership, new ideas and much importantly, a new confidence,"" he told MSNBC in December. Along with his pledges to hold President Donald Trump accountable to the law, Swalwell has met with Parkland shooting survivors and uses his social media to highlight being a working parent who is still paying off his student debt while raising two young children. Swalwell has also made a priority of flying back to California every weekend to visit constituents and spend a day working at a small business in his district, using the hashtag #InYourShoes.",2019-01-15 00:00:00,California congressman Eric Swalwell is running for president in 2020 - Business Insider,,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

By MARC CAPUTO, MATT DIXON and ISABEL DOBRIN 01/14/2019 06:55 AM EST Updated 01/14/2019 07:17 AM EST Good Monday morning. The second week of Ron DeSantis’s governorship dawns. And, so far, he’s impressing one-time critics (i.e., Democrats and moderate Republicans) who were expecting Attila the Hun conservativism but have seen more centrism than expected. On his first full day in office, he appointed the first Hispanic woman to the state Supreme Court (Barbara Lagoa) and issued an anti-discrimination order. He then issued a sweeping package of environmental cleanup plans. And he ended the week Friday by approving an overdue pardon of the Groveland Four and then appointing Broward County’s first African-American sheriff. Oh, and on that last point, POLITICO Florida told you first. GUN FIGHT — “DeSantis suspends Israel and Florida braces for a fight over guns,” by POLITICO Florida's Marc Caputo: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for his agency’s response to the Parkland shooting, a move that could set up the Florida Senate for a partisan and racially tinged fight over guns. A defiant Israel immediately vowed to fight his suspension in the courts and the Florida Senate, which have the final say on his job. He faces long legal odds in both venues. Read more SCOTT SEPARATION — Building off our story last week about tensions between the current and former governor’s camps, it’s noteworthy that Scott didn’t suspend Sheriff Israel, while DeSantis made sure it was one of the first things he did. Asked why did Scott didn’t suspend Israel, DeSantis said, “You'll have to ask Gov. Scott.” Meow. Scott also refused to pardon the Groveland Four. DeSantis made sure to right the longstanding wrong as soon as he could. Not only does DeSantis want to rescind all of Scott’s 11th hour appointments (more than 70), he wants the entire South Florida Water Management District board appointed by Scott to resign. And then there’s marijuana. NO SMOKE IS A JOKE — The godfather of Florida’s medical marijuana state constitutional amendment, Democrat John Morgan, telegraphed that he may be working with the DeSantis administration as it decides whether to greenlight smokable medical marijuana. Scott signed and fought for a law banning smokable marijuana, even though it’s pretty clear that voters thought it would be legal. The state has predictably lost in court, and DeSantis has been overheard asking, “Why are we doing this?” On Friday, DeSantis confidante/transition chair and Congressman Matt Gaetz tweeted to Morgan that he’s “Looking forward to seeing you next week.” Morgan replied: “Air Morgan is fueled and ready to fly. #PotDaddy is looking forward to seeing his favorite Republican, other than my wife!! Let the people speak and be heard.” SHAH, RUBIN TO BALLARD — Former White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah and Jamie Rubin, former spokesman to Clinton-era Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, are leading up Ballard Partners’ new venture, Ballard Media Group, “a bipartisan, full service, multi-disciplinary strategic communications division that brings together the talents of professionals with unrivaled real-world expertise,” according to a press release. Ballard Partners is one of D.C.’s fastest-growing lobbying firms and is a top Tallahassee lobbying firm. Press release here RUNCIE REPRIEVE? — On Friday, we noted that, compared to an elected sheriff, “there are more questions about the governor’s constitutional authority” to suspend Broward County Superintendent of Schools Robert Runcie because he’s appointed and not elected. DeSantis said his legal team is reviewing it. He wants to suspend Runcie. But Florida Playbook reader Bruce Glasserman informed us that a 1974 state Supreme Court advisory opinion to then-Gov. Reubin Askew held that the governor’s constitutional suspension authority extends to elected, not appointed superintendents like Runcie (it’s mentioned in this 1993 advisory opinion). BUT HANG ON, Glasserman wisely notes: that DeSantis is “poised to finish changing the Court from a 4-3 liberal majority into a 6-1 conservative majority in the coming days, he could choose to proceed w/ suspending Superintendent Runcie anyway, perhaps confident that the Court (now ideologically reconfigured) could overturn its previous decision’s precedent & instead uphold a Runcie suspension. This is all pure speculation, of course.” — “DeSantis suspends Israel and Florida braces for a fight over guns,” by POLITICO Florida’s Marc Caputo: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for his agency’s response to the Parkland shooting, a move that could set up the Florida Senate for a partisan and racially tinged fight over guns. A defiant Israel immediately vowed to fight his suspension in the courts and the Florida Senate, which have the final say on his job. He faces long legal odds in both venues. Read more FLYING HIGH — “Dems fly to Puerto Rico on chartered jet, meet with lobbyists, see ‘Hamilton’ as shutdown drags on,” by Fox News’ Louis Casiano: “Despite a partial government shutdown with no end in sight, about 30 Democratic members of Congress traveled to Puerto Rico this weekend -- with their families and lobbyists -- for a winter retreat where they also planned to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show ‘Hamilton.’ Those attending the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC gathering in San Juan also planned to meet Saturday with Puerto Rican officials to discuss ongoing cleanup efforts from Hurricane Maria, according to a report.” Read more GOOD WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT — “As Feds Expand Miami Child-Migrant Compound, Contractor Gets Another $60 Million,” by New Times’ Jerry Iannelli: “In late December, the feds told the Associated Press that the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children, a migrant camp holding 1,300 immigrant children outside of Miami, would add 1,000 extra beds sometime in 2019. While immigrant-rights groups maintain the facility is a humanitarian nightmare — one family that spoke to New Times said their loved one there was trapped in a ‘child prison’ — the news is great for private contractors.” Read more GRIFTIN’ — “He raised $20 million with his viral border wall campaign. GoFundMe is sending it back,” by Bradenton Herald’s Howard Cohen: “The fund-raising website said Friday that it would refund the $20.3 million raised by 340,000 people to partially fund President Donald Trump’s $5.6 billion border wall. Brian Kolfage, 37, who lives with his family in the Miramar Beach resort community of Sandestin, in the Panhandle’s Walton County, created the We the People Will Build the Wall GoFundMe page with the aim to raise $1 billion in mid-December.” Read more DACA TALES — “Despite DACA’s unknowns, two Dreamers bring Southie Coffee to Clearwater,” by Tampa Bay Times’ Tracey McManus: “President Donald Trump in 2017 ordered an end to the Obama-era program shielding from deportation 700,000 immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and grew into adults without citizenship. But as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, hangs in limbo amid legal challenges, Bella Rincon and Steven Gonzalez, both 28 and protected under the program, would not let go of their American dream.” Read more — “Rick Scott: On the shutdown, the wall, stock buybacks and offshore drilling,” by Tampa Bay Times’ Steve Contorno: Read more — “Green New Deal called national security threat, ‘destructive,’” by Hispolitica’s Javier Manjarres: Read more — “Scott willing to sponsor DACA bill in senate,” by The Floridian's Daniel Molina: Read more — “Political Insider: Shutdown blues hit Sarasota and Manatee,” by Herald-Tribune’s Zac Anderson: Read more — “Naples mayor supports Florida senator’s proposal to ban smoking on beaches,” by Naples Daily News’ Lisa Conley and Wayne T. Price: Read more — “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meet Matt Gaetz: the beginning of a beautiful bipartisan friendship?” by Washington Examiner’s Phil Wegmann: Read more — “‘I Felt Dirty’: Former Employees Of The Veteran Crowdfunding Trump’s Wall Say He Pushed Fake News To Get Rich,” by BuzzFeed News’ Brianna Sacks: Read more PURPLE NO MORE — “Stung by midterm loses, Democrats see a swing state drifting away,” by New York Times’ Patricia Mazzei and Jonathan Martin: “After a painful midterm election for Florida Democrats that showed this crucial swing state drifting away from them, a group of party activists gathered at a Cuban restaurant last month to receive some bitter medicine — and a sober warning — to go with their croquettes and plantain chips. Democrats started organizing Latino voters too late, didn’t tailor their message for an increasingly diverse community and ultimately took Latino support for granted, a Florida pollster told about 50 members of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Broward County.” Read more QUIET PLAYER — “Behind the scenes, Bainter pulls strings,” by Gainesville Sun’s Andrew Kaplan: Tucked away in an industrial park outside northwest Gainesville is a business run by one of Florida’s most influential operatives in GOP politics. Despite his growing list of high-profile clients, being named in a gerrymandering scandal in 2012 and having ties to dozens of political committees that shift tens of millions of dollars every election cycle, few know the man who has helped elect dozens of lawmakers. Read more FRESH EYES — “Gruters takes the reins as Florida Republicans prepare for 2020,” by POLITICO Florida’s Matt Dixon: Florida’s Republican leaders gathered to elect state Sen. Joe Gruters the party’s new chairman, setting the stage for the 2020 presidential election. “Republicans, are we ready to deliver Florida for Donald Trump in 2020?,” Guters said in his acceptance speech on Saturday. “Are we ready to paint Florida red in 2020?” Read more NOT EASY — “These school districts tried to arm coaches. It’s harder than it sounds,” by Tampa Bay Times’ Katherine Campione, Vincent McDonald and Christina Morales: “After the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, Brevard County Schools Assistant Superintendent Matt Reed faced a challenge unlike any in his career. His team had to find, hire and train more than two dozen new employees to carry firearms on school campuses and protect students in the event of a school shooter. They had less than six months.” Read more BAD GUY WITH A GUN? — “Utah gun rights activist faces felony firearms, drug charges,” by Deseret News Ashley Imlay and Pat Reavy: “The co-owner of Utah Gun Exchange who went on the road last year in a military-style armored vehicle to counter ‘March for Our Lives’ rallies and town halls along the Florida coast now faces felony drug and firearms charges. Bryan Melchior, 46, of Sandy, was charged Thursday in 3rd District Court with drug distribution plus five counts of purchase, transfer, possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person, all third-degree felonies.” Read more SFWMD — “Brian Mast blasts board members who won't resign as Gov. Ron DeSantis asked,” by Ali Schmitz: “Four South Florida Water Management District board members have said they will not resign after Gov. Ron DeSantis asked all eight of them to step down Thursday.

Republicans hope to have a bill drafted in the coming weeks that would legalize sports betting. At the same time, they’re trying to determine how much support their measure will need to pass muster at the ballot box, Senate President Bill Galvano said. While voters must sign off on the plan before it can become law, their new power over gaming, known as Amendment 3, has never been used, and policymakers are not clear whether a simple majority or a supermajority of the electorate’s support is required to approve any expansion of gambling. “We don’t know if it means 60 percent of the vote or 50 percent plus one,” Galvano told POLITICO Florida.

More than 40 percent of tourists head to Florida for its beaches, and beach tourism brings in more than $55 billion in annual sales annually. So it's hard to overstate the importance of the sandy shores. But according to a new report, Florida isn't doing nearly enough to protect its most important resource from erosion and climate change.

                                        | Topic: Security Wi-Fi signals from ordinary Wi-Fi equipment can be used to detect suspicious objects, such as bombs or weapons, inside people's bags or luggage, at schools, stadiums, museums, malls, or other public spaces. Researchers from Rutgers University say they've developed and tested such a system, achieving above 90 percent detection rates for suspicious objects hidden inside various types of containers. Also: Why the 'fixed' Windows EternalBlue exploit won't die Their system works by using a radio signal called CSI (Channel State Information). CSI signals are part of the Wi-Fi protocol and are used to record general information about the status of the Wi-Fi signal. The Rutgers team say they discovered that by reading the CSI data from Wi-Fi signals that have bounced off or went through objects in a room or open space, they can determine the nature and size of that respective object. They say this data is accurate enough to be used for a scanner-like system that looks for potentially dangerous objects, such as various types of liquids containers, often found inside portable bombs, or weapons such as knives, guns, or grenades. ""Extensive experiments [were] conducted with 15 metal and liquid objects and 6 types of bags in a 6-month period,"" Rutgers researchers said. The research team recorded detection accuracy rates of 99 percent for dangerous objects, 98 percent for metal objects and 95 percent for liquid containers. ""For typical backpacks, the accuracy rate exceeds 95 percent and drops to about 90 percent when objects inside bags are wrapped,"" researchers said. There are advantages and disadvantages to this method. The main advantage is accessibility. This detection system does not rely on using custom or highly expensive hardware. Ordinary, off-the-shelve Wi-Fi equipment is enough. Also: Top 5 ways to block spam calls TechRepublic A Wi-Fi device with two to three antennas is more than capable for the scanning procedures. The device can be integrated into existing Wi-Fi networks, and placed near access doors or entry gates to scan persons entering a building. If the Wi-Fi device detects certain patterns in CSI signals, it can alert a nearby laptop. The disadvantage is that this system does not produce visual representations of the suspicious objects it detects, such as the ones produces by X-ray and CT scanners found in airports. This means that at least one staff member must be present on location and follow through on the system's detections with a manual search of the flagged bag. But such a disadvantage is negligible, researchers feel. In an  	interview with CBS New York, the Rutgers team estimated the total cost of such a system to be below $100. This small cost should outweigh the need to have a staff member check suspicious bags when compared to the tens of thousands of dollars and the number of personnel needed to operate larger equipment such as X-ray scanning machines. ""In large public areas, it's hard to set up expensive screening infrastructure like what's in airports,"" said Yingying (Jennifer) Chen, one of the study's authors. ""Manpower is always needed to check bags and we wanted to develop a complementary method to try to reduce manpower,"" she added. Researchers hope that their systems could be used in public institutions and prevent many of the mass-shooting events that have been plaguing the US in recent years. The system is not foolproof, as no such system is, but it's bettern than nothing. More: SonarSnoop attack can steal smartphone unlock patterns More details about this novel technique are available in a research paper published in late August, entitled ""I 	n-baggage Suspicious Object Detection Using Commodity Wi-Fi."" Academics from Purdue and Binghamton University also contributed. The team research paper received the  	Best Paper Award in the IEEE International Communications and Network Security (CNS 2018) held back in May. This research continues  	previous work from the start of the 2010s when academics started experimenting with using Wi-Fi signals to detect a person's movement and position through walls, research that got more accurate as time went by.

262,https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/01/08/broward-sheriff-scott-israel-tells-staff-hes-being-suspended-over-parkland-response/,"It appears that Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel is preparing to pack it in, for now. The two-term sheriff, the object of fierce criticism over BSO's handling of the Parkland massacre, told his top commanders that he will be removed from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis, sources told the Miami Herald. DeSantis, who was sworn in Tuesday morning, had not made a formal announcement of a possible suspension. Israel's discussions with staff about his ouster were first reported by Miami New Times. Stuart N. Kaplan, one of Israel's lawyers, said Israel was working at his office at the public safety building in Fort Lauderdale. ""The governor has not said anything to us, directly or indirectly, as to whether or not the sheriff is going to be suspended,'' Kaplan said. ""He is working and continues to serve the citizens of Broward County.'' But Jeff Bell, BSO's union chief, said Israel told his staff on Monday that his ouster was inevitable. ""We know that he is telling everyone at the public safety building that he is going to be gone,'' said Bell, who was at DeSantis' swearing-in ceremony in Tallahassee on Tuesday. Several candidates have been mentioned as possible replacements, including former Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti, a Republican like DeSantis. But Bell would not indicate whether the union was backing anyone. ""What I will say is we want someone who will remove politics out of police work and commit to protecting the citizens and our children in the schools,'' Bell said.
There were unconfirmed reports that Israel's undersheriff, Steve Kinsey, had resigned. The sheriff's communications office did not respond to requests for comment. Israel, 62 — a 30-year law enforcement veteran — has vowed to fight any effort to strip him of his office. He maintains that while mistakes were made in responding to the rampage, they were not serious enough to warrant his suspension or removal from office. Israel has long defended his agency's actions on Feb. 14, 2018 when 17 people — 14 of them students — were slain by a gunman in what is considered the worst mass high school shooting in U.S. history. Gun rights advocates and conservatives applauded Israel's possible suspension on social media on Tuesday. Israel had been harshly criticized by the NRA and other groups after articulating his position in favor of gun regulations, making him somewhat of a political outlier in Florida, which pioneered ""stand-your-ground"" laws and other gun-friendly legislation. ""If true, it would be FANTASTIC news,'' said Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman, on Facebook. A state panel investigating the massacre released a 458-page report last week that detailed how the killer, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was able to shoot so many victims inside the freshman building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. The committee blamed security breakdowns and a lack of training on the part of Broward sheriff's deputies, some of whom took cover outside the building instead of rushing into the school to confront the shooter, as officers from neighboring Coral Springs did. The report listed a number of other failures by BSO and the Broward school district. Those other BSO problems included outdated, malfunctioning radios, which prevented rescuers from responding more quickly and possibly saving lives, the report said.
After randomly shooting inside the building — without entering a single classroom — Cruz was able to escape the school grounds by blending in with fleeing students. Cruz, who had a history of emotional problems and disciplinary issues documented by the school district, was apprehended by officers one hour and 16 minutes after the first shots were fired. He now faces 34 counts of premeditated murder and attempted murder and could receive the death penalty. Early on, Israel proclaimed his agency's handling of the tragedy a success, and was praised by President Donald Trump. ""Mr. President, these are the leaders,'' Israel said, pointing to members of his command staff. ""They led SWAT teams; they led staging areas; they led command posts. These are the leaders who led the first responders for police and fire, our deputies who were able do the amazing things we did in Broward County.'' But Israel's portrait of heroism was obliterated when it was learned that the school's assigned sheriff's deputy, Scot Peterson, took cover outside rather than run toward the building as the shots were being fired. Later, bodycam video showed another deputy, in leisurely fashion, sorting through his trunk for his bulletproof vest and then crouching behind his car for several minutes as shots were heard. In public statements, Israel described his leadership as exceptional, and claimed he was being used as a scapegoat, as other agencies — including the FBI — had been warned about Cruz's violent, erratic behavior. The FBI received two tips about Cruz in the six months before the attack, including one from someone who knew him well and believed he was capable of murdering teachers and students. The FBI never followed through by investigating.
When CNN's Jake Tapper asked Israel whether he would have done anything differently that may have changed the outcome, the sheriff recited a flip rhyme: ""if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, O.J. Simpson would still be in the record books.""
His comments prompted a public outcry that led the victims' families, politicians and the sheriff's union to question whether he was fit for his office. Florida's governor can suspend a sheriff — as well as other public officials — for a number of reasons, including criminal activity, neglect of duty and incompetence. But should that happen, Israel will request a trial before the Florida Senate to fight it, his lawyer said. Kaplan said Israel would respect the governor's decision and step down in the interim, even though he believes any suspension would be politically driven. DeSantis had said during his campaign that he would likely suspend Israel. ""I'm not sure his decision is being made on merit or on fact — or is he just now concerned about following through on a campaign promise that is politically motivated. Scott Israel has never wavered that the school district and school children and all members of the community are safe,"" Kaplan said. ""There is a false insinuation on the part of the public — a feeling that BSO is somehow a better agency just because Scott Israel has been removed.'' The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting a criminal investigation into the response to the rampage. The responsibility of what action to take ultimately falls not just on DeSantis, but on the Florida Senate, which would conduct a trial. The 15-member Marjory Stoneman Douglas public safety commission's report, approved unanimously last week, noted that long after the mass shooting, key people involved in the incident, including sheriff's deputies and high school assistant principals, provided investigators with accounts that contradicted the evidence, including surveillance video, leading the panel to believe they were either incompetent or untruthful. The commission found that a policy change by Israel, changing deputies ""shall"" confront active shooters to deputies ""may"" do so, may have contribute to BSO's much-criticized reponse. The panel also found that the agency's active shooter training was inadequate. But the commission did not offer an opinion on whether the sheriff — or the school superintendent, Robert Runcie — should be removed or resign. ""At the end of the day, the governor can suspend and has the power to suspend public officials for almost any reason — whether its malfeasance, incompetence or neglect of duty — all that is in the eye of the beholder,'' said Robert Jarvis, professor of law at Nova Southeastern University, and author of ""Out of the Muck: A History of the Broward Sheriff's Office.'' ""Presumably, the Senate would go along with DeSantis because the Senate is Republican and would not want to embarrass a very new governor from their own political party.'' State Sen. Gary Farmer, a Democrat from Broward, questioned the propriety of suspending the sheriff under the current circumstances.
""I think there are some criticisms of Sheriff Israel's department that are fair, but I don't know that it rises to the level of removal from office by the governor. I think that should be a decision that the voters of Broward County should be able to make,"" he said.
Farmer added that he has asked his legislative staff to research whether DeSantis has legal justification to remove someone on the grounds that ""you just don't think he did a good enough job."" Jarvis said governors have suspended sheriffs twice in Broward's history: in 1922 and 1942.
But it's difficult to make the suspension stick. In 1942, sheriff Walter R. Clark was suspended by then Gov. Spessard Holland for failing to take action against illegal gambling operators. Clark, however, was reinstated by the Senate. And the lawman suspended in 1922, Aden W. Turner — Broward's first sheriff — was removed only to be returned to office by voters six years later. ""Obviously, there were things that were done wrong here,'' Jarvis said. ""But shouldn't it be the voters of Broward County to decide whether or not they want Israel in power? That's always the problem when the governor suspends and the Senate then takes power away from local voters.'' — Julie K.

Jazmine Barnes, sweet 7 year old that should be alive playing with her friends on the playground. May you Rest In Peace. My prayers are with your family and loved ones. Social media lit up with outrage and heartbreak after authorities announced a surprising arrest in the shooting death of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes. The young girl was shot to death Dec. 30 just outside Houston, a brutal killing that sparked immediate outrage in southeast Texas and around the country. Most of that outrage centered around an initial suspect description touted by Harris County Sheriff's Office detectives, who described the suspect as a white male in a red truck. QUESTION ANSWERED: Why the sketch of Jazmine's alleged killer didn't match up Several activists got involved with bringing awareness to Jazmine's death as well as help with detectives' investigation, including social activist Shaun King. Local activist Deric Muhammed, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Houston) and others claimed the shooting might have been racially motivated. But it was a tip that King delivered to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez that ultimately led to Eric Black Jr., 20, being charged with capital murder in Jazmine's death. Black, who is black, reportedly told police that he and a second black male suspect, identified in court as Larry Woodruffe, mistook Barnes' vehicle for another. Woodruffe has not been formally charged in the child's death, but court records indicate he was arrested on a drug possession charge Sunday. Some critical of law enforcement's initial suspect description include former sheriff and far-right activist, David Clarke, Jr. ""(Law enforcement) blamed this on a white guy? Seriously?"" Clark tweeted. ""I could have told you it wasn't a white guy who did this. Now that it's BLACK ON BLACK crime let's see if community outrage will maintain its intensity now that their (sic) is no racial component. Cultural dysfunction."" Left-leaning activist and Bishop Talbert Swan also chimed in. ""A lot of sick bastards out here are doing victory dances because #JazmineBarnes' killer was not white,"" Swan tweeted.

Some states will be considering anew whether to expand government-funded health coverage to more people after Democrats put a sizable dent in Republican statehouse dominance during the November elections. Others will be wrestling with how to boost salaries for teachers and funding for their public schools. State officials also will have to address some weighty issues that arose over the past year — how to recover from disastrous wildfires and floods, whether to legalize sports gambling and recreational marijuana for adults, and whether to make changes to their tax codes in response to recent federal laws and court rulings. Many of the issues have a common denominator: money. ""The number one issue is always taxes or revenues and expenditures,"" said Bill Pound, the longtime executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Given the nature of the economy, given the impact as it's playing out of federal tax reform, that will take a good deal of attention."" The tax overhaul signed one year ago by President Donald Trump will have a trickle-down effect on state income tax returns being filed this year, resulting in a windfall for some states. Lawmakers will have to decide what to do with the money and whether to make changes to their own income tax codes. Sales tax changes also could be on the agenda in as many as 16 states that haven't yet implemented them after a U.S. Supreme Court decision last summer. That ruling allows states to require online out-of-state retailers to collect taxes on sales made to their residents, a potential source of millions of additional dollars. When the 2019 legislative sessions begin, Republicans will control 61 of the 99 state legislative chambers (down from 66 before the November election) and will control both chambers in 30 states. Democrats will have full control of 18 state legislatures. Minnesota will have the only legislature with split partisan control. Nebraska has a single chamber, which is officially nonpartisan. Democratic gains mean there will be closer margins between Republicans and Democrats in most legislative chambers. Democrats also picked up about a half-dozen governor's offices in the November elections. Republicans will have 27 governors while Democrats will have 23. ——— The Democratic surge has helped breathe new life into efforts to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income adults under the terms of the federal health care law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. But a federal judge's ruling in December that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional could bolster resistance among some state lawmakers while the case is appealed. New Democratic governors in Kansas and Wisconsin will be joining incumbent Democratic chief executives in North Carolina and Montana in pushing for expanded Medicaid programs. But they still must contend with Republican-led Legislatures. North Carolina has a 2013 law preventing the governor from expanding Medicaid without approval from the General Assembly. Before Wisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers could take office, Republican lawmakers passed measures preventing him from withdrawing Wisconsin from the multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act or from withdrawing a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. Kansas Gov.-elect Laura Kelly told The Associated Press that expanding Medicaid is ""a moral obligation that we have as a state.""  Her election seemed to boost the chances of that happening, since a bipartisan coalition had passed a bill in 2017 that was vetoed by then-Republican Gov. Sam Brownback. But conservative Republicans gained seats in the Kansas House at moderates' expense, and GOP leaders could bottle up Medicaid expansion bills in legislative committees. In Montana, the question is whether to continue a 2015 Medicaid expansion that provided health coverage to 95,000 adults but is scheduled to expire mid-year. Gov. Steve Bullock's budget proposal would reauthorize Medicaid expansion and raise an additional $50 million annually through tax increases on such things as tobacco, liquor, hotel rooms and rental cars. Republicans who control the Legislature have suggested the Medicaid expansion should be means-tested, include a work requirement and possibly drug testing. If the governor's budget ""comes down to 'we need to have those taxes to pay for Medicaid expansion,' then the answer is 'it's not gonna happen,' "" said Montana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas, a Republican. ——— Public schools could be a top issue in at least a third of the states, including Arizona and Oklahoma — two places where teachers went on strike over funding for schools. Arizona lawmakers, who gave teachers a 9 percent raise last year, are on the hook for a pledge of an additional 10 percent raise over the next two years. In Oklahoma, Republican Gov.-elect Kevin Stitt and lawmakers from both parties all have said additional school funding is a priority this year, even after teachers got an average annual pay hike of $6,100 this past year. ""We have a bunch of members who were elected on two major things: on being supportive of education and reforming state government, so those are the things I think you'll be seeing,"" said Oklahoma House Floor Leader Jon Echols, a Republican. Elsewhere, Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is pushing the first statewide pay raise in a decade for teachers and other school personnel. Governors and lawmakers in Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico are among others considering a funding boost for schools. In Oregon, Democratic Senate President Peter Courtney said a value-added or a gross receipts tax are two possibilities to raise revenue for education. Oregon lawmakers also could consider a tax on carbon emissions as part of an environmental agenda. Washington voters in November rejected an initiative to impose the nation's first tax on carbon emissions. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee is making a retooled bid at addressing climate change with a proposal that would require utilities to produce carbon-free electricity by 2045, forcing the elimination of power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. He also wants to reduce carbon emissions in fuel used for transportation. ""The people decided not to embrace plan A,"" Inslee said recently. But ""this plan B is ready to go, and it can pass this year"" in a Legislature that has expanded Democratic majorities. Illinois Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker and fellow Democrats in charge of the Legislature are considering legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana to bring in as much as $1 billion annually to the state. Pritzker has promised marijuana tax revenue to both the operating budget and capital programs. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also is pushing lawmakers to act quickly to legalize recreational marijuana for adults, a move he had opposed just a year ago. Cuomo hasn't said how much the state stands to gain in tax revenue. Some states also are looking to raise more money by legalizing and taxing sports betting. That comes after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way last year for the widespread expansion of sports gambling in states. ——— In some states, the 2019 legislative session marks the first opportunity to address the aftermath of deadly disasters. Nevada's Democratic-controlled state government is expected to pass a ban on bump stocks on guns and tackle other firearm legislation as the Legislature meets for the first time since the October 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip. The Trump administration earlier this month banned bump stocks, a regulation that will take effect in the new year but is likely to face a legal challenge from gun rights groups. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Republican-controlled Legislature will be wrestling with whether to tap as much as $5 billion from the state's rainy-day fund to pay for the recovery from Hurricane Harvey, which swamped the southeast portion of the state in August 2017. In California, state and federal authorities have estimated it will cost at least $3 billion to clear debris from 19,000 homes and businesses destroyed by three California wildfires last fall. Fresh off its deadliest wildfire in history, the California Legislature also will have to decide how much responsibility utilities should bear and how to prevent future fires from becoming so deadly as the state grapples with the effects of climate change. One option could entail limitations on new construction. ""We need to think about things like zoning ... where we build and how we build,"" said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Democrat. ——— Associated Press writers Amy Hanson in Helena, Montana; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Will Weissert in Austin, Texas; Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City; Kathleen Ronayne and Don Thompson in Sacramento, California; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Michelle Price in Las Vegas; Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon; Bob Christie in Phoenix; David Klepper in Albany, New York; John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois; Jim Anderson in Denver; and Morgan Lee in Sante Fe, New Mexico, contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2018-12-31 14:56:27," Paying for Medicaid, schools will be priority for lawmakers","education and schools,politics and government,law and legislation,finances,budgets and budgeting,medicine and health,taxation",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Deadliest mass shootings of 2018 in the U.S. A California man has been arrested and charged in Florida with threatening to kidnap and intimidate relatives and friends of students who were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February. Brandon Fleury of Santa Ana, California allegedly sent threatening messages using multiple Instagram accounts in what he told investigators was an attempt to “troll” victims and gain popularity, according to a criminal complaint filed in Florida. Fleury allegedly admitted to investigators that he targeted family members who were activists and who had a large social media presence, according to the complaint. Under the username “nikolas.killed.your.sister,” an apparent reference to Parkland shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz, Fleury sent messages in December to victims that said, “I killed your loved ones hahaha” and “With the power of my AR-15, I erased their existence.” He then added smiling, applause and handgun emojis. On Christmas, Fleury allegedly sent a message to a victim stating, “I’m your abductor [smile and applauding emojis] I’m kidnapping you fool.” He continued sending his menacing messages on New Year's Eve and into January, according to the complaint. Authorities traced the messages to a California address and that's where the FBI found Fleury. He told investigators his messages were not threats but “more like taunts,” according to the complaint and he admitted to using his tablet computer to write the messages, court records said. The complaint also indicated he told the FBI that he had a fascination with mass shooters. Fleury was scheduled to make an appearance on Jan. 28 before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-01-22 19:36:17," Man charged after family, friends of Parkland victims threatened on Instagram","education and schools,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
266,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-public-hear-michael-cohen/story?id=60572539,"Cohen is due in federal prison on March 6. Cohen postpones House testimony amid 'threats' The TAKE with John Verhovek With the news that Michael Cohen has postponed his highly anticipated public testimony before the House Judiciary Committee due to what his lawyer described as ""ongoing threats against his family"" from President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, we now seem to have entered yet another bizarre chapter that's ensnared the White House for months. Trump claims that Cohen is ""threatened by the truth."" But whatever the truth behind the nature of the alleged threats Cohen described, it would ultimately be an unfortunate development that the public may not get to hear from the man who seems to be at the center of so many unanswered questions. In December, a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, to three years in prison for various crimes including campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. Cohen is due in federal prison March 6. Questions remain as to whether the public will ever be able to hear and judge for themselves Cohen's answers to key questions only the House Judiciary Committee is in a position to ask. The RUNDOWN with Adam Kelsey Typically, the first news of a mass shooting leads to an immediate response from Washington -- expressions of condolences, an offer of thoughts and prayers, calls for gun control or calls for more good guys with guns. But on Wednesday, it was unusually quiet. Five people were killed in a shooting at a bank in Sebring, Florida, but, whether because of the government shutdown, the related wrangling over the State of the Union or something else entirely, America's leaders didn't seem to notice. It could be, in part, that such acts of violence have become all too common, but the indifference may also be reflective of the political navel-gazing that's allowed some 800,000 federal employees to work a month without pay, with many unable to pay bills and put food on the table. A number of potential Democratic presidential candidates -- former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, in particular -- are pledging to make gun control a centerpiece of their campaigns, but at a point in time in which five lives can be lost in an instant without registering so much as a blip on the political radar, it could require quite a bit of wrangling to remind the country's leaders that it's a debate worth pursuing. The TIP with Ben Siegel Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a veteran and high-profile Democratic lawmaker, is temporarily taking herself out of consideration to be chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, following an ex-staffer's claim she was fired in retaliation for making a rape allegation against a former supervisor at a previous job. According to recent court documents published by the New York Times, the ex-Jackson Lee staffer, identified only as Jane Doe, claims she was raped in 2015 by her then-supervisor at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising arm of the caucus.  She’s suing the CBCF and Jackson Lee’s office, alleging economic and emotional injury. She claims she reported the incident to police and informed CBCF and others at the time but did not pursue a lawsuit. Jackson Lee became CBCF chairwoman in 2017. The former staffer claims that in 2018, when she was then working for Jackson Lee, she informed the congresswoman’s chief of staff she was going to pursue the rape allegation legally, but was fired three weeks later without being allowed to speak to Jackson Lee as requested. Her lawsuit claims Lee’s office unlawfully retaliated against her after she told Jackson Lee’s chief of staff that she was going to sue the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, an alleged violation of the Congressional Accountability Act, meant to protect congressional employees who claim retaliation.  She also alleges a violation of the District of Columbia’s Human Rights Act. When asked by ABC News whether she had retaliated, Jackson Lee declined to comment but pointed to a statement her office posted on Facebook. “The Office adamantly denies the allegations that it retaliated against, or otherwise improperly treated, the plaintiff,“ the statement reads. Jackson Lee resigned Wednesday as CBCF chairwoman. ""The congresswoman values the Foundation’s ideals and does not want to be a distraction during the legal proceedings of the suit filed against the CBCF,"" interim president and CEO Elsie Scott said in a statement. ""I fully support her decision to voluntarily and temporarily step back from the Crime Subcommittee Chair position to ensure the Subcommittee's important work continues,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the House Judiciary Committee chairman said in a statement. ""This decision does not suggest any culpability by Representative Jackson Lee."" Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., will serve as the interim chair until the matter is resolved and Jackson Lee can resume her role, Nadler's statement said. THE PLAYLIST ABC News' ""Start Here"" Podcast.

267,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/maren-morris-starts-2nd-album-uplifting-girl-single-60442764,"Maren Morris is starting her much-anticipated second album with a message-driven single called ""GIRL"" NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Maren Morris knew the importance of selecting the first single she released from her much-anticipated second record, but as soon as she heard the demo of ""GIRL,"" she knew this was the song she wanted to lead off the album. ""It felt like such a timely song for now,"" said the 28-year-old Morris of the song she's releasing Thursday that touches on overcoming self-doubt and the pressure of comparison in a world of impossible standards. Morris wrote the song with Grammy-winning producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Sia, Kelly Clarkson) and Sarah Aarons, who co-wrote the Top 5 hit ""The Middle"" featuring Morris, Zedd and Grey. ""The Middle"" is nominated for record of the year and song of the year, which goes to songwriters, at this year's Grammy Awards on Feb. 10, and Morris was also nominated for best pop duo/group collaboration. Morris said inspiration for the song came from a letter she was trying to write to a female friend after they were struggling to keep their friendship on track. ""The day that we wrote 'GIRL,' I was starting to write this letter to her,"" Morris said. ""Why are we competing against one another? Is it ourselves? Is it this industry? Is it the world?"" After an hour of trying to compose her thoughts, she realized something. ""I don't think I am writing this to her,"" Morris said. ""I am writing this to myself."" The song is also the title of her new headlining world tour kicking off March 9 in Chicago with an all-female lineup including openers Cassadee Pope and RaeLynn. After a run through the United States, the tour will hit cities in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. ""Essentially it's an excuse for me to hang out with them all the time,"" Morris said. The new song comes almost three years since she released her breakthrough single and Grammy-winning song ""My Church,"" from her 2016 debut album, ""Hero,"" and caps a huge year for the Texas-born singer-songwriter. Last year, she married fellow singer Ryan Hurd, toured the globe opening for Niall Horan and spent 33 weeks on the top of Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic songs chart with ""The Middle."" ""To be in major categories is a huge win,"" Morris said of the recognition for ""The Middle."" ''I think it broke so many genre barriers and put my name and voice out to an audience that hadn't heard it yet."" She's also nominated for best country duo performance and best country song for ""Dear Hate,"" a duet with Vince Gill released after the Las Vegas mass shooting, and a best country solo performance nomination for ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,"" a cover from an Elton John tribute album. ""All the songs that I am nominated for were major career risks,"" Morris said. ""Not like career-ending risks, but scary decisions because it's out of people's comfort zone for a country artist to collaborate with an EDM DJ."" —— Online: https://www.marenmorris.com/ —— Follow Kristin M.

News headlines today: Jan. 21, 2019 Police arrested a Colorado man over the weekend who allegedly threatened to kill ""as many girls as I see"" in a mass shooting. Christopher Cleary, 27, allegedly told police that he planned targeting women in a public shooting because he's a virgin who has been rejected too many times, according to the Provo Police Department. All I wanted was to be loved, yet no one cares about me. Police located Cleary in Provo, Utah, on Saturday and questioned him in connection with various threats made online, including one in which he allegedly said he was ""planning on shooting up a public place soon,"" according to a probable cause statement. ""All I wanted was to be loved, yet no one cares about me,"" he wrote in a Facebook post, according to police. ""I'm 27 years old and I've never had a girlfriend before and I'm still a virgin, this is why I'm planning on shooting up a public place soon and being the next mass shooter."" ""I'm ready to die and all the girls the turned me down is going to make it right by killing as many girls as I see,"" he added, according to police. Police said the investigation concerned several agencies in Colorado.

""The Probation Office contacted me and let me know that this is a pattern of behavior with Cleary."" Cleary, who was on probation for stalking and threatening a woman, was arrested for violating probation and making threats of terrorism, according to police. He allegedly admitted to making the threats while in custody, telling officers he was upset and not thinking clearly when he did so, police said in the statement.

269,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/political-shifts-sales-slump-cast-shadow-gun-industry-60533786,"When the gun industry gathers for its annual show, it will be facing a changed political landscape Mass shooting in California reignites gun control debate When gunmakers and dealers gather this week in Las Vegas for the industry's largest annual conference, they will be grappling with slumping sales and a shift in politics that many didn't envision two years ago when gun-friendly Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress took office. Some of the top priorities for the industry — expanding the reach of concealed carry permits and easing restrictions on so-called ""silencers"" — remain in limbo, and prospects for expanding gun rights are nil for the foreseeable future. Instead, fueled by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the federal government banned bump stocks and newly in-charge U.S. House Democrats introduced legislation that would require background checks for virtually every firearm sale, regardless of whether it's from a gun dealer or a private sale. Even without Democrats' gains in November's midterm elections, the industry was facing a so-called ""Trump slump,"" a plummet in sales that happens amid gun rights-friendly administrations. Background checks were at an all-time high in 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in office, numbering more than 27.5 million; since then, background checks have been at about 25 million each year. Gary Ramey, owner of Georgian gunmaker Honor Defense, says the mood at last year's SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was subdued. He's expecting the same this year. ""There was no one to beat up. You didn't have President Obama to put up in PowerPoint and say 'He's the best gun salesman, look what he's doing to our country,'"" he said. ""Numbers are down,"" he added. ""You can't deny it."" Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun issues, said that not only have shifting politics made it difficult for the gun industry to gain ground but high-profile mass shootings — like the Las Vegas shooting that happened just miles from where the SHOT Show will be held and the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting — also cast a pall. ""After the Parkland shooting, (gun rights' initiatives) were kind of frozen in their tracks,"" Spitzer said. ""Now there's no chance that it's going anywhere."" It's easier to drive up gun sales when there's the threat or risk of gun-rights being restricted, he said. ""It's harder to rally people when your target is one house of Congress. It just doesn't have the same galvanizing effect."" The National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show has been held annually for more than four decades. This year more than 60,000 will attend the event that runs Tuesday through Friday — from gun dealers and manufacturers to companies that cater to law enforcement. There's a wait list for exhibitors that is several hundred names long and it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. Last year's show in Las Vegas was held just months after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor music festival. The massacre was carried out by a gunman armed with bump stocks, which allow the long guns to mimic fully automatic weapons. Organizers last year restricted media access to trade journalists. This year's show will again allow reporters from mainstream media to attend. Gun-control advocates are rejoicing in the gun industry's misfortunes of late and chalking it up to not just shifting attitudes among Americans but a shift in elected political leaders. ""Without a fake menace in the White House to gin up fears, gun sales have been in a Trump slump and, as a result, the NRA is on the rocks,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Joe Bartozzi, the new president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry isn't disturbed by the drop in gun sales or the shift in federal politics. While Democrats who ran on gun-control platforms made huge gains in the House, he sees the Senate shifting to the other end of the spectrum. ""Having been in the industry for over 30 years and seeing the trends of gun sales ebb and flow over time, it's very hard to put your finger on any one specific issue as to why this happens. It's just the cyclical nature of the business,"" he said. Trump's campaign was bolstered by about $30 million from the National Rifle Association and when he took office, the industry had hoped that a host of gun rights would be enacted. The Trump administration quickly nixed an Obama-imposed rule that made it more difficult for some disabled people to purchase and possess firearms. But other industry priorities, such as reciprocity between states for carrying certain concealed firearms and a measure that would ease restrictions on purchasing suppressors that help muffle the sound when a gun is fired, failed to gain traction. For now, Bartozzi said his organization is focused on a measure that would expand public gun ranges, funded by an existing tax on firearms and ammunition sales that supports conservation, safety programs and shooting ranges on public lands. The hope is that increasing the number of public ranges will encourage more people to become hunters. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-01-22 05:52:21," Political shifts, sales slump cast shadow over gun industry","politics and government,law and legislation,finances,gun control,firearms",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Sandy Hook shooting victims' families win legal victory against InfoWars, Alex Jones Six families of victims killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School won a legal victory Friday in their fight against controversial radio and internet personality Alex Jones. A judge in Connecticut has granted the families’ discovery requests, allowing them access to, among other things, Infowars’ internal marketing and financial documents. The judge has scheduled a hearing next week to decide whether to allow the plaintiffs’ attorneys to depose Jones. The plaintiffs include the parents of five children who went to the school as well as family members of first-grade teacher Victoria Leigh Soto and Principal Dawn Hochsprung, according to a statement from the plaintiff's attorneys. According to the statement, the plaintiffs allege a ""years-long campaign of abusive and outrageous false statements in which Jones and the other defendants have developed, amplified and perpetuated claims that the Sandy Hook massacre was staged and that the 26 families who lost loved ones that day are paid actors who faked their relative's deaths."" It goes on to say that ""Jones' actions subjected the families and survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting to physical confrontations and harassment, death threats and personal attacks on social media."" ""From the beginning, we have alleged that Alex Jones and his financial network trafficked in lies and hate in order to profit from the grief of Sandy Hook families. That is what we intend to prove, and today's ruling advances that effort,"" Chris Mattei, one of the attorneys representing the families, said in the statement. ""We look forward to gaining access to Infowars' internal marketing and financial documents to show that Jones has built an empire as nothing more than a conspiracy profiteer, as alleged in our complaint."" Jones has sought to dismiss the lawsuit. ""Plaintiffs suffered a horrible tragedy,"" his defense attorney, Jay M. Wolman, wrote in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. ""Alex Jones and Infowars are not responsible for this tragedy. To punish them for First Amendment protected speech on this matter of public concern will not bring back the lives lost."" Wolman did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment. The judge’s ruling on discovery gives the plaintiffs access to any communication Jones had about the Newtown massacre and to documents that could point to the inner workings of Infowars. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-01-11 14:51:26," Sandy Hook shooting victims' families win legal victory against InfoWars, Alex Jones","suits and litigation,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Authorities raced to the SunTrust Bank in Sebring, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon after 21-year-old Zephen Xaver allegedly killed the victims, then called 911, telling dispatchers, “I have shot five people.” The victims were found lying face-down on the floor of the bank's main lobby, according to court documents. Cynthia Watson, a customer, and Marisol Lopez, 55, a bank employee, were among those killed, police said Thursday, as was employee Ana Piñon-Williams, her family said. A mother of seven, Piñon-Williams, 38, had only been on the job a few weeks, her brother-in-law, Tim Williams, said Thursday. ""Her life was truly a light in this world,"" he said. Watson, 65, had been married to her husband, Tony Watson, for just 23 days, he said. Tony Watson described her as ""very hard working. She never stopped and she took care of everyone."" The families of some victims requested their names not be released, police said. Xaver ""knowingly and intentionally took the lives of five of our fellow community members...our sisters, our mothers, our daughters and our co-workers,"" Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund told reporters Thursday, at times overcome with emotion. A sixth person -- an employee -- was in a back break room when the incident began. Upon hearing shots, the employee ran out a back door and contacted police, the sheriff's office said. Highlands County Sheriff Paul Blackman said the mass shooting ""shocks and angers me more than anything I have encountered in my career."" Police said the motive is not known. Authorities do not believe anyone was targeted and said there's no known connection between the suspect and victims. The 21-year-old was armed with a 9mm handgun and wore a bulletproof vest, according to the probable cause statement. ""While we still don’t know what drove the suspect to commit this heinous act, there is no excuse that can justify the cold-blooded murder of multiple victims,"" Blackman said in a statement Wednesday. Dressed in a black and white jail jumpsuit, Xaver appeared before a judge Thursday morning and was formally charged with five counts of ""homicide murder premeditated."" Besides a “yes sir” when informed of the charges, the alleged shooter said nothing in court. The judge said Xaver had “no income, assets, or dependents.” He was denied bond. As authorities work to determine a motive, the suspect's background is coming to light. Xaver worked for two months as a correctional officer trainee but resigned in January, the Florida Department of Corrections said. He had no discipline issues and it was not clear why he resigned, a spokesperson said. The mass shooting, which has left residents of the small city in shock, comes weeks before Florida marks the first anniversary of the Parkland school shooting in which 17 students and staff were killed. The sheriff said, “I pray for the victims, their families and our community. This tragedy will have a lasting impact on Highlands County and likely this community will never be the same."" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it ""a terrible day for Sebring, Highlands County and for the state of Florida."" ""This is an individual that needs to face very swift and exacting justice,"" the governor said of the suspect. Hoglund said in a statement, ""We will continue to investigate and work to see that the victims and their families are taken care of and that they receive the justice they deserve.""

Paul Broadie II, president of Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, announced the firing of Charles Meyrick, saying a school investigation determined the assistant professor committed ""serious misconduct."" Officials said the Nov. 2 disruptions at Manchester Community College, where faculty and administrators of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system were meeting about school consolidation, were part of ""increasingly alarming behavior"" by Meyrick, including his being disruptive at prior meetings. ""Mr. Meyrick's actions took place just days after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and triggered several participants to exit the facility out of fear for their safety,"" said Mark Ojakian, president of the colleges and universities system. ""Our state colleges and universities aim to foster a welcoming learning environment, and these threatening actions go far beyond acceptable discourse."" Messages seeking comment were left for Meyrick on Thursday. According to the school investigation         report , Meyrick acknowledged he shouted ""sieg heil,"" a German phrase for ""hail victory"" noted for its use at Nazi rallies, and gave a Nazi salute from his seat in the crowd in the auditorium, as a way to show the meeting's leaders that their effort to silence his dissent was ""tyrannical and wrong."" Meyrick and a college system official got into an argument about consolidating curriculum, and the official asked Meyrick to leave because of his disruptive behavior, including his calling the official a liar, the report said. Meyrick saw the request to leave as officials trying to stop him from expressing his opinion, the report said. Police said they were called to the auditorium and after the meeting asked Meyrick to leave campus. Meyrick responded by asking, ""What if I don't?"" and a lieutenant told him he'd be arrested, police said. Two officers then escorted him from campus without incident. Investigators said Meyrick told them he characterized the salute and Nazi statement as ""miscalculations."" Asked why he kept his hand up so long, Meyrick said he began questioning his own behavior and needed time to contemplate how to get out of the situation. He put his hand down when the official he had argued with asked him if he had a question, the report said. Meyrick also told investigators he was willing to apologize and did not mean any harm. Meyrick began teaching at the community college in 2009 after working in finance for IBM for 34 years, according to his         biography on the school's website. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-01-24 11:39:18, College fires professor accused of giving Nazi salute,"education and schools,religion and churches,minorities (us),colleges and universities,jews",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
274,https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Time-to-force-issue-on-gun-background-13529518.php,"For a fleeting moment, it seemed as if the Dec. 14, 2012, slaughter of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School would have been the last straw for members of Congress beholden to the gun lobby. It should have been. But even that massacre in Newtown, Conn., failed to prompt action on the glaring loopholes in the nation’s gun laws. What would it take for Congress to act on something as sensible as requiring background checks on all gun sales? The June 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando — 49 killed — did not do it. The October 2017 rapid-fire attack on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas — 58 killed — did not do it. The November 2017 massacre at a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas — 25 killed — did not do it. A turning point appeared to finally arrive in the February 2018 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. — 17 killed — that aroused a determined, articulate group of young survivors who became crusaders for change. They were unafraid to take their cause to social media, cable news shows and in face-to-face confrontations with politicians such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who had been cowed by the gun lobby. Due in part to their efforts, gun control became an elevated issue in the November midterms, which gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Suddenly, groups such as the National Rifle Association were on the defensive. Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers reintroduced a measure that would extend federal background checks to all gun sales, including private transactions. The few exceptions would include transfers among family members or temporary sharing of a gun for hunting. Under the current porous law, about 1 in 5 gun transactions eludes a background check. “We will hold hearings, we will have a vote, and this legislation will finally pass the House,” Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, a co-sponsor, said in a statement. He has been a relentless advocate of the measure, but it had gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled House. The co-sponsors were joined at a Capitol event last week by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was severely wounded eight years ago when a gunman opened fire at a constituent event in Tucson. Six people died, and 15 were wounded in that attack. The bill, HR8, received a push from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, who said: “Gun violence is an epidemic that requires the energy and engagement of the entire nation.” It’s long past time for Washington to focus on a real crisis.

A mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, on August 3 has reignited a discussion on violence associated with white nationalism and the far right. The suspected shooter, a white male, wrote a manifesto containing blatantly xenophobic language. The manifesto cited the ""invasion"" of immigrants as the reason for the shooting, which left 20 people dead. Correspondingly, reports in the past year have pointed to unsettling trends surrounding right-wing extremism and violence. Every extremist killing in the US in 2018 had a link to a right-wing extremism, according to a January 2019 report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. The report zeroes in on incidents such as the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in October 2018. There were at least 50 extremist-related killings in the US in 2018, according to the report, making it the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970. Read more: Right-wing violence has 'accelerated' in the US since Trump took office ""The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists,"" the report states. ""Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case."" Guns were involved in the vast majority of the killings – 42 of out 50. The Anti-Defamation League's findings are consistent with other recent research on right-wing extremism in the US, which shows it's on the rise. ""The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade, more than quadrupling between 2016 and 2017,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a November 2018 report. ""The recent pipe bombs and the October 27, 2018, synagogue attack in Pittsburgh are symptomatic of this trend."" Correspondingly, a November 2018 analysis from The Washington Post on global terrorism data showed that far-right violence has been on the rise since President Donald Trump entered the White House. ""Over the past decade, attackers motivated by right-wing political ideologies have committed dozens of shootings, bombings and other acts of violence, far more than any other category of domestic extremist,"" the report stated. The report said this has occurred alongside a ""decades-long drop-off in violence by left-wing groups,"" which were considered the top extremist threat in the US three to four decades ago. Meanwhile, three men and a male high school student were earlier this month charged with plotting to attack a Muslim community in upstate New York with explosives. In a separate incident, a Colorado man was arrested last Saturday after he posted on social media that he planned to kill ""as many girls as I see."" Police reportedly feared the man planned to target a Women's March event occurring nearby. Relatedly, FBI data released in early November 2018 showed hate crimes rose 17% in 2017. Read more: Anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by 37% in 2017, according to a new FBI report The Trump administration has faced criticism over its approach to extremism, as many feel it's exaggerated the threat posed by jihadists while largely ignoring the violence perpetrated by far-right groups. President Donald Trump sparked a significant amount of backlash over his response to deadly far-right violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Trump controversially blamed the violence on ""many sides."" Far-right leaders praised Trump's response to the events in Charlottesville, and have often spoken approvingly of him. On top of concerns regarding his rhetoric, critics feel Trump isn't taking the issue seriously enough given he cut funding to programs designed to counter violent extremism. An October 2018 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute showed a majority of Americans agree that Trump has ""encouraged white supremacist groups"" with his decisions and behavior.",2019-01-15 00:00:00,All US extremist killings in 2018 had links to right-wing extremism: report - Business Insider,murders and attempted murders,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com
276,https://www.tampabay.com/fun/as-gun-outrage-grew-monster-jam-quietly-stripped-weapons-from-its-monster-trucks-20190109/,"When Monster Jam roars into Raymond James Stadium on Saturday, something will be missing from the enormous trucks — all images of guns. There are still trucks with menacing names like Grave Digger and Maximum Destruction. But Slinger, formerly Gunslinger, was quietly redesigned in 2017 to turn the gun images on the truck to slingshots. The gun turret from Soldier Fortune was removed that year. And the Metal Mulisha monster truck was redesigned to remove the image of a gun. Ellenton-based Feld Entertainment is the producer of Monster Jam, Disney on Ice, Sesame Street Live and a host of other live family-oriented shows. It saw its share of protestors and controversy when it operated the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. In an attempt to assuage animal rights protestors, Feld took elephants out of the circus in 2016. But attendance plunged, and the circus closed for good in 2017. Feld declined to make executives available for an interview this week. Stephen Yaros, Feld's senior vice president for global public relations, released a written statement. ""Monster Jam is a family-friendly brand with an international presence, and we are always innovating and evolving the intellectual property associated with our Monster Jam trucks,"" Yaros said. ""We represent over 50 different Monster Jam trucks and have a truck and design that is relatable to our wide range of fans and their interests."" It's a risk for companies like Feld to potentially alienate its fan base, said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. That's why they were smart to make the change quietly, he said. ""Clearly they wrestled with the experience of the elephants and the animal rights protests with the circus,"" Schweitzer said. ""Once the protest movement gets underway, it makes it difficult to make it go away."" By getting out ahead of it, they cut short accusations of glorifying guns, Schweitzer said. ""The risk is, they may suffer a backlash from some of their customers who don't like the idea that they've adopted a more politically correct stance, that some of their favorite characters have been defanged, or that it looks like censorship."" The difference, he said, was that elephants were a critical part of the circus performance, whereas gun images are merely a subtle change to a monster truck show. Feld's change to Monster Jam came a year after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando left 49 dead, and five years after 20 children and six staff members were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. After more recent shootings, victims and their advocates have had more success targeting businesses to change their ways or sever ties with gun groups. When a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela's removed the products from their websites. But it was the Parkland school shooting in 2018 in Broward County, industry experts have noted, that prompted major companies to suddenly shed ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta and United Airlines axed discounted rates for NRA members, as did some car rental brands. Two weeks after Parkland, Dick's Sporting Goods announced it would end all assault-style weapons sales and stop selling guns or ammunition to anyone younger than 21. Other retailers including Walmart followed suit. Dick's has since seen sales drop after it was a target of boycotts. Entertainment communities like country music and NASCAR have seen a growing demand for debate. Country stars started speaking out after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Big & Rich's John Rich, a staunch gun rights advocate, stepped in to urge fans to cease attacks on Americana singer Jason Isbell, who had challenged other country artists to join the End Gun Violence Together campaign. ""He's a good man and means well, he's trying to have dialogue and I applaud that,"" Rich tweeted. ""I'm open to dialogue anytime on the subject, as are many of my fellow artists."" The NRA has accused companies of ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice."" Supporters and detractors of the NRA have butted heads over the issue on social media, calling on companies to either stay put or step away, leaving little neutral ground. On some message boards Monster Jam fans weren't happy, though it didn't appear to be widely noticed. In a July 2017 YouTube rant, a Monster Jam fan posting as ClearSky Productions said, ""The biggest problem is they took Gunslinger and they censored it to Slinger. What kind of a stupid idea for a truck is that? Nobody fights each other with sling shots.""

278,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JamesFallows/~3/93rURDtAzgo/,"In the wake of a tragedy, a president must act as the leader of supporters and critics alike. Trump has proved incapable of this. There is one presidential duty that each incumbent must eventually bear, but whose timing no one can foresee. Sooner or later in each presidency, something sudden and terrible will occur—an attack, a natural calamity, something as inevitable as a mass shooting or as unusual as a space-program disaster. In response to these sorrows and emergencies, previous presidents have understood a specific, very important part of their job. At least for a moment, they must shift from head of government to head of state—leader of us all—and reflect the shared sentiments of supporters and critics alike. Read: Harvey exposes Trump’s empathy deficit In this role (and using examples from only the past few decades), a president can express a broad sense of national grief—as, for instance, Barack Obama did after the 2015 Mother Emanuel gun massacre in South Carolina, in which a 21-year-old white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners at worship. In this role a president can express a sense of national resolve, as Ronald Reagan did after the on-live-TV explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Or as Bill Clinton did after an antigovernment terrorist killed 168 people by bombing a federal office building in Oklahoma City in 1995. And in this role a president can reassert enduring national principles, as George W. Bush did in the best speech of his presidency, an address to a joint meeting of Congress nine days after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. These are the roles all past presidents have assumed and the responsibilities they have borne, as leaders of us, the whole American public. Donald Trump has not risen to this opportunity nor accepted this burden, even once, because he has proved himself incapable of thinking or acting beyond the interests of me. His callous, tweeted response to the deaths of nearly 50 people in the gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub when he was still campaigning for president—which began, “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism”—prefigured the way he would respond to tragedies when he took office. After thousands of people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Trump awarded his administration, via tweet, “A Pluses for our recent hurricane work” and blamed “a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan” for anything that had gone wrong. About Hurricane Harvey, in Houston, he seemed mainly to notice its “biggest ever!” size. After the deadliest gun massacre in American history, when one murderer in a hotel tower killed some 59 people and wounded hundreds in Las Vegas, Trump breezily said, “Look, we have a tragedy. [But] what happened is, in many ways, a miracle. The police department, they’ve done such an incredible job.” Read: “President Trump did disrespect my son” The list of instances when Trump said the wrong thing could go on. The more important point is that he’s never said the right thing. Conceivably, weather might have kept him from paying his respects at the World War I battlefield in France last month. Nothing but narcissism kept him from driving the few miles from the White House to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, in Arlington, for the presidential duty of laying a wreath on Veterans Day. Any normal president would have recognized the responsibility to show up that comes with his uniquely privileged and powerful job. Trump manifestly did not. Trump appears to have no moral, emotional, or intellectual ambit that extends more broadly than his own person, or some of his business interests, or perhaps some of his children. It’s not really fair to criticize him for something he cannot do. It would be like criticizing a person born without a larynx for not joining in song. This is how he is made, and how he is limited. But this particular silence is deafening.",2019-01-14 15:25:35,Trump Refuses to Soothe a Wounded Nation,"politics and government,united states politics and government,editorials,terrorism",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
279,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/covington-pile-on-symbolism/580918/?utm_source=feed,"It’s ridiculous to claim that the Covington Catholic schoolboys are a symbol of what ails America. About the author: Conor Friedersdorf is a California-based staff writer at The Atlantic, where he focuses on politics and national affairs. He is the founding editor of The Best of Journalism, a newsletter devoted to exceptional nonfiction. Boys from a Catholic high school in Kentucky are hanging out near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., doing pep-rally cheers to drown out slurs and homophobic taunts from the Black Hebrew Israelites, when an American Indian man unexpectedly arrives on the scene, beating a drum as he interposes himself between the groups. It’s the sort of conflict that … virtually never happens. Yet after watching a viral video of that singular event, many observers felt that it was … a symbol of all that’s wrong with America. “The clip focused on one red-hatted boy staring directly at the man with the drum,” Katie Herzog wrote in The Stranger. “His stupid, smirking face seemed to symbolize everything wrong with America right now.” Like many, she reconsidered her initial reaction when additional video of the encounter offered context that cast the boys in a better light. Newspapers published follow-up stories. Pundits issued mea culpas. They were right to do so; and commentators who stood by their original condemnations even as new facts emerged were wrong. (Though it was fair to scold the couple of boys who acted badly by miming tomahawk chops). Even that “smirking” facial expression was more changing and nuanced than it appeared in the initial video. Julie Irwin Zimmerman: I failed the Covington Catholic test For the sake of argument, however, imagine there were a way to prove what that kid was thinking, and it turned out that his inner monologue was, Ha ha, I’ll disrespect this man approaching me by refusing to move out of his way and smiling in an irritatingly smug, conceited, and silly way. What would that signify? I have no pithy answer. But I know that this would not follow: People are responding so strongly to these videos because they are so emblematic of the violence that indigenous people have suffered for over 500 years in the United States. We have been raped, relocated, trafficked, separated, degraded, demoralized, and massacred by the United States government and a culture of media, economy, education, and religion that has dehumanized indigenous people for the entire history of this stolen country. Presently, this country continues to poison indigenous people by defiling our water and pumping drugs and alcohol into indigenous communities; regulate native bodies through tribal numbers and blood quantum laws; and force assimilation (culturally, spiritually). These are tactics of genocide. How strange to treat a smirking teen’s face, something known to every parent and schoolteacher in the world, as an emblem of “tactics of genocide”—as though the root of ethnic cleansing were adolescent insolence. Adam Serwer: The Trump-era overcorrection And that claim was not uniquely inapt. “What was happening was clear and unmistakable, not just resonant but immediately recognizable as iconic,” Laura Wagner wrote at Deadspin. “If you wanted to compress the history of relations between the powerful and the powerless in America, or the dynamics of the current moment, into a single image, you couldn’t do much better than to present a white teen in a MAGA hat, surrounded by a screaming horde of his peers, smirking into the face of an old Native American man.” I could do much better. If I were compressing “the history of relations between the powerful and the powerless in America” into a single image, I’d represent “the powerful” with someone old enough to vote, not a scrawny high-school kid. My horde would look like the Confederate army, not a pep rally. Treating a smirking teenager as a stand-in for the wanton slaughter of indigenous people, the brutal abomination of chattel slavery, the persecution of anti-war activists, the racial terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan, the exclusion of Chinese immigrants, or the internment of Japanese Americans utterly trivializes bygone atrocities. Did these commentators swallow the trendy notion that microaggressions are “violence,” and apply it backwards in history? Read: Stop trusting viral videos Were I to distill “the dynamics of the current moment into a single image,” focusing on negatives, I’d seek out photos of children forcibly separated from their parents at the Mexican border; or addicts dead from opiate overdoses; or mass-shooting victims at a synagogue; or white supremacists beating counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia; or lobbyists facilitating rent-seeking; or homeowners blocking the construction of apartments in their neighborhood; or segregated schools; or signs of climate change. If you think the better choice is a photo of a smirking white 17-year-old, I suspect that the Donald Trump reelection team would thrill at letting you define the 2020 election. And I say that as someone who hates both the MAGA caps and the vicious campaign that popularized them. Rebecca Traister wrote: It’s the easily extracted concern for these grinning boys—amidst the deportations & family separations, the harassment & assaults, the low wages, poverty & incarceration, the shootings & police brutality, the lack of access to medical/repro care—that’s going to finally do me in. Many who are sympathetic to the blue coalition’s concerns are baffled that a large faction within it spends so much energy on culture-war pile-ons, even opining that children are punchable or irredeemable or deserving of doxing. It’s the bizarre focus on these boys as what ails America, rather than on any of the many powerful people doing identifiable harm, or on any of the things that might end family separations, avert assaults, increase wages, reduce poverty, reform police, or increase access to medical care, that’s going to do in the left.",2019-01-23 11:16:41,This Is How the Left Destroys Itself,"drug abuse and traffic,crime and criminals,sex crimes",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

Last June, a man drove to the Hoover Dam and, for 90 minutes, used an armored vehicle that authorities believe he made himself to block traffic on the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge. He had a rifle, a handgun, a flash-bang device, rounds of ammunition, and a sign urging President Donald Trump to “release the OIG report.” The man, Matthew Wright, was a believer in the QAnon conspiracy theory, convinced that rather than investigating Trump’s ties with Russia, special counsel Robert Mueller and Trump are actually working together to expose evildoers and pedophiles (including every previous president) and will ultimately send every Democrat to Guantanamo Bay. He believed so fervently that a secret version of a report from the inspector general existed that would uncover a web of Democratic evil that he was willing to take on armed police officers to get it. After his arrest, Wright wrote letters to the White House from his jail cell, using QAnon phraseology and inquiring about “The Storm,” the day when QAnon followers believe that all of Trump’s enemies will be simultaneously arrested and martial law will be declared. Now Wright is facing life in prison on terrorism charges. I’ve written a lot about conspiracy theories this year, from newer conspiracy theories like QAnon that appeal to some of Trump’s biggest supporters on the right (and appears to have now spread to Canada) to 9/11 trutherism, which has generally had a more left-leaning following. I’ve written about how conspiracy theories like these spread, and why they’re so hard to defuse. And in doing so, I’ve thought a lot about not just how to write about conspiracy theories, but why it’s important to do it. Because some writers have argued that conspiracy theories are largely inside jokes run amok, and that by writing about them, the Washington Examiner’s Eddie Scarry posited, “the media gin up fear and concern over things that barely exist.” Others have wondered if, by writing about them, journalists are unintentionally giving them oxygen and helping them to spread. But conspiracy theories do matter. Conspiracy theories can diminish faith in institutions and government, lead to distrust of science and medicine, and — even worse — inspire acts of violence. And conspiracy theories can be and are being used by those with political influence to shore up their power and mitigate opposition. Perhaps the reason conspiracy theories seem more powerful than ever is that a conspiracy theorist is now in the White House — a president who is a birther, an occasional vaccine truther, a climate change hoax believer who argued in 2016 that Ted Cruz’s father somehow assisted the assassin of John F. Kennedy. In the Trump era, when long-held facts seem to matter less, conspiracy theories — theories that create not just, in Kellyanne Conway’s terminology, “alternative facts,” but an entirely new reality — are more threatening, and more critical to understand, than ever before. If 2018 was anything, it was, for both Matthew Wright and America, an extremely conspiratorial year. But more so, it became a year when conspiratorial explanations that created an alternative history, even an alternative reality — where Trump and Mueller are working together, where a prominent attorney using the real estate website Zillow can “uncover” the truth about who actually sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford, where mail bombs sent by a conspiracy theorist are “false flags,” or where a caravan of refugees can somehow pose a real risk to the strongest military on earth — gained wider credence, thanks to a host of media outlets all too willing to help spread them, and to an audience that wants to believe them (and elites with the power to circulate them). Some of those theories, like the purported dangers or origins of the migrant caravan, were used by some for directly political purposes (Trump, for one, believed that the caravan would be terrific for GOP prospects in the 2018 midterms). But others, like Zillow-gate, or “false flags” as an explanation for mail bombs sent to prominent liberals, seemed to be a way of drawing connections, or just making sense, out of ideas or concepts that didn’t make sense. The power of conspiracy theories isn’t that they can be empirically proven. The power of conspiracy theories is that they offer an explanation for why something happened, one that seems more palatable or, oddly enough, more realistic than the real explanation. In January, conspiracy theorists on the right — and many others — united to demand that a memo written by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) be released to the public, a memo they believed would expose wrongdoing by the Mueller investigation and ultimately bring it to an end. (That didn’t happen.) In June, celebrities and even the son of the president tweeted that George Soros, a child survivor of the Holocaust, was a Nazi. (He isn’t.) In August, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was unceremoniously thrown off Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube, and in September, he was banned from Twitter too. In October, a man sent pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and political figures featured in conspiracy theories, including Soros. Those bombs were then themselves deemed to be “false flags” by the conspiratorially minded — the very concept of “false flags” being, of course, a conspiracy theory.  That same month, a man steeped in perhaps the oldest conspiracy theory there is murdered 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh after ranting on social media platforms about “EVIL Jews.” In November, court documents revealed that conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi was well aware that hackers had in fact been behind the hacking and leak of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s emails, even while he publicly embraced a conspiracy theory that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer named Seth Rich had been behind the hack (and had been killed for it). Even as I write, the Pulitzer Award-winning writer and poet Alice Walker is embroiled in controversy for her own adherence to conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, and her support for the writings of conspiracy theorist David Icke, who believes that Jewish groups funded the Holocaust (oh, and that a shape-shifting reptile predator race is “turning humanity into a slave race”). And that doesn’t include the conspiracy theories that act as undercurrents to our everyday lives, regardless of our political affiliation or religious beliefs — like the anti-vaccination movement, led by conspiracy theorists who wrongly believe that vaccines cause health problems. In their wake have come measles outbreaks in tight-knit religious groups and well-to-do, left-leaning neighborhoods alike, not to mention waves of chickenpox occurrences in private schools, all a result of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories with bipartisan support and, sometimes, deadly consequences. Nor does it include conspiracy theories that hold prominence in other countries, like Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his allies argued that European countries were lowering the value of Turkish currency on purpose as part of a diabolical plan to “demolish” the country (they weren’t). Conspiracy theories are, for all intents and purposes, everywhere, and no ideology, political persuasion, or religious belief is free from them. Left-leaning liberals are not immune to them, and NBA players are just as prone to conspiracy theories as right-wing comedians. And conspiracy theories aren’t just for fringe elements or internet message boards like 8chan (the birthplace of QAnon), or even for the furthest edges of any political group — which makes them so important to understand. A majority of Americans believe in some form of conspiracy theory around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. More than 70 people ended up in prison because of a conspiracy theory alleging mass Satanic ritual sexual abuse taking place in day care facilities in the 1980s  — a conspiracy theory that held sway within police departments across the country and even in New Zealand and Canada. But in 2018, we saw conspiracy theories on the right given new oxygen, via a media apparatus that seems to promulgate conspiracy theories as a means of serving an audience that, as my colleague Dave Roberts wrote in 2015, is more likely to be politically engaged and intense in their engagement and yet has low trust in institutions and political structures. It wasn’t just talk radio spreading “false flag” memes about the mail pipe bombs — it was a host of a prominent Fox News television program. Conspiracy theorists like Corsi and Trump ally Roger Stone pushed the Seth Rich conspiracy theory on Infowars and in other outlets with audiences of millions — and so far, Fox News and the Washington Times have been forced to issue issued full retractions of their spurious allegations. And while traditionally, conspiracy theories have appeared in times of turmoil or tragedy (think 9/11, or the Kennedy assassination, or the school shooting in Parkland, Florida), right-wing conspiracy theories arose in 2018 while conservatives and Republicans held every branch of the federal government. It went beyond simple belief into, for many people, a means of self-identification, of belonging to something bigger than yourself. There are QAnon T-shirts and bumper stickers for purchase; some people put #WWG1WGA — Where We Go One We Go All, the QAnon “catchphrase” of sorts — in their Twitter bios, or on Instagram, or even display it at Trump rallies. just some extremely normal people at an extremely normal political rally for an extremely normal president https://t.co/0Gxa9sa81B pic.twitter.com/9Z2pDX9zCg The power of conspiracy theories is in their ability to supplant evidence, offering a readable road map to a world that seems like it’s out of control. As I wrote earlier this year, conspiracy theories work on everyone because the will to believe in something is omnipresent for everyone: Here’s the really important point: Conspiracy theories aren’t created by evidence, but by belief, or by the desire to believe, that there must be something more to the events that shape our lives, culture, and politics than accident or happenstance. Where there is confusion, or even pain and tragedy, QAnon, or shootings termed “false flags,” or 9/11 trutherism brings some semblance of order and security. The 9/11 attacks were so horrific that they can’t possibly have happened without President George W. Bush being behind it somehow, orchestrating things behind the scenes. A mass shooting at an elementary school that killed so many small children is so terrible that it can’t possibly have really happened. And the Trump administration must only seem to be enmeshed in constant chaos. And that’s not to mention that the means by which conspiracy theories are spread online in 2018 — including by platforms like YouTube, whose recommendations algorithm has been linked to the amplification of conspiracy theories — appeals to people of all political and social persuasions. For example, the poet Alice Walker appears to have been radicalized in part the same way that many far-right conspiracy theorists are too — by watching videos on YouTube, at least according to a poem she posted on her website in 2017 that treats wildly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish texts as citable canon. But the danger of conspiracy theories isn’t just when they espouse anti-Semitic rhetoric with a lengthy history of violent repercussions, or encourage individuals to take up arms against an imaginary enemy holding imaginary children hostage in a DC pizza restaurant. They pose a risk to how we perceive major institutions, and even how we think about democracy itself, and the actions we’re willing (or not so willing) to take to make democracy better. As Jan-Willem van Prooijen, an associate professor in the department of social and organizational psychology at VU University Amsterdam, wrote in 2015: Far-fetched as these conspiracy theories might be, it would be a mistake to portray conspiracy theorists as simply mentally ill: indeed some conspiracy theories — including theories that the CIA was behind the John F. Kennedy assassination, or that 9-11 was an inside job — are endorsed by a surprisingly large number of citizens. Moreover, conspiracy beliefs can have harmful consequences: people who believe that climate change is a hoax will be less motivated to reduce their carbon footprints; while people who believe that the pharmaceutical industry tries to harm instead of help the public through vaccines are less likely to get their child vaccinated. I spoke to professor Stephan Lewandowsky from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. We’d chatted before when I wrote about QAnon, and I reached back out to him to ask what impact conspiracy theories can have on politics and culture on a broad scale. “We know that conspiracy theories have adverse effects on public discourse and public perception. For example, when people are exposed to a conspiratorial claim about government statistics (unemployment rate), this lowers their trust in government institutions — including institutions that are unconnected to the allegations (e.g., the FDA, Census Bureau, and so on),” he told me via email. “Importantly, this effect arises from mere exposure, without people endorsing or otherwise indicating their belief in a conspiracy.” He added, “We need to understand where conspiracy theories come from because their emergence imperils a public good, namely trust in our institutions.” In short, the risk of conspiracy theories like QAnon, Pizzagate, or 9/11 trutherism isn’t just that tens of millions of people will come to believe in them and a handful of those might use violence in their name. It’s that the only way democracies work is if people trust the institutions that make up their framework — and that can’t happen if large swaths of people believe that the government is running a massive pedophile ring, or blew up the World Trade Center, or is secretly behind climate change, or is giving children autism — particularly since research shows that conspiracy theories are “self-sealing,” meaning that evidence against them can become evidence of their validity in the minds of believers. You don’t have to look far to see how conspiracy theories can cause real problems for democracy. Just look at Nigeria, the most populous country on the African continent, where UNICEF was briefly banned from the country because of conspiracy theories that the group was spying for the terror group Boko Haram, and where separatists and members of political parties opposed to President Muhammadu Buhari have spread a conspiracy theory that Buhari died in 2017 and has been replaced by a look-alike — a conspiracy theory Buhari himself was recently forced to address. In an interview with ABC News, Chatham House associate fellow Matthew T. Page said that conspiracy theories in Nigeria, like in many other countries, were ways for everyday Nigerians to “process and understand unexplained political events and erratic behaviors that seem irrational and insensitive.” But those conspiracy theories are causing security challenges for the Nigerian government. And Nigeria isn’t alone. In Brazil, the spread of conspiracy theories regarding voting machines led many voters to distrust the electoral system. In the United Kingdom, almost 50 percent of those who voted for Brexit believed the government had deliberately concealed the truth about how many immigrants live there. The ramifications of conspiracy theories are all too real. Understanding conspiracy theories is about understanding why people think the way they do about the issues that concern them most — and what they want to believe about them. And as our politics gets more frenzied and confusing, conspiracy theories will continue to emerge to try to make sense of it all.    Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Netflix and Marvel’s The Punisher is back for its second season, but perhaps the biggest currently surrounding the series is the question of whether season two will also be the show’s last. Over the past year, many of Netflix’s Marvel series — namely Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and most recently Daredevil — have been canceled. That’s despite the fact that Luke Cage’s last season was pretty good, and Daredevil’s was enjoyable. (Iron Fist’s was an improvement on its dismal first season, but the show ultimately didn’t last long enough to ever really turn things around.) Go behind the scenes. Chat with creators. Support Vox video. Become a member of the Vox Video Lab on YouTube today. (Heads up: You might be asked to sign in to Google first.) The presumed reason for the cancelations isn’t quality or lack of interest (Netflix is famously very stingy with its viewing data, but Marvel’s Netflix shows have always had a vocal core fanbase). Rather, Disney, Marvel’s parent company, is planning to launch a streaming service of its own later this year — where it is expected to host its own original Marvel shows. Many people believe Netflix is jettisoning its Marvel catalog because the shows, which are produced by Marvel TV and ABC Studios, will be moving to Disney’s service in the future. This is also in keeping with Netflix’s recent moves to focus more on creating original programming whose rights it controls 100 percent. Thus, The Punisher season two might very well the last we see of the series, at least until Disney’s streaming service is online. So is it any good? Rating: 2.5 out of 5 In short, it’s a mixed bag. The show’s signature fight scenes are still fantastic, as is the Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal. But something seemed to go wrong in the writers’ room this go-round, and even with a new dynamic that changes Frank’s life, there are still some stories in play that might have been better wrapped up in season one. If this really is the end of The Punisher — at least for now — watching season two, for me, gave a feeling more like relief than sadness over something I’m going to miss. Here are five things to know about the new episodes. The Punisher’s second season relies on an age-old storyline about a tough, cold hero who, through some turn of events, takes a vulnerable youngster under his wing and vows to protect them at all costs. In this case, Frank Castle (Bernthal), for one reason or another, feels compelled to protect a young girl named Amy (Giorgia Whigham) who, for one reason or another, is in desperate need for protection. He’s supposed to be gruff and soulless, and yet she brings out the softness and vulnerability in him. She’s supposed to be sweet and relatively innocent (well, at least not as grizzled as Frank), but he brings out the toughness in her. Marvel’s comic books have played with this dynamic in stories featuring X-Men’s Wolverine and his “tough dad” relationship to Jubilee and Kitty Pryde, as well in stories featuring Cable and Hope Summers. Fox’s 2017 film Logan was an adaptation of those types of Wolverine stories. Other examples include Iron Man and Spider-Man’s relationship in recent Marvel movies like Spider-Man: Homecoming and Avengers: Infinity War, and the central relationship of 2013’s award-winning video game The Last of Us. Being familiar with those works made me appreciate what The Punisher is going for in season two, and initially got me interested in Frank and Amy’s partnership. But as the episodes unfolded, I found myself thinking that the works I mentioned above all did a better job of establishing a relationship that I wanted to see through to the end, via their writing and execution of their characters’ interactions with one another. With that said, there is a moment in The Punisher season two in which Amy pulls bullets out of Frank’s butt, and I don’t think I’ve seen that done in any television show in recent memory (though I’m more than willing to be proven wrong). In the first season of The Punisher, we witnessed everything that Frank lost. We saw his prewar life, and what a nice man he used to be. The difference became even more stark when we saw what a cold man he became after losing everything. But by the end of that season, it felt like Frank had hit rock bottom, and was on his way back to being human again. Season two sees Frank in a better mental state, and picks up in a somewhat more pleasant place (precisely how pleasant depends on your feelings toward Michigan). In doing so, it adds a new layer of tension to the show, as it makes the audience hold their breath to see if some new event will plunge Frank back into darkness. Amy’s presence also factors in, as she essentially becomes his new child and his new family of sorts, and he doesn’t want to lose her like the family he’s already loved and lost. In The Punisher season one, Agent Dinah Madani (Amber Rose Revah) might have been the worst Homeland Security officer on television. She was thoroughly duped by Billy Russo, the season’s main villain, and had something of an anti-Midas touch, as any stakeout or plan she was involved in would end in death and disarray. Season two sees Madani continue her losing streak, which mainly consists of her not being able to control Frank even though she says he shouldn’t be allowed to run loose and impart his vigilante justice on everyone he deems unworthy. And fine, I understand that in the world of Marvel stories, law enforcement has to be somewhat shoddy, because if authorities were always excellent at their jobs, there would be no need for superheroes. But in addition to not letting her be a very good Homeland Security officer, the writers this season have really phoned it in with Madani. Her character only exists to tell viewers everything she is feeling and everything she did or is about to do. At one point, she asks another character, “I am a smart, strong woman, why would I do something like that?” If “a smart, strong woman” is how the writers see Madana and want to portray her, she needs better dialogue, for starters. She also needs to have moments where she acts like a “smart, strong, woman” so we’re more inclined to believe her — her season two storyline where she becomes infatuated with Billy Russo doesn’t do her any favors. While the first episode of The Punisher season two introduces a creepy, chilly new Christian zealot villain, Russo (Ben Barnes) is still the show’s primary baddie. That’s largely due to Russo’s emotional connection to Frank — he could have helped save Frank’s family and was Frank’s best friend at one point in their lives. The new villain, John Pilgrim (Josh Stewart), doesn’t have that same deep relationship with Frank, and while frightening, becomes more of a terrifying afterthought than a compelling villain. We catch up to Russo trying to recover his memories after the head trauma he suffered at the conclusion of season one. His face is scarred (the way he interacts with other characters on the show seems to indicate it’s horrific, but in reality the scars look like stylish and sexy), and he’s working with a therapist to stitch together everything that’s happened and explain why Frank Castle lives in his nightmares. This season we ask: Can Billy start over again? Given his mental reset, will he return to his evil ways? Are Billy and Frank ever going to forgive one another? Does Billy? deserve another shot at redemption? Billy, like Madani, is forced to utter some poor, heavy-handed lines to convey these thoughts. But it’s a testament to Barnes’s ability as an actor and the thoughtfulness paid to Billy and Frank’s relationship in The Punisher’s first season, that some of them actually work. In 2017, Marvel delayed the release of The Punisher’s first season because of the mass shooting in Las Vegas where at least 50 people were killed. And because gun violence in America is inescapable, it’s understandable that a show so heavy on gun violence, might turn some viewers off. But with that said, shows like The Punisher and movies like John Wick (and its sequel) — which have been lauded and appreciated for their creative shootouts and fight scenes — have started a conversation about how we view gun violence in art. At what point does gun violence in art turn into bad taste? Is it just a matter of timing?  Can a viewer appreciate the art of a fight sequence or chase scene if the scene is reliant on guns? And perhaps more pertinently, what separates art from indulgence? Is there a clear line between them? It feels strange saying this, but I think I was able to appreciate the fight sequence work in The Punisher more in season two because I knew what to expect, and because its zealot villain makes it feel more heightened than season one. Additionally, I watched it at a time when there hadn’t just been a news cycle about a major episode of gun violence in America (whereas when I screened season one, the Las Vegas shooting had just occurred). I definitely recognize that other viewers reactions may vary. But for as meandering the season is, for the viewers who are looking for action and who can view the show’s violence as art with more distance from reality, The Punisher’s fight scenes and gun-slinging are top-notch. The action is bloody, brutal, and beautiful its own special kind of way. We get to see Frank hurt people in a variety of ways in a variety of settings: bars, bar bathrooms, bar dance floors, cars, gyms, trailers, and affluent white people’s homes, to name a few. Each one of those scenes is thoughtfully choreographed with regard to space, movement, sound, and energy. The fight sequences hold your interest, surprising with something new. And none of them — even a particularly tricky one that involves people shooting at each other through a wall — disappoints.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

And why the border wall represents a new form of “security theater.” On Wednesday morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders went on Fox News’s morning show, Fox & Friends, to defend herself after claiming on Sunday that “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally” — a false claim that Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace shut down immediately. In an effort to defend her Sunday statements, Sanders made the argument that even one terrorist coming into the United States is a problem worth building a multibillion-dollar border wall over. “The bottom line is whether it’s one, four, 14 or 4,000, one terrorist coming into our country in illegal fashion to do us harm is one too many,” she said. FOX & FRIENDS: Sarah, why did you dramatically inflate the number of people on watchlists who were detained by Border Patrol?@PressSec: ""The bottom line is whether it's one, 4, 14 or 4,000, one terrorist coming into our country in illegal fashion to do us harm one too many."" pic.twitter.com/x3HrdANppq Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen made the same argument on Monday, tweeting that “one terrorist reaching our borders is one too many.” I am sure all Americans would agree that one terrorist reaching our borders is one too many. These are just the terror suspects we know about who reach our border. This is a very popular argument. It’s even made in other countries. But it is not a particularly good one — and it’s not a particularly conservative one, either. To begin with: Yes, terrorism is bad. It is also, fortunately for all of us, extremely rare, particularly in the United States. As Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute wrote in 2018, Americans are far more likely to be killed by an animal than by a terrorist attack: “From 1975 through the end of 2016, 7,548 people have been killed by animals while 3,438 have been killed by all terrorists.” (And yes, that includes the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.) Moreover, the chances of being killed by a foreign-born terrorist are roughly one in 104.2 million per year — meaning that yes, it is possible, but decidedly unlikely, especially when one considers that the chance of being killed by an asteroid while on Earth is somewhere around one in 1.6 million. Conservatives and libertarians generally understand this about other subjects — on guns and gun control, for example. Conservatives who support gun rights have long recognized that while, as the Federalist’s Sean Davis wrote in 2015, “any amount of violent crime is too much,” gun violence and the deaths they cause have been decreasing rapidly since 1993. That means the threat of guns and gun violence, terrifying as it is, is relatively minimal. On the possibility of bans on so-called “long guns” and rifles, the National Review editorial board wrote in February 2018: “All long guns combined — from granddad’s duck gun to the scary-looking black instruments that so repulse our progressive friends — represent a vanishingly small share of the weapons used in violent crimes in the United States, something on the order of 2 percent in a typical year. In spite of the media hysteria, violent crimes involving so-called assault rifles are so rare that the FBI data don’t even break them out into a separate category.” In short, despite recent, awful events like the Parkland shooting, conservative writers and thinkers have made the argument that the hypothetical (and minimal) threat of a rifle being used in a mass shooting isn’t worth curtailing the civil rights of law-abiding gun owning Americans. Which brings us to the border wall. A Trumpian border wall, which began largely as a campaign gimmick, would not fix whatever is going wrong on our country’s border with Mexico. (One might also note that Trump had two years to address a wall with the GOP in charge of both the House and Senate.) As my colleague Dara Lind has written, not only have there been border wall-type construction projects on the southern border since at least the early 1990s, a wall of the type envisioned by Trump and his most dedicated supporters wouldn’t even fix the real crisis that exists at the border: more families with children coming to the border than US officials can handle. It might be fair to call the current situation at the border a “humanitarian crisis.” But it isn’t why Trump shut down the government. And it isn’t something a wall can fix. The point of walls is to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected. That’s not what most of the families and children who are crossing are doing. They’re turning themselves in to the nearest border agent they see on the US side. Not all of them, but a large share, are seeking asylum — seeking to live legally in the US. That’s something they have a legal right to do even if they crossed illegally — and it’s something they could do at a port of entry even if there were a wall across the entire border. The Trump administration’s specific problem with the influx of asylum seekers isn’t that it isn’t catching them — it’s that it can’t quickly deport them, and can’t detain them for the entire time until they are deported, because of extra legal protections for asylum seekers as well as for children and families. (The administration calls these “loopholes” that create a policy of “catch and release.”) In other words, the problem at the border isn’t terrorists. And the data bears this out. According to NBC News, there were “only six immigrants at ports of entry on the US-Mexico border in the first half of fiscal year 2018 whose names were on a federal government list of known or suspected terrorists.” (And it’s also worth noting that being on a watchlist is not itself a certification of guilt.) It’s accurate, then, to say that a Trumpian border wall represents not security, or safety, or a worthy expense for American tax dollars, but “security theater.” In a 2009 piece for CNN, Bruce Schneier wrote that security theaters are “security measures that make people feel more secure without doing anything to actually improve their security.” While actual security can be gained by investigations or analysis, “security theater” is intended to show the public that everything is fine — without actually doing anything to make the public more, well, fine. The best example of security theater is airport security. As JJ Rich wrote for the Reason Foundation last year, Transportation Security Administration agents patting down children and making us all take off our shoes and belts has less to do with effective security practices and more to do with making us feel secure — in effect, curtailing civil liberties and making flying a more challenging experience purely for our feelings. Nowrasteh from the Cato Institute, who did that research on terror deaths compared to deaths from animal attacks, told me, “The wall, and immigration enforcement more broadly, is the most expensive form of security theater since the War on Terrorism.” And he’s not alone. In a piece for Reason, Steve Chapman wrote that the Trumpian border wall — which wouldn’t stop drugs, probably wouldn’t curtail undocumented immigration (which generally takes place via airports, not the border), and would represent a massive outlay of government spending — is a piece of “performance art.” Performance art, mind you, that would curtail the rights of private landowners and represent a tremendous extension of executive power — something conservatives have long railed against. The “just one terrorist” argument wielded by Sanders and Nielsen is the same argument the TSA has used in the past to defend enhanced boarding procedures on airplanes or the use of body scanners: If just one terror plot is stopped by these invasive and arguably un-Constitutional procedures, it’s worth it. But conservatives should know better. They should know that terrorism is actually incredibly rare, and a border wall is likely to do little to affect any future terrorist attack or keep terrorists out of the country, especially since terror suspects have generally traveled through the air to get to the United States. They should know that more people on the Terrorist Screening Database were stopped along the northern border with Canada than along the southern border with Mexico in 2018. They should know that a wall will act merely as security theater to make Americans feel better at their own expense. And then perhaps they should say so, out loud.

For months leading up to the midterm elections, President Donald Trump crisscrossed the country warning Americans about the urgent crisis at the border: A migrant caravan was about to “invade,” he said. At the time, polls showed Republicans responding to the “crisis” viscerally. Undocumented immigrants crossing the border topped the list of issues angering Republican voters, according to a survey conducted by Reuters and Ipsos. A Republican-led Congress had yet to fund Trump’s wall. By November, 37 percent of Republicans cited immigration as the country’s top problem, according to Gallup — up 17 points from October. Then the election happened. House Republicans lost the majority, Trump was no longer on the campaign trail, and the caravan was no longer an “urgent” crisis. The share of Republicans citing immigration as the top problem declined to 29 percent. Trump is back at it, calling for a wall to stop a “humanitarian crisis.” And Republicans are worried about the border again. Seventy-two percent of Republican voters believe Trump when he says a national security crisis is underway on the southern border, according to an early January poll from Morning Consult and Politico. The reality on the border is very different. Contrary to Trump’s account, illegal border crossings are way down (apprehensions on the border are at the lowest they’ve been since the 1970s). And, ironically, those living less than 350 miles from the border are the least likely to back building Trump’s border wall, according to a 2017 Pew report. Trump’s rhetoric, rather than reflecting reality, is designed to stoke fear. We’ve seen this pattern before, the last time he sounded the alarm bells about an “urgent” border crisis — a migrant caravan “invasion” (that didn’t happen). When Trump cries immigration “crisis,” Republicans listen. When he stops talking about it, their fear appears to fade. But this time, the government has shut down over Trump’s border wall. And Republican lawmakers are faced with what happens when they leave a manufactured crisis untouched. Trump is painting a very specific portrait of the border. “How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?” Trump said during a televised Oval Office address this week. “To those that refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken.” The facts are very different, as Vox has written: Lately, Trump has been trying to make a humanitarian appeal, citing the record numbers of children coming to the border and the risks associated. But as Vox’s Dara Lind has written, a border wall isn’t a solution to that problem. As Lind writes: The point of walls is to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected. That’s not what most of the families and children who are crossing are doing. They’re turning themselves in to the nearest border agent they see on the US side. To drive this point home, not a single one of the nine Congress members who represent districts on the US-Mexico border think there should be a wall, as CBS reported. But all these realities are irrelevant to the president. Trump drummed up an immigration crisis to get elected in 2016, and again ahead of the 2018 midterms, he stoked fear about a migrant caravan that conservative pundit and Town Hall editor Guy Benson told me was “far less urgent and far less frightening that it is being portrayed as.” His 2020 presidential campaign fundraised off his Oval Office remarks about the crisis. And public opinion shows Trump’s base responds to it. There’s an old adage in the Capitol building that Congress needs a deadline or a crisis to get working. It’s why spending fights usually come down to the wire, and why gun control only sees a real debate after a particularly high-profile mass shooting. Trump has been warning about this so-called “border crisis” since he took office, but Republicans, who until this January had full control of Congress and mostly say they fully support Trump’s wall, didn’t make it a priority. Every effort to pass immigration policy reflecting Trump’s agenda has failed. And when it comes to the wall, Republicans have just blamed Democrats for blocking their efforts. But Republicans even had a bill to fund the wall with only 50 votes in the Senate — bypassing Democrats altogether. It was called the 50 Votes for a Wall Act, sponsored by Alabama Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne and 15 other House Republicans that would have created a trust fund that could be filled “out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as the Secretary of Homeland Security may request of the Secretary of Treasury on or after October 1, 2018.” In the same way Republicans passed tax reform, and tried to repeal Obamacare without Democrats, they could have pushed through funding for Trump’s border wall. That didn’t happen. The president’s own party isn’t acting like this is a true crisis. Take it from Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX), who represents the biggest border district and doesn’t see a need for a wall. “I was just on the border. If something is a crisis, why are you not paying the people that are taking care of the crisis?” he told CNN’s Elizabeth Landers of Trump’s insistence on keeping the government shut down until he gets a border wall, even at the expense of Border Patrol’s paychecks. Trump’s base might be responding to this border “crisis” — but Republican lawmakers haven’t been acting with urgency.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

284,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/florida-governor-vows-hold-officials-accountable-amid-reports-planned-suspension-sheriff/,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis pledged on Thursday to speak about government accountability at the headquarters of the Broward County sheriff, following speculation he would suspend the official over the police response to the Parkland mass shooting. DeSantis planned to speak about “holding government officials accountable” on Friday in Fort Lauderdale, at the offices of Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, DeSantis’ office said in a statement. The website Politico and the Miami Herald newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported on Thursday that DeSantis planned to suspend Israel and replace him with a former police sergeant from the Broward County city of Coral Springs. DeSantis, a Republican, while campaigning last year, had expressed interest in suspending Israel over the massacre at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, in which 14 students and three adults were shot to death by a lone gunman. A spokesman for DeSantis declined to comment on media reports that the governor planned to suspend Israel. DeSantis was scheduled to visit Broward County on Friday with the lieutenant governor and the state attorney general, who is the top law enforcement official in Florida. The Parkland massacre on Feb. 14, 2018 was the deadliest mass shooting at a high school in U.S. history. Some parents of students at the high school have criticized Israel and called for his removal, according to local media. Some Broward County sheriff’s deputies held back too long as shots were fired at the school in the massacre, instead of rushing toward the gunfire, according to a 485-page report released last week by a state-appointed commission. Broward County Sheriff’s Office training on active shooters was inadequate, according to the report, which also recommended arming teachers and spending more on school security and mental health to prevent similar mass shootings. A spokesman for Israel could not be reached for comment on Thursday. The sheriff, a Democrat, on Thursday tweeted a photo of himself at a desk, saying “still doing the job the voters of Broward County elected me to do!” Broward County sheriff’s deputy Scot Peterson, who was assigned as the school’s resource officer, resigned last year. He was captured on video staying outside the school during the shooting, which lasted several minutes. Israel, in an interview with CNN less than two weeks after the shooting, described himself as “disgusted” with Peterson’s performance but defended himself. “It’s not the responsibility of the general or the president if you have a deserter.” Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Jacqueline Wong As a House select committee begins its investigation into the Capitol insurrection, a new ad from the conservative Lincoln Project targets corporations and CEOs who allegedly ""helped financed the very structure that led to the murderous violence on Jan. 6.""

285,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/memorable-photos-2018/,"What makes some images memorable and others easily forgotten? It’s a question I’ve been studying for nearly 20 years. Estimates suggest that more than 1 trillion photos were taken in 2018. With so many in circulation, it’s difficult for any single photo to capture our attention and become a famed iconic image. In the golden age of photojournalism, news photographs became iconic largely because they appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world – think Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg. But that age has come to an end: Digital journalism and social media have changed the way we consume images. Each day, audiences are bombarded with photos. Many are shocking, inspiring and heartbreaking. But in their overwhelming volume, they’re easily forgotten. Nonetheless, some do rise to the top. Two colleagues and I developed a model to help predict when and how certain images may become widely known. The model shows that certain characteristics of an image – such as its timeliness, its cultural resonance, its political potency or its likelihood of being turned into a meme – can influence its rise and reach. Images that exhibit these qualities can quickly go viral, turning them into what communication scholars call “instant news icons.” While these images don’t typically endure to become truly historic, they nonetheless help citizens navigate and understand complex events. So which images did this in 2018? On Feb. 14, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. Following such a mass shooting, there’s a predictable pattern of news media coverage – breaking news reports filled with speculation, details about the perpetrator, elected officials responding with “thoughts and prayers” and debates about mental health and gun control. But after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, we saw something new: images of resistance. The students there spoke fervently, demanding action from elected officials. These images of resistance spurred school walkouts and nationwide protests, culminating in the March For Our Lives. Forest fires continued to rage in 2018. During the devastating Carr Fire that burned more than 200,000 acres and claimed the lives of three firefighters, Redding, California resident Richard Tuggle captured a photo of five firefighters resting in a backyard in his neighborhood on July 27. The firefighters were clearly reeling from the exhaustion of battling the deadly fire.   Richard Tuggle/Facebook What’s particularly interesting about this photo and its rise to prominence is that it was captured by a citizen rather than a journalist. The photo went viral on social media and was ultimately picked up by news outlets across the country, showing how instant news icons can come from citizens as well as journalists in this new age of photography. Amid controversy and protests, the Senate narrowly confirmed Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 6. The contentious confirmation hearings pitted the image of an incensed Kavanaugh against images of impassioned protesters standing in solidarity with a calm, composed Christine Blasey Ford.   AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool   AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool In early October, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. The Saudis initially denied that they had anything to do with his disappearance. But security-camera footage emerged showing Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It served as evidence to support the claim – later confirmed – that he was killed inside.   CCTV/Hurriyet via AP In this case, the image was captured by a security camera, rather than a photographer. Nonetheless, it became an instant news icon. It’s just another example of the changing nature of the production and consumption of news imagery. Time magazine named journalists as their 2018 Person of the Year, partly in response to the Khashoggi killing. A devastating war in Yemen has led to economic instability and widespread food shortages. On Oct. 26, The New York Times published photojournalist Tyler Hicks’ gut-wrenching images of starving Yemeni children. A few days later we learned that Amal Hussain, the 7-year-old girl in Hicks’ haunting photo, had died. Journalists have continued to document this humanitarian crisis. In mid-December the Senate voted to end U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen. But the crisis continues, and millions of people still face starvation. Political, economic and ethical debates about immigration dominated the year, with two photos driving the conversation. Getty photographer John Moore’s image of a 2-year-old Honduran girl in a pink shirt sobbing as U.S. Border Patrol agents searched her mother became the face of Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy. The image was even modified for a Time magazine cover under the headline “Welcome to America.”   John Moore/Getty Images The image continued to spur discussion after it was made clear that the mother and daughter were not actually separated. However, hundreds of other children have been separated from their parents and recently a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody died. Then, on Nov. 25, Reuters photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon snapped a picture of a mother and her twin daughters fleeing tear gas at the border wall between the U.S. and Tijuana, Mexico. Appearing in news outlets and on social media feeds across the country, it spurred further public and political outrage. Some said the photo effectively contradicted Trump’s narrative that refugees were dangerous. Others noted that the photo evoked the iconic image of a naked Vietnamese girl screaming in pain following a napalm attack.

286,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/how-mark-burnett-resurrected-donald-trump-as-an-icon-of-american-success,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories With “The Apprentice,” the TV producer mythologized Trump—then a floundering D-lister—as the ultimate titan, paving his way to the Presidency. By Patrick Radden Keefe “Expedition: Robinson,” a Swedish reality-television program, premièred in the summer of 1997, with a tantalizing premise: sixteen strangers are deposited on a small island off the coast of Malaysia and forced to fend for themselves. To survive, they must coöperate, but they are also competing: each week, a member of the ensemble is voted off the island, and the final contestant wins a grand prize. The show’s title alluded to both “Robinson Crusoe” and “The Swiss Family Robinson,” but a more apt literary reference might have been “Lord of the Flies.” The first contestant who was kicked off was a young man named Sinisa Savija. Upon returning to Sweden, he was morose, complaining to his wife that the show’s editors would “cut away the good things I did and make me look like a fool.” Nine weeks before the show aired, he stepped in front of a speeding train. The producers dealt with this tragedy by suggesting that Savija’s turmoil was unrelated to the series—and by editing him virtually out of the show. Even so, there was a backlash, with one critic asserting that a program based on such merciless competition was “fascist television.” But everyone watched the show anyway, and Savija was soon forgotten. “We had never seen anything like it,” Svante Stockselius, the chief of the network that produced the program, told the Los Angeles Times, in 2000. “Expedition: Robinson” offered a potent cocktail of repulsion and attraction. You felt embarrassed watching it, Stockselius said, but “you couldn’t stop.” In 1998, a thirty-eight-year-old former British paratrooper named Mark Burnett was living in Los Angeles, producing television. “Lord of the Flies” was one of his favorite books, and after he heard about “Expedition: Robinson” he secured the rights to make an American version. Burnett had previously worked in sales and had a knack for branding. He renamed the show “Survivor.” The first season was set in Borneo, and from the moment it aired, on CBS, in 2000, “Survivor” was a ratings juggernaut: according to the network, a hundred and twenty-five million Americans—more than a third of the population—tuned in for some portion of the season finale. The catchphrase delivered by the host, Jeff Probst, at the end of each elimination ceremony, “The tribe has spoken,” entered the lexicon. Burnett had been a marginal figure in Hollywood, but after this triumph he, too, was rebranded, as an oracle of spectacle. Les Moonves, then the chairman of CBS, arranged for the delivery of a token of thanks—a champagne-colored Mercedes. To Burnett, the meaning of this gesture was unmistakable: “I had arrived.” The only question was what he might do next. A few years later, Burnett was in Brazil, filming “Survivor: The Amazon.” His second marriage was falling apart, and he was staying in a corporate apartment with a girlfriend. One day, they were watching TV and happened across a BBC documentary series called “Trouble at the Top,” about the corporate rat race. The girlfriend found the show boring and suggested changing the station, but Burnett was transfixed. He called his business partner in L.A. and said, “I’ve got a new idea.” Burnett would not discuss the concept over the phone—one of his rules for success was to always pitch in person—but he was certain that the premise had the contours of a hit: “Survivor” in the city. Contestants competing for a corporate job. The urban jungle! He needed someone to play the role of heavyweight tycoon. Burnett, who tends to narrate stories from his own life in the bravura language of a Hollywood pitch, once said of the show, “It’s got to have a hook to it, right? They’ve got to be working for someone big and special and important. Cut to: I’ve rented this skating rink.” In 2002, Burnett rented Wollman Rink, in Central Park, for a live broadcast of the Season 4 finale of “Survivor.” The property was controlled by Donald Trump, who had obtained the lease to operate the rink in 1986, and had plastered his name on it. Before the segment started, Burnett addressed fifteen hundred spectators who had been corralled for the occasion, and noticed Trump sitting with Melania Knauss, then his girlfriend, in the front row. Burnett prides himself on his ability to “read the room”: to size up the personalities in his audience, suss out what they want, and then give it to them. “I need to show respect to Mr. Trump,” Burnett recounted, in a 2013 speech in Vancouver. “I said, ‘Welcome, everybody, to Trump Wollman skating rink. The Trump Wollman skating rink is a fine facility, built by Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Because the Trump Wollman skating rink is the place we are tonight and we love being at the Trump Wollman skating rink, Mr. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.” As Burnett told the story, he had scarcely got offstage before Trump was shaking his hand, proclaiming, “You’re a genius!” Cut to: June, 2015. After starring in fourteen seasons of “The Apprentice,” all executive-produced by Burnett, Trump appeared in the gilded atrium of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, to announce that he was running for President. Only someone “really rich,” Trump declared, could “take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” He also made racist remarks about Mexicans, prompting NBC, which had broadcast “The Apprentice,” to fire him. Burnett, however, did not sever his relationship with his star. He and Trump had been equal partners in “The Apprentice,” and the show had made each of them hundreds of millions of dollars. They were also close friends: Burnett liked to tell people that when Trump married Knauss, in 2005, Burnett’s son Cameron was the ring bearer. Trump had been a celebrity since the eighties, his persona shaped by the best-selling book “The Art of the Deal.” But his business had foundered, and by 2003 he had become a garish figure of local interest—a punch line on Page Six. “The Apprentice” mythologized him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success. Jay Bienstock, a longtime collaborator of Burnett’s, and the showrunner on “The Apprentice,” told me, “Mark always likes to compare his shows to great films or novels. All of Mark’s shows feel bigger than life, and this is by design.” Burnett has made many programs since “The Apprentice,” among them “Shark Tank,” a startup competition based on a Japanese show, and “The Voice,” a singing contest adapted from a Dutch program. In June, he became the chairman of M-G-M Television. But his chief legacy is to have cast a serially bankrupt carnival barker in the role of a man who might plausibly become the leader of the free world. “I don’t think any of us could have known what this would become,” Katherine Walker, a producer on the first five seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me. “But Donald would not be President had it not been for that show.” Tony Schwartz, who wrote “The Art of the Deal,” which falsely presented Trump as its primary author, told me that he feels some responsibility for facilitating Trump’s imposture. But, he said, “Mark Burnett’s influence was vastly greater,” adding, “ ‘The Apprentice’ was the single biggest factor in putting Trump in the national spotlight.” Schwartz has publicly condemned Trump, describing him as “the monster I helped to create.” Burnett, by contrast, has refused to speak publicly about his relationship with the President or about his curious, but decisive, role in American history. Burnett is lean and lanky, with the ageless, perpetually smiling face of Peter Pan and eyes that, in the words of one ex-wife, have “a Photoshop twinkle.” He has a high forehead and the fixed, gravity-defying hair of a nineteen-fifties film star. People often mistake Burnett for an Australian, because he has a deep tan and an outdoorsy disposition, and because his accent has been mongrelized by years of international travel. But he grew up in Dagenham, on the eastern outskirts of London, a milieu that he has recalled as “gray and grimy.” His father, Archie, was a tattooed Glaswegian who worked the night shift at a Ford automobile plant. His mother, Jean, worked there as well, pouring acid into batteries, but in Mark’s recollection she always dressed immaculately, “never letting her station in life interfere with how she presented herself.” Mark, an only child, grew up watching American television shows such as “Starsky & Hutch” and “The Rockford Files.” At seventeen, he volunteered for the British Army’s Parachute Regiment; according to a friend who enlisted with him, he joined for “the glitz.” The Paras were an élite unit, and a soldier from his platoon, Paul Read, told me that Burnett was a particularly formidable special operator, both physically commanding and a natural leader: “He was always super keen. He always wanted to be the best, even among the best.” (Another soldier recalled that Burnett was nicknamed the Male Model, because he was reluctant to “get any dirt under his fingernails.”) Burnett served in Northern Ireland, and then in the Falklands, where he took part in the 1982 advance on Port Stanley. The experience, he later said, was “horrific, but on the other hand—in a sick way—exciting.” When Burnett left the Army, after five years, his plan was to find work in Central America as a “weapons and tactics adviser”—not as a mercenary, he later insisted, though it is difficult to parse the distinction. Before he left, his mother told him that she’d had a premonition and implored him not to take another job that involved carrying a gun. Like Trump, Burnett trusts his impulses. “Your gut instinct is rarely wrong,” he likes to say. During a layover in Los Angeles, he decided to heed his mother’s admonition, and walked out of the airport. He later described himself as the quintessential immigrant: “I had no money, no green card, no nothing.” But the California sun was shining, and he was eager to try his luck. Burnett is an avid raconteur, and his anecdotes about his life tend to have a three-act structure. In Act I, he is a fish out of water, guileless and naïve, with nothing but the shirt on his back and an outsized dream. Act II is the rude awakening: the world bets against him. It’s impossible! You’ll lose everything! No such thing has ever been tried! In Act III, Burnett always prevails. Not long after arriving in California, he landed his first job—as a nanny. Eyebrows were raised: a commando turned nanny? Yet Burnett thrived, working for a family in Beverly Hills, then one in Malibu. As he later observed, the experience taught him “how nice the life styles of wealthy people are.” Young, handsome, and solicitous, he discovered that successful people are often happy to talk about their path to success. Burnett married a California woman, Kym Gold, who came from an affluent family. “Mark has always been very, very hungry,” Gold told me recently. “He’s always had a lot of drive.” For a time, he worked for Gold’s stepfather, who owned a casting agency, and for Gold, who owned an apparel business. She would buy slightly imperfect T-shirts wholesale, at two dollars apiece, and Burnett would resell them, on the Venice boardwalk, for eighteen. That was where he learned “the art of selling,” he has said. The marriage lasted only a year, by which point Burnett had obtained a green card. (Gold, who had also learned a thing or two about selling, went on to co-found the denim company True Religion, which was eventually sold for eight hundred million dollars.) One day in the early nineties, Burnett read an article about a new kind of athletic event: a long-distance endurance race, known as the Raid Gauloises, in which teams of athletes competed in a multiday trek over harsh terrain. In 1992, Burnett organized a team and participated in a race in Oman. Noticing that he and his teammates were “walking, climbing advertisements” for gear, he signed up sponsors. He also realized that if you filmed such a race it would make for exotic and gripping viewing. Burnett launched his own race, the Eco-Challenge, which was set in such scenic locations as Utah and British Columbia, and was televised on various outlets, including the Discovery Channel. Bienstock, who first met Burnett when he worked on the “Eco-Challenge” show, in 1996, told me that Burnett was less interested in the ravishing backdrops or in the competition than he was in the intense emotional experiences of the racers: “Mark saw the drama in real people being the driving force in an unscripted show.” By this time, Burnett had met an aspiring actress from Long Island named Dianne Minerva and married her. They became consumed with making the show a success. “When we went to bed at night, we talked about it, when we woke up in the morning, we talked about it,” Dianne Burnett told me recently. In the small world of adventure racing, Mark developed a reputation as a slick and ambitious operator. “He’s like a rattlesnake,” one of his business competitors told the New York Times in 2000. “If you’re close enough long enough, you’re going to get bit.” Mark and Dianne were doing far better than Mark’s parents ever had, but he was restless. One day, they attended a seminar by the motivational speaker Tony Robbins called “Unleash the Power Within.” A good technique for realizing your goals, Robbins counselled, was to write down what you wanted most on index cards, then deposit them around your house, as constant reminders. In a 2012 memoir, “The Road to Reality,” Dianne Burnett recalls that she wrote the word “FAMILY” on her index cards. Mark wrote “MORE MONEY.” As a young man, Burnett occasionally found himself on a flight for business, looking at the other passengers and daydreaming: If this plane were to crash on a desert island, where would I fit into our new society? Who would lead and who would follow? “Nature strips away the veneer we show one another every day, at which point people become who they really are,” Burnett once wrote. He has long espoused a Hobbesian world view, and when he launched “Survivor” a zero-sum ethos was integral to the show. “It’s quite a mean game, just like life is kind of a mean game,” Burnett told CNN, in 2001. “Everyone’s out for themselves.” On “Survivor,” the competitors were split into teams, or “tribes.” In this raw arena, Burnett suggested, viewers could glimpse the cruel essence of human nature. It was undeniably compelling to watch contestants of different ages, body types, and dispositions negotiate the primordial challenges of making fire, securing shelter, and foraging for food. At the same time, the scenario was extravagantly contrived: the castaways were shadowed by camera crews, and helicopters thundered around the island, gathering aerial shots. Moreover, the contestants had been selected for their charisma and their combustibility. “It’s all about casting,” Burnett once observed. “As a producer, my job is to make the choices in who to work with and put on camera.” He was always searching for someone with the sort of personality that could “break through the clutter.” In casting sessions, Burnett sometimes goaded people, to see how they responded to conflict. Katherine Walker, the “Apprentice” producer, told me about an audition in which Burnett taunted a prospective cast member by insinuating that he was secretly gay. (The man, riled, threw the accusation back at Burnett, and was not cast that season.) Richard Levak, a clinical psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” and worked on other reality-TV shows, told me that producers have often liked people he was uncomfortable with for psychological reasons. Emotional volatility makes for compelling television. But recruiting individuals for their instability and then subjecting them to the stress of a televised competition can be perilous. When Burnett was once asked about Sinisa Savija’s suicide, he contended that Savija had “previous psychological problems.” No “Survivor” or “Apprentice” contestants are known to have killed themselves, but in the past two decades several dozen reality-TV participants have. Levak eventually stopped consulting on such programs, in part because he feared that a contestant might harm himself. “I would think, Geez, if this should unravel, they’re going to look at the personality profile and there may have been a red flag,” he recalled. Burnett excelled at the casting equation to the point where, on Season 2 of “Survivor,” which was shot in the Australian outback, his castaways spent so much time gossiping about the characters from the previous season that Burnett warned them, “The more time you spend talking about the first ‘Survivor,’ the less time you will have on television.” But Burnett’s real genius was in marketing. When he made the rounds in L.A. to pitch “Survivor,” he vowed that it would become a cultural phenomenon, and he presented executives with a mock issue of Newsweek featuring the show on the cover. (Later, “Survivor” did make the cover of the magazine.) Burnett devised a dizzying array of lucrative product-integration deals. In the first season, one of the teams won a care package that was attached to a parachute bearing the red-and-white logo of Target. “I looked on ‘Survivor’ as much as a marketing vehicle as a television show,” Burnett once explained. He was creating an immersive, cinematic entertainment—and he was known for lush production values, and for paying handsomely to retain top producers and editors—but he was anything but precious about his art. Long before he met Trump, Burnett had developed a Panglossian confidence in the power of branding. “I believe we’re going to see something like the Microsoft Grand Canyon National Park,” he told the New York Times in 2001. “The government won’t take care of all that—companies will.” Seven weeks before the 2016 election, Burnett, in a smart tux with a shawl collar, arrived with his third wife, the actress and producer Roma Downey, at the Microsoft Theatre, in Los Angeles, for the Emmy Awards. Both “Shark Tank” and “The Voice” won awards that night. But his triumphant evening was marred when the master of ceremonies, Jimmy Kimmel, took an unexpected turn during his opening monologue. “Television brings people together, but television can also tear us apart,” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if it wasn’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for President?” In the crowd, there was laughter. “Many have asked, ‘Who is to blame for Donald Trump?’ ” Kimmel continued. “I’ll tell you who, because he’s sitting right there. That guy.” Kimmel pointed into the audience, and the live feed cut to a closeup of Burnett, whose expression resolved itself into a rigid grin. “Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one,” Kimmel said. Burnett was still smiling, but Kimmel wasn’t. He went on, “I’m going on the record right now. He’s responsible. If Donald Trump gets elected and he builds that wall, the first person we’re throwing over it is Mark Burnett. The tribe has spoken.” Around this time, Burnett stopped giving interviews about Trump or “The Apprentice.” He continues to speak to the press to promote his shows, but he declined an interview with me. Before Trump’s Presidential run, however, Burnett told and retold the story of how the show originated. When he met Trump at Wollman Rink, Burnett told him an anecdote about how, as a young man selling T-shirts on the boardwalk on Venice Beach, he had been handed a copy of “The Art of the Deal,” by a passing rollerblader. Burnett said that he had read it, and that it had changed his life; he thought, What a legend this guy Trump is! Anyone else hearing this tale might have found it a bit calculated, if not implausible. Kym Gold, Burnett’s first wife, told me that she has no recollection of him reading Trump’s book in this period. “He liked mystery books,” she said. But when Trump heard the story he was flattered. Burnett has never liked the phrase “reality television.” For a time, he valiantly campaigned to rebrand his genre “dramality”—“a mixture of drama and reality.” The term never caught on, but it reflected Burnett’s forthright acknowledgment that what he creates is a highly structured, selective, and manipulated rendition of reality. Burnett has often boasted that, for each televised hour of “The Apprentice,” his crews shot as many as three hundred hours of footage. The real alchemy of reality television is the editing—sifting through a compost heap of clips and piecing together an absorbing story. Jonathon Braun, an editor who started working with Burnett on “Survivor” and then worked on the first six seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me, “You don’t make anything up. But you accentuate things that you see as themes.” He readily conceded how distorting this process can be. Much of reality TV consists of reaction shots: one participant says something outrageous, and the camera cuts away to another participant rolling her eyes. Often, Braun said, editors lift an eye roll from an entirely different part of the conversation. “The Apprentice” was built around a weekly series of business challenges. At the end of each episode, Trump determined which competitor should be “fired.” But, as Braun explained, Trump was frequently unprepared for these sessions, with little grasp of who had performed well. Sometimes a candidate distinguished herself during the contest only to get fired, on a whim, by Trump. When this happened, Braun said, the editors were often obliged to “reverse engineer” the episode, scouring hundreds of hours of footage to emphasize the few moments when the exemplary candidate might have slipped up, in an attempt to assemble an artificial version of history in which Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip decision made sense. During the making of “The Apprentice,” Burnett conceded that the stories were constructed in this way, saying, “We know each week who has been fired, and, therefore, you’re editing in reverse.” Braun noted that President Trump’s staff seems to have been similarly forced to learn the art of retroactive narrative construction, adding, “I find it strangely validating to hear that they’re doing the same thing in the White House.” Such sleight of hand is the industry standard in reality television. But the entire premise of “The Apprentice” was also something of a con. When Trump and Burnett told the story of their partnership, both suggested that Trump was initially wary of committing to a TV show, because he was so busy running his flourishing real-estate empire. During a 2004 panel at the Museum of Television and Radio, in Los Angeles, Trump claimed that “every network” had tried to get him to do a reality show, but he wasn’t interested: “I don’t want to have cameras all over my office, dealing with contractors, politicians, mobsters, and everyone else I have to deal with in my business. You know, mobsters don’t like, as they’re talking to me, having cameras all over the room. It would play well on television, but it doesn’t play well with them.” “The Apprentice” portrayed Trump not as a skeezy hustler who huddles with local mobsters but as a plutocrat with impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth—a titan who always seemed to be climbing out of helicopters or into limousines. “Most of us knew he was a fake,” Braun told me. “He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.” Bill Pruitt, another producer, recalled, “We walked through the offices and saw chipped furniture. We saw a crumbling empire at every turn. Our job was to make it seem otherwise.” Trump maximized his profits from the start. When producers were searching for office space in which to stage the show, he vetoed every suggestion, then mentioned that he had an empty floor available in Trump Tower, which he could lease at a reasonable price. (After becoming President, he offered a similar arrangement to the Secret Service.) When the production staff tried to furnish the space, they found that local venders, stiffed by Trump in the past, refused to do business with them. More than two hundred thousand people applied for one of the sixteen spots on Season 1, and throughout the show’s early years the candidates were conspicuously credentialled and impressive. Officially, the grand prize was what the show described as “the dream job of a lifetime”—the unfathomable privilege of being mentored by Donald Trump while working as a junior executive at the Trump Organization. All the candidates paid lip service to the notion that Trump was a peerless businessman, but not all of them believed it. A standout contestant in Season 1 was Kwame Jackson, a young African-American man with an M.B.A. from Harvard, who had worked at Goldman Sachs. Jackson told me that he did the show not out of any desire for Trump’s tutelage but because he regarded the prospect of a nationally televised business competition as “a great platform” for career advancement. “At Goldman, I was in private-wealth management, so Trump was not, by any stretch, the most financially successful person I’d ever met or managed,” Jackson told me. He was quietly amused when other contestants swooned over Trump’s deal-making prowess or his elevated tastes—when they exclaimed, on tours of tacky Trump properties, “Oh, my God, this is so rich—this is, like, really rich!” Fran Lebowitz once remarked that Trump is “a poor person’s idea of a rich person,” and Jackson was struck, when the show aired, by the extent to which Americans fell for the ruse. “Main Street America saw all those glittery things, the helicopter and the gold-plated sinks, and saw the most successful person in the universe,” he recalled. “The people I knew in the world of high finance understood that it was all a joke.” This is an oddly common refrain among people who were involved in “The Apprentice”: that the show was camp, and that the image of Trump as an avatar of prosperity was delivered with a wink. Somehow, this interpretation eluded the audience. Jonathon Braun marvelled, “People started taking it seriously!” When I watched several dozen episodes of the show recently, I saw no hint of deliberate irony. Admittedly, it is laughable to hear the candidates, at a fancy meal, talk about watching Trump for cues on which utensil they should use for each course, as if he were Emily Post. But the show’s reverence for its pugnacious host, however credulous it might seem now, comes across as sincere. Did Burnett believe what he was selling? Or was Trump another two-dollar T-shirt that he pawned off for eighteen? It’s difficult to say. One person who has collaborated with Burnett likened him to Harold Hill, the travelling fraudster in “The Music Man,” saying, “There’s always an angle with Mark. He’s all about selling.” Burnett is fluent in the jargon of self-help, and he has published two memoirs, both written with Bill O’Reilly’s ghostwriter, which double as manuals on how to get rich. One of them, titled “Jump In!: Even if You Don’t Know How to Swim,” now reads like an inadvertent metaphor for the Trump Presidency. “Don’t waste time on overpreparation,” the book advises. At the 2004 panel, Burnett made it clear that, with “The Apprentice,” he was selling an archetype. “Donald is the real current-day version of a tycoon,” he said. “Donald will say whatever Donald wants to say. He takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. It’s like the guys who built the West.” Like Trump, Burnett seemed to have both a jaundiced impression of the gullible essence of the American people and a brazen enthusiasm for how to exploit it. “The Apprentice” was about “what makes America great,” Burnett said. “Everybody wants one of a few things in this country. They’re willing to pay to lose weight. They’re willing to pay to grow hair. They’re willing to pay to have sex. And they’re willing to pay to learn how to get rich.” At the start of “The Apprentice,” Burnett’s intention may have been to tell a more honest story, one that acknowledged Trump’s many stumbles. Burnett surely recognized that Trump was at a low point, but, according to Walker, “Mark sensed Trump’s potential for a comeback.” Indeed, in a voice-over introduction in the show’s pilot, Trump conceded a degree of weakness that feels shockingly self-aware when you listen to it today: “I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won, big league.” The show was an instant hit, and Trump’s public image, and the man himself, began to change. Not long after the première, Trump suggested in an Esquire article that people now liked him, “whereas before, they viewed me as a bit of an ogre.” Jim Dowd, Trump’s former publicist, told Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the authors of the 2016 book “Trump Revealed,” that after “The Apprentice” began airing “people on the street embraced him.” Dowd noted, “All of a sudden, there was none of the old mocking,” adding, “He was a hero.” Dowd, who died in 2016, pinpointed the public’s embrace of “The Apprentice” as “the bridge” to Trump’s Presidential run. The show’s camera operators often shot Trump from low angles, as you would a basketball pro, or Mt. Rushmore. Trump loomed over the viewer, his face in a jowly glower, his hair darker than it is now, the metallic auburn of a new penny. (“Apprentice” employees were instructed not to fiddle with Trump’s hair, which he dyed and styled himself.) Trump’s entrances were choreographed for maximum impact, and often set to a moody accompaniment of synthesized drums and cymbals. The “boardroom”—a stage set where Trump determined which candidate should be fired—had the menacing gloom of a “Godfather” movie. In one scene, Trump ushered contestants through his rococo Trump Tower aerie, and said, “I show this apartment to very few people. Presidents. Kings.” In the tabloid ecosystem in which he had long languished, Trump was always Donald, or the Donald. On “The Apprentice,” he finally became Mr. Trump. “We have to subscribe to our own myths,” the “Apprentice” producer Bill Pruitt told me. “Mark Burnett is a great mythmaker. He blew up that balloon and he believed in it.” Burnett, preferring to spend time pitching new ideas for shows, delegated most of the daily decisions about “The Apprentice” to his team, many of them veterans of “Survivor” and “Eco-Challenge.” But he furiously promoted the show, often with Trump at his side. According to many of Burnett’s collaborators, one of his greatest skills is his handling of talent—understanding their desires and anxieties, making them feel protected and secure. On interview tours with Trump, Burnett exhibited the studied instincts of a veteran producer: anytime the spotlight strayed in his direction, he subtly redirected it at Trump. Burnett, who was forty-three when Season 1 aired, described the fifty-seven-year-old Trump as his “soul mate.” He expressed astonishment at Trump’s “laser-like focus and retention.” He delivered flattery in the ostentatiously obsequious register that Trump prefers. Burnett said he hoped that he might someday rise to Trump’s “level” of prestige and success, adding, “I don’t know if I’ll ever make it. But you know something? If you’re not shooting for the stars, you’re not shooting!” On one occasion, Trump invited Burnett to dinner at his Trump Tower apartment; Burnett had anticipated an elegant meal, and, according to an associate, concealed his surprise when Trump handed him a burger from McDonald’s. Trump liked to suggest that he and Burnett had come up with the show “together”; Burnett never corrected him. When Carolyn Kepcher, a Trump Organization executive who appeared alongside Trump in early seasons of “The Apprentice,” seemed to be courting her own celebrity, Trump fired her and gave on-air roles to three of his children, Ivanka, Donald, Jr., and Eric. Burnett grasped that the best way to keep Trump satisfied was to insure that he never felt upstaged. “It’s Batman and Robin, and I’m clearly Robin,” he said. Burnett sometimes went so far as to imply that Trump’s involvement in “The Apprentice” was a form of altruism. “This is Donald Trump giving back,” he told the Times in 2003, then offered a vague invocation of post-9/11 civic duty: “What makes the world a safe place right now? I think it’s American dollars, which come from taxes, which come because of Donald Trump.” Trump himself had been candid about his reasons for doing the show. “My jet’s going to be in every episode,” he told Jim Dowd, adding that the production would be “great for my brand.” It was. Season 1 of “The Apprentice” flogged one Trump property after another. The contestants stayed at Trump Tower, did events at Trump National Golf Club, sold Trump Ice bottled water. “I’ve always felt that the Trump Taj Mahal should do even better,” Trump announced before sending the contestants off on a challenge to lure gamblers to his Atlantic City casino, which soon went bankrupt. The prize for the winning team was an opportunity to stay and gamble at the Taj, trailed by cameras. “The Apprentice” was so successful that, by the time the second season launched, Trump’s lacklustre tie-in products were being edged out by blue-chip companies willing to pay handsomely to have their wares featured onscreen. In 2004, Kevin Harris, a producer who helped Burnett secure product-integration deals, sent an e-mail describing a teaser reel of Trump endorsements that would be used to attract clients: “Fast cutting of Donald—‘Crest is the biggest’ ‘I have worn Levis since I was 2’ ‘I love M&Ms’ ‘Unilever is the biggest company in the world’ all with the MONEY MONEY MONEY song over the top.” Burnett and Trump negotiated with NBC to retain the rights to income derived from product integration, and split the fees. On set, Trump often gloated about this easy money. One producer remembered, “You’d say, ‘Hey, Donald, today we have Pepsi, and they’re paying three million to be in the show,’ and he’d say, ‘That’s great, I just made a million five!’ ” Originally, Burnett had planned to cast a different mogul in the role of host each season. But Trump took to his part more nimbly than anyone might have predicted. He wouldn’t read a script—he stumbled over the words and got the enunciation all wrong. But off the cuff he delivered the kind of zesty banter that is the lifeblood of reality television. He barked at one contestant, “Sam, you’re sort of a disaster. Don’t take offense, but everyone hates you.” Katherine Walker told me that producers often struggled to make Trump seem coherent, editing out garbled syntax and malapropisms. “We cleaned it up so that he was his best self,” she said, adding, “I’m sure Donald thinks that he was never edited.” However, she acknowledged, he was a natural for the medium: whereas reality-TV producers generally must amp up personalities and events, to accentuate conflict and conjure intrigue, “we didn’t have to change him—he gave us stuff to work with.” Trump improvised the tagline for which “The Apprentice” became famous: “You’re fired.” NBC executives were so enamored of their new star that they instructed Burnett and his producers to give Trump more screen time. This is when Trump’s obsession with television ratings took hold. “I didn’t know what demographics was four weeks ago,” he told Larry King. “All of a sudden, I heard we were No. 3 in demographics. Last night, we were No. 1 in demographics. And that’s the important rating.” The ratings kept rising, and the first season’s finale was the No. 1 show of the week. For Burnett, Trump’s rehabilitation was a satisfying confirmation of a populist aesthetic. “I like it when critics slam a movie and it does massive box office,” he once said. “I love it.” Whereas others had seen in Trump only a tattered celebrity of the eighties, Burnett had glimpsed a feral charisma. On June 26, 2018, the day the Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s travel ban targeting people from several predominantly Muslim countries, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent out invitations to an event called a Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. If Pompeo registered any dissonance between such lofty rhetoric and Administration policies targeting certain religions, he didn’t mention it. The event took place the next month, at the State Department, in Washington, D.C., and one of the featured speakers was Mark Burnett. In 2004, he had been getting his hair cut at a salon in Malibu when he noticed an attractive woman getting a pedicure. It was Roma Downey, the star of “Touched by an Angel,” a long-running inspirational drama on CBS. They fell in love, and married in 2007; together, they helped rear Burnett’s two sons from his second marriage and Downey’s daughter. Downey, who grew up in a Catholic family in Northern Ireland, is deeply religious, and eventually Burnett, too, reoriented his life around Christianity. “Faith is a major part of our marriage,” Downey said, in 2013, adding, “We pray together.” For people who had long known Burnett, it was an unexpected turn. This was a man who had ended his second marriage during a live interview with Howard Stern. To promote “Survivor” in 2002, Burnett called in to Stern’s radio show, and Stern asked casually if he was married. When Burnett hesitated, Stern pounced. “You didn’t survive marriage?” he asked. “You don’t want your girlfriend to know you’re married?” As Burnett dissembled, Stern kept prying, and the exchange became excruciating. Finally, Stern asked if Burnett was “a single guy,” and Burnett replied, “You know? Yeah.” This was news to Dianne, Burnett’s wife of a decade. As she subsequently wrote in her memoir, “The 18-to-34 radio demographic knew where my marriage was headed before I did.” In 2008, Burnett’s longtime business partner, a lawyer named Conrad Riggs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Burnett had stiffed him to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. According to the lawsuit, the two men had made an agreement before “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” that Riggs would own ten per cent of Burnett’s company. When Riggs got married, someone who attended the ceremony told me, Burnett was his best man, and gave a speech saying that his success would have been impossible without Riggs. Several years later, when Burnett’s company was worth half a billion dollars, he denied having made any agreement. The suit settled out of court. (Riggs declined to comment.) Years ago, Burnett told Esquire that religion was “a waste of time.” Dianne Burnett told me that when she was married to him he had no interest in faith. “But you know what? People change,” she continued. “So I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.” When Burnett met Downey, he reinvented himself. Having made a fortune producing television that was often exploitative, he announced that he would now focus exclusively on “family-friendly franchises,” declaring, “You don’t need to be mean to create drama.” Burnett and Downey launched a production company that has specialized in Christian-themed programming, including a hundred-million-dollar remake of “Ben-Hur,” which flopped. Burnett has spoken enthusiastically to colleagues about the role that prayer and religious devotion now play in his life. He and Downey describe themselves as “the noisiest Christians in Hollywood.” Kym Gold told me she thinks that Burnett tends to adapt to his current partner. Before he married Gold, who is Jewish, he took a six-week course in Judaism. “I’ve never known Mark to be religious,” Gold observed. But she noted that “people close to him have said, ‘He follows the wind.’ ” Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor, is a friend of Burnett’s. “Mark is not at all the person he was a decade ago,” he told me. “Hollywood is built on money, sex, power, and fame. I would say that none of those things are driving forces for him anymore.” Warren assured me, unprompted, that Burnett is sincere in his Christianity—that he is a “genuine believer” who has committed to being an “ambassador” for his faith. Others who know Burnett noted to me that the Christian community is itself a significant viewer demographic. Burnett talks with colleagues about the “faith audience,” and describes the Christian community as “the largest army on earth.” In 2013, he and Downey produced “The Bible,” a History Channel miniseries that, Burnett claims, was watched by a hundred million people. The Good Book, in Burnett’s words, is “the ultimate period piece.” At the State Department, Burnett mentioned religious intolerance “throughout the Middle East,” genocide in Darfur, and the persecution of religious minorities in Myanmar. “I’m simply a TV producer,” he said, noting that he was “far less educated” than his audience. But he was good at communicating with the masses, he went on. He explained his formula for storytelling: “K-I-S-S—‘Keep it simple, stupid.’ ” Burnett said that when he and Downey travel, strangers sometimes “ask her to lay her hands upon them,” as if she were actually an angel. This, he confided, is “the power of media.” He suggested that his position in Hollywood gave him some leverage when it came to pressing politicians to do the right thing: “In the end, nobody wants to look bad in the media.” But Burnett did not cite any controversial White House policies that he hoped to change; he didn’t even mention Trump’s name. Burnett had remained close to the President. At the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, he introduced Trump, saying that there “has never been a single bad word between us,” and describing their fourteen-year friendship as “one of the greatest relationships of my life.” Over the years, Burnett and Downey have given to Democratic causes, and in 2008 they donated the maximum contribution to Barack Obama’s campaign. But Burnett has never been especially political. One longtime “Apprentice” staff member told me that Burnett did not welcome the idea of losing his star to a Presidential campaign, noting, “Trump running for President cost Mark a lot of money. He made millions on ‘The Apprentice,’ and Trump killed the franchise.” By the time Trump announced his campaign, ratings for “The Apprentice” had fallen, and the show had been repackaged as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The contestants were now D-list celebrities, including Gary Busey, the zonked-out actor, and Gene Simmons, the repellent front man of Kiss. There were the same business challenges and boardroom eliminations, but the stakes felt conspicuously lower. A lot of the drama in the original “Apprentice” had stemmed from the idea that, for aspiring entrepreneurs, competing on the show could be a career-defining opportunity. For the aging, Botoxed cohort on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” their presence was a tacit admission that their best days were behind them. Still, everyone gamely pretended to take it seriously. Describing the show in one public appearance, Donald Trump, Jr., said that it could be intimidating for Trump’s children to pass judgment on someone “as accomplished as a Gene Simmons.” In the opening episode of Season 11, the theatrical tension of the boardroom was suddenly punctured by an electronic trill. “Whose cell phone?” Trump growled. “How do I turn this off?” Busey stuttered, fumbling with the tiny buttons. “Gary, turn your cell phone off!” Trump said. It is strange to watch this kind of malarkey now and consider that only a few years later one of these men would be President. “Donald mentioned a number of times, ‘Maybe I’ll run for President one day,’ ” Burnett told the Washington Post in January, 2016. “And sad to say, politics is kind of a TV show.” When Burnett was asked whether he supported Trump’s candidacy, he deflected the question, retreating behind his conceit that politics is simply entertainment by other means. “I have no idea about the politics,” he said, adding, “I have had great fun—great fun—watching it.” After Trump won the election, he turned to his old friend for advice on the inaugural festivities. Like a starlet who keeps returning to a favorite director, Trump had always loved the way that Burnett made him look. Burnett was summoned to New York for a consultation with the President-elect and another Trump confidant, the financier Tom Barrack. Burnett pitched a few Riefenstahlian notions: a parade up Fifth Avenue; a televised helicopter ride ushering Trump from Manhattan to D.C. Barrack, who became the chairman of the inaugural committee, later said that Burnett was actively involved in producing the Inauguration, adding, “Mark is a genius, and the President-elect loves him.” I spoke to several people who recalled Burnett telling them that he was busy working on the Inauguration. A Democratic political operative who was involved in a back-channel campaign to dissuade big-name stars from appearing at the event told me that Burnett had tried to enlist musicians to perform. “Mark was somebody we were actively working against,” the operative said. Trump’s wish list included Elton John, Aretha Franklin, and Paul Anka—who, he hoped, would sing “My Way”—but they all claimed to be otherwise engaged. The event ended up with sparse crowds and a feeble roster of performers. Burnett eventually played down his role in the Inauguration. His representatives told me that “he did not produce” the event. One person who knows Burnett pointed out, “It wasn’t successful, so he probably doesn’t want to be associated with it.” On October 8, 2016, the day after the Washington Post released the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mike bantering about grabbing women’s crotches, Bill Pruitt tweeted, “As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse.” In other interviews, Pruitt said that, during his time on “The Apprentice,” he’d heard Trump make not only sexist statements but also racist ones. This was not so difficult to imagine. Trump’s natural idiom is vulgarity, and the targets of his ire—Colin Kaepernick, “shithole countries,” any African-American journalist who asks him a tough question—are clearly not chosen at random. Part of what was mesmerizing about him, to Mark Burnett and, ultimately, to the American people, was his compulsion for offensive talk. But, in the heightened political atmosphere of an impending Trump Presidency, the notional existence of more “Trump tapes” assumed a potent urgency. Last summer, Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former “Apprentice” contestant and aide to the President, reignited such speculations when she claimed to have heard a tape, recorded during the period when “The Apprentice” was made, in which Trump said the N-word. Manigault Newman produced a recording of her own, taken surreptitiously, of a conversation with two aides from the Trump campaign, in which they appeared to discuss the existence of such a tape. On the recording, one of the aides, Lynne Patton, says that she raised the issue with Trump, and that he said he had no recollection of using such language. “No, he said it,” Katrina Pierson, the other aide, interjects. “He’s embarrassed.” On August 13, 2018, Trump denied that he had ever used racial slurs, tweeting, “@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.” This was a peculiar thing to tweet: if Trump had never uttered the epithet, why would he need to be assured by Burnett that there were no tapes of him doing so? The tweet was also notable because, when the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, Burnett had taken his most definitive step toward distancing himself from Trump. In a statement, he had said, “Given all of the false media reports, I feel compelled to clarify a few points. I am not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy. I am NOT ‘Pro-Trump.’ Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.” Trump generally answers such criticism with a hyperventilating rebuttal, but he didn’t fire back at Burnett—at least not publicly—and their friendship does not appear to have suffered. Scarcely two months after issuing his statement about not being “Pro-Trump,” Burnett attended a fund-raiser for the President-elect at Cipriani, in New York, and in January, 2017, he and his two sons flew to Washington for the Inauguration. Burnett may have wanted to downplay his friendship with the President, but Trump felt no similar compunction. Last March, at a rally in Richfield, Ohio, he announced, “I got a call from Mark Burnett! He did ‘The Apprentice,’ he’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you, did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ ” (Roseanne Barr, a rare Trump supporter in Hollywood, had just rebooted her sitcom.) “I said, ‘Mark, how big were they?’ ‘They were unbelievable! Over eighteen million people!’ ” When I asked Burnett’s representatives about the President’s characterizations of his exchanges with Burnett, they declined to either confirm or deny their accuracy. Burnett’s reluctance to discuss the Trump Presidency is dismaying to many people involved with “The Apprentice,” given that Trump has succeeded in politics, in part, by borrowing the tropes of the show. Jonathon Braun pointed out to me that when Trump announced his candidacy, in 2015, he did so in the atrium of Trump Tower, and made his entrance by descending the gold-colored escalator—choreography that Burnett and his team had repeatedly used on the show. After Trump’s announcement, reports suggested that people who had filled the space and cheered during his speech had been hired to do so, like TV extras, for a day rate of fifty dollars. Earlier this year, the White House started issuing brief video monologues from the President that strongly evoke his appearances on Burnett’s show. Justin McConney, a former director of new media for the Trump Organization, told New York that, whenever Trump works with camera people, he instructs them, “Shoot me like I’m shot on ‘The Apprentice.’ ” Randal Pinkett, who won Season 4 of “The Apprentice,” told me that he had watched Trump’s campaign with a growing sense of dread. Pinkett had long since concluded that Trump was racist. When Trump named Pinkett, who is African-American, the winner, he asked him if he would consider sharing the title with another contestant, a white woman. Pinkett declined. “The only conclusion I can draw is that he didn’t want to see a black man be the sole winner of his show,” he told me. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen said Trump told him that he had not chosen Kwame Jackson, the Goldman Sachs banker, to win in Season 1, because “there’s no way I can let this black fag win.” As a winner, Pinkett went to work for the Trump Organization. “The closer I got to Donald, the less I liked what I saw,” he recalled. “It’s like a person with bad breath.” After Pennsylvania legalized casino gambling, in 2004, Trump applied for a license to build a casino in a predominantly African-American community. “The community hated Donald,” Pinkett said. So the company dispatched Pinkett as an advocate. Upon returning, he said, “I’m not going out there again to represent you folks.” The Trump Organization was using him like a prop, he felt, and he did not want to sell a project that the community so roundly opposed. The casino was never built. Even the grand prize on “The Apprentice” was a bit of a fake, Pinkett told me. His Trump Organization job was actually paid for by NBC. “It wasn’t even his money!” he said. When Trump announced his campaign, Pinkett and Kwame Jackson decided to make a public statement opposing him. “This wasn’t about policy or politics, this was about fitness for office,” Jackson recalled. “This was about basic American character and decency.” They reached out to scores of former contestants and planned a press conference. In the end, apart from Pinkett, Jackson, and two other contestants, nobody showed up. In a statement, Trump said, “How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren’t for me.” “I think the reality for Mark Burnett is he’s a Hollywood guy,” Jackson told me. “He probably feels that if he torpedoes Donald Trump he’ll torpedo a part of his own legacy. And it’s funny, because he has enough money and enough power in Hollywood that he could actually afford to speak up.” Burnett’s silence “is abdication,” Jackson said. “It’s collusion. It’s being complicit, just like an Ivanka Trump. I’m very disappointed in Mark for that.” A recent piece in the Ankler, a widely read online newsletter about Hollywood, noted that Burnett “has spent the past couple years reigning over his corner of resistance territory with nary the slightest hint of backlash.” Donald Trump was a folk devil in Hollywood, and everyone in the industry knew about Burnett’s close association with the President, yet no prominent liberals were refusing to work with Mark Burnett. It’s one thing to “take brave stands on the red carpet,” the article observed. “But you wouldn’t want to go so crazy as to . . . get on the wrong side of a mid-sized mini-studio.” Burnett was recruited to the television arm of M-G-M in 2015, by Gary Barber, the company’s chairman and C.E.O. Barber, a former accountant, had brought the studio back from bankruptcy, slashing costs and shepherding profitable titles like the James Bond franchise. In his effort to build up M-G-M, Barber wanted to augment the studio’s television business. So he bought Burnett’s company and enlisted him to oversee television production. Ostensibly, Barber and Burnett got along. But, whereas Mark Burnett Productions had been characterized by profligate dazzle, Barber was thrifty, and monitored every expense. The chairman of M-G-M’s board is Kevin Ulrich, a financier whose private-equity fund holds a controlling stake in the company. People who know Ulrich describe him as someone who relishes the flashy perquisites of Hollywood moguldom. Whereas Barber liked to spend weekends quietly tending to the racehorses he owns, Ulrich liked going to parties and premières. Barber was interested in selling the studio—a move that Ulrich opposed. According to several sources, Burnett began cultivating Ulrich, inviting him to events and introducing him to celebrities. Then, last March, M-G-M’s board informed Barber that he had been fired; he had just signed a contract extension, so the studio would pay him two hundred and sixty million dollars to leave. Despite this payment, he was incensed. Three months after Barber’s ouster, Burnett was promoted to chairman of television at M-G-M. Barber declined to speak with me, but a friend of his said that he was “blindsided” by his ouster: Burnett had made an alliance with Ulrich and got Barber kicked off the island. As a younger man, Burnett made it known that he wasn’t content to be the producer of a few hit shows—he wanted to run a television studio one day. According to someone who has worked closely with him, Burnett had always felt like an outsider, “because in the reality-TV business, you’re never part of the true Hollywood.” He had long aspired to transition to scripted television and films but did not have much talent for such storytelling. At M-G-M, he would oversee both scripted and unscripted shows, including the acclaimed series “Fargo” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” He had now achieved such a level of power that, even in reflexively liberal Hollywood, his association with Trump was discussed mostly in whispers. Many people who spoke to me for this piece would not do so on the record, citing fears of being blacklisted. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” continues to dog Burnett. In 2017, when he took the stage at the Producers Guild of America Awards to accept the award for Outstanding Producer of Competition Television, there were boos in the audience. In September, he skipped the Emmy Awards, though “The Voice” and “Shark Tank” were nominated; the night before the ceremony, however, he and Downey attended the annual gala for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, at a hotel in Century City. Walking into the event, they had a confrontation with the actor Tom Arnold. Arnold, a wild-eyed industry veteran best known for his role in the 1994 film “True Lies” and for a former marriage to Roseanne Barr, had been on a quest to uncover damaging “Apprentice” outtakes of Donald Trump. He had even launched a gonzo TV show, produced by Vice, called “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.” As Arnold relates on the show, he and Trump knew each other for years, because they had occupied “the same level of Hollywood.” Indeed, in 2010, Burnett had e-mailed Arnold, “Is there any way I can get you to do Celeb Apprentice? . . . I do think that Celeb Apprentice has an awesome brand. Trump really wants you. I REALLY want you.” Arnold was, in his own estimation, a prankster and a marginal celebrity. And it disturbed him to think that someone just like him might be entrusted with managing the country. What precisely happened in Century City is a matter of dispute, but there was a scuffle between Arnold and Burnett. Soon afterward, Roma Downey tweeted a photograph of the back of her hand, writing, “Got this bruise tonight when Tom Arnold tried to ambush my husband Mark and me at a charity event. Is your TV show worth it Tom? Please stop.” Some observers wondered whether a bruise could have emerged that quickly. Arnold himself offered a very different account on Twitter: “Mark Burnett just went apeshit & choked me at this huge Emmy party then he ran away with his torn Pink shirt & missing gold chain. I’m waiting for LAPD.” It might seem improbable that Burnett, the smiling glad-hander, would physically attack someone. But it would not be unprecedented. His second wife, Dianne Burnett, told me that one day, in Santa Monica, Mark left her and one of their sons in the car in order to fetch frozen yogurt. While he was gone, a vagrant began aggressively banging on the car window, presumably in search of a donation. When Burnett returned, Dianne recalled, he punched the man in the face, knocking him down, then drove away. Hours after the Century City event, TMZ published an account by an eyewitness, who said that “Mark had his hands on Tom’s throat, and Tom was tearing at Mark’s shirt and ripping off his crucifix.” The authorities have declined to press charges against Burnett, and several people close to him characterized Arnold as a puerile stunt artist who cornered Burnett in a bit of performance art in order to promote his lousy show. That may well be true, but there is a certain cosmic poetry in the notion that the only person in Hollywood willing to antagonize Burnett about his relationship with Trump is a figure like Tom Arnold. Someone who has worked with Burnett told me, “Mark created the world in which Tom Arnold is the only guy who can go after him. Tom Arnold is trolling Mark Burnett just like Donald Trump trolled all his opponents. And he’s doing it for a reality show!” After Season 1 of “Survivor,” a contestant named Stacey Stillman sued CBS and Burnett, claiming that he had improperly shaped the competition by whispering to contestants about whom they should vote to eliminate. In a deposition, another cast member said that Burnett “believed that certain people would make a better TV show than others, and he did what he could to have influence over those people staying on the island.” Burnett denied any wrongdoing, and the suit was ultimately settled. One consequence of the lawsuit was that, when it came time to make “The Apprentice,” producers tried to have cameras on Donald Trump from the moment he walked onto the set until the moment he left—and all that footage was preserved. When M-G-M bought Burnett’s company, it assumed ownership of those outtakes and, after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, it had to contend with public demands to unseal the “Apprentice” tapes. Marvin Putnam, a lawyer who represents M-G-M, told me, “Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes. Period. Even if Mark Burnett wanted to release the tapes, Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes.” Putnam explained that the contracts that Trump and other cast members signed contained standard industry stipulations limiting the manner in which outtakes and other footage could be used. These are binding obligations, which means that if M-G-M were to violate them—by releasing footage not just of Trump but of anyone who appeared with him onscreen—the studio could be sued. Brian Edwards, the president of television operations at M-G-M, who has worked with Burnett for more than a decade, pointed out that, even without such legal constraints, Burnett couldn’t release the tapes—if he did, talent would refuse to work with him in the future. “If everybody in reality television knew that their outtakes were going to be made public at the first sign of pressure, what do you think would happen to the business?” Edwards asked. Neither Putnam nor Edwards would comment on whether M-G-M possesses tapes in which Trump says something offensive; nor would they say how much, if any, of the archive has been reviewed. Over the fourteen seasons hosted by Trump, nearly two hundred hours of “The Apprentice” aired on NBC. If Burnett indeed shot three hundred hours of footage for each episode, there could be some sixty thousand hours of outtakes to sift through. Most of the former “Apprentice” staffers I spoke to recalled hearing Trump speak coarsely about women. “He wasn’t going around saying ‘pussy, pussy, pussy’ all the time,” Walker said. But he regularly made comments about the bodies of female contestants and female staffers. One “Apprentice” employee told me, “He’d say, ‘How about those boobs? Wouldn’t you like to fuck her?’ ” Even so, Braun said he doubted that there was any “Apprentice” tape in which Trump uses the N-word. “I was the supervising editor on the first six seasons,” he said. “I didn’t watch every frame, but in everything I saw I didn’t hear him saying anything so horrible.” Braun noted that editors on reality shows often amuse themselves by compiling “gag” reels of a cast member’s most off-color or embarrassing moments. The producers may be barred, legally, from airing such outtakes, but that doesn’t stop editors from sharing them internally. Tom Arnold told me that he has seen one such reel from “The Apprentice,” in which Trump uses the N-word. But Braun, who is dismayed that Trump is President, is dubious. “If there was a tape, it would have spread like wildfire,” he said. Another “Apprentice” staffer made the same point: “If somebody had the goods, it would have leaked long ago. There were no Trump fans on the set. I don’t know a single person who worked on the show who voted for Trump.” Whenever Trump appeared on the show, the staffer explained, there were “at least a hundred people watching him,” with a dozen cameras capturing every angle. Live feeds were transmitted to executives not just at NBC but at corporations sponsoring the episode. The staffer continued, “In the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Donald was on a bus. He thought he was alone. He never thought he was alone in the boardroom. It was a set.” To Braun, the hunt for the tapes feels like a distraction. “We’ve seen that it doesn’t matter,” he said. “He now says plenty of things that are outwardly racist, misogynist, and fascist. It just doesn’t hurt him.” After Manigault Newman made her claims about the “Apprentice” tapes, The Economist conducted a survey, and found that seventy-seven per cent of white Trump voters felt that “it is possible that a person who uses the ‘N-word’ while in office can still be a good President.” More than a third of white Trump voters admitted to using the word themselves. One day this past fall, Burnett got a call from his first wife, Kym Gold, with whom he remains friendly. Gold was upset about what was happening in the country, and asked Burnett to intervene with Trump. “We had it out,” she told me. “I said, ‘You’ve got to help our children, for the future and safety of this country.’ ” Gold implored Burnett, “Tell him this is not a reality show. This is real life. You’re the President. You’re saying things you cannot say—to reporters, to other world leaders.” Burnett heard her out. “I’m not into politics,” he told her. “I’m not even on Twitter.” But he said that he had no intention of speaking out against Trump or of releasing any tapes. “I’m just a guy who produces shows,” he insisted. Burnett may not be a policy maven, but he has long been fascinated with political star power. In 2010, he launched “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” on TLC, announcing, “With a dynamic personality that has captivated millions, I can’t think of anyone more compelling than Sarah Palin to tell the story of Alaska.” At the time, Burnett contended that the show was “completely nonpolitical.” The Daily Beast disagreed, suggesting that it “may qualify as the earliest, most expensive Presidential campaign ad ever made.” Burnett and Trump have licensed the “Apprentice” format to dozens of other countries, and Burnett once noted that, increasingly, tycoons cast in the Trump role are “people with political aspirations.” At least half a dozen hosts have held political office, including João Doria, the governor-elect of São Paulo State, who is an ally of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s strongman President-elect. Last year, Kevin O’Leary, one of the hosts of “Shark Tank,” announced his intention of running for Prime Minister of Canada, as a member of the Conservative Party, noting that he and Trump had “both worked for Mark Burnett, and we both got famous on reality television.” Burnett joked to more than one person that he was no longer simply a TV producer but a producer of political leaders. (Four months later, O’Leary dropped out of the race and returned to the show.) For nearly two decades, Burnett has also spoken about his desire to make a television show with Vladimir Putin. In 2001, he sought to enlist Putin in a project called “Destination: Mir,” a reality competition in which the winner would be sent into space. The idea was scuttled after Russia decommissioned the Mir space station. In 2015, Burnett expressed an interest in building a reality show featuring Putin—not so much a program about politics, Burnett suggested, as a hymn to the glory of Russia, “the humans, the nature, the animals of the nation.” Burnett’s myopia about politics may be selective, but that does not mean it is feigned. He would hardly be the first Hollywood chieftain with a dim grasp of current events beyond Los Angeles, but even by industry standards he can seem remarkably disconnected. Shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, this past February, Burnett attended a regular meeting of television executives at M-G-M. At one point, someone mentioned the marketing plan for a project in the studio’s film division: a remake of “Death Wish,” starring Bruce Willis. The movie, about an armed vigilante, was unabashedly pro-gun—Breitbart eventually hailed it as an “N.R.A. Public Service Announcement.” Someone asked whether M-G-M would be altering the rollout of the film, in light of the shooting. “What shooting?” Burnett said, according to someone outside M-G-M who was briefed on the meeting. When his incredulous colleagues wondered how he could not have been aware of the Parkland massacre, Burnett said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” adding, “I’m not on social media.” For all Burnett’s talk about being nonpolitical, his reluctance to disavow the President may stem, in part, from a fear of alienating Trump’s constituents. Like Republican lawmakers or evangelical pastors, Burnett is beholden to a faction of the public that, in many instances, thinks the President can do no wrong. “The moment you go political, you turn half of the nation against you,” Rick Warren told me. “And, when you’re trying to reach as many people as you can, you don’t want to do that.” The dilemma is compounded, Warren pointed out, when the occupant of the White House is so vindictive. “You know the way this President chews up people?” Warren said. “There’s a fine line in what you can say.” Katherine Walker suggested that part of the reason Burnett seems so unfazed by the role he has played in the Trump saga may be that he is British. “There is something to being American and having these visceral reactions that Mark doesn’t have,” she said. “He just doesn’t get it on that level. I don’t think he has the same sense of Oh, my God, what have I done?” For many Americans, the Trump Presidency evokes a painful feeling of dispossession, as cherished norms and national institutions are eviscerated. “People are making it seem like Mark’s ignoring evil,” Walker continued. “But I think it’s more benign than that—and scarier, in a way. He doesn’t care. He just wants to stay out of it.” “Mark is extremely smart,” Richard Levak, the psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “The Apprentice,” told me. “Mark has an eye for casting, and he cast Donald Trump.” I asked Levak what kind of personality profile he might have prepared for Trump as a candidate for the show. He said he would have noted “the energy, the impulsiveness, the inability to articulate a complete thought because he gets interrupted by emotions, so when he speaks it’s all adjectives—‘great,’ ‘huge,’ ‘horrible.’ ” What made Trump so magnetic as a reality-television star was his impulse to transgress, Levak continued, and it is the same quality that has made a captive audience of the world. “That somebody can become that successful while also being that emotionally undisciplined—it’s so macabre that you have to watch it,” he said. “And you keep waiting for the comeuppance. But it doesn’t come.” There has likely never been a man who, in his own lifetime, has been as widely spoken and written about as Donald Trump. Politics has never been so spellbinding. “It’s the reason people watch a schoolyard fight,” Levak said. “It’s vicariously watching someone act out and get away with it.” Burnett once remarked that “Lord of the Flies” is so absorbing because all the characters are suddenly transported into a world in which “the rules are changed, and convention, law, and morality are suspended.” It’s an apt paraphrase of the Trump Presidency. On Sunday afternoons, Burnett likes to pour himself a generous glass of wine and stroll out onto the balcony of his seven-thousand-square-foot home, off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. He and Downey refer to the property, which was undamaged by the recent wildfires, as the Sanctuary. It is an exquisite spot, with white couches facing an unbroken view of the ocean. Burnett likes to reflect on the fact that his mansion is not far from one of the homes where, as a young immigrant, he worked as a nanny. He is on social media, as it happens. He seldom tweets, but he’s active on Instagram. Along with family snapshots and photographs of Burnett palling around with celebrities and religious figures, there are a couple of videos he has taken of himself relaxing on the balcony. “Lazy Sunday afternoon,” Burnett says in one of them. He is barefoot, wearing a T-shirt that says “SPIRITUAL GANGSTER.” He gestures at his expansive view, with undisguised satisfaction, and says, “Look at this. Wow.” He pans the camera across the sky, which is just starting to bruise red and violet in the twilight. “So grateful,” Burnett says. He often expresses wonderment at how blessed he is, and at the magnitude of his success—which, these days, he ascribes to “God’s favor.” When I remarked to Jonathon Braun that Burnett seems eerily untroubled by the legacy of his own creation, he said that, for Burnett, the Presidency was just another game. He went on, “I think it’s a game for Trump, too. It’s a game for the audience. I think the voters like it. They’re enjoying the spectacle. It’s in the soul of who Mark is. They’re kindred spirits. There are no major causes driving them—it’s just about playing a game and winning it.” Years ago, when Burnett did publicity for “Survivor,” interviewers tried to figure out how the contestants had fared that season. Of course, he could not reveal such secrets. So when they asked Burnett who would win the game, he told them, “Me.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House"" with guest host Elise Jordan examined on Thursday the political success the students achieved. ""The mass shooting at their high school in February marked a turning point in the gun safety debate, this year we saw over a million people protest during the march for our lives and many state legislatures passed stricter gun laws,"" Jordan reported. ""In further proof of the attitude shift, the NRA has seen its financial situation worsen in the era of Donald Trump."" For analysis, Jordan brought on Dave Cullen, the author of the book Columbine and the upcoming book Parkland. ""Did the Parkland kids change the equation when it comes to gun control in America?"" Foley asked. ""They totally changed it,"" he replied. ""I don't think the NRA has figured out what hit them and they still have not figured out what to do with these kids,"" he added. ""These Parkland students really are the heroes,"" MoveOn senior advisor Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""And so they were relentless,"" she continued. ""They became activists, politically involved and not only that, we had something else that played in their favor ... technology."" ""You have social media, that played a big role in this,"" she explained. Watch:  Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep.

288,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/pentagon-defeats-us-cities-appeal-gun-check-flaws-court/,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected an effort by New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco to require the Pentagon to do a better job of reporting service members who were disqualified from owning weapons to a national background check system. By a 3-0 vote, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia said judges lacked jurisdiction under the federal Administrative Procedure Act to compel the Department of Defense to fix what the cities called a “broken” reporting system, and supervise its progress. The cities sued seven weeks after a mass shooting on Nov. 5, 2017, when former Air Force member Devin Kelley killed 26 people at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church before killing himself. Kelley, 26, had been convicted in a 2012 court martial of assaulting his wife and stepson and should not have been allowed to possess weapons. But his conviction had not been entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The cities said the Pentagon had failed to report some 15,000 current or former military personnel who could not own guns because of court martial convictions or dishonorable discharges, and that this undermined their ability to fight violent crime. Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson acknowledged the challenges that cities and towns face in protecting the public from “horrific” violence that is “far too often” committed by people who should not have firearms. “The municipalities’ efforts to combat these threats are commendable,” Wilkinson wrote. “The APA, however, does not permit their efforts to include judicial supervision of the myriad programmatic workings of the federal government.” Spokesmen for New York’s and Philadelphia’s law departments had no immediate comment. San Francisco’s city attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the Pentagon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wednesday’s decision upheld an April 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Virginia. The case is City of New York et al v U.S. Department of Defense et al, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1699.

289,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/florida-sheriff-suspended-criticism-school-shooting/,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday suspended the local sheriff criticized for the police response to last year’s mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. DeSantis said Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel showed leadership failures in the shooting that left 14 students and three adults dead at the hands of a lone gunman on Feb. 14, 2018. “The massacre might never have happened had Broward had better leadership in the sheriff’s department,” DeSantis said during a news conference in Fort Lauderdale. In a report released last week, a state-appointed commission identified multiple failings in Israel’s agency’s response to the shooting. Israel, a Democrat, has served as the elected sheriff of the agency with 5,800 employees since 2013. Despite criticism of the shooting response, he has said he would continue to serve in his elected capacity, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. DeSantis, a Republican elected to the office in November and sworn in earlier this week, criticized the sheriff during his campaign and had signaled that he would have likely removed Israel from office. Some parents of students at the high school have criticized Israel and called for his removal. Some Broward County sheriff’s deputies held back too long as shots were fired at the school in the massacre, instead of rushing toward the gunfire, according to a 439-page report released last week by a state-appointed commission. Broward County Sheriff’s Office training on active shooters was inadequate, according to the report, which also recommended arming teachers and spending more on school security and mental health to prevent similar mass shootings. “My daughter would have lived if somebody could have just given her one more second,” said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was among the mass shooting victims.

290,https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/new-years-eve-party-times-square-cheer-press-freedom/,"Reporters will be the guests of honor at the New Year’s Eve party in New York’s Times Square on Monday, in what organizers said was a celebration of press freedom after an unusually deadly year for journalists at U.S. news outlets. Two attacks in particular weighed on organizers as they discussed in autumn whom to give the honor of initiating the ceremonial ball drop just before midnight, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. One was the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for the Washington Post and U.S. resident, inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. The other was the mass shooting in June in the newsroom of The Capital, a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, in which five employees were killed. “Throughout the year it’s been a big issue,” Tompkins said in an interview. “Times Square itself is the ultimate agora and public space,” noting that the area was named after the New York Times, and that it was a Times publisher, Adolf Ochs, who began the tradition of the ball drop in 1907. Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the Times Square Alliance approached his group because of “the perception that the journalism and journalists in particular are under threat and their role is being questioned.” Simon, who said he usually spends New Year’s Eve playing Scrabble with his wife in New Hampshire’s White Mountains, will be in the spotlight at the Times Square festivities, joining Mayor Bill de Blasio to launch the ball drop a minute before midnight. Simon will be joined onstage by an array of journalists from U.S. and international news outlets. The names were still being finalized on Friday, the Times Square Alliance said. The button-pressing honor has in previous years gone to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, an Iraq War veteran, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the singer Lady Gaga. The Times Square Alliance contacted Simon in November, Simon said, several weeks before Time magazine would devote their annual “Person of the Year” issue to several prominent journalists who have faced attacks and hostility. Among those journalists were Khashoggi, and Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters imprisoned by Myanmar for investigating how the country’s security forces killed members of the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority. U.S. President Donald Trump has become a vociferous critic of parts of the press, routinely chiding reporters and outlets he views as publishing “fake news,” calling them “the enemy of the people.” Simon said this was in the background of his discussions with the Times Square Alliance. “Unavoidably, Trump was the subtext, but not front and center,” he said. “We wanted to have a unifying message.” As a House select committee begins its investigation into the Capitol insurrection, a new ad from the conservative Lincoln Project targets corporations and CEOs who allegedly ""helped financed the very structure that led to the murderous violence on Jan. 6."" ""Who funds the politicians trying to cover up the assault on America's Capitol?"" the ad's narrator asks, following a clip of former president Donald Trump falsely claiming that insurrectionists were ""hugging and kissing the police.""        Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (WY) on Tuesday fired back at Republicans critical of her role in the commission to investigate Jan. 6, saying, ""This is absolutely not a game. This is deadly serious."" ""There are some in my party, including Leader McCarthy, who continue to act as though this is about partisan politics, I think it's really sad. I think it's a disgrace,"" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.    According to a report from Forbes, lawyers who brought lawsuits attacking the 2020 presidential election results in Michigan by alleging voter fraud are attempting to use Donald Trump's words to avoid sanctions. On the evening before House select committee opens hearings into the Jan 6th Capitol riot that was inspired by accusations that the election was stolen from Trump, the so-called ""Kraken"" attorneys, including one-time Trump attorney Sidney Powell, made a new filing.

292,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/republican-whines-stopped-debating-aoc-due-supporters-offensive-tweets-ignored-followers/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., just got into a heated Twitter debate with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., over questions of tax policy — although Scalise cut things short after Twitter users began ridiculing him for nearly dying during a mass shooting in 2017, even though his own supporters also posted insulting tweets. The online exchange began when Scalise, reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's proposal that the marginal tax rate be increased to 70 percent for Americans, tweeted, ""Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money Democrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs."" His tweet included a link to an article that described Ocasio-Cortez specifically calling for the tax hike to fund programs in a Green New Deal. This story first appeared on Salon.com. In her response, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to Scalise that ""you’re the GOP Minority Whip. How do you not know how marginal tax rates work? Oh that’s right, almost forgot: GOP works for the corporate CEOs showering themselves in multi-million?bonuses; not the actual working people whose wages + healthcare they’re ripping off for profit."" Her comment referenced the fact that her proposed tax increase would only apply to Americans who make more than $10 million each year. At this point Scalise drew attention to some of the inappropriate responses of people who seemed to be supporting Ocasio-Cortez in the exchange, including one who wrote ""snipe his ass,"" another who urged her to ""kick his cane"" and a third who praised her by saying ""she's got better aim than James Hodgkinson, that's for sure."" After citing these tweets, Scalise wrote ""Hi @AOC. Happy to continue this debate on the Floor of the People’s House, but it’s clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers. #StayClassy.""  That said, many of the responses to Ocasio-Cortez from Twitter users who seemed to agree with Scalise were deliberately disrespectful toward the congresswoman, with at least one also implying violence will occur if her policies were implemented. One person tweeted, ""Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Obviously you don't know how economic works. If you tax the wealthy Americans at 70% why would they want to stay in this country? The top 3% taxpayers already pay more than 50%. Look at what is going on in socialist countries in Europe? The people are rebelling!"" Another wrote, ""Its funny how we used to see how socialism does not work, but now that the elitists on the left want their power back, they need votes and so socialism is now a successful model."" Another Twitter user referred to Ocasio-Cortez as an ""economic imp,"" while a fourth person implied violence could result as a result of Ocasio-Cortez's proposal by tweeting that ""Here’s an idea, Taxation = Theft ....pretty sure we fought a war over taxes being levied against us before"" Scalise has not publicly expressed any objections to those tweets against Ocasio-Cortez. The Louisiana congressman survived a harrowing ordeal after he was nearly assassinated during a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. After returning to the House of Representatives, Scalise explained to ""60 Minutes"" that ""I found out later just how much damage was done internally. You know, I mean, my femur was shattered. The hip and pelvis had serious damage where the bullet went through and, you know, did some damage to areas that had to be shored up with steel plates and then they did a phenomenal job of rebuilding, you know, kind of the, rebuilding Humpty Dumpty. I mean, there were, there was a lot of damage inside that had to get fixed."" As a House select committee begins its investigation into the Capitol insurrection, a new ad from the conservative Lincoln Project targets corporations and CEOs who allegedly ""helped financed the very structure that led to the murderous violence on Jan. 6."" ""Who funds the politicians trying to cover up the assault on America's Capitol?"" the ad's narrator asks, following a clip of former president Donald Trump falsely claiming that insurrectionists were ""hugging and kissing the police.""

293,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/BINzAiHD2xY/,"The relentless news cycle lurched through the holidays, with an ongoing government shutdown and President Donald Trump's decision to suddenly pull troops from Syria in an apparent break with US allies. Nevertheless, there are reasons to have hope about the future of politics. Newsweek assembled the thoughts of former and future lawmakers and writers about why the American public shouldn't despair and where to go from here. Author Irshad Manji noted that media producers prioritize negative stories, and cautions that there needs to be more balance. “We in the media—because of our own need for eyeballs and clicks and profits—we’re not telling the healing stories,” said Manji. “We’re telling the stories of the conflicts. We need to hear both.” What follows are testimonials by Barack Obama, Stacy Abrams and others on how to actually make America great again, as Donald Trump has famously promised. Obama starts off, drawing inspiration from Robert F. Kennedy. ""Robert F. Kennedy knew a thing or two about hope,"" Obama writes.""Half a century ago, it was hope in the future, hope in people, hope in our capacity to do better, to be better, that spurred him to challenge a sitting president of his own party and challenge the conscience of a nation."" The 44th president observes that the world seemed steeped in chaos in the 1960s but Kennedy still projected hope. ""And through steel towns and crowded housing projects and windswept Native American reservations, Bobby reinvigorated an American spirit that was bruised and battered and still reeling from assassinations and riots and protests—and hatred,"" Obama notes. Obama singles out the qualities that allowed Kennedy to make Americans hopeful for the future. ""He argued for unity over division, for compassion over mutual suspicion, for justice over intolerance and inequality."" Obama then looks to hopeful developments in our current moment, like the activism of the Parkland students. ""It hasn’t even been a year since a mass shooting stole 17 lives at their school, but less than a month later those students had helped to raise the age to buy a rifle in Florida,"" Obama writes. ""They’d lengthened waiting periods before purchase. A couple of weeks after that, they’d inspired hundreds of thousands to march in the nation’s capital and all across the country. And, of course, they haven’t won every battle, but online, in the media, in the streets, on college campuses, they have become some of our most eloquent, effective voices against gun violence, he says ""And they are just getting started. Who knows what they’re going to do once they can actually rent a car?"" ""Ripples of hope. That’s the legacy, that’s the spirit, that Bobby Kennedy captured, standing on top of a beat-up car 50 years ago,"" he continues. ""Those are the ­descendants of the men and women and children who reached up into the sky, trying to get a touch of hope."" Stacy Abrams, who came close to becoming the first black female governor in America, writes that she's driven by the singular need to eradicate poverty. ""What do I want? Why do I want it? And how do I get it? My primary goal is to eradicate poverty; I believe it is immoral and a stain on our society,"" Abrams says. ""And so when I despair or get angry, I take the time to think about how I can best achieve that goal—and then I get to work."" She slams politicians who sow fear to get elected and says that instead, diversity should be celebrated. ""Too often, our fear is sowed from an idea that our diversity is a weapon or a weakness. We must instead realize that our diversity is our strength; it allows America to be the rich and enterprising nation we are,"" Abrams writes. Joe Kennedy III, grandson of Robert Kennedy, also speaks about fear. ""I wish it were easy to change human nature. Fear motivates, but hope does too,"" Kennedy writes. He points to the example of Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) who's persevered despite severe discrimination and violence. ""There is not an elected official who has been let down more often by people than he has—people who should know better and have his best interests at heart,"" Kennedy writes. ""He’s been arrested over 40 times and beaten and nearly killed. Yet he has lived, seen, fought and bled for the ability of the United States to change and become a more perfect union. There is value in that fight and pursuit."" The writer Irshad Manji dares readers to not instantly deride perceived ideological enemies. ""True story: A young hip-hop artist from Biloxi, Mississippi, wants the stars and bars in her state flag replaced by an inclusive and unifying design,"" Manji writes. ""She invites a supporter of the Confederate battle flag to her home, where they discuss his perspective. Soon after, he realizes that he cares more about defending her dignity than about preserving a symbol. He then stops flying his own Confederate battle flag. What sparked the transformation? Respect. The activist respected the flag-waver enough to engage rather than label him."" ""Here’s a courageous exercise that more of us could turn into a concrete habit: When you’re being disagreed with, ask not how you can change the other person’s mind; ask what you’re missing about the other person,"" she concludes. Other perspectives on hope come from actor and activist Don Cheadle, conservative writer Ben Shapiro, and historical Jill LePore. Read here. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney (WY) on Tuesday fired back at Republicans critical of her role in the commission to investigate Jan. 6, saying, ""This is absolutely not a game. This is deadly serious."" ""There are some in my party, including Leader McCarthy, who continue to act as though this is about partisan politics, I think it's really sad. I think it's a disgrace,"" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.

Former president Donald Trump's alleged efforts to get Justice Department officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election constitution an ""extraordinary circumstance"" and are not protected by executive privilege, the DOJ wrote in a letter this week. In the letter obtained by the New York Times, the DOJ advised officials who served in the Trump administration that they can give ""unrestricted testimony"" to committees investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, including the House panel that will meet for the first time Tuesday.

They fled gunmen in their high schools and prepared the dead for burial after a massacre inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. They broke barriers at a formerly all-male military academy. They brought political change to Utah and Minnesota and brought hay to fire-torn ranches in Oklahoma. In a chaotic year of natural disasters, mass shootings and political upheaval, these 18 people left indelible impressions on both our readers and journalists. These newsmakers — whether they sought media attention or a spotlight was cast on them because of a news event — are among the most memorable people we met in 2018. I met Brooke Harrison a few days after a gunman turned her freshman English class into a killing field. Classes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were resuming, and Brooke and her mother, Denise, allowed me to follow them through that first tremulous day back. Brooke is a sophomore now. She still lives in — and loves — Parkland. Though she was not among the students who immediately became activists, she has recently written op-ed pieces about school safety and gun laws, and in October she spoke at a Democratic Party event in Colorado. In one of her speeches, she explained why she is now so outspoken: “I’ve told anyone I can my story. For me, talking about it, sharing it, waking people up, has been the best therapy.” — JACK HEALY James Shaw Jr. was memorable because he did not want to be. By the time we met in Nashville in April, people were celebrating the soft-spoken man as a hero. The day before, he had stopped at a Waffle House for an All-Star Special — with cheese on the eggs, but no butter for the grits — before a man opened fire. Then, with America in the midst of yet another mass shooting, he wrestled the AR-15 away. Four people died. Officials believe the toll could have been far worse if not for Mr. Shaw. After the shooting, the electrician, who turned 30 Friday, helped raise more than $240,000 for victims. “You don’t want to have the spotlight for being a survivor when four people died,” Mr. Shaw told Nashville Scene, which named him its “Nashvillian of the Year.” But now he’s in the spotlight. Next year, he might run for mayor. — ALAN BLINDER Sarah Zorn can do more than 70 push-ups in two minutes. She holds black belts in three karate disciplines. There is much more about Ms. Zorn’s character, patriotism, intellect and leadership skill that impressed the Citadel enough to name her this year as the first female regimental commander — the top cadet — in the Southern military school’s 175-year history. But her physical prowess is an important part of her story. In 1995, the first woman to gain full admission to the Citadel, Shannon Faulkner, walked onto its Charleston, S.C., campus escorted by federal marshals. The Citadel community was, to put it mildly, not ready to accept a woman in its ranks. Ms. Faulkner was subjected to death threats and sexist slurs as she fought in the courts for the right to enroll in the public school. But Ms. Faulkner was also not ready for the Citadel. She suffered in the torrid heat during her first grueling day of training, and dropped out a week later. That fueled the argument, in some quarters, that the Citadel was no place for women. Of course, they were wrong — demonstrably so, thanks to Ms. Zorn, and measurably. — RICHARD FAUSSET Wilfred Jones met me on a cold winter day in a part of San Juan County, Utah, that sits within the Navajo Nation. Days before, a federal judge had ruled that officials had been illegally diluting the Native American vote for decades, a decision that meant Navajo people might win two of three county commission seats. Mr. Jones had been a plaintiff in the case, and his story foretold two of this year’s major themes: Battles over ballot box access not only continued, but became fiercer in a climate of division and tight races. And amid those fights, Native people across the country made historic political gains. This fall, two states elected the nation’s first Native American congresswomen, and another elected its first Native American lieutenant governor. And in San Juan County, voters elected a majority Navajo commission, the first in its history. — JULIE TURKEWITZ The wildfire was still simmering. Hundreds of thousands of acres of Oklahoma prairie had been charred. And Lori White was traversing the county in her pickup truck, helping coordinate hay deliveries for ranchers who had lost even more than she had. Traveling from story to story, I see my share of fresh tragedy and raw pain. But from wherever I report, whether in this country’s most sprawling cities or most remote towns, I find people like Ms. White who are doing the quiet work of putting things back together. Happily, it sounds like normalcy is returning to Oklahoma. When I spoke to Ms. White this month, she said the grass had come back, her cattle had returned to once-blackened pastures and workers were replacing the final section of the roughly 15 miles of perimeter fencing that she lost in the fire. “Except for the burned trees,” she said, “you wouldn’t think anything happened.” — MITCH SMITH The early details were grim enough. A tourist boat in Branson, Mo., sank, killing 17 of the 31 people on board. It got worse when details emerged that nine members of one family had died. And I practically got sick to my stomach when I saw a portrait of that family, the Colemans. They were black mothers and fathers, infants and elders. They looked like they could have been my family. It is impossible to fathom what it means to have three generations wiped out. Tia Coleman lost her husband, her three children, four in-laws and a nephew. How do you start over after something like that? How do you even want to continue to live? A reporter asked Ms. Coleman if she was happy she made it out alive. “I don’t know yet,” she said. — JOHN ELIGON The day after Hurricane Michael tore through the Florida Panhandle, Gene Bearden, 76, sat alone on top of a picnic table at an R.V. park in Panacea, Fla. Most residents had fled ahead of the Category 4 storm, but Mr. Bearden felt he couldn’t go. He had been stuck for years without a valid driver’s license. A sheriff’s deputy wrote him a note to let him drive his white pickup truck into the next town for the night. Then Mr. Bearden returned to the patch of land he calls home. His food had spoiled. His camper was mostly wrecked. Drinking water was scarce. Mr. Bearden, a military veteran with prostate cancer, seemed resigned to his fate. He became a symbol of the struggling people who are so often forgotten in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has tried to contact Mr. Bearden to sort out his license. But he does not have a phone, and the agency has been unable to help him. The manager of the R.V. park, though, said this month that Mr. Bearden is still there, still in Panacea, and like the rest of the Panhandle, still holding on. — PATRICIA MAZZEI For decades, a serial killer and rapist had eluded capture in California. Nearing retirement and frustrated with the endless false starts and dead ends, Detective Paul Holes had a final Hail Mary plan to upload a DNA sample from a 1980s homicide to a genealogy website. In April, after working with genealogists to identify a perpetrator through distant relatives, the police in Sacramento arrested Joseph DeAngelo, who had been living quietly for years in a tidy suburb. They charged him as the so-called Golden State Killer, who had terrorized communities up and down California in the 1970s and 1980s. While it was an ensemble act, Mr. Holes, an investigator with the Contra Costa County district attorney’s office, is credited with cracking the case. And he has not gone quietly into retirement. The fame he earned from solving the case has turned him into a media star. He recently inked a deal with the television network Oxygen to produce true crime documentary shows. — TIM ARANGO In a news-drunk age, with outrage often following calamity, it’s worth spending time with somebody like Alan Fields, whom I met while reporting a story about convicted felons seeking pardons from an administration that has taken a celebrity game show approach to granting clemency. In the early 1990s, Mr. Fields pleaded guilty, but served no time, for his role as a drug courier, a minor player in a kingpin’s empire. He moved to the Detroit suburbs, married a doctor, earned a decent living, volunteered in his community. But he is hardly a free man. With a felony on his record, career paths are closed off; he can’t even coach his son’s Little League team. He began seeking a pardon years ago, unaware that he was living in an historically pardon-stingy stretch of presidential administrations. Listening to the disheartened but thoughtful Mr. Fields, his fate resting on the whims of various presidents, was a sober reminder: News as daily spectator sport is a luxury, for those lucky enough to be mere spectators. — CAMPBELL ROBERTSON The night I first met Rome Shubert, he still had a bandage on the back of his neck protecting the spot where a bullet had grazed his head. Hours earlier, he had fled from his art class at Santa Fe High School while a student shot indiscriminately throughout the campus, killing 10. The next day, he and his teammates on the varsity baseball team insisted on putting on their uniforms and playing in a regional quarterfinals game. Now a 17-year-old junior, Rome knows he could have been killed or paralyzed by that one bullet, but he does not want the shooting to be what defines his life. He’s still a pitcher on the varsity baseball team and has a verbal commitment to attend and play baseball for the University of Houston after he graduates in 2020. He barely notices the scar below his left ear. “It brought me down for just about a week, and then I just battled through it,” Rome said. — MANNY FERNANDEZ For decades, Rabbi Daniel Wasserman has led Pittsburgh’s Orthodox chevra kadisha, a Jewish burial society that guards and ritually prepares bodies after death. Traditionally, members of the burial society do not speak about what they see, instead working anonymously. When I first spoke with Rabbi Wasserman the day after 11 Jews were killed while attending Shabbat prayer services at the Tree of Life synagogue, it was clear he felt compelled to talk. In the initial days after the October shooting, Rabbi Wasserman told me could not cry because thinking about his emotions would overwhelm and paralyze him. But once the work was complete, he encouraged each member of the group to speak to a mental health professional, and he took his own advice. “Thank God, you move forward, other lives move forward” he said. “There are births and bar mitzvahs, marriages and funerals,” of the routine sort, far different from the ones that gripped his community in October. — JENNIFER MEDINA Dean Phillips, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Minnesota, and I met at his campaign headquarters in an affluent, quaint town on the edge of a lake. In a polarized era, Mr. Phillips, stuck out for his cheerful campaign slogan: “Everyone’s invited.” He put out a message that people — not big money — should fuel politics. Mr. Phillips, who owns a chain of coffee shops and is heir to the Phillips liquor fortune, refused to accept political action committee money of any sort. He won his race, and so far remains committed to not accepting special interest money. “I think I’m the only member of Congress who took it that far,” he said. — FARAH STOCKMAN Clutching a pink rose and covered in blankets, Patty Saunders, 89, was cheerful and engaging — a remarkable demeanor given her harrowing escape from the worst wildfire in California’s history. Ms. Saunders, 89, struck me as a symbol of both the hardiness and the exhaustion of Californians during a year when the world around them felt so precarious. Ms. Saunders, an actor in the 1950s and 1960s who had bit parts in several movies, now lives with a couple who took her in after the mobile home she rented was destroyed. She attributes her survival to her faith and the prayers she said in the car as it drove through tunnels of flames. — THOMAS FULLER When we checked in with Gov. Jerry Brown just before Christmas last year, we spent more than an hour at the governor’s mansion talking about the end. That is, the end of Mr. Brown’s 50 years in public life. He had a year left before retirement, and wanted to talk about what was left to do. He was unable to cement two big projects on his final-year bucket list: a high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles and twin water tunnels in the Sacramento Delta. And the housing crisis has only grown worse in this last year, and will be handed off to his successor, his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom. Still, Mr. Brown is leaving with high marks from the public. California’s economy is humming, and Mr. Newsom will inherit a huge budget surplus, compared to the deficit Mr. Brown found eight years ago. He has emerged as a leader in the fight against climate change and President Trump. And now, Mr. Brown is off to his family ranch in the hills of Northern California. — ADAM NAGOURNEY Brandie Wilson runs the Humboldt Area Center for Harm Reduction in Eureka, Calif, which provides a needle exchange program and health referrals for people struggling with addiction. When we met in March, she had already become a lightning rod in the community, a rural town along the Redwood Highway wrestling with a severe addiction crisis. Many of the area’s most vulnerable people counted on her for support and guidance. But critics felt her activism was enabling addiction rather than solving it, and she was blamed for a needle litter problem in town. Ms. Wilson was quoted in a story I wrote about the intersection of homelessness and heroin addiction in Northern California. The story “really demanded that our community talk about this and talk about it in a real, ongoing, and sustainable way,” she recently said. “There were a lot of people in our community who said, ‘Thank you for saying what you said.’” — JOSE A. DEL REAL Troubled by evidence that the field of human genetics was being hijacked by white supremacists, the traveling lecturer John Novembre began showing a photograph of white nationalists chugging milk and proclaiming that lactose tolerance is proof of a white genetic identity. (In fact, though the trait is especially common among people of European ancestry, it evolved in East Africa.) Dr. Novembre, a professor at the University of Chicago, told me that he worried about drawing attention to how his field’s work is being misappropriated. Little is known about the genetic underpinnings of intelligence and behavior, much less how varying environments and cultures may have influenced them. “But I also worry about not talking about it,” he said. — AMY HARMON Scot Peterson, an armed sheriff’s deputy in Parkland, Fla., who failed to rush inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a gunman fired upon students, was named the Coward of Broward and quickly became the fall guy for one of the nation’s worst school shootings. But 10 months later, it is clear that many other mistakes may have contributed to the massacre. A draft state report found that in addition to Mr. Peterson, several deputies stayed outside the school as shots were fired. The F.B.I. admitted  bungling a tip that predicted Mr. Cruz could become a school shooter. And some say blame also lies with state lawmakers whose past defeat of legislative restrictions allowed Mr. Cruz to buy his assault weapon despite profound concerns about his stability. Mr. Peterson, facing a lawsuit from a grieving parent, has apologized. His lawyer won’t say where he is living, but at last report he was screening visitors from behind a sheet on his front door. — RICHARD OPPEL JR. Each morning, Igor Gavrish walks through three locked doors and scans his iris twice to get into the Boston University laboratory where he works. While the authorities have decided the 24-year-old Russian immigrant can be trusted to work with some of the world’s deadliest viruses, he cannot pass a background check to enlist in the United States Army. He joined the Army through a program that offered legal immigrants with needed language or medical skills a fast track to citizenship in exchange for military service. But the program’s vetting system is so strict that it has rejected people like Mr. Gavrish, who called home regularly or have parents who work as teachers or government clerks. He may eventually be deported to Russia, where he could be punished for trying to join the Army. “I’m afraid to go back,” he said. — DAVE PHILIPPS Advertisement",2018-12-28 10:00:28,18 Memorable People We Met Across the Country in 2018 - The New York Times,"education and schools,news and news media",1,http://nytimes.com
