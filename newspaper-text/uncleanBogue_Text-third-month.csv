The Little Rock Workforce Development Board was given the money to establish the Rock City Reentry Program, which is is part of the Little Rock for Life campaign announced last month by Mayor Mark Stodola in a response to a mass shooting at a nightclub that left 28 injured. The money will create a network of services and training sites to help 150 adults re-enter society, the release stated. Arkansas has one of the fastest-growing prison populations in the country, in part because so many prisoners commit new crimes after their release, the city said. The program hopes to end that cycle by providing newly released prisoners with counseling, mentorship and training in new fields. In the release, Dobbie Brown, who participates in another Little Rock re-entry program, said he is now working at Interstate Signways at the Little Rock Port Authority. “You can break the chain by keeping programs like this alive and making them grow,” he was quoted as saying. “A lot of people just need a chance after they mess up and do their time and come home. You just need a chance.” The project is one of 23 across the country receiving funding from the U.S. Department of Labor. The department announced its plan to spend $72 million on employment opportunities for ""justice-involved individuals"" in June. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

4,https://newrepublic.com/article/143633/handshake-why-yousef-muslet-face-life-prison-everyday-gesture,"On the Sunday before Christmas, in 2015, Hal Howard was pulling away from a party at his pastor’s house when he saw, standing in the street in front of him, a little girl. Howard slowed his pickup truck to a stop and tooted his horn. The girl didn’t move. At the same time, the girl’s father, Yousef Muslet, was playing with one of his sons on their front lawn. Muslet’s house sits opposite the pastor’s, in a prim, suburban neighborhood of Belle Glade, Florida. When Howard began honking at his daughter, Muslet walked up to the truck and introduced himself. The conversation between Howard and Muslet was brief, no more than five minutes. At one point, near the end, the two men shook hands. Finally, Muslet gathered up his children and headed inside. As Howard drove away, his friend Pat Lucey, who was sitting in the passenger seat, wished Muslet a merry Christmas. Nine days later, Muslet was at home, talking on the phone with his accountant, when he heard a knock at his door. He opened it to find a half-dozen deputies from the Palm Beach County sheriff’s department. A deputy asked Muslet if he recalled a discussion from the previous week, one in which he had mentioned Allah. Muslet replied that he had a lot of conversations and he talked about Allah a lot. Then Hal Howard appeared on his sidewalk. He pointed at Muslet. “That’s the guy,” he said. Another deputy stepped forward with handcuffs and informed Muslet that he was under arrest. He was placed in a police car and taken to jail. Earlier that afternoon, Howard had walked into the sheriff’s department and told the deputy on duty that he was afraid. His talk with Muslet had left him deeply unsettled. His concern, he said, centered on the handshake. As Howard told it, Muslet had gripped his hand forcefully and yanked his arm, as if trying to pull him through the driver’s side window. Howard, who was 75, struggled to let go, but Muslet had overpowered him. According to a police report, Howard said that Muslet “had a strange look on his face during the entire encounter.” Muslet also yelled “Allah! Praise Allah!” which left Howard even more frightened. After a half-minute of grappling, Howard was finally able to pry his hand free and speed away. Given his age and Muslet’s strength, Howard felt lucky he hadn’t suffered more than a sore shoulder. At first, worried that he was overreacting, he hesitated to report the incident. But more than a week later, at the urging of family and friends, he decided to tell the police. Muslet was charged with two felonies: battery on an elderly person and burglary. (Under Florida law, burglary includes unlawfully entering a vehicle with the intention of committing a crime.) Muslet had lived in Belle Glade since he was twelve. Now 51, he owned a local clothing store with his brothers. His criminal record showed nothing more serious than speeding tickets. The handshake with Howard, Muslet insisted, had seemed friendly. Yet if he was found guilty of both charges, he faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. The handshake, it is said, was a ritual conceived in mistrust, for the purpose of making peace. Its origin dates at least to classical antiquity, when Greek foot soldiers joined palms to demonstrate they carried no weapons. Gradually, shaking hands evolved into a ceremonial greeting between strangers. The gesture, though, never quite lost its hint of threat. President Trump, whose grasp is unabashedly combative, has managed to bring the act full circle, transforming a sign of unity into a new form of warfare. When I meet Hal Howard outside his trailer in February, the first thing he does, naturally, is present his hand. “The proper handshake,” writes Emily Post, “is made briefly; but there should be a feeling of strength and warmth in the clasp.” By this definition, Howard’s is textbook. His demeanor, though, is reticent, almost stoic. He has light blue eyes, sun-mottled skin, and thin, white hair, high and tight, as he’s kept it since his Army days. On his right index finger he wears a big, gold ring marked with a Latin cross—“just to let people know where I stand.” Howard drives me in his truck, a shiny, white Dodge Ram 1500, to a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts. He lives in Clewiston, a town over from Belle Glade. Both are in the heart of sugar country, surrounded by acres of cane fields. During the harvest season, the fields are regularly set on fire. Burning off the plant’s leaves—known, in the industry, as the “trash”—eases access to its sucrose-rich stalk, which is then cut off and trucked to a mill for processing. In the distance, as we drive, a sloppy cloud of brown smoke rises from a vast sea of green. Above the flames, a cauldron of raptors hovers, waiting to snatch up fleeing rabbits and rats. When I mention Clewiston’s motto—“America’s Sweetest Town”—Howard frowns. “That’s a lie,” he says. “They get that sugar cookin’, it smells like a pig farm.” As we sip coffee, Howard, who is originally from Kentucky, tells me he used to own a construction business in Fort Lauderdale. Now, in his retirement, he stocks shelves at the local supermarket. He lives a simple, abstemious existence, the orbit of which encircles his church. For two decades, Howard has sworn off liquor, cigarettes, women, and other fleshly temptations. His chief indulgences are watching television and washing his truck. It was at a church in Clewiston that he met Pat Lucey—“my Christian brother.” Howard, a divorcee, and Lucey, a widower, quickly became close. The two men now share a trailer and a dog, a Chihuahua–German Shepherd mix named Mr. Whitey. In 2015, the church in Clewiston suffered a schism, and Howard joined some of the congregation in defecting to another, in Belle Glade. He had only known his new preacher for a couple of months when he attended his party. Howard had stayed for an hour, nibbling on finger foods, then left with Lucey, filled with the Christmas spirit. He was surprised when Muslet approached his truck, but he only got nervous when Muslet began discussing religion. “At first, I thought he just wanted to talk to somebody,” Howard tells me. “But then, as the conversation went on, I realized he was trying to get into my Christianhood.” According to Howard, one of the first things Muslet asked him was the name of his god. He readily replied that his lord and savior was Jesus Christ. This didn’t seem to satisfy Muslet, who continued to pepper him with questions about his faith. After a minute, Howard realized that Muslet is not actually Christian—he’s Muslim. At one point, he even offered to share the tenets of his own faith with Howard’s fellow parishioners. “He said he would like to come to our church and teach everybody how to be a Muslim,” Howard recalls, incredulous. “I said, ‘Well, you’re welcome to come to church, but we don’t want to hear anything about a Muslim. We believe in Jesus.’ ” The longer the conversation went on, Howard says, the louder and angrier Muslet got. Howard wanted to leave, but Muslet’s daughter was still blocking his way. When Muslet finally extended his hand, Howard took it eagerly, hoping the talk was drawing to a close. The violence of the handshake—and what he saw as Muslet’s evident sadism—shocked him. “The whole time, he’s laughing and smiling,” Howard says. “Got a big smile on his face. And that really turned a button on me.” As they struggled, Howard kept telling Muslet to let go. Howard thought about hitting him, but he was strapped in his seatbelt and his left arm was pinned to his side. “I called him a choice name or two,” he says. “It’s hard to be a Christian when you’re being mistreated.” Finally, Muslet backed away, leaving Howard’s shoulder throbbing. Howard was mad. Still, he told himself he was making too much of it. It was only after he discussed the encounter with his sons and his co-workers at the supermarket that he changed his mind. Muslet, they warned, could be dangerous. Ultimately, Howard says, he went to the police out of fear that Muslet might hurt someone else. I ask Howard whether Muslet’s being Muslim had anything to do with his decision to report the incident to police. “Before you go to the wrong place,” he says, “I don’t hate Muslims. And I can prove I don’t. Because, for the last three years, my doctor was a Muslim. And I love the man.” Not long ago, Howard contracted throat cancer—a common affliction, he says, in smoke-choked Clewiston. Friends recommended a Palestinian doctor named Abdel Kaki, who has won Howard’s trust through sound medical advice and a patient bedside manner. While Howard has no objection to “plain” Muslims—“the ones that come here to be part of America”—he believes the “radical” ones need to be watched. Dr. Kaki, for example, is a plain Muslim, an upstanding citizen and asset to the community. “I think,” Howard says, “he might actually be a Christian Muslim.” Based on his encounter with Muslet, though, Howard guesses that he’s probably a radical Muslim. “You can tell ’em by what they do, the way they act,” Howard says. “If they’re against Christians, that’s a pretty good sign.” I ask Howard where he gets his information about radical Muslims. He motions with his cup to a television mounted above my head. I turn and see that it’s tuned to Fox News. “That’s my channel,” he says. Before we part, Howard asks me if I go to church. I say I was raised Episcopalian, but am now agnostic. He looks alarmed. “You need to go to church,” he says. “I’ll be real truthful with you. He’s coming real soon. Read the Bible. Everything in Revelations is happening now.” The culture, Howard says, growing animated, has lost God. The signs are everywhere. A corrupt government. Gay marriage. Kids killing parents. Nearly naked women broadcast on network television. Salvation-wise, it’s now or never. Howard tells me that for many years, he lived in sin—“I did my thing, not God’s thing.” Then, in his early fifties, he had an affair with a married woman. The Lord did not approve. Howard tried to end it, but one day, the woman called him again. Howard knew, in his heart, he shouldn’t see her, but he went anyway. As soon as he got home, his blood pressure shot up to 192 over 90, and it stayed like that for a week. Then God came to Howard, in his mind. The blood pressure spike, the Lord said, had been a warning. He put matters plainly: Howard was going to do God’s thing now. “Yeah, He’s real,” Howard says, fingering his gold ring. “And He’s going to hurt me if I don’t do what He says.” After seeing Howard, I drive to the other, more famous side of Palm Beach County—the Mar-a-Lago side—to an event at the Royal Palm Yacht & Country Club in Boca Raton. Inside the club’s vast ballroom, a capacity crowd of mostly elderly couples sit at white linen banquet tables, snacking on canapés. At the front stands a handsome, polished man in his late forties, wearing a crisp, blue blazer with an American flag pin. Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser is a practicing physician who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, but he enjoys a second career as a political commentator on radical Islam who appears frequently on Fox News. Taking the podium, Jasser compares the religion of Islam to a sick patient in need of urgent care. Terrorism, he says, is just a symptom of this disease. The bigger threat is ideological. Islamists—those who practice “political Islam”—don’t believe in a separation between mosque and state. Instead, they advocate the adoption of Koranic law, or sharia. Political Islam, Jasser says, sends adherents down a “conveyor belt” of radicalization. He cites the Tsarnaev brothers, who bombed the Boston marathon, as an example of the danger in assuming Muslims are peaceful without interrogating their beliefs. “The narrative about them is that they appeared to be normal American Muslims,” Jasser says. “How do you know they were normal? Do we know what they believed about the state, about the Constitution? No. The fact that they had a cell phone, or drove a motorcycle, or were trying to make the Olympics—that doesn’t make them normal.” According to the most recent estimates, Muslims make up approximately 1 percent of the U.S. population. In Palm Beach County, they are more than twice that. Whether in spite of, or because of, the local demographics, Palm Beach has become one of America’s most concentrated hotbeds of anti-Islamic sentiment. Until 2013, the county was represented in Congress by Allen West, a former Army officer who denounces all of Islam as a “totalitarian theocratic political ideology.” The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified three groups in Palm Beach County that espouse anti-Muslim views—including Citizens for National Security, the organization that is hosting Jasser’s appearance at the yacht club. Founded in 2008, the group believes that thousands of Muslims are seeking to infiltrate American institutions to undermine them from within, and that the Tsarnaev brothers were radicalized by a pro-Islam bias in their history textbooks. In a recent YouTube video, the group warns of a new “breeding ground for homegrown terrorists that few are aware of—American classrooms!” As the sociologist Christopher Bail traces in his 2015 book, Terrified, organizations like Citizens for National Security have spread rapidly since the attacks on September 11—funded, in his estimate, by at least $245 million in donations, much of it “dark money” from private, right-wing foundations. The money has been used to bankroll an army of dubiously credentialed experts, who argue that Muslims are waging a “stealth jihad” against democratic institutions. In this mind-set, requests by Muslims for basic religious accommodation—foot baths at airports, say, or designated prayer rooms at work—are understood as covert attempts to implement sharia. Left unchecked, such incursions would, they fear, eventually usurp the U.S. Constitution. The influence of these groups has helped, in little more than a decade, to fundamentally reshape American views of Islam. In a poll conducted in 1993, nearly two-thirds of Americans had no opinion, favorable or unfavorable, of Muslims. By 2011, a majority looked at Islam unfavorably. In one poll, only a third of Americans considered Muslims in the United States to be “trustworthy.” Ten state legislatures have passed bills banning sharia, and hate crimes against Muslims have reached a level not seen since 2001. A few weeks before Muslet’s arrest, a 27-year-old man was charged with vandalizing an Islamic center in North Palm Beach. Last November, a mosque in Boynton Beach was defaced with the words FUCK ISLAM. Jasser differs from much of Fox’s commentariat in that he is a practicing Muslim, one who has positioned himself as a Luther-like reformer, promoting a “spiritual,” apolitical interpretation of his faith. In his opinion, many Muslim-American groups are, in fact, fronts for political Islam. In Boca Raton, he repeats again and again that his criticisms are not aimed at Islam as a whole, but at a certain, unspecified percentage of its adherents. The crowd seems fully with him; when a woman with long blond hair asks Jasser why he doesn’t just convert to Christianity or Judaism, she is roundly booed. At the same time, Jasser’s logic suggests that every Muslim American must be viewed as an existential threat until demonstrated otherwise. The morning after Jasser’s talk, Fox News carries a short article noting that an arsonist has set fire to a mosque in Tampa—the second such case in Florida in six months. On the radio, two local talk show hosts, after reviewing a new Mediterranean restaurant—“I wasn’t in love with the baklava”—chat matter-of-factly about the Obama administration’s infiltration by Muslim extremists. One of Yousef Muslet’s attorneys described his client to me as a “visible Muslim.” As I watch Muslet pull up in front of the Belle Glade mosque a few minutes before Friday prayer, I have a hard time believing that Hal Howard had mistaken him, even momentarily, for a brother in Christ. Muslet wears a blinding white thawb and a multicolored keffiyeh; his face is dominated by a colossal salt-and-pepper beard, dense and impeccable, like topiary. When Muslet sees me, he bounds up and, forgoing a handshake entirely, engulfs me in a bear hug. In Muslet’s version of his encounter with Hal Howard, the handshake was an attempt to defuse a tense situation. “I offered my hand in peace, bro,” he tells me. Muslet was born in Palestine but aggressively inhaled the idiom and drawled speech of his teenage years in Florida. This seeming mismatch has a disarming effect on strangers. “People sometimes get nervous when they see me,” he says. “But when I start talking, they usually calm down.” As Muslet remembers it, when Howard started yelling at his daughter to get out of the street, Muslet had sought to soothe him. “I’m like, ‘Just chill.’ The way he was trying to rush out of there, and my kids are playing in the street? You can’t be driving through a neighborhood like that. Bottom line? I was a concerned father.” Muslet denies being upset when he approached the truck, though he does admit, as Howard alleged, to bringing up religion. After learning that Howard was coming from his neighbor’s Christmas party, Muslet asked him a question he likes to ask a lot of non-Muslims. “I asked him, ‘What’s God’s name?’ And he said ‘Jesus.’ And I said, ‘OK, but isn’t Jesus the son?’ And he said, ‘Yeah.’ ‘OK,’ I said, ‘so, what’s the father’s name? What’s God’s name?’ And he says, ‘Well, uh, God.’ And I said, ‘No, no, no—God is who he is. But what’s his name? Because I’ve learned his name, and I would like to share it with you.’ ” Muslet then revealed to Howard that God’s real name is Allah. “And Hal says, ‘Well, my lord and savior is Jesus Christ.’ ” I ask Muslet why he decided, at that precise moment, to try to educate a 75-year-old Southern Baptist—one fresh from a Christmas party at his preacher’s house, no less—about Islam. Muslet says he saw the encounter as a “teaching moment.” Everyone, he explained, worships the same God. Giving dawah—inviting people into Islam—is an important part of his faith. At the mosque, Muslet introduces me to two of his sons—he has ten children in total, six with his current wife—and a man named Wayne Rawlins, whom he considers his best friend and spiritual mentor. Rawlins—a tall, lanky black man with a loose, goofy smile—is the author of a book about Islam that Muslet found enormously inspirational. “Wayne’s the power, man,” Muslet says. “Me? I go more on impulse. But Wayne, he has a plan for everything.” After ablutions, we follow several dozen men into the mosque’s prayer hall. Muslet and Rawlins are the only people, besides the imam, wearing robes; the other men, wilting in the late-winter heat, favor khakis and short-sleeve shirts. As the imam delivers a brief sermon about the importance of being steadfast and straight in your faith—interrupted occasionally by the faint beep of a smoke detector—Muslet and Rawlins sit just in front of the lectern, staring up, eyes alight, like keen students, as Muslet’s children slouch against them. When the imam finishes, Muslet stands and faces the congregation. Seeking to become more involved in civic affairs, he is running for city commissioner. “Guys,” Muslet says, “some folks are going around whispering that there’s a Muslim running for commissioner. Well, it’s true and, man, it’s a good thing. Belle Glade needs Muslim leadership. Some of you might not want to be part of a corrupt system, but it’s a Muslim’s job to lead. So make sure to get to the polls, vote, and get me in that seat!” Like a true politician, he then invites everyone to help themselves to free food—halal chicken. Leaving the mosque, Muslet drives to work. That day, he and his two brothers are opening a new clothing store called Krave, located in the city’s humble downtown. Outside, on the street, a chef flips halal burgers and a DJ booms Kodak Black songs out of refrigerator-size speakers, as young men muster under shady awnings, waiting for the doors to open. A new clothing store is an event in Belle Glade. The closest mall is 35 miles away, and the town’s main commercial strip—a grim mix of storefront churches, pop-up tax refund shops, and dimly lit discount stores—has seen better days. When the Muslet family arrived from Palestine in the 1970s, the area was flush with money from the sugar industry, and the Muslets opened a department store catering to the Jamaican workers shipped in to cut cane. In the early 1990s, the cutting became automated, devastating the local economy. Soon, Belle Glade boasted the nation’s second-highest rate of violent crime. Adjusting to the changing times, the Muslets opened a street-wear boutique called Addiction; Krave, just across the street, specializes in high-end sneakers. Both stores are decorated past the point of functionality, like ornamented temples. Inside Addiction, a giant, two-story trompe-l’oeil mural mimics the wall of a New York City brick tenement, while in Krave, the entire floor has been designed to look like an aubergine-colored cosmos, stippled with stars, planets, and wispy nebulae. Observed from Belle Glade, both realms feel equally distant. As customers stream into the store, Muslet’s brothers, Faisal and Adam, work the register, while his mother, an octogenarian in a long, black robe, sits in a folding chair by the door, sipping a Coke and worrying a string of prayer beads. Muslet, who has changed out of his thawb into strategically ripped jeans and a white t-shirt bearing the graffitied Krave logo, bounces around the store, tending to customers. A former football player and track star at Glades Central Community High—his nickname was “the Arabian Horse”—he still retains an athlete’s lazy grace. Many of his clientele he has known for years, and he greets them with a brotherly clinch or a dap. The DJ’s hype man, Charles Askew, tells me he has known Muslet his entire life. He admires the fact that the Muslet brothers always hire in the community, usually from among their customers. A few months before, a Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputy—one of the officers who arrested Muslet—had shot and killed a young black man. Muslet and his brothers had attended a march in the victim’s honor. “That spoke volumes,” Askew says. “They could sell us clothes, go home to a big old house, not care what’s actually happening here. But they don’t do that.” I want to ask Muslet more about his case, but every time I try to talk with him, he gets interrupted by requests from customers or employees. At one point, I find him in the back of Addiction, behind a shelf of cargo shorts. He and Wayne Rawlins are kneeling on unfolded polo shirts, murmuring prayers. Nothing about Muslet suggests a propensity for violence. Nor does he seem to meet Howard’s definition of radicalism. Muslet is both hopelessly American and an asset to his community. He appears to embody everything the United States asks of its immigrants. As an entrepreneurial young man, he co-owned two profitable gas stations in northern Virginia, with his eyes on acquiring more. He wore snakeskin cowboy boots and coached his son’s T-ball team, the Exxon Tigers. Then, in 1999, he and his first wife took a vacation to Myrtle Beach. One sunny afternoon, as Muslet was nudging a rubber inner tube into the water, it dawned on him that he was unprepared for death. “I suddenly wondered, ‘What if a wave came over me right now?’ ” he recalls. “I was happy, but I wasn’t ready to die, man. So, I said, ‘OK, Allah, just get me back to shore and I’ll live the rest of my life for you.’ ” Safely delivered, Muslet sat on the sand and thought about all the people who had ever hurt him. He asked Allah to forgive them. Then, he thought of all the blessings—family, money, America—the Almighty had bestowed on him. Finally, he began to think of all the bad things he’d ever done, every person he’d ever wronged, and asked Allah to forgive him. All at once, he was visited by a breathtaking sense of relief. He arose and walked into the ocean, and there, out past the sunbathers and the paddleboarders and the beer-bong enthusiasts, he felt, for the first time in his life, truly clean. Muslet was not, up to that point, a devout Muslim. He smoked Marlboro Lights and drank cranberry vodka and had once impregnated a woman to whom he was not married. (“Guys who wore robes?” he says. “You know what I used to call them? Taliban.”) After his saltwater baptism, he immediately set about making some changes. For starters, he explained to his wife, who was wearing a bikini, that she was dressed inappropriately. (“They call it a bathing suit,” he says. “But my wife was basically in her underwear.”) Muslet was excited to share his spiritual awakening with his partner, but she didn’t seem to get it. Two days later, on the drive back to Virginia, she asked for a divorce. When he got home, Muslet took the Koran off his fireplace and began reading it. His taste for alcohol and cigarettes left him. Dressed in a Nike sweat suit and Nautica boots, he got into his Toyota Supra and headed west. For almost 40 days, he drove around the country, reading the Koran at night and giving dawah during the day. Then he moved back to Belle Glade, joined the family business, and became involved in the local Muslim community. Muslet grew out his beard, adopted the habit of wearing a thawb, and married a woman who loved Islam as much as he did. Then, in 2014, he met Wayne Rawlins. Their bond, Muslet says, was instantaneous. Rawlins had written a book titled America 2064: Islam in America Over the Next 50 Years. For Muslet, it felt like the perfect embodiment of his own philosophy of Islam. “It was the book I had always dreamed of writing,” he says. America 2064 begins with a short biography of its author. Rawlins, it notes, served as a consultant for the Justice Department on anti-gang initiatives. The FBI once honored him with an award for community leadership. “Rawlins is not a terrorist, extremist, or radicalized fundamentalist,” the bio assures readers. “Nor is he an anarchist or traitor. He is a Muslim born in the USA.” America 2064 is short—only 208 pages—but its ambitions are enormous. In his preface, Rawlins explains that the book is meant to serve as a kind of blueprint—“a strategic framework to change our country’s political, social, and economic landscape” over the next half-century. All of America’s social problems, he argues—poverty, crime, violence, out-of-wedlock births, pornography, homosexuality—can be solved by applying the Koran. Islam, in his view, is the answer to everything. At one point, Rawlins cites a Republican congressman who denounces Islam as a political and legal system seeking world domination. “He is right!” Rawlins declares. “Islam is intended for all mankind and provides a total way of life.” Rawlins does not seek to force Islam on anyone. Every individual, he believes, must be free to choose his or her own religion. The way to spread Islam, he believes, is through good deeds. The only weapon is dawah, which is every Muslim’s duty. As more and more Americans convert to Islam, Rawlins hopes, the U.S. Constitution will be amended to reflect the commandments of Allah. In place of our existing system of secular law, Americans would decide to be ruled by Islamic law—sharia. “By 2064,” Rawlins concludes, “Islam will dominate the American landscape, Insha Allah.” Muslet enthusiastically embraced his friend’s vision for an America united under Allah. After all, Islam had saved his life. Why couldn’t it solve Belle Glade’s problems, too? In 2010, to help bring social services into disadvantaged communities, Rawlins had started a program called Walking One Stop. Today, flanked by activists and community leaders, he and Muslet often go door to door, helping people sign up for unemployment insurance, food stamps, and other public benefits without the hassle of calling on multiple bureaucracies. “We’re just trying to gain the pleasure of the Almighty,” Rawlins says. “The Walking One Stop is an embodiment of Islam. By doing good deeds with Muslim leadership, it softens the hearts of the people towards Muslims and towards Islam.” He laughs. “It’s just the beginning, though. Yousef and I, we’ve got plans. We want people to become Muslim. There’s a lot of stuff we want to do together.” Not long before his arrest, the FBI began taking an interest in Muslet. For some years, Muslet had been friendly with a pair of agents from the Miami bureau, who used to drop by the Belle Glade mosque occasionally, to check in. As part of its counterterrorism efforts, the FBI has developed a massive network of confidential informants. The imam who spoke at Muslet’s Friday prayers, Foad Farahi, is currently suing the FBI for trying to deport him after he refused their request to work as an informant. Muslet shows me an email from one of the agents in December 2014, thanking him for passing along his contact information. At the time, Muslet was finishing construction on Krave. “I know you are a leader in your community and someone who we can reach out to,” the email reads. “Hope all goes well with the opening of the new store!” Then, in the summer of 2015, Muslet flew to Palestine to visit relatives. Not certain how long he wanted to stay, he bought a one-way ticket to Jordan. He was joined by Wayne Rawlins, who wanted to pray in the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during Ramadan. Seven weeks later, when Muslet flew back into Miami, federal agents were waiting for him at the gate. They took him into a room where he was questioned about his time in the Middle East. Had he really gone to Palestine? Or had he gone into Syria, to meet with ISIS? Muslet pointed out to the agent that his passport showed that he crossed into Israel two days after arriving in Jordan. Besides, he had posted photos on Facebook of everywhere he visited. Muslet grew angry, explaining that he is a Muslim and that ISIS is not Islam. The beheadings? The stoning? The throwing people off buildings? In Muslet’s understanding of Islam, terrorism and the taking of innocent life is forbidden. Muslet gave the agents dawah. At one point he took a copy of America 2064 out of his bag and passed it to one of the agents. “Read this,” he said. “This is my plan. This is what I plan to do.” After five hours, the FBI let Muslet go. Two weeks later, though, his brother Faisal was stopped at the Israeli border and refused entrance. He had never been arrested and had no dealings with the FBI. Muslet contacted one of the FBI agents who used to visit the mosque and asked if there was anything he could do. She suggested he come to a meeting at the FBI’s office in Palm Beach. This time, agents asked him about his association with Wayne Rawlins. Muslet again explained about his plan to peacefully Islamicize America. He also made a date to meet them in Belle Glade. He would bring Rawlins, so they could talk to him themselves. Ever since the September 11 attacks, the FBI has devoted special attention to Palm Beach County. Twelve of the 19 attackers either lived in or had connections to the area. The ringleader, Mohamed Atta, took flight training at Palm Beach County Park Airport. In 2013, the Palm Beach sheriff’s department started Community Partners Against Terrorism, a program designed to encourage residents to report activities they deem suspicious. In a video produced by the department, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw notes that “one person’s observations ... can save thousands of lives.” As an example of suspect activity, the video shows a woman taking a picture of a bridge; suspicious persons are defined as individuals who “just don’t fit in.” Before meeting the FBI, Muslet and Rawlins arranged to rendezvous at the mosque. When they got there, a Palm Beach sheriff’s car was already parked across the street. As they drove to their meeting spot, a seafood restaurant called Mr. Shrimp’s, they saw sheriffs’ cars dotting the route. A helicopter from the sheriff’s department hovered overhead. At lunch, after Muslet made introductions, he says the FBI asked him and Rawlins if they were interested in working with the bureau. “We’re working with you right now,” Muslet said. The agents finished their tilapia and left. Two months later, Muslet was arrested for shaking Howard’s hand. On the day of the arrest, Muslet’s wife, Nekia, was in the bedroom with one of her children. As soon as she realized what was happening, she ran to put on her head scarf. By the time she got outside, Yousef was being escorted down the street in handcuffs and her mother-in-law was screaming. “I think the officers were worried she was going to pass out,” Nekia recalls. Both women were panicked as they watched Yousef being taken away. Nekia converted to Islam in high school after being raised in a strict Christian household. “I actually really wanted to fall in love with Christianity,” she says, “but I just couldn’t grasp going through Jesus to talk with God.” Now, as her husband was placed in a patrol car, she told herself it had to be a case of mistaken identity. She gathered her children in the bedroom and explained to them that the police were confused. “I told them that Allah wanted baba to be in jail for the night because he could talk to the people there,” she says. “And that calmed them down.” Muslet actually knew many of his fellow inmates. Some were customers at Addiction. Greeting him warmly, they hooked him up with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and sheets for his bunk. Muslet, in turn, gave dawah. The next morning, the judge released him on his own recognizance. The threat of a long sentence, though, still loomed. The evidence that led to Muslet’s arrest was, by any measure, thin. At 12:40 p.m. on December 29, 2015, Hal Howard walked into the sheriff’s office in Belle Glade. According to court records, the dispatcher told the deputy on duty, Kurt Castaldo, that Howard was looking to report “a Muslim that is getting pretty active.” Castaldo sat down with Howard, who told him about the incident with Muslet. At the time, Howard couldn’t recall Muslet’s name—only his address. Castaldo decided to proceed to Muslet’s house to identify the suspect and get a statement. He summoned five deputies, including a canine unit, as backup. He also requested that Howard tag along to identify Muslet. The officers drove off in squad cars, followed by Howard in his truck. According to Castaldo, when Muslet first answered the door, he seemed friendly and shook hands. But when Castaldo began asking about his encounter with Howard, Muslet grew “belligerent and confrontive.” In a deposition taken three months after the arrest, Castaldo insisted that Muslet kept interrupting him in a hostile tone—“talking over me, not letting me speak.” But another deputy recalled Muslet remaining calm during the questioning. Even when Howard appeared, Muslet seemed more confused than angry. After being told that he was under arrest, however, Muslet lost his temper. One officer said that by the time he “had to go hands on” with the suspect, Muslet was speaking “in his native tongue in a boisterous manner.” According to Castaldo, Muslet threatened the deputies before he was placed in a squad car. “You guys fucked up now,” he says Muslet shouted. “I am going to get all of you!” Muslet admits that he exchanged undiplomatic words with the deputy who cuffed him. (“I told him, ‘Man, you need to go get yourself some breakfast or something, because you’re not eating me for breakfast.’ ”) But he denies physically resisting the arrest, or threatening the officers in any way. Later, at the trial, Castaldo testified that he decided to arrest Muslet because the suspect “had put himself at the scene” of the encounter with Howard. At the moment of the arrest, though, his sole evidence that Muslet had been violent was Howard’s statement. Only after Muslet was placed in jail did Castaldo attempt to corroborate the crime. He contacted Pat Lucey, Howard’s friend who was riding in the truck with him during the incident, and recorded a seven-minute statement about what he witnessed. Then he went back to Howard and recorded a ten-minute statement. No medical examination of Howard was ever conducted, even though Castaldo’s report listed his injuries as “serious.” This—the statements from Howard and Lucey about the incident, and the statement from Muslet about his arrest—comprised the entirety of the Palm Beach sheriff’s investigation into the supposed crime. It’s not uncommon for law enforcement, erring on the side of public safety, to be hasty in making an arrest. It’s up to the local prosecutor’s office to review the evidence and determine whether it is sufficient to file charges. J.D. Small, the prosecutor who brought the case to trial, says he found Hal Howard’s account “credible,” and that it was corroborated by Pat Lucey. On the recording, a nervous-sounding Howard offers an account similar—though not identical—to the one he gave me. As Castaldo questions him, he speaks slowly and sounds genuinely shaken. Two moments stand out. At one point, Howard describes the instant he realized that Muslet was Muslim. “I knew he looked a little weird because I’m not used to a full-face beard,” Howard says. “Then it dawned on me that this is not a Christian. He’s got to be a Muslim. Right then my fear just doubled, because of all the things that are happening in the United States and overseas.” Later, Howard describes seeing Muslet’s daughter, who was five at the time, on the street in front of his truck. “And this girl was standing in the middle of the road,” he says. “And I’ll tell you what—I’ve never been scared of an eleven-year-old, twelve-year-old girl, whatever she was, but this girl had evil in her eyes. You could just see it. The hate. And the hair on the back of my neck raised up.” I ask Small whether these statements—admitting a fear of Muslims and believing a five-year-old girl was evil—made Howard appear less credible to the prosecution. “I think that’s editorial,” says Mike Edmondson, a department spokesman sitting in on the interview. Whatever Howard’s personal views, he explains, they were irrelevant to the case. Besides, he adds, Howard’s account was backed up by Pat Lucey, who had witnessed the incident. Listening to Lucey’s short statement, however, this is far from clear. Lucey does confirm some aspects of Howard’s account. He acknowledges that Muslet leaned into the window and was “very loud” and “aggressive,” to the point where the two men felt intimidated. “I guess if we’d said much more, one of us would have got slapped probably, because he was that aggressive,” Lucey says. “I thought he was literally going to come through the window probably.” But at no point in the statement does Castaldo ask Lucey about a handshake. Nor does Lucey mention one. Lucey, in fact, never clearly describes any kind of physical contact between the two men. The closest he gets is toward the end of the statement, when he offers an ambiguous, fragmentary description of how the encounter ended. Muslet, he says, “finally let go of his hand. Hal pulled back, if I remember right…. I mean, he had his hand…. I thought he was going to shake his hand, but when he started doing the sign language….” Lucey then talks about Muslet performing a gesture in which he spells “Allah” in the folds of his palms. (Muslet later demonstrates this to me, with great pleasure.) Castaldo never asks Lucey to clarify what he means and, a minute later, the recorded statement ends. Two weeks later, based entirely on this evidence, the prosecutor’s office filed charges. Muslet’s trial was originally set to be held in early September 2016. But Flynn Bertisch, Muslet’s lead attorney, argued that the proximity to September 11 might put the jury in a prejudicial frame of mind. Ultimately, though, the prosecution and the defense agreed to skip a jury altogether and hold a bench trial, in which a judge hears evidence and renders a verdict. In his opening argument, Bertisch contended that the case was not really about the handshake at all. “This case,” he said, “is really about God”—how a difference in religious opinion blew up into something much bigger. The state, meanwhile, chose mostly to ignore religion and focus on proving that a genuine assault had taken place. Small, the prosecutor, called Pat Lucey to the stand as his first witness. A bald, bespectacled man with an endearingly bubbly disposition, Lucey didn’t offer much to support the state’s case. After Muslet began talking about Islam, he testified, he basically ignored him, seeing any argument as hopeless. “I just kind of tuned him out,” said Lucey, who is partially deaf. “I felt like he has his point of view and I have mine. Maybe all his french fries wasn’t lining up in his Happy Meal.” As for a handshake, Lucey testified, he simply didn’t see one. Asked for more details about what he did see, Lucey confirmed that Muslet was gesturing expressively and touched Howard on the arm a few times while he was leaning in the window. Asked whether this seemed like assault, Lucey equivocated. “Did I see a belligerent pulling of him?” he responded. “No.” What stayed with Lucey most about the encounter was the avidity with which Muslet sought to convince them of the rightness of Islam. “The man was zealous about what he believes,” Lucey said. “He’d make a good Baptist evangelist.” Next, the state showed a video of Muslet in the backseat of the squad car after his arrest, clearly agitated. At this point, Muslet did not know why, precisely, he was being taken to jail. When told he was being charged with battery and “burglary of a conveyance,” Muslet was incredulous. “Battery?” he sputters. “Where? Where, brother?” “Based on the statement by the victim,” a deputy replies. “Who’s the victim?” “Hal.” “Mr. Hal? I touched Mr. Hal? I offered to shake Mr. Hal’s hand!” As a deputy tries to calm him down, Muslet, his voice increasingly loud and strident, begins rambling. “You can’t charge me with that because you have no proof of that! He is a liar! I have witnesses! There were a hundred witnesses! A thousand witnesses! Burglary? What do you mean burglary? How do you come up with this bogus charge? What, do you think I’m ignorant? I have rights! You have no right to have me in this car right now! Because you have no—show me the evidence that you have! Other than some lying, crazy Islamophobic.” For the next 20 minutes, Muslet cycles rapidly through confusion, righteous anger, respectful deference, and threats of a lawsuit. “I’m a Palestinian, wears a rag on his head,” he continues, “wears a thawb, I mention Allah—Allah’s the name of the almighty creator, Allahu Akbar—that’s his name. And you don’t even know his name. What’s God’s name? Walking around, taking orders, shooting people. Who’s in charge?” At one point, Muslet denounces the sheriff’s deputies as “a bunch of Islamophobic racists.” Watching this in court, the judge chuckled. “I’m going to teach a class,” he said. “What not to do if you’re arrested.” The last person to testify was Hal Howard. He sat with his hands folded neatly in his lap, hunched slightly forward, like someone in church. His account of the confrontation with Muslet differed, in certain key details, from the version he gave me, as well as from the one he first offered Deputy Castaldo. Now, instead of Muslet shaking him with his right hand, Muslet used his left hand to grab him by the wrist. Instead of Howard having to pry their hands apart, Muslet let go on his own. Instead of Muslet leading his children silently into the house, Muslet told them, “Get out of the road before he kills you.” Despite all the inconsistencies, Howard seemed to genuinely believe his own account of events. He again said—somewhat touchingly—that Lucey would corroborate his version of events. The prosecution, for its part, tried to avoid any mention of religion. But the topic kept working its way into the trial. At one point, Small asked Howard why the conversation with Muslet had scared him. “Well, I’m a Christian, number one,” Howard replied. “I believe Jesus Christ died for my sins. And I have a father in heaven. And none of them has even a nickname called Allah.” Small quickly tried to steer the line of questioning back on course. “But what was it about the, uh, defendant’s demeanor—” “I felt like he was trying to force Allah onto me,” Howard interrupted. “He wanted to come to my church and teach everybody about Allah.” The defense, by contrast, sought out this angle wherever it could find it. Toward the end of questioning, Bertisch noted that Lucey had wished Muslet a merry Christmas. Howard nodded. “God-blessed him, too.” “Did you find that weird?” “No. He’s American. Ninety percent of us believe in God. What’s wrong with saying God bless you? It’s on the dollar bill.” “But you have an individual here who believes in a different god, correct?” “I don’t know what he believes in,” Howard said. “I guess it’s a god.” “Well, he told you he wanted to come to church to enlighten people about his god.” “I don’t know about ‘enlightening’ anything.” “You just thought,” Bertisch ventured, “he was going to force his god on you?” “After he got through talking, yes,” Howard says. “That’s what I thought he wanted.” In the course of his testimony, Howard comes across as both deeply averse to being preached at by a Muslim and committed to doing what he thinks is the right thing. At one point, he repeats that it was his sons and friends who urged him to report the handshake. But he also notes that he was inspired, in part, by a public service announcement he saw on television. “I told them,” Howard said, referring to the sheriff’s office, “what I heard on the TV, about the FBI saying that no matter how small it is, you got to report it.” The judge interjected. “So, when you say, ‘You should report things,’ was it, you know, he was an Arab or Muslim or something?” “Anything suspicious,” Howard said. “When that—I guess it was the bombing or the killing down in California—they said those people had seen them supplying bullets and stuff. And anything you see that’s suspicious, or anything that happens suspicious, should be reported.” After further questioning, it became apparent that Howard was referring to the mass shooting that took place on December 2, 2015, when a Muslim couple killed 14 people at an office Christmas party in San Bernardino, California. The shooting had occurred less than three weeks before Howard encountered Muslet after the Christmas party at his pastor’s house. Reporting Muslet was his way of trying to prevent such things from happening in Belle Glade. “That’s the only way we’re going to find out what’s going on,” he told the court. During the trial, it was hard not to see Muslet and Howard as spiritual twins. Their faith followed similar, classical lines. Both are men who, lost in sin, had undergone a sudden, unexpected conversion—delivered from doubt into what William James called a “state of assurance.” They remain devout in their faith, live self-denying lives, and believe that the end times are upon us. Two men in dying towns, residents of a burning world, had found a path to eternal life. When they met, their disagreement struck at the very center of who they are. There was no evidence to suggest that Hal Howard was lying. He clearly believed that something violent had been done to him. And, in one sense, something had. Whatever the handshake had been like, Muslet had, consciously or not, taken a jackhammer to the bedrock of another man’s identity. Such a gesture, though conceived with peaceful intentions, could not have failed to feel threatening. The question of what, precisely, happened between Howard and Muslet can’t be answered with any certainty. But what came afterward was clearly shaped in large part by the wider political battle being waged over Islam. It’s possible that Muslet’s religious beliefs played no role in his prosecution. But in Palm Beach—once the training ground for the September 11 attackers, now a center for anti-Islamic hate groups—Howard’s account was deemed more plausible than Muslet’s. Though uncorroborated by any evidence, Howard’s version of events seemed correct to police and prosecutors, enough to pursue a case to trial and force a local businessman and civic activist to consider, for almost a year, the possibility that he would be taken away from his family and placed in prison for the rest of his life. In his ruling on the case, Judge Peter Evans made clear that his ability to render a verdict was hindered by a lack of clear evidence. “There was no investigation” he said. “I mean, what investigation? They went and talked to a couple guys.” He then ruminated aloud for several minutes about how best to weigh the need of law enforcement to protect public safety with the rights of citizens not to be the target of undue suspicion. “It’s unfortunately the society that we live in,” the judge said. “A little nothing turns into a case where I’m supposed to convict this guy and send him to prison for life. Because he shook a guy’s hand too hard? I don’t know. Since 9/11, every time there’s an incident involving a Muslim, everyone’s on red alert. But there’s incidents every day.” The judge sighed. “How do you deal with this stuff? Right? All kidding aside, to me, this is really just sort of a fascinating societal issue. Because I see it every day in here. So how do you deal with it? On the one hand, you have the government, saying ‘Hey, you see any Muslim do something, you should report it,’ because, you know?” At the same time, the judge said, Muslet should be slow to call people bigots. “Instead of Mr. Muslet, for example, talking about ‘This is racism, you’re picking on me’—doesn’t there have to be some kind of understanding on the other side? These cops—well, maybe this isn’t the best example of a great investigation—but what are the cops doing? They’re doing their job. It’s their job to go arrest someone on a felony. Whether they should have or not is another issue. But they do what they do.” The judge turned to Muslet, sitting in his thawb. “Meanwhile, he’s screaming, what? Islamo—” “Islamophobia,” Muslet said. “Islamophobia! So, yeah, it’s kinda got to go both ways, right? I don’t know.” The judge threw up his arms. “Good luck solving this one!” In the matter of the criminal case, though, he declared Muslet innocent. Muslet, overcome, stood up. “Can I—can I shake your hand, judge?” There was an awkward silence, then laughter in the courtroom. The judge looked uncertain. Finally, he motioned to his judicial robes. “Well, we’re both wearing dresses,” he said. Muslet was deeply relieved at his acquittal. He claims, however, never to have been in doubt about the outcome. “Allah wouldn’t do that to me,” he says. Then he pauses. “Unless, of course, that was what he wanted. But I don’t think it was.” Not long after the trial, Muslet stopped by the home of Dr. Kaki, Hal Howard’s beloved physician. The two men hail from the same village in Palestine, and have known each other for years. “I told him ‘Hey, one of your patients tried to put me away for life,’ ” says Muslet. “He was pretty surprised.” Just before I leave Belle Glade, Muslet gives me a tour of the town. He shows me where, on the main street, he wants to install a storefront mosque, to call the Muslim shopkeepers to prayer, and where he wants to open a halal restaurant. Farther out, we pass the leviathan sugar mill, its stacks spewing white smoke. In the distance, poppy-yellow crop dusters buzz the fields. The streets are dotted with campaign signs for Muslet’s opponent for city commissioner. Muslet hasn’t had time to put up any signs of his own, but he remains optimistic about the election. “I think people are ready to take on Big Sugar,” he says. “The sugar companies, they’ve been making millions for years, and what do we get back?” He is quiet for a while, staring out the window. “I just wanna see people come up, man. Live good lives.” When we reach Muslet’s house, his kids are playing in the backyard. His wife smiles and waves. Muslet points at the roof of the home of Howard’s pastor, Eric Stevenson. On the apex sits a big, plastic nativity scene. Muslet’s kids and the pastor’s kids play together, but the two men aren’t friends. Shortly after the pastor moved in, he threw a lawn party whose guests included young teenagers. “The girls are wearing these short shorts and there are young men out there, too,” Muslet frowns. “And they’re doing things like kissing and—intimate things.” During the party, Muslet walked over to Stevenson’s house. “I said, ‘Hey Eric, I wanna ask you a question….’ He said, ‘Yeah?’ I said, ‘Eric, what’s your God’s name?’ ” The conversation followed a predictable trajectory. It strikes me that giving dawah seems to be something Muslet does when he feels annoyed. “Everyone gets dawah—Muslim, Jew, Christian, police, FBI,” Muslet says. “It’s what I do.” I ask Muslet whether he understands why people who are used to a secular form of government might be alarmed at the prospect of sharia. “I understand separating church from state, and I agree with it,” he says. “Separating mosque from state? I agree with that. But you can’t separate God from state, because God is a way of life. I don’t have a choice. I really don’t. I can’t force anyone to be Muslim, but it’s my obligation to share it with people. Now, will sharia law ever be—.” He stops. “Actually, it is going to be implemented, because Allah is gonna implement it. Eventually. I want the Messiah to come, to confirm to the people. I’m ready for him, because he’s the one they’re going to believe. Everything that’s happened, all the signs. He’s coming back.” A few weeks after I leave Florida, the election for commissioner is held. Muslet receives 124 ballots, or approximately 12 percent of the vote. He calls it “a valuable learning experience.” His plans to Islamicize America with Wayne Rawlins remained undiminished. Howard was disappointed at the verdict. “I didn’t expect them to send him to prison or nothing, but I thought they’d find him guilty,” he tells me. “Because he was guilty.” Howard isn’t worried about his own safety, however. “I don’t think God would let him hurt me.” A month later, Howard felt severe chest pains. When he visited Dr. Kaki, the physician told Howard to go to the emergency room, immediately. When he arrived, doctors discovered a clogged artery in his neck. A three-inch stent was placed in his carotid artery. He credits Dr. Kaki with saving him from a stroke. “I love that man,” he says. “I truly do.” Matt Wolfe is a doctoral student in sociology at New York University, where he researches missing persons.",2017-08-02 06:01:00,The Handshake,,401,http://www.tnr.com/

So far, most of the Duggars and their significant others have remained silent about the latest scandal to rock their fundamentalist Christian family, 28-year-old Derick Dillard's transphobic Twitter attack on an underage girl. As Paper magazine reports, that girl was one of his fellow TLC reality show stars, Jazz Jennings. The transgender 16-year-old is an LGBTQ activist who uses her reality series, I Am Jazz, as a platform to inspire other transgender teens and to encourage cisgender viewers to be more accepting and understanding of the marginalized group. On Wednesday, Derick Dillard, the husband of Jill Duggar, took to Twitter to opine that ""'transgender' is a myth"" and that Jazz Jennings' show ""follows a non-reality."" He also used the incorrect pronouns when referring to Jazz. ""Every day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different,"" Jazz tweeted in response. None of the Duggars have attempted to defend Derick Dillard's actions, but Jeremy Vuolo did recently share a quote from a religious leader that Derick often retweets, author John Piper. The quote basically says that Christians should desire to know the glory of God instead of longing for worldly things.""The physical eye is meant to say to the spiritual eye, 'Not this, but Maker of this, is the desire of your soul.'"" - @JohnPiper pic.twitter.com/wCmM5NTIB1— Jeremy Vuolo (@Jeremy_Vuolo) August 5, 2017The words Jeremy Vuolo felt compelled to share come from one of Piper's books, Seeing and Savouring Jesus Christ. They precede a paragraph suggesting that homosexuality exists because people ""exchange God's glory for lesser things.""""The ache in every human heart is an ache for this. But we suppress it and do not see fit to have God in our knowledge (Romans 1:28). Therefore the entire creation has fallen into disorder. The most prominent example of this in the Bible is the disordering of our sexual lives. Paul says that the exchange of the glory of God for other things is the root cause for the homosexual (and heterosexual) disordering of our relationships.""In a post on the Desiring God website, John Piper also shares his thoughts about how Christians should treat transgender men and women. He encourages Christians who work alongside transgender people to quit their jobs if they are asked to refer to their co-workers by pronouns that don't correspond with their birth sexes.As the Hollywood Gossip reports, John Piper has also discouraged Christians from attending the same-sex weddings of friends and family members. In 2016, Jessa Duggar's husband, Ben Seewald, was criticized for using a John Piper quote to respond to a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. ""The physical eye is meant to say to the spiritual eye, 'Not this, but Maker of this, is the desire of your soul.'"" - @JohnPiper pic.twitter.com/wCmM5NTIB1 It's unclear whether Jeremy Vuolo had Jazz Jennings in mind when he decided to tweet a Piper quote. He hasn't shared his own personal feelings about transgender people, but Jeremy has made some controversial comments about gay men and women. As the Inquisitr previously reported, he's shamed a fellow pastor for saying that he would perform a same-sex marriage, and he's said that it's important for Christians to speak out against same-sex marriage. ""To tell people graciously that marriage is only between a man and a woman is love,"" Vuolo said during one of his sermons.Shhhh!

10,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/14/judge-rules-families-victims-1998-arkansas-school-/,"A judge has ruled that the families of the five people who died in a mass shooting at an Arkansas middle school almost two decades ago are owed $150 million from their killers, according to a news release. Circuit Judge John Fogleman entered the judgement in the wrongful-death suit Monday, said Jonesboro attorney Bobby McDaniel, who represented all five families. Mitchell Johnson was 13 when he and an 11-year-old classmate, Andrew Golden, killed four girls — Natalie Brooks, Paige Herring, Stephanie Johnson and Brittney Varner — and teacher Shannon Wright at Westside Middle School near Jonesboro on March 24, 1998, the Democrat-Gazette previously reported. Ten others were injured in the shooting. According to Monday's news release, each family was awarded $20 million in compensatory and punitive damages against Johnson and an addition $10 million in damages against Golden, who has changed his name to Drew Grant. It is unlikely the plaintiffs will ever collect any money, McDaniel said. “If either of them tries to sell their story for a book or movie deal, or wins the lottery, this judgment means they can’t get rich without paying these families first.""

11,http://newsblaze.com/usnews/politics/walmart-apologizes-for-back-to-school-gun-display_83899/,"Walmart officials apologized Thursday after a photo surfaced on social media depicting a back-to-school display inside one of the corporation’s stores that was filled with guns. The photo began making the rounds on social media Wednesday morning. It displays a gun rack in a Walmart store with a back-to-school sign above it that reads “Own the school year like a hero.” “What’s seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores,” Walmart said in a statement, according to the New York Times. “We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened.” Walmart officials confirmed Thursday that the displays were official Walmart marketing materials. On Friday, the company announced it had determined the cause of the display was “mischief.” Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson told CNNMoney that employees had tracked down the cause of the display, and had determined that the incident was a prank. Crowson did not elaborate as to whether that meant the image was digitally altered, or whether a customer or employee had put up inappropriate materials over the gun rack. On Thursday, the company incorrectly said that the store where the display had been put up was in Evansville, Indiana. Crowson later said the incident did not take place there, although he did not identify what store it did take place in, according to the Chicago Tribune. School shooting incidents have been on the rise in the United States, and many social media commentators pointed out the dark implications of the sign placed above the gun rack, which features an AR-15 guide and hinted at events such as the Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook massacres. Since 2000, there have been 17 school shootings in the U.S. with more than three victims, which is the requirement to meet the definition of a mass shooting according to U.S. Congress. Walmart has been criticized heavily in the past several years for selling guns in stores. In 2006, the store cut back on gun sales due to low demand. However, Walmart began increasing its gun inventory in 2011, bringing them back to at least half of the company’s 3,600 stores, according to the Wall Street Journal. In 2015, Walmart decided to end the sale of assault rifles in stores after facing public pressure to remove them from the shelves, according to the New York Times.

12,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/15/deadly-rally-accelerates-removal-confederate-statu/,"In Gainesville, Fla., workers hired by the Daughters of the Confederacy chipped away at a Confederate soldier's statue, loaded it quietly on a truck and drove away with little fanfare. In Baltimore, Mayor Catherine Pugh said she's ready to tear down all of her city's Confederate statues, and the city council voted to have them destroyed. San Antonio lawmakers are looking ahead to removing a statue that many people wrongly assumed represented a famed Texas leader who died at the Alamo. Some people refused to wait. Protesters in Durham, N.C., toppled a nearly century-old statue of a Confederate soldier Monday at a rally against racism. Activists took a ladder up to the statue and used a rope to pull down the Confederate Soldiers Monument that was dedicated in 1924. A diverse crowd of dozens cheered as the statue of a soldier holding a rifle fell to the ground in front of an old courthouse building that now houses local government offices. The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., is fueling another re-evaluation of Confederate statues in cities across the nation, accelerating their removal in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist renewed pressure to take down the Confederate flag from public property. ""We should not glorify a part of our history in front of our buildings that really is a testament to America's original sin,"" Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe said Monday after the statue known as ""Old Joe"" was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904. A county spokesman said he did not know if the statue was removed because of the events that killed one person and injured dozens more Saturday in Charlottesville. But many officials who were horrified by the confrontation soon began publicizing plans to take down statues. The Southern Poverty Law Center last year counted more than 1,500 things around the country named after Confederate figures or dedicated to the Confederacy, including holidays, statues, flags and the names of cities, counties, schools and parks. Nearly half are monuments, which are in 24 states. Most of the dedications are in the South, but 24 are in the North and 21 in states that did not exist at the time of the Civil War. In Jacksonville, Fal., City Council President Anna Brosche ordered an immediate inventory of all of the Confederate statues in her city in preparation for their removal. ""These monuments, memorials and markers represent a time in our history that caused pain to so many,"" she said Monday. Lexington, Ky., Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the weekend bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. San Antonio Councilman Roberto Trevino is promoting a measure that would remove the Confederate statue at the center of Travis Park, where for years people have mistakenly identified the figure as being that of Col. William Travis, a Texas hero who died at the Alamo. ""This is not an important art piece, but a monument to power. It was put in to remind people of that power. It is an unfortunate message of hate, and we think it's important to relocate it."" Trevino said Monday. ""We do think that history is important so we're looking for an appropriate location for it."" St. Louis dismantled its Confederate Monument in Forest Park in June, giving it to the Missouri Civil War Museum after years of debate. In Memphis, city attorney Bruce McMullen said Monday that he plans to file a petition to remove a statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate cavalry general and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from a park. The Memphis City Council voted in 2015 to relocate the statue, but the state historical commission blocked the move under the Heritage Protection Act, which makes any push to remove historical markers harder. In Nashville, protesters draped a black jacket over the head of a Forrest bust at the Tennessee Capitol while cheering, ""Tear it down!"" Republican Gov. Bill Haslam later said he didn't think Forrest should be honored at the Capitol. In Baltimore, Pugh said Monday that she would move forward with the removal of Baltimore's statues of Roger B. Taney, a Marylander who wrote the 1856 Dred Scott Supreme Court ruling that denied citizenship to African-Americans, and a statue of two Virginians, Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Pugh said she was making plans to send the statues to cemeteries with Confederate dead outside the city. But hours later, the city council voted unanimously to have the statues destroyed instead of moved. It was unclear whether anything would happen to the statues immediately. Seconds after the monument fell in Durham on Monday, protesters began kicking the crumpled bronze monument. In response, Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper tweeted: ""The racism and deadly violence in Charlottesville is unacceptable but there is a better way to remove these monuments."" Back in May, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu moved his city's four main Confederate statues, including a statue of Lee, at night after threats of violence from Confederate sympathizers and white supremacists. Pugh said she is consulting with Landrieu, now head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, about the removal of Baltimore's statues and the cost.\ Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

Gwynn's three-day trial is set for Sept. 18 before U.S. District Judge J. Leon Holmes in Little Rock. Read Wednesday’s Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details. EARLIER: The rapper who performed the night of a mass shooting at a Little Rock nightclub has pleaded not guilty to a federal charge stemming from another shooting in Forrest City. Ricky Hampton, who performs under the stage name Finese 2 Tymes, also waived his court appearance that had been set for Tuesday in federal court on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, filings show. Hampton in July pleaded not guilty in federal court after he was named in a criminal complaint. The not guilty plea filed Tuesday comes after he was indicted by a grand jury. Authorities say Hampton became angry at a woman blocking his exit after a June 25 performance at Club Envy in Forrest City, prompting him to fire the gun at her as she tried to drive away. The rapper has not been charged in the July 1 shooting at Power Ultra Lounge in Little Rock that left 25 people injured from gunfire. Hampton’s bodyguard, Kentrell Dominique Gwynn, 25, was later arrested on three charges related to the Little Rock shooting. Gwynn was set to appear in federal court for his arraignment Tuesday afternoon. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

In Baltimore, Mayor Catherine Pugh said she’s ready to tear down all of her city’s Confederate statues, and the city council voted to have them destroyed. San Antonio lawmakers are looking ahead to removing a statue from a prominent downtown park. The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is accelerating the removal of Confederate monuments in cities across the nation in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist led to the end of the Confederate flag being flown on public property. “We should not glorify a part of our history in front of our buildings that really is a testament to America’s original sin,” Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe said Monday after the statue known as “Old Joe” was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904.

Many officials who were horrified by the events that killed one person and injured dozens more Saturday in Charlottesville soon began publicizing plans to remove statues. Not everyone is in favor of destruction. A law professor and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio called removal a “slippery slope,” saying judging historical figures through a modern lens can be difficult. “A healthy democracy and people within that democracy should be able to say, ‘This is our history.’ And history is made up of actions of human beings, and human beings aren’t perfect,” said Jeffrey F. Addicott, who stressed he was speaking for himself and not the law school. Statues, he added, can be moved, but he’s opposed to them being “put in a warehouse never to be seen again because then you’re kind of erasing or rewriting history.” The director of public history for Northeastern University in Boston suggested adding context to existing Confederate statues and adding new statues to mark prominent slavery or lynching sites throughout the South. “I think simply destroying them or removing them and turning them into junk metal, there’s a nihilistic element to that. It’s wiping out history,” Martin Blatt said. “However, looked at from the perspective of African-Americans ... I can understand destruction. In Jacksonville, Florida, City Council President Anna Brosche ordered an immediate inventory of all of the Confederate statues in her city in preparation for their removal. “These monuments, memorials and markers represent a time in our history that caused pain to so many,” she said Monday.

But hours later, the city council voted unanimously to have the statues destroyed instead of moved. It was unclear whether anything would happen to the statues immediately. The convergence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis with Confederate imagery in Charlottesville will make it difficult for government agencies to defend having Confederate statues on their property, Boston College history professor Heather Cox Richardson said. “The idea that this somehow is about Southern heritage, I think that ship sailed,” Richardson said. After Dylann Roof fatally shot nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley successfully led calls to bring down a Confederate flag that had flown on Statehouse grounds for 54 years. Other cities and organizations speeded up their removal of Confederate imagery following Roof’s arrest. Now local officials will find it harder to ignore or shelve questions about Confederate statues, Richardson said. “It was always possible for people to look the other way,” she said. “After Charlottesville, I do not see how Americans can look the other way. You have to make a choice at this moment.” Associated Press reporters Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky; Erik Schelzig in Nashville, Tennessee; Jonathan Drew in Durham, North Carolina; and Jason Dearen in Gainesville, Florida, contributed to this report.

Aug. 16 2017, Updated 1:47 p.m. ET HBO producer Marc Henry Johnson was sentenced this past Tuesday to a year in prison for moving the body of a stunning Long Island doctor and mother, who died of a cocaine overdose, on his watch. “My guess is we would not be sitting here had Mr. Johnson immediately called 911,” said Manhattan Federal Judge Jesse Furman. “For all we know, she could have been saved.” According to the NY Daily News, Johnson allegedly called paramedics once Cerveny “turned blue.” While the incident occurred in 2015, Johnson, 53, pleaded guilty to accessory earlier this year. “Please give me the chance to redeem myself,” he said in court. As RadarOnline.com can reveal, the producer’s friend, Kiersten Cerveny, died in October of 2015 after the two got cocaine from local NYC drug dealer, James “Pepsi” Holder. She overdosed while in the coke dealer’s apartment. Johnson claimed he had met with Cerveny, 38, at around 4 am to buy cocaine from Holden, who later admitted to having used his apartment as a stash house. He was sentenced to five years behind bars last May. The incident was caught on tape, as a video shows both Johnson and Holden carrying Cerveny’s dead body trough the building’s hallway in order to move her away form Holden’s drug-filled apartment. “You made the wrong choice,” said Furman. “I can’t get past the fact that your conduct may have resulted in the tragic death of Cerveny.” Johnson admitted to everything and apologized to his family, saying that he hoped the judge would be lenient, as he had lost several family members to crack and alcohol overdoses.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – A Florida sheriff's deputy copied a videotape of a mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale's airport last January that killed five people and leaked it to the website TMZ, according to a warrant that led to his arrest Wednesday. Deputy Michael Dingman, 47, leaked surveillance video of Esteban Santiago opening fire last Jan. 6 inside a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to the Los Angeles-based news and celebrity gossip website, investigators said. TMZ posted the 22-second video two days after the shooting. It shows Santiago pulling a handgun from his waistband and firing three shots as panicked passengers scrambled. He then runs off the screen. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Dingman's actions ""took away from the amazing performance"" done by his deputies and other law enforcement officers after the shooting. ""At the end of the day, this is about one deputy who chose to tarnish the badge,"" Israel said. He said the leak did not hinder the shooting investigation. He also said that while TMZ is known to pay large sums for videos, the investigation found no evidence Dingman had been paid. Deputy Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association, the union that represents the county's deputies, said Dingman will fight the charges. ""We feel very confident that his defense will address every single issue,"" Bell said. Michael Finesilver, Dingman's attorney, declined comment. TMZ did not return a call and email seeking comment. Dingman, who has been suspended without pay, was released Wednesday shortly after he surrendered on $2,000 bail on charges of violating Florida public records laws, surreptitiously making the video and tampering with evidence by deleting files from his cellphone then tossing it in his pool. Under Florida law, criminal evidence such as the shooting video usually only becomes a public record when the investigation is complete. According to Dingman's arrest warrant filed by Detective Joshua Webb, investigators noticed that the TMZ video was taken by a cellphone recording it from a computer screen. The reflection showed a sergeant was sitting in front of the screen and that the video had been recorded in the sheriff's office's airport station. Sgt. Scott Yurchuck told investigators he had brought Dingman and two other deputies assigned to the airport into his office early Jan. 8 to show them the video for training purposes, playing it several times. Yurchuck said he remembered Dingman standing behind him in the spot the video appeared to be recorded from and that the deputy was holding his cellphone. Investigators then searched the websites Dingman visited using his sheriff's office computer and found he visited TMZ's website shortly after he left Yurchuck's office. They say his cellphone records show Dingman's phone called TMZ and several local news outlets that morning using a system that blocks the user's identity. They say Dingman's phone had four calls that morning with a phone number belonging to TMZ founder, Harvey Levin, less than an hour before the video appeared on the website. On Jan. 10, a Broward captain, lieutenant, sergeant and Webb went to Dingman's house to confront him and confiscate his sheriff's computer and patrol car. Webb said Dingman told them he knew why they were there. Webb said Dingman told him he had ""made a huge mistake"" and that his ""credibility"" was gone, without specifically referencing TMZ. Webb said Dingman, on advice of his attorney, refused to surrender his cellphone without a warrant. After Webb obtained one, Dingman allegedly gave him a different one than the one he'd had at the airport Jan. 8. As Webb was leaving, he says Dingman told him, ""Do you guys think I made money on this thing? Because if so, I didn't."" After the alleged phone deception was discovered, Webb got a search warrant for Dingman's home on Jan. 13. Dingman pointed him to a phone sitting in a plastic container filled with rice -- a common attempted fix for cellphones that have gotten wet. Dingman told Webb he had dropped it into the pool on the day the video had been recorded, but ""It's not what you think."" Webb wrote that a subsequent investigation found that the cellphone had been erased before being submerged in water. Also, all of Dingman's sheriff's office emails from that period had been erased, which can only be done by someone with Dingman's password. Santiago's trial for the shooting is scheduled for next year. The FBI says Santiago admitted committing the shootings in recorded interviews with agents.

28,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/433nwn/my-family-always-passed-as-white-until-we-didnt,"My family immigrated from Lebanon to Canada before I was born in order to flee a nasty civil war. Since we're quite light-skinned, growing up people assumed we were some kind of white: Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese was mainly what I heard. My mom explained how back in those pre-9/11 days, people she met hardly knew where Lebanon was and hadn't heard much about Islam either, so it was easy for us to live under the radar, hassle-free. This was before the hummus craze. But obviously, with everything going on today, things have changed. Now, the disclosure of who we are, along with some cultural clues, shifts how people see us regardless of our light skin tone. I suppose one could argue that it's a privilege to be passable as white, or a variant thereof, but it's a bit more complicated than that. As a kid, my folks cultivated a dual identity within the Lebanon-like bubble of our southwestern Ontario home. We remixed the Lebanese Arabic dialect with English idioms and ate kibbeh with chicken nuggets and homemade fries. As Muslims, we studied the Qu'ran, prayed five times a day, and were forbidden to eat pork—including pepperoni and bacon, too. You'd expect it all to be confusing, but I was a happy kid living under the radar and felt my upbringing was normal. When I write, I use the pseudonym Mike Miksche, but my birth name is James and only because my mom loved James Bond. I didn't think much of my ethnicity growing up since my name makes me that much more passable. My mom, Amal, and brother Ramie have Arabic names, but to many Canadians, they sound ambiguous enough, as does my sister's name, Aida. My brother, Ahmed, on the other hand, was less passable as a kid because of his name. Sometime during fifth or sixth grade, he was called a ""Paki,"" which was confusing for him. Before that, he just thought he was a white kid with a strange name: Turns out that privilege can be turned on and off so quick that it puts into question the degree of it, particularly since we only benefit when people are unaware of who we really are beyond our skin tone. Ahmed lost even more of that privilege during the Persian Gulf War in the early 90s where he was then compared to Saddam Hussein by kids at school. It's difficult to see the connection between ""Ahmed"" and ""Saddam,"" but I suppose that's the thing ignorance is made of. Today he claims that the name doesn't inhibit him when applying for jobs because he works in IT, but when crossing the border, he's often asked to step aside for a special search. In 1995, after my great uncle died, my mom decided to do the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, thinking that this religious pursuit would keep her close to her uncle and ensure he was taken care of in heaven. She started wearing the hijab that same year and subsequently lost her privilege. After putting it on, she lost roughly 20 percent of her clientele from the salon she ran off the side of our house. Things changed yet again following the 9/11 attack. ""After September 11, the way people started treating me and acting toward me—it was like a wake-up call,"" my mom told me. She remembered one man randomly shouting, ""Go home!"" and soon told herself, ""You're not Canadian. You are always Lebanese, and that's where you belong."" The sad truth is that she doesn't really feel all that Lebanese either, having left her home when she was 15 years old and is now stuck in a purgatory state with her self-identity. Ramie, my younger brother who was 11 at the time, hadn't thought much about his ethnicity until then. After 9/11, not only was he in shock from seeing the footage of the towers coming down, but he told me that he could remember going to school fearful that kids would beat him because the terrorists were Muslims just like him. Being so young, there was confusion in the classroom as to the nationality of the attackers: Some thought they were Chinese, and others believed them to be Indian. One boy finally said, ""Actually, it was exactly who Ramie is. It's a Muslim."" He was bullied for a few weeks after that, but it stopped until high school, where kids then began calling him ""terrorist."" Today, some friends joke that I too look like a terrorist when I grow my beard out, which is useful to know. I now make sure my beard is trimmed when crossing the United States border—which is a privilege on its own to have the option. Still, even if I ""pass,"" when getting to know new people I'll often disclose that I'm an Arab, raised Muslim, and am gay, too. The look of shock and pity I sometimes get by even the most liberal folks is hindering. It's the gay part that really trips them up, and some ask silly questions in an attempt to fit me into the narrative they expect for a Muslim-born queer like myself. Mike Miksche: ""Some friends joke that I too look like a terrorist."" I don't blame them for their assumptions. These narratives find their way into our collective unconscious because of the horrific stories emerging today, whether it's accounts of the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando or those heartbreaking stories of gay Chechen men being detained, tortured, and killed in the Russian federal republic. These stories also paint a very disturbing image of Islam's relationship with the LGBTQ community, which in turn creates fear, confusion, and anger within the community toward Muslims. LBC's Maajid Nawaz, a Muslim himself, argued on air that the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain who were marching at London Pride this year had the right to be angry at Islam since the only ten countries where being gay may be punishable by death are Muslim majority countries. I agree with their anger. I feel it's just, and I think they should be allowed to express their frustration at pride of all places. There's no doubt that Islam, like most religions, has a history of homophobia as Nawaz points out, but he then provocatively claimed that people like himself—Muslims—are killing gay people. This didn't sit well with me. I concluded that Nawaz can claim that he's somehow responsible for the deaths of gay men by virtue of being Muslim, but he doesn't speak for all Muslims. Neither does the Orlando gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS, Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, or those ten shameful Muslim majority nations who are killing people like me. It's silly that I even have to say it, but my mom isn't responsible for the death of any gay Muslims, and neither are my siblings. Still, some almost seem disappointed to hear that although it was tough coming out, my family now supports me, have met my lovers, and are extremely open-minded about my lifestyle. Hearing this challenges their prejudices that they've formed about people like my family, but there are approximately 1,053,945 Muslims in Canada alone and about 1.6 billion worldwide. To think all Muslims can be painted by the same brush not only lacks nuance but is plain ignorant. It's why I think it's important for me to disclose who I am. The whole family. Photo via the author More recently, Ramie has had friends share Islamophobic memes and clips on social media, knowing full well that he is Muslim. When confronted, they'd dismissed his concern, explaining that he's not really ""one of those people."" ""I just feel like I get written off for any sort of struggles that I have had with being Arab,"" he told me, adding how isolating a feeling it is to be misunderstood like that, as if the sum of who he is, is skin-deep. ""I want to explain to my friends about some of the shit you go through and it's like, 'Uh, you look white. What's the big deal?'"" To me it's a very big deal: Whether people recognize that they hate me or not doesn't ease that gutting anxiety building inside as we continually see xenophobia go mainstream. In light of the mass shooting in the Quebec City mosque, which left six dead and 19 injured, I worry about my mom's safety. She now complains about being harassed or discriminated against in the mall, the bank, the gym, and on the highway. With the rise in hate crimes reported earlier this year against Muslims, I also worry about the type of world my nephews will have to deal with when they really become conscious of their identity. They won't get a chance to live under the radar the way we did. That's why I've learned to speak up more and more, not just for my family, but for anybody who faces discrimination for who they are and what they look like because I believe that we're all in this together.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. ORLANDO, Fla. – A British conglomerate being sued by survivors of the Florida nightclub shooting says it had nothing to do with the gunman's ""terrible actions,"" according to a response to the lawsuit filed this week. G4S PLC says it never directly employed gunman Omar Mateen as a security guard; its subsidiary, G4S Secure Solutions, did. The conglomerate argued in the response filed Monday that it should be dropped from the lawsuit. The parent company said that its subsidiary acted independently and that it didn't have operational control over it. ""G4S ... was not involved with any aspect of Mateen's employment,"" said the response filed in state court in South Florida. The victims' lawsuit contends Mateen's employer could have stopped the attack before last year's massacre at the gay nightclub in which 49 patrons were killed in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The complaint said that G4S bosses knew Mateen was mentally unstable yet continued to employ him as a security guard and didn't seek to have his firearms license revoked, even after he was investigated by the FBI in 2013 for telling co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter. The subsidiary said in its response earlier this month that the lawsuit should be dismissed since Mateen wasn't working for them at the time and didn't use their weapons. The subsidiary said that the lawsuit failed to show G4S Secure Solutions had any legal duty to the survivors and the families of the deceased. ""Thus, while G4S's employees and their families want nothing more than for Mateen's victims and their families to find some semblance of peace, this misguided lawsuit is not the answer,"" said the response. Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, originally was named as a defendant but she was dropped from the lawsuit. Salman, however faces criminal charges in federal court. She has pleaded not guilty to aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing the investigation. Her trial is set for next March.

33,http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/report-assesses-state-police-response-to-nightclub-massacre/2335220,"ORLANDO — The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says it did many things right in responding to a 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub, but could have done better at identifying victims and notifying their relatives, according to an internal review released Friday. The report is a self-review of the FDLE's response to the massacre, although the Orlando Police Department was the primary responding agency. A separate review of the Orlando Police Department's response is still ongoing. The state agency lacked a protocol for identifying victims, notifying their families and returning belongings to families, even though it had the help of the medical examiner's office, according to the review. Victims' relatives gathered at a hospital at first, then were moved to a nearby hotel and then were instructed to go to a nearby senior center. ""When FDLE agents arrived at the hotel for next of kin notification, they encountered chaos and no plan of action for the operational processes,"" said the report, which recommends creating a protocol for identifying victims and next-of-kin notification. The report says there also was a shortage of victim advocates and chaplains to help with the notifications and it recommends creating an emergency list of advocates and chaplains for the future. Family members also became ill when receiving the news, and the report recommends having paramedics on standby when agents are delivering bad news. The agency's report also says that in the rush to get to the scene, agents didn't bring common equipment. The review also says agents relied on their cellphones rather than radios to communicate since they didn't know how to operate their own agency's radios, and it recommends annual training. The review also said federal and state agents sometimes duplicated their investigative leads and that a process should be implemented to eliminate the duplication when it arises. The agency praises itself in international communications, coordinating its agents quickly to the response, its communications with federal and local law enforcement agencies and also providing intelligence analysts to the investigation. The Orlando Sentinel first reported on the review Forty-nine people were killed in the June 12, 2016, massacre at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

34,http://newsblaze.com/usnews/national/gun-ownership-and-violence-the-truth-about-control-and-who-controls-what_84366/,"Whenever there is a mass shooting in the United States, the cry goes out from the left for more “gun control.” But really, what exactly does gun control mean? Perhaps a pragmatic answer is necessary. The reality is this: there are 30,000 gun-related deaths per year by firearms, which is an undisputed fact. Now let’s equate that with the population of the United States of America, which is approximately 325 million people. That means that 0.0925 percent of the nation’s population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is small. But that will not be enough for the hardened anti-gun lobby in this country. Their perspective on gun violence has little to do with facts and everything to do with distorted ideology. That ideology is what they want you to adhere to no matter what. But for the pragmatic American, here is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths in perspective to other causes of death: It can be said that “gun violence” is technically not 30,000 annually. It actually drops to 5,100 when applying the modifiers above There is more to these statistics that is both revealing and eye-opening: Twenty-five percent of all gun crime happens in just four U.S. cities. All four of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of strict laws that is the root cause. This leaves 3,825 gun crimes for the entire rest of the nation. That’s about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some states have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169, while Alabama had one. Stricter gun laws need to be examined. California has the strictest by far. It is not the guns that are causing the problem. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal people residing in those cities and states. The question is this: are 5,100 deaths per year out-of-control? Should this cause more restriction of guns to the law-abiding citizen where legal gun ownership is fairly easy? Now compare gun deaths with other causes: robbery, rape, assault, and murder are all done by criminals. Does anyone think criminals will obey any written laws? Hardly! That is why they are called criminals. Compare gun deaths stats with those from other causes: Why is the focus on gun control? A ten percent reduction in medical errors would be 66 percent of the total gun deaths or four times the number of criminal homicides. The real answer is simple. Taking away guns gives “control” to governments. Which political party is constantly trying to take away the guns and always wants bigger government? The Founding Fathers did not wish to disarm the citizens. They knew the danger of a “controlled” populace. The Second Amendment is an American’s right to bear arms. Criminals will always have guns from illegal sources. That’s why they are called criminals. Remember that the next time some anti-gun zealot screams to reduce your lawful right to bear arms. Also remember the words of Noah Webster: “Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.” A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power. The operative word to concentrate on is not “gun.” It is “control.” Dwight L. Schwab Jr. is a moderate conservative who looks at all sides of a story, then speaks his mind.

37,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/27/trump-lift-limits-military-gear-police/,"Trending: WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to restore the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies under a program that had been sharply curtailed by the Obama administration amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war-fighting gear to confront protesters. Documents obtained by The Associated Press indicate President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order undoing an Obama-era directive that restricted police agencies’ access to the gear that includes grenade launchers, bullet-proof vests, riot shields, firearms and ammunition. Trump’s order would fully restore the program under which “assets that would otherwise be scrapped can be repurposed to help state, local, and tribal law enforcement better protect public safety and reduce crime,” according to the documents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could outline the changes during a Monday speech to the national conference of the Fraternal Order of Police in Nashville, Tennessee, a person familiar with the matter said. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of an official announcement. The changes would be another way in which Trump and Sessions are enacting a law-and-order agenda that views federal support of local police as a way to drive down violent crime. National police organizations have long been pushing Trump to hold his promise to once again make the equipment available to local and state police departments, many of which see it as needed to ensure officers aren’t put in danger when responding to active shooter calls and terrorist attacks. An armored vehicle played a key role in the police response to the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. In 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to give surplus equipment to police to help fight drugs, which then gave way to the fight against terrorism. Groups across the political spectrum have expressed concern about the militarization of police, arguing that the equipment encourages and escalates confrontations with officers.  President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2015 that severely limited the surplus program, partly triggered by public outrage over the use of military gear when during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police responded in riot gear and deployed tear gas, dogs and armored vehicles. At times they also pointed assault rifles at protesters. Obama’s order prohibited the federal government from providing grenade launchers, bayonets, tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, and firearms and ammunition of .50-caliber or greater to police. As of December, the agency overseeing the program had recalled at least 100 grenade launchers, more than 1,600 bayonets and 126 tracked vehicles — those that run on continuous, tank-like tracks instead of wheels — that were provided through the program. Trump vowed to rescind the executive order in a written response to a Fraternal Order of Police questionnaire that helped him win an endorsement from the organization of rank-and-file officers. He reiterated his promise during a gathering of police officers in July, saying the equipment still on the streets is being put to good use. “In fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left,” Trump said. The documents, first reported by USA Today, say Trump’s order would emphasize public safety over the appearance of the heavily equipment. They describe much of the gear as “defensive in nature” intended to protect officers from danger. The Justice Department declined to comment on the expected move. Sessions has said he believes improving morale for local law enforcement is key to curbing spikes in violence in some cities. The plan to restore access to military equipment comes after Sessions has said he intends to pull back on court-enforceable improvement plans with troubled police departments, which he says can malign entire agencies and make officers less aggressive on the street. Consent decrees were a hallmark of the Obama administration’s efforts to overhaul certain agencies, sometimes after racially charged encounters like the one in Ferguson.

""Just a few summers ago, our nation watched as Ferguson raised the specter of increased police militarization. The law enforcement response there and in too many places across the country demonstrated how perilous, especially for Black and Brown communities, a militarized police force can be,"" the LDF said. ""The President's decision to make this change in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville and against a backdrop of frayed relations between police and communities of color further reflects this administration's now open effort to escalate racial tensions in our country,"" the organization said.

They describe much of the gear as ""defensive in nature"" intended to protect officers from danger. The Justice Department declined to comment on the expected move. Most police agencies rarely require military equipment for daily use but see a need to have it available, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ""It is hard to imagine any situation where a grenade launcher or bayonet would be something that a major police department would need, but defensive shields and armored vehicles kept on reserve will be welcome,"" he said. Sessions has said he believes improving morale for local law enforcement is key to curbing spikes in violence in some cities. The plan to restore access to military equipment comes after Sessions has said he intends to pull back on court-enforceable improvement plans with troubled police departments, which he says can malign entire agencies and make officers less aggressive on the street. Consent decrees were a hallmark of the Obama administration's efforts to overhaul certain agencies, sometimes after racially charged encounters like the one in Ferguson.

                    Dr. Chad Williams Editor’s Note: After a shooting killed nine people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, educator Dr. Chad Williams wondered how he and other educators could make sense of the tragedy for students. He founded the hashtag #CharlestonSyllabus on Twitter, where educators came together online to offer teaching ideas, resources and support for each other. Williams explains why he and others rallied around the hashtag online in the aftermath of the shooting. As a professional historian and college professor, I am expected to remain emotionally detached from the present. Personal feelings must be kept at bay, lest they affect my “objectivity” and fair judgement.  But in the aftermath of the June 17 massacre of nine black men and women by a white supremacist in Charleston, South Carolina’s historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, my resolve was challenged like never before. I absorbed the news of the terrorist attack in stunned disbelief. As details unfolded about what took place, I wrestled with a range of raw emotions: sadness, grief, disgust, rage. The sheer horror of the shooting initially filled me with hopelessness. In the following days, I felt alone at times in my anger and frustration. My mind eventually shifted to the historical significance of the Charleston shooting and how, as a teacher, I would have to inevitably grapple with this event in the classroom. I grew increasingly frustrated by the lack of historical knowledge informing discussions about the tragedy in the media and amongst the general public. But then I recalled the #FergusonSyllabus, developed by Georgetown University professor Marcia Chatelain, that used Twitter to marshal resources for educators in the aftermath of the Mike Brown shooting and subsequent protests. Having used the #FergusonSyllabus in my own teaching, I thought perhaps a similarly crowd-sourced #CharlestonSyllabus would be a good idea. I reached out to some of my colleagues on the evening of June 19. We started tweeting out suggested readings using the hashtag #CharlestonSyllabus. To my great surprise and pleasure, additional recommendations began pouring in. Within an hour, #CharlestonSyllabus was trending. Just what is the #CharlestonSyllabus? Most simply, the #CharlestonSyllabus is a list of nearly 300 books, articles, novels, primary source documents, films, songs, children’s literature and educational websites that provide historical context for the Charleston shooting and the various issues related to it. University of Iowa professor Keisha Blain, with the assistance of a several librarians who generously volunteered their services, compiled the resource page, which is located on the website of the African American Intellectual History Society. Organized thematically, the readings cover issues such as the history of African Americans in South Carolina, slavery in the United States, the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Confederate flag, southern racial violence, the black church, and the civil rights movement. While by no means definitive, this list offers teachers, students and the general public an excellent introduction to African American history and the legacies of race in American society. As a Twitter hashtag, #CharlestonSyllabus is also an exciting teaching tool. Compared to some seasoned veterans, I am a relative newcomer to Twitter. But I have witnessed its power to spark a new civil rights movement with #BlackLivesMatter, as well as advance innovative pedagogy with hashtags like #HipHopEd. Whenever I prepare a course syllabus, I always ask, “What are the best ways that I can connect with my students?” Given the significance of the Charleston massacre, it is imperative that we use every tool at our disposal to engage with students in the language they understand. A Twitter generation of students requires a Twitter-literate generation of teachers who can effectively translate this medium into the classroom. The #CharlestonSyllabus is also a vibrant, diverse, socially conscious community of people. This was something I needed in the aftermath of the shooting. And as people from all over the world, from different backgrounds and professions, with varying levels of education and knowledge about race began using the hashtag, it became clear that #CharlestonSyllabus was more than a list of books. “This is what I needed to help process & understand,” an appreciative woman tweeted. “#CharlestonSyllabus is one of the most positive and educational things I have seen in a very long time,” another person wrote. Historians, librarians, teachers at every grade level and thousands of other individuals committed to learning and true social change have come together around #CharlestonSyllabus. The results have been awe-inspiring. Soon, other educators and I will begin to prepare our syllabi and lesson plans for the start of classes in the fall. How will we talk about the Charleston shooting and its aftermath? Hopefully the #CharlestonSyllabus will make answering this question a little less daunting and make our work even more fulfilling.

43,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/19/shell-casings-found-at-club-linked-to-g/,"Police have matched shell casings found after a mass shooting at a Little Rock nightclub last month to a gun Memphis rapper Ricky Hampton's bodyguard was carrying, the department reported Friday. Kentrell Gwynn, 25, faces 10 counts of aggravated assault, one for each shot he's accused of firing at Power Ultra Lounge in the early morning hours of July 1. Police spokesman Lt. Steve McClanahan said investigators believe Gwynn was one of several people who opened fire during a dispute between rival gangs at the now-shuttered club. Twenty-five people at the club were injured by gunfire. Three others were injured as panicked clubgoers fled the business at 220 W. Sixth St. The shooting made international headlines and led state, local and federal authorities to form an investigative force aimed at addressing broader violent crime issues in the city. Gwynn is the first person charged in the shooting. ""This is a deal where we had to wait on forensics and that's what we did,"" McClanahan said. ""We waited and we subsequently matched 10 rounds from inside the club to the weapon he had."" Aggravated assault, as partly defined under Arkansas law, occurs when someone ""engages in conduct that creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury,"" and does so ""under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life."" Gwynn and Hampton, who was performing at the club when the shooting occurred, were arrested July 2 in Birmingham, Ala., on charges unrelated to the Little Rock shooting. Authorities reportedly found a .40-caliber Glock pistol in the car Gwynn was driving at the time of their arrests. Gwynn also had a loaded .40-caliber Springfield XD pistol strapped to his thigh, according to a federal affidavit. Authorities reported July 18 that .40-caliber Sig Sauer shell casings had been found at Power Ultra Lounge after the shooting, and that at least one round found at the club had been ""preliminarily matched"" to the Springfield XD pistol Gwynn was carrying. Gwynn of Memphis was being held at the Pulaski County jail Friday when he was served with warrants on the aggravated assault charges. An affidavit filed in connection with the charges was sealed. Little Rock police did not release further details. Gwynn was indicted earlier this month on federal gun charges. He's accused of providing Hampton with a machine-gun-style pistol, even though he knew Hampton was a convicted felon who could not legally possess a gun. Hampton, who goes by the stage name Finese2Tymes, was indicted on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He also faces state charges in a shooting outside a Forrest City nightclub in June. Hampton, 25, is accused of shooting out a car window and injuring a woman inside the vehicle. Both have pleaded innocent to the federal charges. They're scheduled to go to trial Sept. 18 in U.S. District Court in Little Rock. McClanahan said an investigation of the nightclub shooting is ongoing. ""We're still looking for additional shooters,"" he said.

48,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/alabama-gop-senate-primary-donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell,"Despite Trump’s endorsement for Luther Strange, former Alabama supreme court chief justice Roy Moore is leading the polls ahead of Tuesday’s election Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.39 GMT Tuesday’s Senate primary in Alabama will be a test of how far Donald Trump’s endorsement can sway an election. The three men leading the tight race on the Republican side have all been enthusiastic about the president.  Congressman Mo Brooks has said he votes with Trump’s agenda “95% of the time”, while former Alabama supreme court chief justice Roy Moore and incumbent senator Luther Strange have both reached higher for inspiration. “President Trump is the greatest thing that has happened to this country,” Strange said this summer. “I consider it a biblical miracle that he’s there.” “God puts people in positions in positions he wants,” said Moore in May. “I believe he sent Donald Trump in there to do what Donald Trump can do.” But it was Strange who won Trump’s endorsement, the president tweeting on 8 August: “Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!” The move was seen as a victory for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who is backing Strange, and a blow to Brooks in particular. The Alabama congressman had criticized the president for his public attacks on Jeff Sessions, whose appointment as Trump’s attorney general led to him leaving the Senate and a special election for his seat. But despite Trump’s endorsement, Moore is leading in the polls – although he faces a tough path to victory. Alabama requires candidates to get 50% of the vote in a primary to clinch their party’s nomination, so the three Republican candidates are all vying for two spots in a September runoff. Moore is a controversial figure who has twice been forced from his position as the state’s chief justice. First, in 2003, he was ousted for violating a federal court’s order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from grounds of the Alabama supreme court and then, in 2016, he was suspended for refusing to enforce the supreme court’s ruling on gay marriage. Recently, he told the Guardian that “maybe Putin is right” and “more akin to me than I know” given the Russian leader’s stance on gay marriage. Moore also suggested that the US could be described using Reagan’s words about Russia as “the focus of evil”. “You could say that about America, couldn’t you?” he said. “We promote a lot of bad things.” A specific example, Moore said, was gay marriage. But while Moore is leading in polls in Tuesday’s primary, he might have a difficult time getting a majority in a runoff. His most likely opponent in a two-man race is Strange, a hulking 6ft 9in former college basketball player who reached the Senate under controversial circumstances. As Alabama’s attorney general, he was conducting an investigation of then-governor Robert Bentley for ethics violations related to an extramarital affair. Bentley appointed him to replace Sessions, sparking accusations he was doing so in order to impede the investigation. The governor later resigned from office and pled guilty to two misdemeanor charges. Strange has been the beneficiary of millions of dollars of spending from the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super Pac closely tied to McConnell. Most of the money has gone to attack Brooks, in an attempt to keep the four-term member of Congress from earning the second place in the runoff. Brooks is a member of the Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group that has long been a thorn in the side of House Republican leadership. In contrast, Strange has been a steadfastly loyal vote for McConnell since joining the Senate. The result is that Brooks has turned his campaign into a referendum on the Senate majority leader and the “swamp” in Washington. Brooks’s campaign bus is bedecked with a sign that says “ditch Mitch” and his campaign rhetoric echoes Trump’s demands that the Senate end the legislative filibuster. The problem for Brooks, who has gained the backing of many of most ardent pro-Trump media personalities like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, is that Trump endorsed Strange, sending out his tweet again early on Monday morning. A Super Pac tied to Trump has also announced that it will spend $200,000 on Strange’s behalf to get out the vote. The president added on Tuesday morning: Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange, he will be great! Despite his backing for Strange being interpreted as a win for McConnell, Trump has since echoed Brooks in repeatedly criticizing  the Senate majority leader in recent days for failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In a new campaign ad, Brooks appeals directly to Trump, calling McConnell and Strange “weak” and telling the president that they failed him. Brooks caused controversy with a previous campaign ad that used his experience as a survivor of June’s mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice to show his commitment to gun rights. Moore has tried to dismiss the President’s endorsement of Strange, saying on Wednesday: “I think the people are not voting for President Trump. They’re voting for his agenda, which I firmly believe in.” On the Democratic side, an unknown named Robert K Kennedy is currently beating Democratic favorite Doug Jones in polls. Jones is a former US attorney who has been endorsed by party luminaries including Joe Biden and John Lewis. But neither is considered to have much of a chance of beating the Republicans in this deep red state. Even if Moore, considered the most vulnerable candidate at the general election, were to become the nominee, he would still win, said Liam Donovan, a former NRSC staffer. “The Trump era has shifted the political winds” towards the GOP in Alabama, said Donovan, noting that while Moore isn’t “the most popular guy in Alabama”, the tight margin in the United States Senate means Republicans would loyally back the controversial judge in a general election.",2017-08-15 06:00:11,'A biblical miracle': Alabama GOP Senate primary set to test Trump's reach,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

The neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website appeared to be offline late Monday after Google said it would cancel the hate site's domain registration following its migration from GoDaddy earlier in the day. Attempts to reach the website, which has been called the ""top hate site in America,"" on the surface web weren't completed and sometimes hung at a screen from Cloudflare, which provides security from DDoS attacks to the site. Other times, the site displayed a message from Andrew Anglin, the site's publisher, saying it was experiencing an outage. ""We're having an outage,"" the message read. ""It'll be a minute."" It also directed readers to the site's channel on Discord, a voice chat program used mostly by gamers, which previously tweeted that it had shut down the server and banned several related accounts. Love. Not hate. pic.twitter.com/5xFpvHTuI2 Google confirmed in an email it was cancelling The Daily Stormer's registration with its Google Domains service for violating the terms of service. Anglin didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The apparent disappearance of The Daily Stormer from the web comes after a weekend of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the site had helped organize a white supremacist rally. The violence claimed the life of a woman protesting the white supremacists when a car plowed into a group of people. A post by The Daily Stormer about the incident caused GoDaddy to revoke its domain registration prompting the website to register with Google. Domain providers direct internet users and search engines to a site's URL. ""We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service,"" GoDaddy said in a tweet Sunday, adding in an emailed statement, ""If no action is taken after 24 hours, we will cancel the service."" We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service. A message from Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based company, is sometimes displayed when trying to access the The Daily Stormer. Cloudflare provides internet performance and security services, but doesn't host content. Without naming The Daily Stormer, Cloudflare acknowledged concerns had been raised over some sites that used its network. ""We find the content on some of these sites repugnant,"" a spokeswoman said in an email. ""While our policy is to not comment on any user specifically, we are cooperating with law enforcement in any investigation."" GoDaddy pointed to a hate-filled post on The Daily Stormer that focused on Heather Heyer, the woman killed over the weekend. ""Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service,"" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Hours after GoDaddy's statement, a post on The Daily Stormer, which was the subject of a CNET profile last month, said the site had been taken over by hacktivist group Anonymous. ""WE HAVE TAKEN THIS SITE IN THE NAME OF HEATHER HEYER,"" the post read, adding she was ""A VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM."" Anonymous acknowledged the post through a Twitter account but didn't confirm it was involved. Instead, the hacking collective suggested it might be an elaborate stunt by Anglin and mooted he might be having difficulty a new domain registrar. ""This is likely to be the derps from dailystormer engaging in a silly troll to woo their clueless base,"" reads the tweet from @YourAnonNews. ""If we're proven wrong, so be it.""

50,http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/surprising-no-one-gop-leaders-hesitate-investigate-white-supremacy/2045828/," GOP politicians scored political points this weekend when they condemned the actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville andÂ President Donald Trump's refusal toÂ denounce the far-right marchers. Everyone from House SpeakerÂ Paul Ryan to former presidential candidate Mitt Romney got in on the action,Â andÂ even Texas Senator Ted Cruz had no problem condemning the hate on display. But these may just be words:Â Republican leaders areÂ avoiding investigations into white supremacy, per aÂ Politico report. The House Judiciary Committee has no plans to hold hearings on the growing violence of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in the U.S., according to aides, despite the call to do so from HouseÂ Democrats. The calls for action came after an Aug. 12 white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent, and an attendee at the alt-right rallyÂ mowed down anti-racist counter-protesters, leaving one dead. But many DemocratsÂ are worried that that it's not enough. California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa told Politico,Â âOthers think this is not an issue for Congress? I think it's front and center for us."" He said that he would reach out to committee chair Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, about holding a separate hearing on white supremacy and domestic terrorism. Speaker Ryan's office reportedlyÂ deferredÂ questions on potential action to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Ryan's office would not say whether or not he believes congressional action isÂ warranted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's officeÂ reportedlyÂ said ""that it's up to individual committee chairs to set their own hearing schedule."" This is not just a recent problem. New York Rep. Jerrod Nadler told Politico thatÂ Democrats have been trying unsuccessfully for months to request hearingsÂ on domestic terrorism. The Charlottesville attackÂ came only months after the Trump administration reportedly shifted a counter-terrorism unit's focus to just ""Islamic extremism,"" despite continued warnings from U.S. intelligence agencies that far-right white supremacists are becoming increasingly more violent. And yet: Republican Congress members have been largely hesitant to act. Sen. Cruz is one of a small number of GOP politicians who has called for an investigation into domestic terrorism and white supremacist extremism. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also condemned the attack which left one woman dead and approximately 19 others injured as domestic terrorism; he also said the Department of Justice is pursuing the case. But that isn't enough for some, who see other politicians, such as Ryan and Romney, capitalize on such a horrific event by offering the equivalent of ""thoughts and prayers"" after a mass shootingÂ or a terrorist attack. It's sadly unsurprising that the same party that has passed gerrymandering laws that target minority voters; that supports building a border wall; and that is systematically dismantling the DOJ's civil rights division is coming up empty when it comes toÂ investigating and attempting to dismantleÂ white supremacy.

52,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2017/08/18/Calif-mass-murderer-escapes-death-penalty/5181503094452/,"Aug. 18 (UPI) -- The man responsible for Orange County, Calif.'s, deadliest mass shooting avoided the death sentence Friday after a judge ruled prosecutorial misconduct made such a determination impossible. Instead, Scott Evans Dekraai was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms without parole.
Advertisement Dekraai, 47, pleaded guilty in 2014 to gunning down eight people including his ex-wife at the hair salon where she worked in Seal Beach in October, 2011. Dekraai's motive was anger over a custody dispute. Dekraai was apprehended minutes after the shooting, was identified by eye-witnesses and never denied he was the shooter. Despite the overwhelming evidence against his client, Dekraai's attorney, Scott Sanders, succeeded in shifting the focus in the case away from the crime and onto the conduct of the Orange County Sheriff's Office and county prosecutors. Sanders repeatedly argued before Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals that prosecutors used bogus tactics to secure damaging information about his client and others, and had repeatedly suppressed evidence that could have proved helpful in mounting a defense.
RELATED Civil rights commission slams Trump transgender military ban At the center of the alleged misconduct was a jailhouse informant ring Sanders said was run by deputies and knowingly supported by prosecutors that saw certain inmates give damaging testimony against others in exchange for preferential treatment by jail guards. He said dozens or even hundreds of other cases could have been tainted by testimony using the system. After the allegations, county prosecutors recused themselves and state prosecutors stepped in to handle the case. A separate grand jury empaneled to investigate the allegations found them to be without merit, but Goethals said the level of prosecutorial misconduct Sanders unearthed was serious enough he'd become convinced the county could not provide an environment that would produce a fair sentencing verdict. He said failing to step in and end the trial before the death penalty phase would have been ""unthinkable.""

Prosecutors have the option of appealing the judge's ruling, but have not said whether they intend to do so. Family members of the victims were split on whether Dekraai should be put to death, with several, including Dekraai's former brother-in-law, speaking out against the DA's office and sheriff's department.

""Notwithstanding the issues that were raised by the court's ruling, we believe the defendant would have received a fair trial during the penalty phase of the criminal proceedings. The decision to remove the death penalty rests at the feet of Judge Goethals and nobody else."" The California attorney general's office and the U.S. Justice Department are still conducting separate investigations into the misconduct allegations.

In Baltimore, Mayor Catherine Pugh said she's ready to tear down all of her city's Confederate statues, and the city council voted to have them destroyed. San Antonio lawmakers are looking ahead to removing a statue that many people wrongly assumed represented a famed Texas leader who died at the Alamo. Some people refused to wait. Protesters in Durham, N.C., toppled a nearly century-old statue of a Confederate soldier Monday at a rally against racism. Activists took a ladder up to the statue and used a rope to pull down the Confederate Soldiers Monument that was dedicated in 1924. A diverse crowd of dozens cheered as the statue of a soldier holding a rifle fell to the ground in front of an old courthouse building that now houses local government offices. The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., is fueling another re-evaluation of Confederate statues in cities across the nation, accelerating their removal in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist renewed pressure to take down the Confederate flag from public property. ""We should not glorify a part of our history in front of our buildings that really is a testament to America's original sin,"" Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe said Monday after the statue known as ""Old Joe"" was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904. A county spokesman said he did not know if the statue was removed because of the events that killed one person and injured dozens more Saturday in Charlottesville. But many officials who were horrified by the confrontation soon began publicizing plans to take down statues. The Southern Poverty Law Center last year counted more than 1,500 things around the country named after Confederate figures or dedicated to the Confederacy, including holidays, statues, flags, and the names of cities, counties, schools, and parks. Nearly half are monuments, which are in 24 states. Most of the dedications are in the South, but 24 are in the North and 21 in states that did not exist at the time of the Civil War. In Jacksonville, Fla., City Council President Anna Brosche ordered an immediate inventory of all of the Confederate statues in her city in preparation for their removal. ""These monuments, memorials, and markers represent a time in our history that caused pain to so many,"" she said Monday. Lexington, Ky., Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the weekend bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. San Antonio Councilman Robert Trevino is promoting a measure that would remove the Confederate statue at the center of Travis Park, where for years people have mistakenly identified the figure as being that of Col. William Travis, a Texas hero who died at the Alamo. ""This is not an important art piece, but a monument to power. It was put in to remind people of that power. It is an unfortunate message of hate, and we think it's important to relocate it."" Mr. Trevino said Monday. ""We do think that history is important so we're looking for an appropriate location for it."" St. Louis dismantled its Confederate Monument in Forest Park in June, giving it to the Missouri Civil War Museum after years of debate. In Baltimore, Mayor Pugh announced Monday that she would move forward with the removal of Baltimore's statues of Roger B. Taney, a Marylander who wrote the 1856 Dred Scott Supreme Court ruling that denied citizenship to African-Americans, and a statue of two Virginians, Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Pugh said she was making plans to send the statues to cemeteries with Confederate dead outside the city. But hours later, the city council voted unanimously to have the statues destroyed instead of moved. It was unclear whether anything would happen to the statues immediately. Seconds after the monument fell in Durham on Monday, protesters began kicking the crumpled bronze monument. In response, Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper tweeted: ""The racism and deadly violence in Charlottesville is unacceptable but there is a better way to remove these monuments."" Back in May, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu moved his city's four main Confederate statues, including a statue of Lee, at night after threats of violence from Confederate sympathizers and white supremacists. Pugh said she is consulting with Mayor Landrieu, now head of the United States Conference of Mayors, about the removal of Baltimore's statues and the cost. The violence in Charlottesville will probably speed up efforts to do away with the monuments, experts said. The convergence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis with Confederate imagery in Charlottesville will make it difficult for government agencies to defend having Confederate statues on their property, Boston University history professor Heather Cox Richardson said. ""The idea that this somehow is about Southern heritage, I think that ship sailed,"" said Professor Richardson, who teaches and writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction and Southern politics. Violence and death changes things, agreed University of Georgia political science professor M.V. ""Trey"" Hood III. Photos of gunman Dylan Roof, who fatally shot nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, showed him with a Confederate flag and triggered a swift ""sea change"" in perception of the banner, Dr. Hood said. Then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley successfully led calls to bring down a Confederate flag that had flown on Statehouse grounds for 54 years. Other cities and organizations began accelerating their removal of Confederate imagery following Roof's arrest. Now local officials will find it harder to ignore or shelve questions about Confederate statues, Dr. Richardson said. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

          / CBS/AP FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A veteran Florida deputy has been arrested on accusations that he recorded video of a gunman opening fire inside the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in January, reports CBS Miami. Two days after five died and six were wounded in a Jan. 6 mass shooting at the airport, video surfaced on TMZ.com showing the shooter walking through a terminal, opening fire on passengers. Esteban Santiago, 26, has pleaded not guilty to 22 federal charges in the case. Michael Dingman, 47, was suspended with pay later that month. On Wednesday, he turned himself in to law enforcement, reports the Sun-Sentinel. Dingman faces several charges, including using a two-way communication device (a cell phone) to commit a felony and tampering/fabricating physical evidence. In an arrest report obtained by the Sun-Sentinel Dingman is quoted by a detective insisting he wasn't paid for any video related to the shooting. Deputy Jeff Bell, president of the Broward deputies union, said Dingman will have a strong defense. Investigators said Dingman destroyed the phone he used to secretly record the video and later transferred his service to a new phone. Dingman was released on $2,000 bail.

(Photo by Shel Hershorn/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) What Austin was like in 1966 The city of Austin was just a sleepy college town in 1966. It would grow by leaps and bounds with the next few 50 years into a community influence by tech companies, musicians, and transplants looking for an undefinable Texas vibe. Sixth Street Sixth Street wasn’t the carnival
of bars and nightlife it would come to be by the ‘80s and ‘90s. It was rather
in decline, with only scattered shops and vacant buildings, a sort of skid row.
I-35’s construction in 1959 separated the street’s east and west sides,
creating a barrier somewhat. College life was concentrated on Guadalupe Street,
or “The Drag” as came to be known.  Reverberation Roky Erickson of the 13th Floor Elavators performs on the Larry Kane Show in 1967, in Houston Texas. The Austin-based band released its debut album in the months after the tower massacre. Lead single ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" was already a hit that summer. John Lennon told the London Evening Standard that the group was ""more popular than Jesus"" in a March 1966 interview, sparking outcry from Christians around the world. The group's ""Paperback Writer"" dominated the charts during the summer of 1966. “In my recollection, in 1966, Austin was a hotbed of liberals and 
cowboys and the university crowd,” Larry Todd, the second news 
director at TV and radio station KHFI told the Austin American Statesman recently. Governor Connally Texas Governor John B. Connally standing outside of the state capitol while being surrounded by autograph seekers in 1966. Connally would serve as governor from 1963 until 1969. He also knew something about sniper fire, sadly. Burning temperatures The hottest day of 1966 was July
31. The high temperature that day was 99 degrees, closing out the hottest month
of the year in Austin. Some of Whitman's victims that would survive would not only be shot but also suffer severe burns from the pavement they fell on.  It was 51 years ago Tuesday that ex-Marine Charles Whitman walked to the top of the University of Texas' 307-foot clock tower and shot at students and Austin residents for more than 90 minutes. Using an array of firearms he killed 15 people and wounded 32 during his Aug. 1, 1966, killing spree. A trained Marine sniper, he shot most of his victims near the heart. PREVIOUS: Survivors of 1966 shooting at UT remember dead Whitman killed his mother and wife in the hours before he began shooting from his perch in the observation deck of the 27-story clock tower, just before noon. He wanted to spare them the shame of living with his deeds to come. During his terrorizing episode he shot a pregnant woman, Claire Wilson, killing her unborn child with a gunshot to the head while still in the womb. Wilson survived but would not be able to have any more children. The child was the 16th Whitman victim, yet sometimes the baby is not listed in the final tally of the dead. In the minutes after Whitman began shooting, some UT students on campus grabbed deer rifles from cars and dorms and attempted to stop him. RELATED: Decades later, debate remains over who killed UT shooter Charles Whitman Whitman was so terrifyingly accurate with his high-powered rifle that he shot people as far as 500 yards away. Texas Monthly published a strong 40th anniversary oral history piece on the shootings in 2006. Author Gary Lavergne's 1987 book ""A Sniper in the Tower"" tackled the subject in a way few had done before that point. NPR spoke with Lavergne last year about mental health laws and gun violence, recounting how Whitman told a school psychiatrist he had a dark fantasy involving shooting people from that tower. The official didn't think anything of the remark. Whitman, Lavergne noted, seemed to be a normal person with flaws like anxiety and depression, but he was manipulative. A 17th death would be attributed to Whitman when in November 2001 David Gunby died of injuries he suffered when he was wounded 35 years earlier. He had been shot in the lower back, destroying his kidney, leading to a kidney transplant and a life of dialysis treatments. RELATED: Officer who shot UT sniper in 1966 dies at 72 Whitman also wounded 32 people in the spree, many who have gone on to tell their stories to the world. As the mayhem continued on the UT campus, Austin police officers Houston McCoy and Ramiro Martinez made their move on the shooter, confronting him after climbing into the sniper's lair. McCoy fired twice with his 12-gauge shotgun, hitting Whitman in the face. Officer Ramiro Martinez also fired on Whitman, emptying his service revolver into him. An autopsy performed on Whitman found that he had been suffering from a brain tumor. He had been complaining of headaches and mental health issues for some time, and relayed as much in his suicide note. The autopsy report stated that he had a glioblastoma, a variety of brain tumor, which was pressing the part of the brain that controlled emotional patterns. It was reportedly the size of a walnut. The Austin American Statesman created a powerful and insightful multimedia package diving into the story of Whitman, his victims and the aftermath of the shooting spree that can be seen here. LONGHORN PRIDE: Legends, secrets and myths of University of Texas at Austin One of the rifles used to carry out one of the worst killing sprees in Texas history is now on display at the Crime Museum in the U.S. capitol. The Remington 700 rifle used by Whitman was obtained from a private collector,the museum said. The buyer preferred that it not sit in a closet collecting dust and wanted it to be an educational piece. While Whitman perpetrated the first recognized mass shooting at an education institution in U.S. history, the police that day learned a powerful lesson. The efforts of law enforcement to finally take him down in a hail of gunfire on the observation deck ultimately led to the creation of SWAT teams across the country.

Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, moved leaders across the country to plan to wipe away much of the remaining Old South imagery. Only two statues were taken down immediately, in Gainesville, Florida, where the Daughters of the Confederacy removed a statue of a Confederate soldier known as ""Ole Joe,"" and in Durham, North Carolina, where protesters used a rope to pull down a Confederate monument dedicated in 1924. But the anti-Confederate momentum seemed to ensure that other memorials would come down soon. Many local and state governments announced that they would remove statues and other imagery from public land, or consider doing so, in the aftermath of Saturday's white nationalist rally that killed one person and injured dozens more. The changes were publicized as President Donald Trump defended Confederate statues in wide-ranging remarks. ""This week it's Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson's coming down,"" Trump said during a visit to Trump Tower in New York. ""I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Asked specifically whether Charlottesville's Lee statue should come down, he said: ""I would say that's up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located."" All around the country, Republican and Democratic officials at the state and local levels moved swiftly to begin a process to remove the statues. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he would ask the Legislature to reverse a 2015 law signed by his Republican predecessor, Pat McCrory, that prevents the removal or relocation of monuments, and to defeat a measure giving immunity to motorists who strike protesters. He also planned to ask state officials to determine the cost of moving Confederate statues and to give him options of where they could go. ""Our Civil War history is important, but it belongs in textbooks and museums — not a place of allegiance on our Capitol grounds,"" Cooper said in a statement. In Maryland, GOP Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday he would push to remove the statue of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the infamous Dred Scott ruling in 1857 affirming slavery, from state land. ""While we cannot hide from our history, nor should we, the time has come to make clear the difference between properly acknowledging our past and glorifying the darkest chapters of our history,"" said Hogan, who before had resisted calls to move the statue. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings announced plans Tuesday to ask his city council to appoint a task force to study the fate of the city's Confederate statues. Rawlings said he personally finds the monuments to be ""dangerous totems,"" but a task force would ensure a productive conversation. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, called on state officials Monday to remove a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate cavalry general and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Tennessee Capitol. Protesters earlier draped a black jacket over the head of the bust while cheering, ""Tear it down!"" Similar plans were being made in Baltimore and San Antonio, as well as Lexington, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; and elsewhere. In Durham, Sheriff Mike Andrews said protesters who toppled a nearly century-old Confederate statue in front of a North Carolina government building would face felony charges. The Confederate Soldiers Monument, dedicated in 1924, stood in front of an old courthouse that how houses local government offices. The crumpled and dented bronze figure has been taken to a warehouse for storage. Deputies later arrested Takiyah Thompson, who identified herself Tuesday as the woman who tied the rope that was used to tear it down. She said her actions were justified because Confederate statues represent white supremacy. A law professor and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University in San Antonio called removal a ""slippery slope,"" saying judging historical figures through a modern lens can be difficult. ""A healthy democracy and people within that democracy should be able to say, 'This is our history.' And history is made up of actions of human beings, and human beings aren't perfect,"" said Jeffrey F. Addicott, who stressed he was speaking for himself and not the law school. Statues, he added, can be moved, but he's opposed to them being ""put in a warehouse never to be seen again because then you're kind of erasing or rewriting history."" The Sons of Confederate Veterans condemned attempts to take down Confederate statues around the country. ""These statues were erected over 100 year ago to honor the history of the United States,"" added Thomas V. Strain Jr., the group's commander in chief. ""They're just as important to the entire history of the U.S. as the monuments erected to our forefathers."" Strain, who said his group did not participate in Charlottesville, condemned the Klan, white nationalist groups, neo-Nazis and other extremists. ""It's painful to watch for lack of better words,"" he said. ""It was our family that fought, and it was our families that died, and now we have these knuckleheads hijacking the flag for their own purposes."" But city and state officials said Charlottesville convinced them it's time to move on from having Confederate imagery in prominent public places. In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the Charlottesville bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. ""This is the right time,"" Gray said Monday. ""We accelerated that because of the events in Charlottesville, but I knew that it was the right thing to do.""

The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is fueling another re-evaluation of Confederate statues in cities across the nation, accelerating their removal in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist renewed pressure to take down the Confederate flag from public property. “We should not glorify a part of our history in front of our buildings that really is a testament to America’s original sin,” Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe said Monday after the statue known as “Old Joe” was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904. A county spokesman said he did not know if the statue was removed because of the events that killed one person and injured dozens more Saturday in Charlottesville. But many officials who were horrified by the confrontation soon began publicizing plans to take down statues. The Southern Poverty Law Center last year counted more than 1,500 things around the country named after Confederate figures or dedicated to the Confederacy, including holidays, statues, flags and the names of cities, counties, schools and parks. Nearly half are monuments, which are in 24 states. Most of the dedications are in the South, but 24 are in the North and 21 in states that did not exist at the time of the Civil War.

William Travis, a Texas hero who died at the Alamo. “This is not an important art piece, but a monument to power. It was put in to remind people of that power. It is an unfortunate message of hate, and we think it’s important to relocate it.” Trevino said Monday. “We do think that history is important so we’re looking for an appropriate location for it.” St. Louis dismantled its Confederate Monument in Forest Park in June, giving it to the Missouri Civil War Museum after years of debate. In Baltimore, Pugh announced Monday that she would move forward with the removal of Baltimore’s statues of Roger B. Taney, a Marylander who wrote the 1856 Dred Scott supreme court ruling that denied citizenship to African-Americans, and a statue of two Virginians, Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Pugh said she was making plans to send the statues to cemeteries with Confederate dead outside the city. But hours later, the city council voted unanimously to have the statues destroyed instead of moved. It was unclear whether anything would happen to the statues immediately. Seconds after the monument fell in Durham on Monday, protesters began kicking the crumpled bronze monument. In response, Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper tweeted: “The racism and deadly violence in Charlottesville is unacceptable but there is a better way to remove these monuments.” Back in May, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu moved his city’s four main Confederate statues, including a statue of Lee, at night after threats of violence from Confederate sympathizers and white supremacists. Pugh said she is consulting with Landrieu, now head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, about the removal of Baltimore’s statues and the cost. The violence in Charlottesville will probably speed up efforts to do away with the monuments, experts said. The convergence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis with Confederate imagery in Charlottesville will make it difficult for government agencies to defend having Confederate statues on their property, Boston University history professor Heather Cox Richardson said. “The idea that this somehow is about Southern heritage, I think that ship sailed,” said Richardson, who teaches and writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction and Southern politics. Violence and death changes things, agreed University of Georgia political science professor M.V. “Trey” Hood III. Photos of gunman Dylan Roof, who fatally shot nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, showed him with a Confederate flag and triggered a swift “sea change” in perception of the banner, Hood said. Then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley successfully led calls to bring down a Confederate flag that had flown on Statehouse grounds for 54 years. Other cities and organizations began accelerating their removal of Confederate imagery following Roof’s arrest. Now local officials will find it harder to ignore or shelve questions about Confederate statues, Richardson said. “It was always possible for people to look the other way,” she said. “After Charlottesville, I do not see how Americans can look the other way. You have to make a choice at this moment.”  ___ Jesse J. Holland covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press in Washington.

Michael Campina/Special to the Post and Courier Police respond to a reported shooting scene on King Street in Charleston. Grace Beahm Alofrd/Staff A disgruntled man with a gun killed a former co-worker at a popular Charleston restaurant Thursday and took at least one other person hostage for hours until police shot him. Terrified lunchtime diners crawled and ran from Virginia’s on King after the gunman barged in after noon, locked the door and announced “I am the new king of Charleston,” witnesses said. Police sirens wailed in the busy commercial district, and officers blanketed the downtown streets, a scene that served as a startling reminder of an episode two years earlier when a gunman shot nine church worshippers to death in a race-motivated crime a quarter of a mile away. But the officers contained the shooter on the second floor of the King Street restaurant before they could take him down during a tactical operation. The suspect, described as an older man, was critically wounded. No one else was hurt. Shane Whiddon. Provided The Charleston County Coroner's Office identified the victim as 37-year-old Anthony Shane Whiddon, of Goose Creek. Whiddon was the executive chef at Virginia's, the coroner's office said. He was transported to Medical University Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Whiddon moved to Charleston to serve as opening chef for the now-closed Union Provisions. He previously held a line cook job at Charleston Grill. Before relocating to Charleston, he worked at Sea Island Company, a Georgia resort. The father of two children, Whiddon joined Virginia’s in 2016. He was just getting comfortable in his role as executive chef, according to colleagues who cited his pride over a recent photo shoot at the restaurant. John Aquino, who works in the Virginia's building, said a manager was texting co-workers from a closet as the gunman kept hostages. “I heard that a dishwasher got fired and came back in and shot the chef,"" he said. The authorities offered conflicting accounts of how many people had been captive. One person was safely removed afterward, city officials said in a statement after initially indicating that a group had been held. ""This was not an act of terrorism. This was not a hate crime,” Mayor John Tecklenburg told reporters gathered 100 yards from where city leaders first addressed the world about the mass shooting in June 2015. “This was a tragic case of a disgruntled individual. ""(He) took his anger into his own hands.” The gunman, who Tecklenburg said had suffered mental health problems, was not identified by authorities on Thursday. Officials, including Gov. Henry McMaster, commended the quick police response. ""We send our prayers to lift up the families affected by today's tragedy in Charleston,” McMaster said on Twitter. “As they always do, our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line today and likely prevented further loss of life."" Law enforcement and emergency personnel rush a man into an ambulance after a shooting and hostage situation in downtown Charleston on Thursday, August 24,2017. Leroy Burnell/Staff 12:17 p.m.: Charleston police receive calls for help after a gunman shoots a man in Virginia… Like many Charleston restaurants, Virginia’s specializes in Southern dishes like fried chicken with collard greens or shrimp and grits. The restaurant is part of Holy City Hospitality, a company founded by local businessman Michael Bennett in 2001. Its sister restaurants, including 39 Rue de Jean and Coast Bar & Grill, are nearby. Holy City Hospitality's managing director, Marty Wall, released the following statement Friday morning on the loss of Whiddon: ""We are deeply saddened and heartbroken by what transpired yesterday at our restaurant Virginia's on King. We are devastated by the passing of Shane Whiddon, our beloved and well-respected chef and friend. Our thoughts and prayers from Holy City Hospitality and Bennett Hospitality are with Shane's family, our work family, and the customers and employees who are affected by this awful tragedy. We're extremely grateful for the incredible teamwork of the many law enforcement agencies and the Mayor of Charleston in handling yesterday's events. We would also like to thank the Pastor and staff at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church for all the support they provided law enforcement and our staff. The outpouring of support from the community has been remarkable and for that we are very grateful."" Virginia’s takes up two stories in a building on the corner of King and Hutson streets. To workers there, Thursday seemed like a normal, calm lunch hour. But about 12:15 p.m., two waitresses and three kitchen staffers hurried past tables on the first floor and went through the front door, saying nothing to the diners inside, witnesses said. Many were enjoying their meals when a man in his 50s or 60s emerged from the back of the restaurant. Clad in an apron, he also resembled a kitchen worker, the witnesses said. But at first glance, the diners knew something was wrong. The man was carrying a small revolver in his left hand. Some witnesses said he had called himself the “new king of Charleston.” Other accounts varied. ""There's a new boss in town,” he said, according to Tom and Patsy Plant, who had been eating with their daughter. To Patsy Plant, he looked like an “ordinary grandpa.” “But he had a crazy look,” she said. “It was very crazy."" He told about 30 customers to get down. Bill Rosene of Mount Pleasant, who had been eating cornbread with his wife, looked up and saw the man walk down an aisle. Then Rosene saw the gun clutched at his side. “Everyone get on the floor!” the man said, according to Rosene. “Get on the floor!” No one screamed. “But everyone was kind of frantic,” his wife, Tia, added. As people ducked down, the gunman changed his mind. “No,” he said, “everyone go to the back,” the Rosenes recalled. They quickly obliged. People move through the dining room. Some crawled. “We did not want to give him a good target,” said Peter Siegert IV, 45, of Maryland, who had been eating there with his father. But as they herded away from the gunman, the patrons found two side exit doors. “Then,” Bill Rosene said, “everyone just ran out the door.” The first-floor diners scurried away, not knowing if more were still inside. People flee businesses Thursday in the area where a gunman opened fire in Virginia's On King restaurant in Charleston. Andrew Knapp/Staff It was unclear when the gunfire went off. Cato Roemo was having lunch nearby when he heard three shots. He saw a body in the street, he said. ""I just ran,"" he said. When officers from the Charleston Police Department arrived, the wounded person was inside, Interim Chief Jerome Taylor said. The man was taken to the street, where paramedics did CPR. He was taken to Medical University Hospital, but he later died. Officers, sheriff’s deputies and federal agents converged on the restaurant. They drew their pistols and slung rifles over their shoulders. SWAT team snipers set up in nearby buildings and on rooftops. Richard Sikoral, a construction worker at the Marion Square Hotel project across the street, led sharpshooters to the upper reaches of the unfinished building. Minutes later, two more SWAT members climbed scaffolding and took positions. At a hair salon and other restaurants, people were told to stay inside. Doors were locked. Construction workers were ordered to leave. The Charleston Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau closed. Some area schools were locked down. A man spoke on a cellphone, hoping to hear about his nephew who works near the scene. Dozens of children and family members were kept inside the nearby Children’s Museum of the Lowcountry. “The children (had) no idea,” visitor services associate Bobby LePire said. Sarah Cobb, owner of MOSA Boutique on King Street, stuck her head through an open door to check on the commotion. The police told her to stay inside. ""We've got an active shooter,"" a policeman said while telling people to leave the street. ""We don't want anyone else getting shot."" Officers showed up and broke a window to get inside, said Sandy Troeder, who works nearby. Likening the quick police response to the mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said the officers managed to get inside the restaurant and stay there for most of the time while the gunman was upstairs with hostages. Crowds gathered behind yellow police tape as the situation unfolded, hoping to reach their workplaces or to hear news that the situation was over. SWAT team gather on Vanderhorst Street as they respond to a shooting and hostage situation at Virginia's On King on Thursday, Aug. 24, 2017, in Charleston. Grace Beahm Alford/Staff About 2:30 p.m., two hours after the ordeal began, a loud bang echoed between the historic buildings, startling tourists standing outside a Meeting Street hotel. The sound, Cannon said, was likely an intentional explosion meant to distract the gunman. A Charleston police officer shot the man, the police chief said. The mayor said the man had “mental health challenges,” but he gave no details. “We tragically lost a member of our community,” Tecklenburg said. After an ambulance took the wounded gunman away, rain started to fall on Charleston. The sun poked through the clouds, and church bells rang. “I’m glad to hear the bells of St. Matthew’s are ringing,” the mayor said. Visitors in the popular tourist destination said the disturbance hadn’t tinged their opinion of the Holy City. ""It's just random,"" John Griffith of Wilmington, N.C., said as he surveyed the police vehicles on the normally bustling Upper King Street. ""But it's unfortunate (that) it's become the norm.""

About a dozen conservative activists showed up at Steinorth’s office Thursday after their planned protest at a fundraiser for Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, who supported the cap and trade program, was derailed upon learning the fundraiser was cancelled. Protestors used their mobile phones to shoot video of the protest. One 9-minute video posted to YouTube, which has generated more than 108,000 views since being posted, shows protestors entering the office of Steinorth, R-Rancho Cucamonga, with organizer Joseph Turner leading the charge. “We’re here to see Assemblyman Marc Steinorth as one of the Republicans who sold us out to cap and trade, so we’re going to let him know we’re sick of these rinos (Republican in name only) and we’re voting him out,” Turner says in the video. A CHP officer who arrived at the planned Mayes protest followed the group to Steinorth’s office, where he called for backup, Rancho Cucamonga CHP Sgt. Tom Graham said Monday in a telephone interview. That’s when a bevy of CHP officers and sheriff’s deputies began arriving at Steinorth’s office in cars, SUVs and on motorcycles, cramming the parking lot, to the surprise of protestors. About a dozen officers are seen in the video lining the hallway in Steinorth’s office as Turner and his group were leaving. “Was there a mass shooting or something?” Turner is heard saying in the video as he exits the building and sees the number of police vehicles lining the parking lot. “It was heated and contentious, but it wasn’t as if things were resulting in some kind of chaotic melee,” Turner said in a telephone interview Monday. Graham said about 20 CHP officers responded to the backup call. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said roughly 10 deputies from the Rancho Cucamonga station responded to the call. “It appears they were being disruptive and refused to leave the office when asked to,” Bachman said in an email. “Once we determined there was no emergency and/or violence, deputies left and those not already there diverted to other activities.” Graham said the reason so many CHP responded to the call was because officers were in the middle of a shift change – some were headed into the field and others returning – when the call went out, resulting in many of them winding up at Steinorth’s office because they had no other calls to respond to at the time. “Bad timing for the protestors, good timing for us,” said Graham, adding that the protestors left with no incident. “It’s just the way it happened. We didn’t plan for it. It just happened that way.” Steinorth said in a telephone interview Monday he was thankful the protest did not get too out of hand. “Law enforcement protected the rights of both parties involved. They ensured the safety of my staff and the First Amendment rights of the demonstrators,” Steinorth said. “I’m grateful they arrived and handled this situation in the most peaceful way possible.” He said his staff has arranged a meeting with Turner and his group to discuss their concerns. Turner said the meeting is scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday at Steinorth’s office.

67,https://www.thewrap.com/apple-1-billion-content-investment-no-netflix-threat/,"Tech giant could get into the subscription game, but the initial focus is to sell more devices Apple plans to spend $1 billion on content to develop up to 10 big-budget shows over the next year, music to the ears of creatives in and out of the 30-mile zone who now have another deep-pocketed buyer to pitch to. It’s a move that could position the computing giant to launch its own subscription streaming service that could challenge Netflix and Amazon — and newer old-media streaming players like CBS and Disney. But for now, the company’s move is really about selling more iPhones and Apple TVs. Apple’s hope is to turn iTunes into an indispensable source of must-see TV, like Netflix or HBO, which would then incentivize customers to buy its products and sign up for subscription products down the line. Netflix uses “House of Cards” and “Stranger Things” to get more than 100 million people worldwide to shell out $10 a month. And while a pipeline of original programming should help Apple develop more ancillary iTunes revenue down the line, for now, Apple can use their exclusive content to ship $200 Apple TVs and $600 iPhones. It’s not hard to imagine the sales pitch for the only brand of television that could theoretically show a series with the popularity of a “Game of Thrones.” Also Read: Apple Set to Drop $1 Billion on Original TV Content Also Read: Apple Set to Drop $1 Billion on Original TV Content “First and foremost, they’ll use it to sell more products,” Ezra Kucharz, a media adviser and former senior strategist to  CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, told TheWrap, while noting that he hadn’t spoken to anyone at Apple about its just-announced push into original content. “You’ll probably get two different strategies in the iTunes Store,” Kucharz said. “There will be a ‘skinny bundle’ and subscription service of sorts where this content will live. There may be multiple channels. But if you want to buy individual episodes, you will be able to.” Ross Gerber, the president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said a premium subscription service — maybe a revamped Apple Music — has to be the plan. But he questioned why Apple is developing original content instead of using the $77 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet to acquire or pursue a joint venture with a producer of high-end TV and movies, perhaps even Lionsgate. Apple could then use its rights to those shows and movies to launch its own Netflix-like streaming service, without having to build it from the ground up in a company with a very limited track record in that field. Also Read: Augmented Reality Makes Apple CEO Want to 'Yell out and Scream' Also Read: Augmented Reality Makes Apple CEO Want to 'Yell out and Scream' Apple’s initial forays into original content, the reality series “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke,” didn’t really do much to indicate what its eventual programming plans might be — and weren’t exactly critical darlings, either. “The first two shows are horrible,” Gerber said. “Then I watch ‘The Defiant Ones’ on HBO, which is basically a big Apple ad. How in God’s name did Apple not make this?” But that could be changing.  In June, Apple content chief Eddy Cue brought over Sony Pictures Television Presidents Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to run its video business, tipping its hand that it would be getting into scripted content. Kucharz said other than live sports, that’s the only content of real value anymore. Also Read: Netflix vs. Disney: Why the Companies Are Waging 'Studio-on-Studio Violence' Also Read: Netflix vs. Disney: Why the Companies Are Waging 'Studio-on-Studio Violence' “It’s going to be all about scripted shows,” he said. “If you’re in the commoditized and perishable content business, things are going to be tough. You can get the weather a lot of places.” And while $1 billion is an eye-popping number, it’s a relative pittance to Apple, about half of what Time Warner’s HBO spends on content, and one-sixth of Netflix’ content budget. It could be a sensible bet for Apple that could make it a significant player in original video, while also bolstering sales for the iPhone and iPad (despite their higher price point than other smartphones and tablets). Gerber, however, questioned whether that commitment was big enough to make a real impact in Hollywood, especially with Apple’s prodigious bankroll. “They’re going to make 10 to 15 shows,” he said. “That gives you a very low likelihood of success in Hollywood. What Netflix does is they spend so much money they’re going to have good shows, because everyone wants to work at Netflix. The bad shows just get swept under the rug.” Also Read: Former WGN America Boss Matt Cherniss Heads to Apple Also Read: Former WGN America Boss Matt Cherniss Heads to Apple Another motivation for Apple to beef up its lean slate of original content: decreasing market share in digital video. In 2012, the company hauled in about 50 percent of all digital video downloads. But with competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu gaining steam in recent years, Apple has seen its slice of the pie cut to between 20 to 35 percent, according to the Wall Street Journal. This drop has been masked by the overall size of the digital video market rapidly growing over that time period. Even though Apple has a smaller share, it’s still seen its revenue from services (which includes iTunes downloads) take off, jumping 22 percent year-over-year to $7.3 billion in its most recent quarterly report. If it can pump some of its cash into intriguing content like its own “House of Cards,” Apple can regain some share in a growing market. And it can also add value to Apple TV, which is facing increased competition from Smart TVs and other streaming devices like Amazon’s Fire TV and the Roku Premiere. Also Read: FX's John Landgraf Says Apple Won't Be a Competitor: 'We Can't Do What They Do' Also Read: FX's John Landgraf Says Apple Won't Be a Competitor: 'We Can't Do What They Do' “You will see them develop series within iTunes and the Apple TV ecosystem,” Kucharz said. “They tried a couple times to kind of revamp Apple TV and do deals with some of the networks. Ultimately, this may be another way.” Apple thrives on its ecosystem — the often seamless interconnection between its myriad devices. To fully realize all of the iPhone’s features, for example, it’s better to pair it with a Mac than a PC. And Apple has made it possible for iPhone users to text from a MacBook and make phone calls from an iPad — and recently, bounce between devices when renting videos through iTunes. Adding a substantial suite of high-end original content would be a further draw to an already compelling package, similar to Amazon making originals like “Transparent” available to its Prime subscribers. That could become another funnel back to Apple’s ecosystem, keeping current users engaged and attracting new ones — assuming Cue, Erlicht and Van Amburg can develop compelling enough content.

If it’s going to be a phone company, they’re dead. It’s got to be another company. AT&T, the smartest move they could have done was buy Time Warner. How many [companies] need to buy [other companies] until Apple buys someone?” Who's Who in the Apple Vs. FBI Feud (Photos)

Updated: July 17, 2021 @ 6:34 am   Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a visit to the Port of Charleston in 2013. (AP file photo) COLUMBIA — The announced Charleston visit from former Vice President Joe Biden has excited many of the state's Democrats about the possible presidential run they were denied in 2016. Biden will speak before a diverse audience next month in what is the first high-profile visit from a potential 2020 presidential candidate in this early primary state with more appearances from others being expected, despite the election being three years away. Many of the state's Democrats said they hope Biden throws his hat into the race that he decided to stay out of last year after his son Beau Biden died from brain cancer. ""I think there are people all over the country who wished he ran in '16 and would support him in '20,"" said Amanda Loveday, former S.C. Democratic Party executive director and longtime Biden supporter. S.C. Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson calls Biden a genuine leader and person who connects with the average resident. ""I think that there is a group of individuals in South Carolina who are ready to march into hell and back if Joe Biden announces he's going to run for president,"" Robertson said. U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn said Biden's love affair with South Carolina, and specifically the Charleston area, is clear — and reciprocated. Biden joined Clyburn, a Columbia Democrat, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in Charleston in April to unveil a statue for his good friend Fritz Hollings, a former governor and U.S. senator. Biden, a former longtime Delaware senator, delivered the eulogy at the funeral for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina political icon. When giving the Senate oath of office to North Charleston Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Scott in January, Biden said: ""When I die, I want to be reborn in Charleston."" He attended a Sunday service at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church after the mass shooting in June 2015. And for years he's vacationed on Kiawah Island. Next up, Biden is coming to Charleston to serve as the keynote speaker for the Sept. 23 Charleston branch of the NAACP's 100th anniversary fundraising dinner. Some political experts say while they would welcome a run from the former vice president, it's just as possible that Biden's love of South Carolina — and an invitation — is what's bringing him here. Email Sign Up! ""Knowing how he is, I think he would jump at an opportunity to speak whether he was considering (a campaign) or not,"" South Carolina Democratic strategist Lachlan McIntosh said. ""He really has a special soft place for Charleston and the people that live here. I wouldn’t read too much into that."" McIntosh's caution isn't stopping some Democrats from getting excited at the thought of Biden running in 2020, believing he'd stack up pretty well against Republican President Donald Trump. ""I have some more conservative friends who can't say a bad thing about (Biden),"" said Boyd Brown, a former Democratic state House representative. ""I think there would be some great pickup opportunity for Biden."" Brown noted that in previous years — such as when he ran against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2008 — Biden's biggest obstacle was his ability to sometimes put his foot in his mouth. ""The things he was criticized for saying 20 years is ago is child's play compared to what comes out of the Trump White House on a daily basis,"" he said. Clyburn also played down concerns about Biden's age — 74. Biden would be 77 during the 2020 general election. Trump became the country's oldest president when he took office this year at age 70. ""I don’t buy all this malarkey about his age thing,"" said Clyburn, 77. ""He's younger than I am. I played golf with folks younger than me the other day and I was driving them all day."" Clyburn said he would urge Biden to prepare for a potential presidential campaign. ""My thoughts are he should keep his lamp trimmed and burning, so he can be ready when the bridegroom comes,"" Clyburn said, quoting the Bible. Of course, McIntosh said, all of it is speculation about a race that's three years away — even if many Democrats feel as though Trump's first six months in office have been much longer. ""It feels like it's been about three years since he won,"" McIntosh joked. ""It is early. But I think whether Biden is considering running or not, I wouldn’t read too much into it. I think he'd be (at the NAACP event) no matter what. That's just the type of person he is."" Biden isn't the only Democratic politico with South Carolina eyes. Former Maryland Gov.

69,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/OB7wwAomOy8/james-corden-has-wildly-exceeded-his-own-expectations,"SEARCH Two years ago, nobody knew James Corden’s name. Look at him now. Senior Writer When The Daily Beast first spoke to James Corden in 2014, he offered a word of warning to those anticipating his late-night debut on CBS: “They should lower their expectations.” In retrospect, it seems those expectations may have been way too low. “If you think about where we started from, it’s inconceivable,” he says now. We’re sitting in his office on the roof of CBS Television City in Los Angeles on a recent Wednesday evening. He’s just finished yet another episode of The Late Late Show and has already changed out of his tailored suit and into jeans and a casual polo shirt. The almost manic energy on display for the one-hour taping has given way to palpable exhaustion. “I remember seeing articles like, ‘Who the fuck is James Corden?’” the host continues. “I get it. In truth, I don’t think I realized how brave a decision it was for my boss to have taken. I didn’t realize how bold that decision was.” Then, he finds the joke. “Part of me wondered if they gave me the job because they just wanted to kill the franchise,” Corden says with a laugh. If that was the plan, CBS has failed miserably. Thanks in large part to his insanely popular “Carpool Karaoke” segment—now its own standalone spin-off show on Apple Music—Corden has become the most popular host on YouTube where his show has the top three most-watched clips across all of late-night television, each with more than 100 million views. “Our plan, which we felt was really ambitious, was to try and gain a million subscribers to our channel a year,” Corden says. Less than two and a half years in, the channel has nearly 12 million subscribers. While Corden says his show’s YouTube numbers are “not ever an obsession” for him, he is very aware that his channel has the second most subscribers in late-night (behind Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show, which, with a one year head start, has just over 14 million). “It’s where you can see your show’s relevance,” he says. “That’s really what our show’s about.” When Jimmy Fallon started hosting The Tonight Show, he already had five years at NBC’s Late Night under his belt, plus another seven seasons on Saturday Night Live. Corden, meanwhile, was a complete unknown to the vast majority of Americans. The London native had created and starred in three seasons of the British sitcom Gavin & Stacey, but that show was never even shown on American television. Corden seems to have arrived on the late-night scene at precisely the right moment. Never before have nightly Nielsen ratings mattered so little. “I’m sure they matter to someone,” Corden says. “I don’t really know what they are. I’ve never looked at a single piece of paper about what our ratings are.” Times have changed since the late-night wars between Jay Leno and David Letterman. “Then you had to make a choice,” Corden says. “Then America had to make a choice who they were watching. That was the only way you could watch them and it was the only metric by which you could mark success. “Today, you can watch everyone,” he continues, helping to explain why there seems to be less competition between hosts in this new era. With a little more than 1 million viewers on average watching The Late Late Show when it airs on CBS at 12:35 a.m., it is very clear that most people are seeing the show on YouTube the next day, where individual clips regularly exceed that total. “I don’t really think about ratings,” Corden adds. “I’m amazed when anyone does. I’m genuinely gobsmacked, I sort of can’t believe it. I think, well I don’t know how many people watch House of Cards, but I know it’s good and I know it’s a hit. Because I hear people talking about it.” Creating moments that people will talk about has become a huge part of the job for Corden and his executive producers Ben Winston and Rob Crabbe. And more often than not these days, those moments involve President Donald Trump. Trump has already helped lift The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to its highest ratings since the week it premiered and given renewed relevance to Corden’s time slot competitor Late Night with Seth Meyers. But while Fallon’s avoidance of all things political likely cost him an Emmy nomination this year, Corden still managed to make the cut in the crowded Outstanding Variety Talk Series category despite a similar reputation for shying away from politics. Corden has, however, managed to find his own unique way into the barrage of terrible news that comes with covering the Trump administration on a daily basis. “We do politics every night on the show,” Corden says. “What we always try and do is go, when something happens, what is our show’s version of this?” Often that means going above and beyond what other hosts are doing with simple monologue jokes. The night I visited the show, he had reworked the lyrics of Justin Bieber’s “Despacito” to include references to North Korea and Charlottesville. “Donald Trump made comments that brought him shame, kept saying that both sides are to blame,” he sang. “After denouncing neo-Nazis slowly, slowly.” When Trump announced his transgender military ban, Corden and his staff gathered and asked themselves, “What’s our version of this?” They ended up doing of a parody of Nat King Cole’s “L-O-V-E” called “L-G-B-T” that featured four costumed dancers and an elaborate wall of lights. And then there are times, like after Trump announced his ban on Muslim immigrants, when Corden decides he needs to put the jokes aside and get serious. It’s a posture that comedian Norm Macdonald mocked in a recent interview with The Daily Beast, using Corden’s name as a punchline. “It happened at some point that talk show hosts had to be political pundits,” Macdonald told me. “And if a train explodes outside of my house, I have to have James Corden talk me through it.” “My biggest thing that I’m very conscious of is I think you have to earn the right to be a voice in those things,” Corden says. As a British citizen who has been living in the U.S. for just two years, he adds, “I’m a visitor here and I’m guest here in this country that I believe to be the most magnificent place in the world. And I don’t think that that has changed because Donald Trump is the president. I still feel privileged and lucky to live here every day.” Corden had perhaps more moral authority when London was hit with yet another terror attack just as he was preparing to broadcast his show from that city for the first time. “Going to London was a massive thing for our show,” Corden says, thinking back to this past June. By the time the attack happened, he says they had already shot what he describes as a “very, very stupid opening” called “The Corden’s Back in Town” set to the tune of Thin Lizzy’s “The Boys Are Back in Town.” “It was me going around London like I’m some big dick, I’m back!” he explains. “And no one in London giving a shit, kids on the bus flicking me the bird. We had probably shot 70 percent of it and then that—” His smile fades and he takes a long pause. “That tragedy happened in London and the hardest thing about it was a lot of our crew were out in London that night. “We were in London, of course we had to change the opening of our show,” Corden continues. “And we thought the best way to open the show was to do it on these rainy cobbles, saying, this might seem like a strange time to be doing a variety show. But, in another way, maybe it’s the greatest time. Because there was also a lot of media reports that were saying London was terrified and it was a city under attack and people were scared and that was just not the feeling there. That was not the feeling as you walked around. If anything, it was the opposite. It felt like the city was going, ‘Fuck you!’” It was just a few weeks after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. “And you could feel London as a place go, ‘No, fuck off,’” Corden says. “We wanted to try to go, this is our show, we’re going to absolutely show off the incredible cultural diversity of this city, the absolute embracing of all cultures. And we will not be harmed by a group of idiots.” In the cold open that ended up airing that Tuesday night, Corden told his viewers, “I’m so proud to be broadcasting here from my hometown. I’m proud to show off its beauty, its diversity, and its stoic British determination to let nothing, or anybody, stand in our way.” He then added, “This is not a country that feels afraid.” It was almost a year to the day after Corden hosted the Tony Awards as this country was reeling from the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. “The harsh realities of that story just grew and grew throughout the day,” Corden says, thinking back to the Tonys gig, which also earned him an Emmy nomination for writing. “And then it became it clear that, well, OK, we have to say something about this. But what do we say?” As he was waiting in the wings to go on and address the tragedy on live television to start the ceremony, Corden became overwhelmed as he realized how difficult it would be to transition from a somber tribute to a massive production number. “I just remember having a very real feeling of like, the next 12 minutes are going to define the rest of the night,” he says. “If this doesn’t work, we’re going to have to keep trying to pull the night with it.” It worked. Calling the Tonys “the mecca of award shows as far as I’m concerned,” Corden says he had “two of the best nights of my life in that ceremony.” The first was in 2006 when The History Boys won Best Play and the other was 2012 when he won Best Actor for One Man, Two Guvnors. “For that night to go the way it went was incredible,” he says. “It just felt like everything I hoped it would be in that 12 minutes.” Given his two-for-two success rate on Broadway—“I feel like I should probably never be in another one, because what are the chances?” he jokes—Corden thinks a lot about returning to the stage at some point. “I am too busy right now, but I would be really disappointed in myself if I didn’t do another one,” he says. Before he was offered The Late Late Show, Corden was in talks to play the lead role in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum on Broadway, a part originated by Zero Mostel and later played by Nathan Lane. Those two actors also famously portrayed the character of Max Bialystock in Mel Brooks’ The Producers on screen and on Broadway, respectively. Corden already has the latter role in his sights. He’s even identified the perfect co-star to play Leo Bloom: Jim Parsons. “That’s sort of as good of casting as you could imagine, really, he’d be so amazing in that role,” Corden says, imagining the possibilities. “Look, I would love to go back and do something like that, but who knows?” he adds. “We’ll see.”",2017-08-24 00:00:00,James Corden Has Wildly Exceeded His Own Expectations,"television,reviews",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

The United States swore in a new President, whose determination to reshape Washington was met with approval from his supporters, but resistance from a great many others, including the thousands of women who marched around the country just after his inauguration. The fight for equality gained steam, as some Americans banded together to protect the rights of Muslims, refugees, Dreamers, women and the LGBTQ community. The country was rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which left 59 dead and more than 500 wounded. The global stage was shaken up, with a new leader in France, an independence movement in Catalonia, and rising tensions between North Korea and the United States. Wonder Woman inspired young girls across the globe, while the #MeToo movement toppled powerful men in fields from Hollywood to politics. To sum 2017 up, it was a year during which people went above and beyond to defend what they believe in, to seek the truth, and to right perceived wrongs.

71,https://www.cnet.com/news/taking-trolls-to-court-lawsuit-targets-the-daily-stormer/,"The victim of a troll attack takes on the neo-Nazi who runs ""the top hate site in America."" The result might prompt trolls to think twice before they post. Tanya Gersh has been the target of online harassment since December 2016. Editor's note: In July, CNET News published a special report exploring how hate spreads over the web. The stories in that series examined Internet-fueled intolerance. Our reporters explored, for example, what happens when online hate speech crosses into real life, the ways neo-Nazis use social media and how racists co-opted cartoon character, Pepe the Frog. Some of CNET's female reporters shared their own experiences of being harassed online. The timing of the package --  ""iHate: Intolerance takes over the internet"" -- was uncanny. As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, America slid into a Summer of Hate. People threatened places of worship, defaced cemeteries and intimidated others because of the way they look or dress. And a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, heavily promoted on extremist websites, left three people dead. The web's role in recruiting people to hateful, extremist organizations is back in the spotlight after The New York Times profiled a young neo-Nazi in Ohio. The story portrayed the man's decidedly ordinary life and raised, but didn't answer questions, about how he was  radicalized. Our reporting may provide a few answers, which is why we're republishing some of our stories. WARNING: The themes of the following story are disturbing. The language includes religious, ethnic and gender slurs. CNET has preserved much of the ugly wording in order to present a clear picture of attacks on real people. Tanya Gersh heard gunshots when she picked up her phone. It wasn't the first time. A real estate agent and mother of two, Gersh became the target of a barrage of hate last year for trying to help Sherry Spencer sell a property in Whitefish, Montana, and use part of the proceeds as a donation for a human rights group. That caught the eye of neo-Nazis, who were convinced Gersh was pressuring Spencer to sell. Why were neo-Nazis enraged by a proposed real estate transaction? Because Spencer is the mother of Richard Spencer, a leader of the ""alt-right"" movement of self-identified white nationalists. They believed Gersh was extorting Spencer. The hate directed at Gersh came in all forms. She got angry phone calls, hateful texts, intimidating emails and racist social media posts. People she'd never met urged Gersh to kill herself. A chunk of the filth was even directed at her 12-year-old son via his Twitter and YouTube accounts. Gersh, who is Jewish, also received Christmas cards with messages such as ""Thanks for demonstrating why your race needs to be collectively ovened"" and ""You are surprisingly easy to find on the internet. And in real life."" ""Kike."" ""Whore."" ""Bitch."" Now Gersh is taking on the man who started it all. In a federal lawsuit filed in April, Gersh accuses Andrew Anglin, who publishes the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, of invading her privacy, intentionally inflicting emotional distress and violating Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act by organizing more than 700 instances of harassment since December 2016. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, is representing Gersh. ""It would have been so much easier for us to lay as low as possible and let it all blow over,"" Gersh said in an interview. ""But it wasn't an option for us because of the pain that was caused."" In an email, Anglin, who bills his publication as ""The World's Most Genocidal Republican Website,"" said he was exercising his right to free speech. ""Whether you agree with what I have to say or not, I think all Americans can agree I have a right to say it,"" he wrote. ""We're going to put together the best First Amendment defense we can."" Anglin's attorney, Marc Randazza, sent a prepared blurb in the form of an image that read, ""The wall that protects the First Amendment is not manned with pretty happy smiling thoughts and easy-to-love characters."" Gersh's lawsuit, if successful, could change the environment for hate sites, making it clear to trolls they can be held responsible for the repercussions of what they write, at least in US civil cases. The SPLC has used similar tactics against hate groups since the 1980s, according to its newsletter, the SPLC Report, though many of those cases occurred before widespread adoption of the internet. Criminal cases are often hard to pursue, experts say, in part because law enforcement officials may not understand online harassment the way they understand stalking, for example, or take it as seriously as other kinds of intimidation. The situation is complicated by the fact that no one law enforcement agency goes after cyberharassment in particular. US laws around hate on the internet date back to the earliest chat rooms and bulletin boards. By the '90s, they'd begun to address electronic harassment. But the laws were narrow and generally addressed a method, say harassment over the phone, rather than a broad range of intimidating behavior, says Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland and author of the book ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace."" And they aren't used often, she says. ""We do have a suite of laws. We have been improving them over time, but we need to use them,"" Citron said. ""When we don't use them, harassers just get to say 'f--- you' and walk away."" Federal and state laws have evolved since the era of dial-up internet and they cover crimes ranging from cyberstalking to harassing telephone calls. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense under federal law and roughly half the states have statutes covering cyberstalking and cyberharassment. Prosecutors won nine convictions in 22 cyberstalking cases in 2014, and 11 out of 19 in 2015, according to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (PDF). Last year, the UK rolled out guidelines for prosecutors that detail the intersection of criminal offenses and online communications. The act of inciting a harassment campaign -- what the guidelines call virtual mobbing or dog piling -- falls under the Serious Crime Act 2007. Lawsuits, like Gersh and the SPLC's, are occasionally filed. The first successful cyberstalking case in California dates to 1999, when a man named Gary Dellapenta was sentenced to six years in prison after he posed as his own ex-girlfriend online and invited people to act on fake rape fantasies. He even gave them her address, prompting six men to show up at her door. But it's hard to sue an anonymous troll, and big social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, are protected by the Communications Decency Act. The act protects online services and businesses from being held accountable for what their users say or do on them. Even if you know who to sue, lawsuits take time and cost thousands of dollars. In many cases, plaintiffs probably won't recoup that amount even if they win. In 1998, fair housing advocate Bonnie Jouhari sued Ku Klux Klan leader Roy Frankhouser and, in a separate complaint, Ryan Wilson and neo-Nazi group ALPHA HQ, after she was targeted for helping victims of discrimination take legal action. Jouhari, who is white, was labeled a ""race traitor."" The groups posted her picture and address online, an early example of a tactic now known as ""doxing,"" to encourage others to torment her. Jouhari and her daughter ended up moving across the country to escape the harassment. Click to see more from iHate. Jouhari settled with Frankhouser, who agreed in May 2000 to an apology delivered on ""White Forum,"" a public access show, and 1,000 hours of community service. She was also was awarded $1.1 million in the suit against Wilson. But she never saw a dime because Wilson said he had no money. Legal experts say Jouhari's case isn't unusual. ""You might get the satisfaction of suing someone,"" said New York Law School professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who founded the Institute for CyberSafety. ""But you'll spend thousands out of pocket that you're never going to see back."" David Dinielli, one of the SPLC attorneys representing Gersh, says her case is different. The goal is to send a message to people trafficking in hate online. ""One of our principal points in bringing this lawsuit is to make certain that people know that they can't simply hide behind their keyboards in order to conduct their terrorism,"" Dinielli said. ""We want to send a message to people like Andrew Anglin and others who think they can wreak havoc on people's lives, simply by calling on people to launch a troll storm."" It's unclear how many people read The Daily Stormer, which takes its name from Der Stürmer, a Nazi tabloid. In a July 4 post celebrating the fourth anniversary of its launch, Anglin, the publisher, wrote the site had become internationally recognized, adding ""And last month, we had 4.3 million unique visitors."" ComScore, an analytics firm, says the Stormer had 83,000 unique visitors in May 2017 but that it often falls below the roughly 50,000 unique visitors per month the firm requires to qualify for measurement. What's clear is that the Stormer, which the SPLC calls ""the top hate site in America,"" uses its readers to project hate. Its readers have included Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the man who last year killed Jo Cox, a British member of Parliament. Anglin also spearheads a ""Troll Army"" and has mounted numerous campaigns against people who fall afoul of his views. Targets have included Luciana Berger, a British parliamentarian, and Julia Ioffe, a journalist who wrote about First Lady Melania Trump. Anglin initiated his attack against Gersh on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after Sherry Spencer posted an article to Medium accusing Gersh of bullying her into selling her property. The property had become the focus of Whitefish locals because of negative attention the town was getting as a result of Richard Spencer, who initially owned part of it, according to the lawsuit. Sherry, who lives in Dallas, has said her son no longer has an ownership stake. Anglin encouraged his readers to participate in ""an old fashioned Troll Storm"" and tell Gersh what they thought of her ""Jew agenda."" He published her address, telephone number and Twitter handle, as well as contact information for Judah Gersh, her husband, and Love Lives Here, a local group that promotes diversity. Anglin also included the Twitter handle of Gersh's son, whom he called a ""creepy little faggot."" He encouraged them to visit Judah's office, tell him what they thought of his wife's behavior and ""advise him to get a leash on that hoe."" In a subsequent post, Anglin directed readers to leave Google and Yelp reviews of the law firm where Gersh's husband works, providing links to the pages to make it easier. As in previous troll operations, Anglin cautioned participants against threatening Gersh. ""NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT,"" he wrote. Anglin may believe such disclaimers exculpate him, or clear him of responsibility, the SPLC lawsuit says. Andrew Anglin Six days later, Anglin expanded what he now called a ""MEGA TROLLSTORM,"" asking readers to contact the Gershs' employers and clients. He provided contact information for Tanya's employers, plus phone numbers and emails for the parent company. He also included contact details for groups affiliated with Love Lives Here, as well as those for Judah's clients. It didn't take long for the trolls to gather. The complaint describes a ""tsunami of threats"" that came in voice mails, emails, phone calls and Holocaust imagery. One tweet directed at Gersh's son included a picture of an oven with the message, ""psst kid, theres a free Xbox One inside this oven"". At one point, Anglin announced a march on Whitefish that he initially planned to end at Gersh's house. The march was to be called the ""James Earl Ray Day Extravaganza,"" named after the man who assassinated Martin Luther King, Jr. Anglin ""postponed"" the event because he couldn't get a permit. On April 18, Gersh and the SPLC filed a lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of the state anti-intimidation act. How the case will turn out remains to be seen, in part because SPLC lawyers can't find Anglin. Dinielli, Gersh's lawyer, said his team hasn't been able to serve Anglin and he hasn't stepped forward to receive the complaint. A November 2016 article in HuffPost said Anglin ""appeared"" to be in Berlin, while other reports have placed him in Russia and Ohio. In July, CNN reported that Anglin said he lives in Lagos, Nigeria. As of late October, SPLC lawyers completed another step in trying to serve Anglin, running a notice for six weeks in a Franklin County, Ohio newspaper that called for Anglin to answer the complaint. In November, the defense added Montana-based attorney Mathew Stevenson. ""It's about to get interesting,"" Randazza said via email Monday. Anglin and Stevenson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Gersh's lawsuit isn't the only one Anglin is facing. Sirius XM radio host Dean Obeidallah, who is Muslim, filed a defamation lawsuit in August after a Daily Stormer post said Obeidallah had masterminded the May bombing of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Much like SPLC, Obeidallah's lawyers are also trying to find Anglin and serve him with the lawsuit. ""The purpose of the lawsuit is to seek recovery for the damages he caused with his dangerous lies but also to send a message that minority groups will not be bullied into silence by him and his kind."" Obeidallah said via email. ""We will continue to call out the dangers of white supremacy and do our best to not allow those views to ever be normalized in the United States."" Anglin is named in a third lawsuit stemming from the Stormer's role in promoting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left three people dead in August. Eleven residents seek monetary damages, as well as a ban on events similar to the white nationalist march. They say Anglin and other white nationalists violated state and federal civil rights laws. ""The people of Charlottesville deserve their day in court, and those responsible for the violence on August 11 and 12 must be held accountable,"" said Brett Edkins, communications director for Integrity First for America, a nonprofit funding the suit. ""We are pleased to be supporting this historic case,"" Anglin's battles haven't been all legal, either. After the violence in Charlottesville in August, GoDaddy and Google refused to host The Daily Stormer. The site has bounced around and at several points ended up on the dark web. Most recently it resurfaced using a domain in Hong Kong. The site has appeared online intermittently but reports suggested it would be shut down. Anglin was born in 1984 and grew up in Ohio. He went to high school in a suburb of Columbus, where he listened to punk rock and cultivated the air of an outsider, according to a profile in Columbus Alive. He started to get interested in conspiracy theories and in his early 20s moved to the Philippines to teach English. In 2013, Anglin started The Daily Stormer, which picked up from Total Fascism, an earlier website he'd created. In a biographical post from March 2014, Anglin says, ""I ask myself what Hitler would do if he'd been born in 1984 in America and was dealing with this situation we are currently dealing with and also really liked 4chan and Anime."" An article posted on April 27 and still on the site's home page, which sports ""Jewish Problem"" and ""Race War"" sections, asks readers to donate to save the publication. The article's headline reads ""SPLC is Suing Anglin! Donate Now to STOP THESE KIKES."" An Anglin supporter also started a campaign to raise $150,000 for Anglin's legal defense on a far right crowdfunding site called WeSearchr. The fund-raising drive exceeded its goal in pledges after a little more than a month. A victory by Gersh and the SPLC wouldn't mean the end of trolling, but it might send a message. And it might raise a speed bump in the road for Anglin and other online hate sites. ""We have to establish what is right as we grow into this new online society and make a very clear statement to hate groups that they can't do this to people,"" Gersh said.

72,https://www.elitedaily.com/news/politics/surprising-no-one-gop-leaders-hesitate-investigate-white-supremacy/2045828," GOP politicians scored political points this weekend when they condemned the actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville andÂ President Donald Trump's refusal toÂ denounce the far-right marchers. Everyone from House SpeakerÂ Paul Ryan to former presidential candidate Mitt Romney got in on the action,Â andÂ even Texas Senator Ted Cruz had no problem condemning the hate on display. But these may just be words:Â Republican leaders areÂ avoiding investigations into white supremacy, per aÂ Politico report. The House Judiciary Committee has no plans to hold hearings on the growing violence of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in the U.S., according to aides, despite the call to do so from HouseÂ Democrats. The calls for action came after an Aug. 12 white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent, and an attendee at the alt-right rallyÂ mowed down anti-racist counter-protesters, leaving one dead. But many DemocratsÂ are worried that that it's not enough. California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa told Politico,Â âOthers think this is not an issue for Congress? I think it's front and center for us."" He said that he would reach out to committee chair Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, about holding a separate hearing on white supremacy and domestic terrorism. Speaker Ryan's office reportedlyÂ deferredÂ questions on potential action to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Ryan's office would not say whether or not he believes congressional action isÂ warranted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's officeÂ reportedlyÂ said ""that it's up to individual committee chairs to set their own hearing schedule."" This is not just a recent problem. New York Rep. Jerrod Nadler told Politico thatÂ Democrats have been trying unsuccessfully for months to request hearingsÂ on domestic terrorism. The Charlottesville attackÂ came only months after the Trump administration reportedly shifted a counter-terrorism unit's focus to just ""Islamic extremism,"" despite continued warnings from U.S. intelligence agencies that far-right white supremacists are becoming increasingly more violent. And yet: Republican Congress members have been largely hesitant to act. Sen. Cruz is one of a small number of GOP politicians who has called for an investigation into domestic terrorism and white supremacist extremism. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also condemned the attack which left one woman dead and approximately 19 others injured as domestic terrorism; he also said the Department of Justice is pursuing the case. But that isn't enough for some, who see other politicians, such as Ryan and Romney, capitalize on such a horrific event by offering the equivalent of ""thoughts and prayers"" after a mass shootingÂ or a terrorist attack. It's sadly unsurprising that the same party that has passed gerrymandering laws that target minority voters; that supports building a border wall; and that is systematically dismantling the DOJ's civil rights division is coming up empty when it comes toÂ investigating and attempting to dismantleÂ white supremacy.

The neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website appeared to be offline late Monday after Google said it would cancel the hate site's domain registration following its migration from GoDaddy earlier in the day. Attempts to reach the website, which has been called the ""top hate site in America,"" on the surface web weren't completed and sometimes hung at a screen from Cloudflare, which provides security from DDoS attacks to the site. Other times, the site displayed a message from Andrew Anglin, the site's publisher, saying it was experiencing an outage. ""We're having an outage,"" the message read. ""It'll be a minute."" It also directed readers to the site's channel on Discord, a voice chat program used mostly by gamers, which previously tweeted that it had shut down the server and banned several related accounts. Love. Not hate. pic.twitter.com/5xFpvHTuI2 Google confirmed in an email it was cancelling The Daily Stormer's registration with its Google Domains service for violating the terms of service. Anglin didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The apparent disappearance of The Daily Stormer from the web comes after a weekend of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the site had helped organize a white supremacist rally. The violence claimed the life of a woman protesting the white supremacists when a car plowed into a group of people. A post by The Daily Stormer about the incident caused GoDaddy to revoke its domain registration prompting the website to register with Google. Domain providers direct internet users and search engines to a site's URL. ""We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service,"" GoDaddy said in a tweet Sunday, adding in an emailed statement, ""If no action is taken after 24 hours, we will cancel the service."" We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service. A message from Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based company, is sometimes displayed when trying to access the The Daily Stormer. Cloudflare provides internet performance and security services, but doesn't host content. Without naming The Daily Stormer, Cloudflare acknowledged concerns had been raised over some sites that used its network. ""We find the content on some of these sites repugnant,"" a spokeswoman said in an email. ""While our policy is to not comment on any user specifically, we are cooperating with law enforcement in any investigation."" GoDaddy pointed to a hate-filled post on The Daily Stormer that focused on Heather Heyer, the woman killed over the weekend. ""Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service,"" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Hours after GoDaddy's statement, a post on The Daily Stormer, which was the subject of a CNET profile last month, said the site had been taken over by hacktivist group Anonymous. ""WE HAVE TAKEN THIS SITE IN THE NAME OF HEATHER HEYER,"" the post read, adding she was ""A VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM."" Anonymous acknowledged the post through a Twitter account but didn't confirm it was involved. Instead, the hacking collective suggested it might be an elaborate stunt by Anglin and mooted he might be having difficulty a new domain registrar. ""This is likely to be the derps from dailystormer engaging in a silly troll to woo their clueless base,"" reads the tweet from @YourAnonNews. ""If we're proven wrong, so be it."" (Derp is slang for stupidity.) The Daily Stormer takes its name from Der Stürmer, a Nazi tabloid. It's unclear what sort of traffic the site receives but it attracts a fringe readership.

74,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/business/media/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-lawsuit.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Sydney Ember The author of a New York Times editorial will have to testify under oath in a defamation lawsuit filed by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, a federal judge ruled on Thursday. The Times filed a motion last month seeking to dismiss the case, and the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, said the testimony was necessary to help him determine whether to grant that motion. Judge Rakoff set the hearing for Aug. 16. Judge Rakoff said last month that he would rule by the end of this month on the motion to dismiss the case. A spokeswoman for The Times said in a statement that the news organization would provide the testimony the judge had ordered. David McCraw, deputy general counsel for The Times, said the witness would be James Bennet, The Times’s editorial page editor. In the lawsuit, which was filed in June, Ms. Palin contends that The Times “violated the law and its own policies” when it linked her in an editorial to a mass shooting in January 2011. The editorial was published online on June 14, the same day that a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where Republican congressmen were practicing, injuring several people including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana. The Times later published a correction and issued an apology on Twitter. Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit that the editorial conflicted with other articles The Times had published about Ms. Palin’s political activities and the 2011 mass shooting by Jared Loughner in Arizona. It cited several articles in The Times that dismissed the notion that there was any link between Ms. Palin, political rhetoric and the rampage. “The Times had ample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner’s crime,” Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit. In his order, Judge Rakoff said one of the questions presented by The Times’s motion to dismiss Ms. Palin’s case was “whether the complaint contains sufficient allegations of actual malice, an essential element of the claim.” Determining that, he added, depended in part on whether the author or authors of the editorial were aware of articles in The Times that contradicted what they wrote. That information, he said, was “peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant.” Advertisement",2017-08-11 00:19:27,New York Times Editorial Writer Must Testify in Sarah Palin Lawsuit,"politics and government,suits and litigation,decisions and verdicts",1,http://nytimes.com

The sum includes $500,000 each to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League “to further their work in tracking, exposing and fighting hate groups and other extremist organizations,” Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility wrote in a memo to employees that was provided to Reuters by the company. As much as $1 million more will be contributed in two-for-one matches of donations by employees to “a wide range of human and civil rights organizations,” according to the memo. The bank is also contributing $50,000 to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation. Racial conflict in Charlottesville earlier this month was followed by intense political controversy over remarks by President Donald Trump. Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan, said he “strongly” disagreed with Trump as he and other CEOs moved to disband an advisory panel to the president. JPMorgan has reacted to a wide range of traumatic events in the past with contributions and matches of employee donations. The events have included the recent Grenfell Tower apartment fire in London, the 2016 Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub mass shooting, earthquakes and tropical storms.

77,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-preps-to-remove-limits-on-military-gear-to-police,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is preparing to restore the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies under a program that had been sharply curtailed amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war-fighting gear to confront protesters. Documents obtained by The Associated Press indicate President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order undoing an Obama administration directive that restricted police agencies’ access to the gear that includes grenade launchers, bullet-proof vests, riot shields, firearms and ammunition. Trump’s order would fully restore the program under which “assets that would otherwise be scrapped can be repurposed to help state, local, and tribal law enforcement better protect public safety and reduce crime,” according to the documents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could outline the changes during a Monday speech to the national conference of the Fraternal Order of Police in Nashville, Tennessee, a person familiar with the matter said. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of an official announcement. The changes would be another way in which Trump and Sessions are enacting a law-and-order agenda that views federal support of local police as a way to drive down violent crime. National police organizations have long been pushing Trump to hold his promise to once again make the equipment available to local and state police departments, many of which see it as needed to ensure officers aren’t put in danger when responding to active shooter calls and terrorist attacks. An armored vehicle played a key role in the police response to the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. In 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to give surplus equipment to police to help fight drugs, which then gave way to the fight against terrorism.
Groups across the political spectrum have expressed concern about the militarization of police, arguing that the equipment encourages and escalates confrontations with officers. President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2015 that severely limited the surplus program, partly triggered by public outrage over the use of military gear when during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police responded in riot gear and deployed tear gas, dogs and armored vehicles. At times they also pointed assault rifles at protesters. Obama’s order prohibited the federal government from providing grenade launchers, bayonets, tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, and firearms and ammunition of .50-caliber or greater to police. As of December, the agency overseeing the program had recalled at least 100 grenade launchers, more than 1,600 bayonets and 126 tracked vehicles — those that run on continuous, tank-like tracks instead of wheels — that were provided through the program.
Trump vowed to rescind the executive order in a written response to a Fraternal Order of Police questionnaire that helped him win an endorsement from the organization of rank-and-file officers. He reiterated his promise during a gathering of police officers in July, saying the equipment still on the streets is being put to good use. “In fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left,” Trump said.
The documents, first reported by USA Today, say Trump’s order would emphasize public safety over the appearance of the heavily equipment. They describe much of the gear as “defensive in nature” intended to protect officers from danger. The Justice Department declined to comment on the expected move. Most police agencies rarely require military equipment for daily use but see a need to have it available, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “It is hard to imagine any situation where a grenade launcher or bayonet would be something that a major police department would need, but defensive shields and armored vehicles kept on reserve will be welcome,” he said. Sessions has said he believes improving morale for local law enforcement is key to curbing spikes in violence in some cities. The plan to restore access to military equipment comes after Sessions has said he intends to pull back on court-enforceable improvement plans with troubled police departments, which he says can malign entire agencies and make officers less aggressive on the street. Consent decrees were a hallmark of the Obama administration’s efforts to overhaul certain agencies, sometimes after racially charged encounters like the one in Ferguson.

At a town hall meeting in Colorado Springs on Tuesday, Republican Senator Cory Gardner came face to face with a raucous crowd imploring him to do more to fight back against hateful rhetoric. The town hall came just three days after a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia left one woman dead and at least 34 injured. At the Gardner town hall, a local rabbi told the story of her synagogue being desecrated just two weeks earlier. “It’s not just in Charlottesville…and it’s not the first time” she said (at 34:30 minutes of the video above). “Do you see the connection between what the Trump administration and your party do in the building of hate and division?” Although Colorado as a whole voted for Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election, more than 60 percent of Colorado Springs’ county picked Donald Trump. The city has long been known as a conservative hub, home to the Christian organization Focus on the Family and the US Air Force Academy. Most of the town hall’s attendees, however, appeared to strongly oppose the president. Many applauded Gardner’s denunciation of Trump’s initial response to the violence in Charlottesville over the weekend. Mr. President – we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism. https://t.co/PaPNiPPAoW — Cory Gardner (@SenCoryGardner) August 12, 2017  Thirty-five minutes into the meeting, attendees became louder about their disapproval of Trump’s administration, and started shouting things like “Get Steve Bannon out!” and “Call out Trump!” One man who identified himself as Jewish asked: “Are you confident that Donald Trump is fit to lead the country?” and was met with positive applause. Gardner replied that Trump was elected by “the people of the country,” and that he does believe the current president is fit for the role. Failing to quiet the rowdy crowd, the moderator started announcing the impending end of the town hall—more than thirty minutes ahead of time. A father who lost his son in the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado scolded Senator Gardner for never answering a single request for a meeting in the past five years. Now, he said, he had a new question (at 1:05:00): “Will you ask that the peddlers of the alt-right messaging who are employed in the White House…are taken off of the government payroll?” he said, mentioning Steve Bannon. “I don’t want to be paying their salaries.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

80,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2017/08/13/media-exploit-violence-help-democrats/,"The mainstream media enjoys grousing about supposed threats to the First Amendment under President Donald Trump. But few are bothering to stand up for the basic right of freedom of speech in the wake of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia between white supremacists and left-wing “anti-fascist” rioters. The death toll was three, after a horrific attack — possibly an act of domestic terror — by an apparent right-wing extremist who drove his car into the “Antifa” crowd, killing one and injuring many more. Two state police officers monitoring the protests also died in a helicopter crash nearby. The white supremacists had gathered to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, one of many historic markers of the old South that have been targeted since a racially-motivated mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. But the protesters did more than defend the statue. They also used the event to broadcast their hatred of Jews, among other minorities, and to elevate their otherwise marginal national profile. As repulsive as the white supremacists and their messages were, they had the same First Amendment rights as all other Americans do. (I grew up in Skokie, Illinois, where neo-Nazis were once granted the right to march through the largest community of Holocaust survivors outside of Israel, so free speech has always been a particularly potent principle for me.) The “anti-fascist” protesters arrived with the intent of shutting down free speech — through force. When that happens, Americans should unite in condemning the violent assault on the First Amendment. We should not let those who would shut down free speech succeed, either by silencing the offensive speech or by using the fact of violence to rally public opinion against the targeted group. Otherwise, such violence will continue to be used. Trump has been criticized for not condemning the white supremacists in his initial response to the clashes in Charlottesville. But Trump took an oath to defend the Constitution. His first duty was to uphold freedom of speech — not to indulge the “anti-fascists,” or the media who protect them by failing to report their violent tactics and totalitarian mindset. Therefore he correctly, and strongly, condemned the violence on “many sides.” The fact that Trump’s measured, appropriate response became a pretext for more media outrage, and nationwide protest, is further proof that the media have abandoned their own supposed principles in the service of a political agenda. They want to bring down President Trump, and negate the 2016 election, First Amendment be damned. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

82,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/03/psychiatrist-mass-shooters-have-personality-disorders-and-are-likely-not-mentally-ill/,"A psychiatrist testified at a public hearing in Michigan's Oakland County on Tuesday that mental health issues do not automatically place a person at risk for mass shooting or suicide, based on his research of the phenomenon.  The Oakland County Public Services Committee heard from a number of physicians and other health care professionals about their day-to-day interactions and dealings with gun violence prevention. This was the committee's sixth consecutive meeting regarding the issue. “We have to look at new strategies in combating gun violence,” Committee Chairman Bill Dwyer told the group, the Oakland Press reported. “I think everything has to start in the home on the part of the parents. Accidental shootings occur because of unsecured firearms. It’s frustrating because lives are being lost.” Health care workers from the nearby hospital, Beaumont Hospital-Farmington Hills, came to the meeting to answer any questions the committee had about treating victims of gun violence and those with mental health problems. The health care team agreed that further education is needed, especially about the dangers associated with having a firearm in the home. The psychiatrist on the team, Dr. Theodore Ruza, made one point very clear: Having a mental illness does not automatically mean the person is at risk for committing a mass shooting or suicide. People who have personality disorders, not mental illnesses, like anxiety and depression, are more likely to carry out these firearms-related incidents.  About one percent or less of those that commit these crimes have a psychiatric diagnosis. Mental health does not mean that you’re at-risk for mass shootings or suicide. What pre-disposes you to a mass shooting are personality disorders like narcissistic personality, paranoid personality and anti-social personality. According to Ruza, the general public automatically buys the notion that all mass shooters have some sort of mental illness, which he says is completely false. “Less than one percent have a true psychiatric diagnosis,"" Ruza said. He did not indicate what share of psychiatric disorders go undiagnosed. The county and Oakland Community Health Network have partnered together to launch a campaign aimed at reducing the stigma behind mental illness. The partnership also focuses on promoting the county's ""Lock-It-Up"" initiative, which provides free gun locks to residents and encourages parents to safely store their firearms in their home.

83,http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/11/liberals-will-always-see-gun-owners-as-domestic-security-threats/,"(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) A Democratic congresswoman declared the National Rifle Association and conservative commentator Dana Loesch “domestic security threats” Thursday night. “I’m just going to say it. #NRA & @DLoesch are quickly becoming domestic security threats under President Trump. We can’t ignore that,” New York Rep. Kathleen Rice tweeted out. I’m just going to say it. #NRA & @DLoesch are quickly becoming domestic security threats under President Trump. We can’t ignore that. — Kathleen Rice (@RepKathleenRice) August 11, 2017  It was a bold statement to make about a group that claims millions of Americans as members. Are all these citizens a threat to the country because they like gun rights? It appears this Democrat seems to think so. Rice was likely claiming a security threat over the NRA’s recent ad featuring Loesch criticizing The New York Times. Several journalists and leftists considered the ad as tantamount to a threat of violence against the press — one of whom was Rep. Rice. Beyond the pale. #NRA is a disgrace to the Constitution they claim to defend. Lunatics actively encouraging violence against free press. https://t.co/fh9kMPmWXS — Kathleen Rice (@RepKathleenRice) August 4, 2017  It’s not uncommon for liberals to wildly claim law-abiding gun owners are a threat to America. It’s one of the core planks of the gun control agenda that the public supposedly can’t trust those gun nuts. They could turn out to be the next Timothy McVeigh, and, as liberals fervently believe, right-wing terrorists are a far bigger threat than Islamic radicals. These are the lines repeated ad nauseam by liberal supporters of gun control in order to sow distrust for gun owners and the groups that represent their rights. Any time a shooting occurs and the triggerman was not a Muslim radical, the NRA is always blamed first for the carnage. Rice’s attack is a little different, however. It wasn’t uttered in response to a mass shooting or some new gun restriction the NRA opposes. It was made over a video the Second Amendment rights group made about the media. The ad, presented by Loesch, warns The New York Times that gun advocates are “coming for you.” “Consider this a shot across your proverbial bow,” the conservative commentator dramatically says. “We’re going to fisk The New York Times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag.” Over-the-top, for sure. A call for violence? You’d have to be blinded by ideology to think so. Unfortunately, there are plenty of folks like Rep. Rice who fall into that category and construed it as a violent threat. It didn’t help that several prominent journalists claimed to hear Loesch saying “fist” instead of “fisk,” and spread the botched interpretation all over on Twitter. “Fisting” the Times certainly sounds more violent than fisking the paper, but it mostly sounds like an act best left to the dark corners of the internet than a legitimate threat of physical violence. To fisk means to debunk or correct news reporting. So the big threat, delivered in a bombastic manner, from the NRA was that it was going to correct The Times’ coverage of gun matters. The Gray Lady has a well-known reputation for supporting gun control, such as when the paper put an editorial in favor of firearm restrictions on its front page in 2015, so it makes sense for the NRA to take some issue with the outlet’s coverage. Especially when another Times editorial regurgitated this year the debunked smear against Sarah Palin that claims the former Alaska governor directly inspired the Gabby Giffords shooting. (RELATED: NYT Uses GOP Shooting To Falsely Attack Sarah Palin With Debunked Conspiracy Theory) Right now, there’s a particularly appealing narrative to liberals that the right-wing is encouraging violence and intimidation against journalists. The press has weirdly become a heroic and selfless industry to the Left in the age of Trump. Reporters are just there to report to the facts objectively, in spite of all the terrifying tweets they receive, according to the telling of the center-left. So what difference if the NRA was saying “fisk” or “fist”? It makes for far better copy to imagine the gun rights group was inciting its millions of AR-15-toting followers to slaughter journalists rather than simply wanting greater scrutiny of the Times’ gun coverage. Regardless of the facts, liberals like Rep. Rice will always view gun owners as “domestic security threats.” They represent the stereotypical right-wing Middle American that liberals so despise. The caricature of a gun owner is a white male who will never check his privilege. He may own a Confederate flag, and probably takes stands on social policy that would get him fired from Google. Moreover, he owns at least one firearm — a deadly weapon that the Left believes only the state should possess. The gun to millions of Americans represents independence and the ability to protect oneself from threats to you and your family. To liberals, middle Americans who believe that are a dangerous menace to society because they represent open defiance towards left-wing dogma. Stripping these wrong-thinking gun owners of their cherished weapon means that these folks have to rely more on the state, making it more likely that they will submit to the dictates of progressives.[dcquiz] [dcquiz] The only way you can view law-abiding gun owners as a security threat is if you view them as dangerous reactionaries who would murder journalists on the basis of an internet ad. It’s worth remembering the gun control issue as not of one of safety for liberals, but of power. Liberals want the state to be in control of the weapons, because they intrinsically distrust those who legally possess firearms. Progressives would finally sleep better at night if they knew nobody in rural Georgia had access to a firearm anymore. Well, just the Georgians who follow the law — that is.

A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. High 89F. Winds SSW at 10 to 15 mph.. Partly cloudy skies. Low near 75F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: July 17, 2021 @ 6:34 am   Columbia Bureau Chief Catherine Templeton, Republican candidate for South Carolina governor, addresses the 2017 South Carolina Republican Convention in Columbia. File/Andrew Brown/Staff COLUMBIA — Catherine Templeton made waves in her first public forum as gubernatorial candidate by saying she is “proud of the Confederacy"" and pledged “we’re not going to rewrite history” by removing Confederate monuments. Templeton's comments late Tuesday upset black leaders in the state, who are still stung by the racially charged mass shooting at a Charleston church two years ago and the vicious fight to remove the Confederate battle flag from the S.C. Statehouse grounds. “I don’t think she understands the diversity we have in South Carolina and that we’re not all a bunch of flag-waving yahoos,” said Joe Darby, the AME Church's presiding elder over the Beaufort District. “When you elevate the Confederacy, you stomp on the memories of those who were subjugated, the slaves. She’s stomping on my ancestors."" Templeton, a former two-time state agency head running in her first campaign, spoke Tuesday at a Republican town hall meeting in Pickens County, a conservative area bordering North Carolina and Georgia with the state's smallest percentage of black residents. A man who identified himself as a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans asked Templeton about her views on “Southern heritage and Southern defense” after other states have removed monuments and memorials. The issue remains sensitive in South Carolina since lawmakers voted in 2015 to remove the battle flag from the Statehouse grounds after Dylann Roof, a self-avowed white supremacist, killed nine black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. Templeton’s answer was blunt. “Not on my watch. I don’t think there’s anything else to say about it,” Templeton said. “You cannot rewrite history. I don’t care whose feelings it hurts. You cannot rewrite history. “We’re standing on the shoulders of giants in South Carolina,” she added. “And it’s why we are who we are, where we are. And I very much respect the men who gave their homes, their fortunes and their lives to put us in this position. Fortunately, we have a law, too, that protects us, and I’m sure it will be enforced.” COLUMBIA — Her pride in the Confederacy is not all that Catherine Templeton discussed during… State law requires two-thirds approval in the Legislature to remove historical monuments. Templeton was asked later if she would have voted to taken down the flag if she were a member of the General Assembly at the time. “I think what we did was we reacted,” Templeton said. “I think that’s what happens in government a lot. We have an emergency, and we create a response because it’s the only thing we have control over. “I’ve already said and mean it from the bottom of my heart that I’m proud to be from South Carolina, I’m proud of the Confederacy. But I’m not going to second guess what the people in the Statehouse did when I wasn’t there,"" she continued. ""I live in Charleston, and I drive by Mother Emanuel on a daily basis. And a bad person took something that’s dear to us, took our heritage and turned it into hate. And I think we acted as a result.” Templeton’s consulting firm, Brawley Templeton, was among dozens of businesses to praise then-Gov. Nikki Haley and the Legislature in 2015 for removing the flag from the Statehouse grounds. “Thank you to the Palmetto State leadership for respectively placing our history where it belongs, the moral courage to truly respect the differences of one another and the ability to come together to achieve greatness as a community, rather than as individuals,” read a statement sent the day the flag was removed. Templeton also said during the town hall she would back a bill to ban removing any historical monuments. Several monuments on the Statehouse grounds honor leaders who worked to prevent equal rights for black South Carolinians, including former governor and U.S. Sen. Ben Tillman. “I would not allow monuments to be taken down,” she said. “We’re not going to rewrite history.” Reached Wednesday, Templeton, whose father was named after a relative wounded for the Confederacy in the Civil War, did not back away from her comments at the town hall. “I am who I am because of my ancestors,” Templeton told The Post and Courier. “I’m proud of my family, and that doesn’t make me a racist. History may make us uncomfortable, but it made us who we are.” Dot Scott, president of the Charleston chapter of the NAACP, said Templeton is not alone among politicians in her showing support for the Confederacy 152 years after the Civil War ended. She said she believes Templeton’s main foe for the 2018 Republican nomination, Gov. Henry McMaster, shares her views. ""We have two candidates that give NAACP heartburn,” Scott said. “We’re continuing the same mindset that brought us Dylann Roof. Dylann Roof did not rewrite history. He was reflecting history the way it is.” S.C. Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson said the leading Republicans for governor now have issues involving race: McMaster is a member of a country club with no black members and now Templeton is trying to appeal to racist tendencies of voters.

87,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/business/media/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-lawsuit.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Sydney Ember The author of a New York Times editorial will have to testify under oath in a defamation lawsuit filed by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, a federal judge ruled on Thursday. The Times filed a motion last month seeking to dismiss the case, and the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, said the testimony was necessary to help him determine whether to grant that motion. Judge Rakoff set the hearing for Aug. 16. Judge Rakoff said last month that he would rule by the end of this month on the motion to dismiss the case. A spokeswoman for The Times said in a statement that the news organization would provide the testimony the judge had ordered. David McCraw, deputy general counsel for The Times, said the witness would be James Bennet, The Times’s editorial page editor. In the lawsuit, which was filed in June, Ms. Palin contends that The Times “violated the law and its own policies” when it linked her in an editorial to a mass shooting in January 2011. The editorial was published online on June 14, the same day that a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where Republican congressmen were practicing, injuring several people including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana. The Times later published a correction and issued an apology on Twitter. Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit that the editorial conflicted with other articles The Times had published about Ms. Palin’s political activities and the 2011 mass shooting by Jared Loughner in Arizona. It cited several articles in The Times that dismissed the notion that there was any link between Ms. Palin, political rhetoric and the rampage. “The Times had ample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner’s crime,” Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit. In his order, Judge Rakoff said one of the questions presented by The Times’s motion to dismiss Ms. Palin’s case was “whether the complaint contains sufficient allegations of actual malice, an essential element of the claim.” Determining that, he added, depended in part on whether the author or authors of the editorial were aware of articles in The Times that contradicted what they wrote. That information, he said, was “peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant.” Advertisement",2017-08-10 20:19:25,New York Times Editorial Writer Must Testify in Sarah Palin Lawsuit,suits and litigation,1,http://nytimes.com

(Alex Pappas/Fox News) Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers are ramping up calls to remove Confederate statues on display in the halls of Congress, bringing the raging debate over Civil War symbols across the South to Capitol Hill. Nearly 10 Confederate-era figures are memorialized in the U.S. Capitol, each sponsored by a state. Mississippi displays Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, in Statuary Hall, for example. Virginia displays Gen. Robert E. Lee in the Capitol’s crypt. “There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,” House Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday. But even as numerous cities consider taking down monuments in the wake of the Charlottesville violence at a white supremacist rally, the Democrat-led effort on Capitol Hill faces slim chances of success. The 100 total statues on display are part of the National Statuary Hall Collection and aren’t chosen by Congress. Each state contributes two statues, chosen by their state governments, according to the Architect of the Capitol. “These are decisions for those states to make,” Doug Andres, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan, told Fox News. One Democrat suggests he wants to change that. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, believed to be mulling a possible run for president in 2020, said Wednesday he plans to introduce a bill to remove the statues from the Capitol building. “This is just one step,” Booker tweeted. “We have much work to do.” On Thursday, tourists packed into the halls of the Capitol on a hot August afternoon to see the monuments. Standing in Statuary Hall by the Jefferson Davis statue, one Capitol tour guide, wearing the customary red coat, informed one tour group about the latest calls to remove some of the statues. “So we will see,” the guide told the group. The tourists who visited the Capitol on Thursday expressed varying opinions about the proposal. “They shouldn’t be removed. It’s part of history, whether you like it or not,” said Gary Kincaid, 82, of Sedona, Ariz. Others said it’s time to make a change. “It probably shouldn’t have been allowed to be put up anyway,” said Mark Armstrong, 54, an Illinois resident who is retired from the Army. Speaking of the Confederates memorialized by the statues, Armstrong, who is black, said: “I mean, they seceded from the Union. It’s being a traitor, basically.” Another tourist outside the Capitol said he didn’t feel strongly one way or the other about the issue, but he appreciated both sides of the debate. “It’s tough to say,” said Damian, who declined to give his last name. “It’s part of our history, but it’s part of our history many people aren’t proud of.” Earlier this week, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz called on her state to remove its statue of Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith in the Capitol. “It's time for Florida lawmakers to call a special session to replace Florida's Confederate statue in our nation's Capitol,” Wasserman Schultz said. Other Confederates memorialized in the Capitol include: Alexander Stephens (Georgia), Joseph Wheeler (Alabama), James Z. George (Mississippi), Wade Hampton III (South Carolina), and Zebulon Baird Vance (North Carolina). After the 2015 mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie G. Thompson unsuccessfully pushed legislation to remove Confederate imagery from the Capitol. This week, he renewed his call. “Confederate memorabilia have no place in this country and especially not in the United States Capitol,” Thompson said. “These images symbolize a time of racial discrimination and segregation that continues to haunt this country and many African-Americans who still to this day face racism and bigotry.” President Trump on Thursday tweeted his displeasure with the recent push to remove Confederate symbols in cities across the country. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” Trump said. “You can't change history, but you can learn from it.” The president made a slippery slope argument, asking: “Who's next, Washington, Jefferson?” RICHMOND MAYOR WANTS CONFEDERATE STATUES ON MONUMENT AVENUE REMOVED The push has accelerated in recent days after a rally of white supremacists, protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, turned violent in Charlottesville last weekend. Since then, politicians in a number of states including Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland have called for the removal of statues.

MARIETTA, Ga. – A man accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth in a 2010 Georgia workplace mass shooting has been involuntarily committed to a prison psychiatric hospital after doctors said he has refused to take anti-psychotic medications. Jesse James Warren, of Temple, Georgia, opened fire at a Penske truck-leasing facility in Kennesaw on Jan. 12, 2010, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said in a news release Tuesday. Three men were killed the day of the shooting, while a fourth succumbed to his injuries three years later. Another person was injured but survived the attack, which occurred about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta. Investigators described Warren, 67, as a disgruntled ex-employee. Psychiatrists determined that Warren is not competent to stand trial. At a hearing Tuesday, two forensic psychiatrists from Georgia Regional Hospital testified that Warren still won't take medication for his disorder and is a danger to the community. The doctors also testified that Warren continues to believe that he invented Wi-Fi for the military, was paid $500 million by the government, and that Penske stole much of that money. The doctors said he also believes his defense attorneys — and, at times, his doctors — are working against him. Warren perceives threats where there are none and could react violently to those perceived threats without the structure and security of a hospital setting, they testified. One doctor testified that Warren has suffered delusions since at least 2005, when he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia. Warren's defense team, led by Gerald Word and Jimmy Berry, offered no rebuttal evidence and did not object to the state's request for civil commitment. Warren, who has been in custody since his arrest the day of the attack, did not speak during the hearing. Reynold's office said Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark reviewed all of the documents before signing the order to commit Warren to a secure state prison hospital indefinitely. His psychiatrist will report to the court at least once each year regarding Warren's mental condition. Chief Assistant District Attorney Jesse Evans acknowledges this is not the final resolution he would have liked. ""However, we take some solace in the fact that Mr. Warren will be locked up in a prison hospital and not able to inflict these kinds of harms on anyone else,"" Evans told the court.

91,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/nyregion/bronx-lebanon-hospital-siege-counterterrorism-nypd.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Al Baker Police radios crackled to life: someone was shooting inside Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. The gunman — an “active shooter,” in police parlance — was spraying bullets from a semiautomatic rifle at doctors and others, moving toward the roof and, according to fractured reports, setting fires. It was a deadly horror unfolding in a building created to save lives. But to New York City’s counterterrorism officials, the frantic second-by-second dispatches June 30 were something else: A real test of new antiterrorism plans. In its earliest moments, the hospital shooting sounded like the kind of low-tech assault called for in the pages of the propaganda magazine Rumiyah, which the Islamic State publishes for potential terrorists. It mirrored a siege on June 1 of the largest hotel-casino in the Philippines by an armed man carrying gasoline canisters. And it was similar to a recent training exercise: a scenario that New York police and fire officials had invented for a three-day tabletop drill just weeks earlier. In the end, the onslaught at Bronx-Lebanon was the work of one man, a disgruntled former employee, who died in the assault along with one of his victims. Still, it provided a crucial trial run for the new antiterrorism tactics. Those include a system in which armed officers escort paramedics to the periphery of mass shootings to save bleeding victims; the fast response of elite officers armed with long guns (180 police vehicles arrived at the hospital in minutes); and a new doctrine in which the first officer on the scene goes in fighting, no matter what. All of these tactics were put to work that harrowing day. “We constantly need to strive to adapt our strategies, our tactics, to face the world that we are living in and that is exactly what we are doing here,” said James E. Leonard, the Fire Department’s chief of department. An after-action review is ongoing, he said, to see “what went well; what can we do better.” On display that afternoon was the so-called Rescue Task Force, groups made up of paramedics and officers trained to face gunfire to care for victims so seriously wounded they might bleed to death before help arrives. The protocol calls for officers to go in and render an area — a hallway, lobby, staircase or floor — safe or “warm,” before forming “a force protection team” around a cadre of medical responders to “take them inside to start to do triage and start to remove patients,” said John J. Miller, the Police Department’s deputy commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism. The paramedics wear tan-colored, military-grade bullet-resistant vests and helmets, said Chief Leonard, who said 10 teams are “on duty at all times” around New York. The concept contrasts with previous tactics of having counterterrorism forces clear a scene before allowing medical personnel inside. And it solves a challenge law enforcement has confronted since as far back as the Columbine school shooting, in 1999, and as recently as the June 2016 attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla.: How to fight an armed assailant in a sprawling venue, such as a mall, theater or office building, while also tending to the injured. “There are cases that would benefit from a minute’s difference of high-quality medical response, as opposed to people laying on the ground while you cordon off the area,” said Juan C. Zarate, a deputy national security adviser during the George W. Bush administration. He also said it would keep the body count low, minimizing the sensational impact that terrorists aim for. New York is just one city incorporating trauma-care teams into counterterrorism responses, said John D. Cohen, who until 2014 served as the counterterrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security and is now a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University, where he is the co-leader on a project examining mass-casualty attacks in the United States and Europe. The Rescue Task Force is one of new counterterrorism elements designed bit by bit in New York since 2014, when the de Blasio administration moved in to City Hall. Perhaps the most dramatic is the creation of heavily armed counterterrorism squads that are always ready: the Strategic Response Group and the Critical Response Command. There are now 2,000 police officers in New York equipped with long guns to confront terrorists head-on, versus 500 such officers three years ago. Previously, trained officers had to be pulled off other assignments to respond to a mass shooting, taking crucial moments to change clothing and get the right equipment, find vehicles and converge from around the city. (The speed of the new approach was on display on June 30, when scores of officers, many with long guns, converged on Bronx-Lebanon.) Also, the first officer on the scene, whether on patrol or in plainclothes, now confronts the threat rather than backing off and radioing in details. So far, the department has trained 10,000 officers in active shooter response, adding more each day. They are trained to keep going until more heavily armed reinforcements, including officers from the Emergency Service Unit, arrive. All of that was in place when the violence erupted at Bronx-Lebannon, one of the city’s biggest and busiest. “By and large, everything worked the way we’ve honed it toward,” said Mr. Miller of the Police Department, who responded to the hospital that day. Of course, variables emerged. For one, Bronx-Lebanon is a high-rise with banks of elevators; the shooting played out on the 16th and 17th floors. Second, witness accounts indicated the gunman, Dr. Henry Bello, was moving upward and setting himself on fire. Dr. Bello, 45, who had been what is called a house physician at the hospital, had been dogged by financial troubles and possibly addiction. Dr. Bello killed one person: Dr. Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, 32, who had volunteered to cover a colleague’s shift that day. Six others were wounded. In the first moments of the attack, Dr. Bello’s moves mimicked the threat officials faced at the tabletop exercise that ended on June 1: a made-up scenario featuring a gunman, on the loose in a skyscraper, setting fires. (It ended, incredibly enough, just as the attack in Manila was getting underway.) Patrol officers, counterterrorism teams and the nascent Rescue Task Force came together as planned, Mr. Miller said. The first officers to arrive, from the 44th Precinct, ran inside and realized that people knew the identity of the attacker, who was believed to be hunting a particular person. Those officers moved from floor to floor — as victims fled to various points after being wounded. As they went, they broadcast Dr. Bello’s name on the radio and distributed his photo over their smartphones. “So that if someone encountered him, they would know he was the bad-guy doctor and not some other doctor,” Mr. Miller said. Emergency Service Unit officers arrived and took over as fire and other police responders formed teams of 12, with officers surrounding emergency medical technicians. “It was one of the first times, I think, in the nation, that rescue forces were activated in this fashion,” Chief Leonard said. Chief Leonard said fire and police officers met and deemed “the bigger threat” to be the gunman — not the small fires he had apparently set. So firefighters were held back. If the fires had been more threatening, he added, officers would have escorted firefighters up.

92,http://theconversation.com/more-states-are-allowing-guns-on-college-campuses-81791,"Professor of Higher Education, University of Mississippi Professor of Leadership and Counselor Education, University of Mississippi Neal H. Hutchens has informally advised The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus. Kerry B. Melear does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list A community college instructor in Texas recently started off the academic year by wearing a bulletproof vest and army helmet to class. He did this to protest a law that, starting this August, authorizes individuals to carry concealed handguns at public community colleges in Texas. In 2016, the same law had already allowed guns at four-year institutions. Texas and 10 other states now have laws permitting concealed carry of guns at colleges and universities. So far in 2017, campus carry bills have been introduced in at least 16 other states. As scholars of higher education law, we have both been following campus carry legislation quite closely. Kerry published an analysis of campus carry laws and policies and Neal has worked with an advocacy group that opposes guns on campus. While state laws and campus policies vary widely across the U.S., our view is that colleges and universities should not be forced to allow guns on their campuses – particularly in a political climate that has seen violence at dozens of colleges across the country. One key argument in favor of campus carry laws comes from the idea that arming students and faculty will protect the community in the case of a violent incident, such as the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech University in 2007. This campaign is also part of a larger effort – led by the National Rifle Association – to expand rights for individuals to carry guns in public places, including at colleges and universities. In 2004, such sentiments helped propel Utah to become the first state to allow guns on campus. Utah Republican State Sen. Michael Waddoups explained his support of the law: “If government can’t protect you, you should have the right to protect yourself.” Since Utah passed its law, other states have followed, with legislative interest picking up notably in the last five years. In May of 2017, Georgia joined the ranks as the 11th state to allow some form of concealed carry on public campuses. Though Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin all have campus carry laws, there are important differences among them. For some states, firearms are regularly permitted. Public colleges and universities in Utah and Arkansas must allow any individual with an appropriate permit to carry a concealed gun on campus, including inside campus buildings. In Tennessee, full-time employees, but not students, may carry concealed weapons. A handful of states have given schools some measure of autonomy.  In Wisconsin and Kansas, public institutions may choose to prohibit guns in specific buildings, but guns must be allowed elsewhere on campus. In Kansas, such an action requires the school to put in place certain security measures, like metal detectors and armed security guards in the buildings where guns have been banned. Meanwhile, some states are quite specific when it comes to one area of campus: sporting events. Earlier this year, Arkansas passed its campus carry law, which was quickly amended to prohibit guns at athletic contests. Georgia also doesn’t allow guns at college sporting events, but the law does allow concealed handguns at tailgating. What about the other 39 states? Individual colleges and universities have discretion in 23 states to decide whether guns are allowed on their campus. Among these, public institutions in Ohio can set their own policies when it comes to guns in campus areas and buildings, but firearms are allowed by law to be in locked cars in parking areas. The final 16 states prohibit outright the concealed carrying of guns at any college or university. From our perspective – and based on an emerging body of research – allowing individuals to carry guns on campus is not an effective way to prevent mass shootings and, in fact, may be more likely to lead to violent outcomes. Recent research by scholars at Johns Hopkins University discusses how guns on campus may allow suicidal individuals easier access to firearms. They note this is especially troubling since younger people, highly represented on college campuses, can be more susceptible to suicidal behavior that results in death or hospitalization. Indeed, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college-aged individuals. In general, gun deaths are more likely connected to personal disputes or domestic violence than mass shootings. The researchers at Johns Hopkins suggests that trend is true on college campuses as well, with gun incidents more likely to involve interpersonal conflict than a random shooting event. While not focused specifically on campus gun laws, another new study determined that states with concealed carry laws have experienced increases in violent crime. We believe that, rather than an effective deterrent to violence, guns on campus are more likely to put people at risk. The prevailing sentiments at many schools across the U.S. seem to suggest that institutions of higher learning likely don’t view campus carry as enhancing safety. While public colleges and universities in Texas must allow firearms to be carried, private institutions have the option of adopting campus carry under the state’s law. Yet, so far, only one private university in the state has done so. What’s more, several universities in campus carry states have sought to challenge state laws. While ultimately unsuccessful, public institutions in Utah and Colorado engaged in lawsuits in an effort to keep guns off their campuses. Dozens of recent incidents at colleges across the country have shown that campuses are currently epicenters of protest and unrest. The recent violence prompted by white nationalist gatherings at and near the University of Virginia highlighted this in a disturbing fashion. In short, it’s not unreasonable to expect university administrators to be concerned that permitting guns on their campuses could lead to violence, cause fear in their community, and interfere with their educational mission. These are the same administrators who can limit educational and civic activities that they feel are potentially dangerous (like making campus venues unavailable for certain events). But in 11 states, administrators aren’t able to make these decisions when it comes to faculty and students carrying concealed weapons. We believe that guns on campus should be prohibited outright – as they are in many states. However, if states insist on maintaining campus carry laws, institutions should at least be given the legal discretion to design appropriate policies for their unique campus contexts.

Robert E. Lee High School, established in 1958, takes its name from the Confederate general-in-chief. Its mascot is currently the Volunteer and the school colors are red and grey. Its pep squad, currently called the Southern Belles, were once called the Confederates, according to Express-News archives. And, its varsity dance team and junior varsity drill team are respectively named the Rebel Rousers and Dixie Drillers.

San Antonio lawmakers are looking ahead to removing a statue that many people wrongly assumed represented a famed Texas leader who died at the Alamo. Some people refused to wait.  Protesters in Durham, North Carolina, toppled a nearly century-old statue of a Confederate soldier Monday at a rally against racism. Activists took a ladder up to the statue and used a rope to pull down the Confederate Soldiers Monument that was dedicated in 1924. A diverse crowd of dozens cheered as the statue of a soldier holding a rifle fell to the ground in front of an old courthouse building that now houses local government offices. RELATED: Officer on fatal Charlottesville crash: 'Hahahaha love this' The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is fueling another re-evaluation of Confederate statues in cities across the nation, accelerating their removal in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist renewed pressure to take down the Confederate flag from public property. ""We should not glorify a part of our history in front of our buildings that really is a testament to America's original sin,"" Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe said Monday after the statue known as ""Old Joe"" was returned to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904. A county spokesman said he did not know if the statue was removed because of the events that killed one person and injured dozens more Saturday in Charlottesville. But many officials who were horrified by the confrontation soon began publicizing plans to take down statues. The Southern Poverty Law Center last year counted more than 1,500 things around the country named after Confederate figures or dedicated to the Confederacy, including holidays, statues, flags and the names of cities, counties, schools and parks. Nearly half are monuments, which are in 24 states. Most of the dedications are in the South, but 24 are in the North and 21 in states that did not exist at the time of the Civil War.

""These monuments, memorials and markers represent a time in our history that caused pain to so many,"" she said Monday. Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the weekend bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. San Antonio Councilman Robert Trevino is promoting a measure that would remove the Confederate statue at the center of Travis Park, where for years people have mistakenly identified the figure as being that of Col. William Travis, a Texas hero who died at the Alamo. ""This is not an important art piece, but a monument to power. It was put in to remind people of that power. It is an unfortunate message of hate, and we think it's important to relocate it."" Trevino said Monday. ""We do think that history is important so we're looking for an appropriate location for it."" St. Louis dismantled its Confederate Monument in Forest Park in June, giving it to the Missouri Civil War Museum after years of debate. RELATED: Locals gathered at Travis Park to honor a woman killed in car attack in Virginia In Baltimore, Pugh announced Monday that she would move forward with the removal of Baltimore's statues of Roger B. Taney, a Marylander who wrote the 1856 Dred Scott supreme court ruling that denied citizenship to African-Americans, and a statue of two Virginians, Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Pugh said she was making plans to send the statues to cemeteries with Confederate dead outside the city. But hours later, the city council voted unanimously to have the statues destroyed instead of moved. It was unclear whether anything would happen to the statues immediately. Seconds after the monument fell in Durham on Monday, protesters began kicking the crumpled bronze monument. In response, Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper tweeted: ""The racism and deadly violence in Charlottesville is unacceptable but there is a better way to remove these monuments."" Back in May, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu moved his city's four main Confederate statues, including a statue of Lee, at night after threats of violence from Confederate sympathizers and white supremacists. Pugh said she is consulting with Landrieu, now head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, about the removal of Baltimore's statues and the cost. The violence in Charlottesville will probably speed up efforts to do away with the monuments, experts said. RELATED: Rowdy but peaceful counter protesters converge on Travis Park Saturday The convergence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis with Confederate imagery in Charlottesville will make it difficult for government agencies to defend having Confederate statues on their property, Boston University history professor Heather Cox Richardson said. ""The idea that this somehow is about Southern heritage, I think that ship sailed,"" said Richardson, who teaches and writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction and Southern politics. Violence and death changes things, agreed University of Georgia political science professor M.V. ""Trey"" Hood III. Photos of gunman Dylan Roof, who fatally shot nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, showed him with a Confederate flag and triggered a swift ""sea change"" in perception of the banner, Hood said. Then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley successfully led calls to bring down a Confederate flag that had flown on Statehouse grounds for 54 years. Other cities and organizations began accelerating their removal of Confederate imagery following Roof's arrest. Now local officials will find it harder to ignore or shelve questions about Confederate statues, Richardson said. ""It was always possible for people to look the other way,"" she said. ""After Charlottesville, I do not see how Americans can look the other way. You have to make a choice at this moment."" ___ This story corrects spelling of last name of San Antonio Councilman Robert Trevino, not Travino. ___ Jesse J.

95,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/08/02/stanford-prof-mass-shootings-commonly-stopped-unarmed-americans-rather-armed-ones/,"Stanford University professor and researcher John J. Donohue suggested Wednesday that it is “much more common that an unarmed person will stop a mass shooting than an armed citizen will.” He made his comment on the Pat Morrison Asks podcast at the Los Angeles Times, based on the observation that “most people are unarmed.” Donohue’s suggestion can be proven wrong via logic and experience. First, consider how it would look if one tried to present Donahue’s statement as a logical argument: Premise A: Most people are unarmed. Premise B: Some mass shootings are stopped. Conclusion (A+B =): It is “much more common that an unarmed person will stop a mass shooting than an armed citizen will.” It is readily apparent that Donohoe’s conclusion is actually an assertion in need of substantiation; it does not follow from the premises he used. And that is because there are so many variables that Donohoe leaves out. Those variables include Democrat-mandated gun-free zones, where law-abiding Americans who are normally armed for self-defense are forced into the category of “unarmed” persons by forces outside their control. The variables also include an unstated, or unknown, percentage of mass shootings that are actually stopped by unarmed people. When testing Donohue’s claims in light of experience, the problems with his claims are even clearer. It is almost always a “good guy or girl with a gun” who stops a public mass attacker. The second-most-probable outcome is that the attacker takes his or her own life. Consider the following mass public attacks: The claim that it is “much more common that an unarmed person will stop a mass shooting than an armed citizen will” is demonstrably false.

After the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va., many city leaders and even some governors around the country have urged the removal of Confederate monuments in their jurisdictions — a typically bureaucratic process that, in cities like New Orleans and Charlottesville, have been met with legal delays that helped feed tensions surrounding their removal. But, in an interview here, Ms. Pugh suggested the tense political climate had turned her city’s statues into a security threat and she said that her emergency powers allowed her to have them removed immediately. “The mayor has the right to protect her city,” she said. “For me, the statues represented pain, and not only did I want to protect my city from any more of that pain, I also wanted to protect my city from any of the violence that was occurring around the nation. We don’t need that in Baltimore.” In recent days, cities and resident from Gainesville, Fla. to Lexington, Ky., called for their Confederate monuments to come down on the heels of the weekend’s violent clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters over a Robert E. Lee statue that is set for removal in Charlottesville. David Goldfield, a professor of history who studies Confederate symbols at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said the removal of the monuments in Baltimore was likely to be part of a “rolling cascade” of cities and states ridding themselves of, or at least relocating, similar statues. ”You’re going to see another wave of these removals.” Mr. Goldfield said. “The fact that it’s done fairly expeditiously is not surprising because if you do it quickly the opposition can’t build up, and the confrontations that we’ve had, not only in Charlottesville but elsewhere, will not materialize.” Many government officials have called to remove dozens of controversial statues, markers and other monuments from public grounds. Ms. Pugh said she had spoken with the president of the City Council on Monday, the same day the council voted unanimously to remove the four monuments, and said she intended to take them down “quickly and quietly.” Initially, she also wrote a letter to the Maryland Historical Trust, providing notice of her concerns, but was advised by the city’s attorney that she could move forward without its approval, based on her executive powers to protect the city. “I think any city that has Confederate statues are concerned about violence occurring in their city,” Ms. Pugh said. Small, celebratory crowds gathered as the monuments were removed overnight. Residents were seen celebrating by the pedestal of a monument to the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, two Confederate generals, which had been spray-painted with the phrase “Black Lives Matter.” The mayor had moved so swiftly that even some members of Baltimore’s City Council were unaware. The president of the City Council, Bernard C. Young, known as Jack, missed a late-night phone call from the mayor because he had taken cold medicine for bronchitis and was asleep. And Brandon Scott, another member of the City Council, received a text message from a city worker informing him of the removals while he was talking with his neighbors about a shooting in his neighborhood. “I didn’t know it was going to happen yesterday,” said Mr. Scott, although he was glad the city acted swiftly to stave off any effort by protesters to take them down themselves — like the ones in Durham, N.C. Members of one activist group, Baltimore Bloc, had announced Tuesday on Twitter that the city planned to take down the statues on Wednesday evening. Instead, at least one of their members watched happily as a statue of Lee and Jackson was hoisted off its pedestal, posting a video on Twitter and writing, “Move Lee, get out the way, get out the way Jackson, get out the way.” The city had been studying what to do with its Confederate monuments since 2015, when a mass shooting by a white supremacist at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., led to a renewed debate across the South about removing Confederate monuments and battle flags from public spaces. Ms. Pugh said she had been working on the removal of the statues since June, when she met with Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans to discuss his city’s removal of its own Confederate monuments. By last week, she said she had reached out to contractors to solicit assessments on the feasibility of removing each of the statues in short order, and sped up her efforts after watching the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday. Ms. Pugh said she did not anticipate a legal challenge but that the city would fight any suit. “I don’t think it would matter, because I think having consulted with my legal team I acted in the best interest of my city,” she said, The mayor said she did not know where the statues were moved or where they will end up. She suggested plaques be installed that describe “what was there and why it was removed.” Maryland never seceded from the Union in the Civil War, but there was popular support for the Confederacy in Baltimore and southern Maryland, where Confederate soldiers are buried. The monuments, here in a majority-black city, are considered widely offensive because of their ties to slavery and the Confederacy. The monuments, which are now empty pedestals, included the one to Lee and Jackson, a double equestrian statue of the generals erected in 1948; the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, erected in 1903; and a statue of Roger B. Taney, a Supreme Court Justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision, which held that even free blacks had no claim to citizenship, which was erected in 1887. The fourth statue, the Confederate Women’s Monument, was dedicated in 1917. On Tuesday, Gov. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor here, called for the removal of a second Taney statue, this one from the State House grounds in Annapolis, the state capital. Some of the empty pedestals, including the one to Mr. Taney in the Mount Vernon neighborhood, drew the attention of passers-by, some who were seen reaching atop the pedestal to feel a sticky black goo left behind. For a moment, a middle-aged woman pulled up in a sedan and idled next to the site. “Have they taken the monument down?” she yelled out a window to a man sitting on a nearby bench. “All of them?” He answered in the affirmative, and she responded with a slur before driving away. Kaylyn Meyers, 29, watched the exchange and said it seemed to sum up the tension gripping the country. “People are really emboldened right now,” she said, while pausing to smoke a cigarette and look at the pedestal. Regarding the woman in the car who uttered the slur, she said, “That was just completely wrong.” Ms. Meyers had taken the day off to visit all four monument sites. History could not and should not be erased, she said, but men like Taney did not belong on a pedestal in a nice public park, either. “Good riddance,” she said.

97,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/us/politics/pelosi-confederate-statues-capitol.html?mcubz=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Thomas Kaplan WASHINGTON — The nationwide push to dismantle Confederate memorials divided Congress’s most senior Democrats on Thursday, as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, pressed for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol while her Senate counterpart tried to keep the focus on President Trump’s equivocation over white nationalists. “The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,” Ms. Pelosi said, putting pressure on the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to act. “If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, took a very different tack, saying that Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, were “trying to divert attention away from the president’s refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism and other forms of bigotry.” The division highlighted how delicate the political path forward might be for Democrats after the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend. While large majorities of Americans say they disagree with the beliefs of white nationalists and the Ku Klux Klan, even Democratic voters are divided over the removal of Confederate memorials. The fate of those monuments has been the focus of attention around the country after the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, which protested the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a city park. Mr. Trump has added fuel to the debate about such monuments, writing on Twitter on Thursday, “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.” On Wednesday night, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would introduce a bill to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol. But with the president plunging into the longstanding debate over the appropriate place of Civil War-era symbols in contemporary society, Mr. Schumer argued on Thursday that Mr. Trump was trying to shift the conversation away from his own response to the violence in Charlottesville. “While it is critical that we work towards the goal of Senator Cory Booker’s legislation,” Mr. Schumer said, “we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions.” A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, said on Thursday that Democrats remain united in their focus on the president. “Whether it’s the adulation of Confederate statues, the hiring of white supremacists as staff in the White House, or his confusion in knowing right from wrong, true from false or American patriotism from white nationalism, Democrats are united in continuing to hold President Trump accountable for his actions and statements,” he said. At the Capitol, the debate over a collection of statues contributed by the states to commemorate notable people is not new. It flared after the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and a Republican attempt to allow Confederate symbols at national cemeteries shut down once-routine spending legislation that year. Each state is allowed two statues, and at least 10 or so statues recognize Confederate figures. The statues are scattered in different locations, some more prominent than others. Among those represented include Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, whose statue was given by Mississippi and stands in National Statuary Hall, next to the Capitol rotunda. A statue of Lee, given by Virginia, stands in a room underneath the rotunda called the crypt. Federal law allows states to request the replacement of statues that are part of the collection. Mr. Ryan’s office showed no desire on Thursday to weigh in on whether the Confederate statues should remain. “These are decisions for those states to make,” said Doug Andres, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan. Mr. Hammill rejected that argument. “For Speaker Ryan to hide behind states’ rights to defend the symbols of the Confederacy is as shameful as it is preposterous,” Mr. Hammill said. He added that the statues could be moved to a private space in the Capitol, away from public view. For Democrats, the push to remove the statues moves the post-Charlottesville debate into delicate territory. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this week found that 52 percent of Americans believed Mr. Trump’s response to the violence was not strong enough, compared with 27 percent who thought it was. But 62 percent said statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should remain as historical symbols, including 44 percent of Democrats. (Forty-seven percent of Democrats said they should be removed on account of being offensive to some people.) Mr. Booker plans to introduce his legislation when Congress returns next month following its August recess. “The Capitol is a place for all Americans to come and feel welcomed, encouraged and inspired,” Mr. Booker said. “Confederate statues do the opposite. They are, unequivocally, not only statues of treasonous Americans, but are symbolic to some who seek to revise history and advance hate and division.” A spokeswoman for the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, declined to comment on Thursday. Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, a racial justice organization, said his group planned to draw attention to the need to remove the statues at the Capitol. Mr. Robinson questioned the presence of Confederate statues on what he described as “hallowed ground where laws are made and decisions are made about this country’s future and who’s valued and who’s not.” “Those statues are celebrations of these people,” he said. “They are not showing the rapes or the beatings or the selling off of children from their parents.” Advertisement",2017-08-17 08:00:00,Call to Remove Confederate Statues From Capitol Divides Democrats,"politics and government,law and legislation,demonstrations and riots",1,http://nytimes.com

Bennet’s testimony, given in federal district court in Lower Manhattan, was the focus of an evidentiary hearing in the suit over the editorial, which was published after Rep. Steve Scalise was shot in Virginia while practicing for the annual congressional baseball game. The editorial linked Palin to the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that gravely injured former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and several others. After it was corrected, the editorial stated that the committee ""circulated a map that showed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs"" — removing the reference that said it had targeted individual members. The Times later issued a correction, and added a new sentence to the editorial, clarifying that ""no connection to the shooting was ever established” between the PAC’s map and the shooting. Palin argued the Times, which described the map circulated by the PAC as a kind of “political incitement,” had defamed her by publishing ""a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed in June. Federal District Judge Jed Rakoff requested Wednesday’s evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not to allow Palin’s lawsuit against the paper to proceed. Rakoff said he intends to rule on that question before the end of August. The determination will rest in part on whether the suit meets the high standards for defamation cases to proceed in the United States — a requirement for the plaintiff to show the Times committed “actual malice” in its publication of the editorial. That is the legal standard for defamation cases involving public figures such as Palin. Rakoff had previously said that answering that question would depend on whether the author of the editorial was aware of articles or editorials in the New York Times contradicting the editorial. Through their questioning, the Times’s lawyers sought to demonstrate that Bennet, who has been the paper’s editorial page editor since April of 2016, was pressed for time on the day of the shooting, and unaware of both prior columns and news articles that contradicted the editorial, and of a news story to be published the day after the shooting by one of the Times’ reporters, which also said there was no confirmed connection between heated political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting. Bennet was not the initial author of the editorial, entitled “America’s Lethal Politics,” but he substantially rewrote the rough draft written by Times staffer Elizabeth Williamson, which he received in the early evening on the day the shooting took place, he said. Bennet said he and editorial board members discussed the aims of the editorial at a board meeting after the shooting took place the morning of June 14, in order to focus attention on the horror of that day and the act itself, to restate the Times editorial board’s position advocating for more sensible gun control laws, and to express concern about the state of political rhetoric in the country. Williamson’s initial draft didn’t accomplish the Times’ goals, and didn’t focus enough on the “horror of the day and the significance of the act,” Bennet said. The lateness of the hour and impending deadlines led him to significantly rewrite portions of the editorial himself, adding the sentences which were corrected later in response to complaints about their accuracy. In using the phrase “political incitement” in the editorial, which Bennet added to Williamson’s draft and which was later changed in corrections to the piece, Bennet said he originally was “looking for a very strong word to write about the political climate because I wanted to get our readers’ attention.” Although “incitement” is typically defined as urging someone to engage in a kind of behavior, Bennet said he’d used the word in the sense he observed Palestinians and Israelis using it, when he covered the region for the Times, “to talk about a range of communications, from deliberate orders, to textbooks that elide important facts, to maps that misrepresent the politics of the region.” Bennet said he hadn’t intended to suggest that the map the PAC circulated in 2011 was “tantamount to complicity in attempted murder,” although many of the Times’ readers interpreted it that way. Bennet said readers’ reactions to the editorial and the misrepresentations he thought he’d unintentionally made caused him a “tremendous amount of concern,” leading the paper to make corrections to the piece in the morning on the following day. “I had created an ambiguity,” Bennet said. “Our first priority is to get the facts right.” He said the uproar over the editorial left Times staffers and editors “scrambling” the following day. Lawyers for Palin asked Bennet, whose brother Michael is a Democratic senator in Colorado, whether he knew that Colorado Democratic Congress members who endorsed his brother in 2016 had been listed as targets on the 2011 map, or whether he remembered that a PAC associated with Giffords, advocating gun control, had endorsed his brother’s re-election. Bennet said he did not remember or recall those circumstances at the time he was rewriting the editorial. Rakoff asked lawyers for both parties to submit briefs explaining what they thought the hearing added to the judge’s impending decision, “particularly on the issue of actual malice, which I think looms as a significant issue.” Delivered daily by 6 a.m., New York Education is your guide to the day’s top education news and policy in Albany and around the Empire State.

I know the pain that hate can cause, and we need to isolate haters, and we need to make sure that they know there is no place for them.” Haley mentioned their talk again on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday, saying she was the one who initiated the talk. “I picked up the phone and I had a private conversation with the president about Charlottesville, and it was taken very well,” Haley said. But when asked afterward, she would not confirm or deny whether Trump acknowledged he made a mistake with his racially charged comments. “The president clarified so that no one can question that he’s opposed to bigotry and hate in this country,"" she said. Trump set off a fresh furor last week when he doubled down on his claim that ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville that left one woman dead, while seeming to express sympathy for some of the protesters associated with the white supremacist rally. Playbook Plus By ANNA PALMER, JAKE SHERMAN and DANIEL LIPPMAN Members of his administration have generally defended Trump's comments — or tried to avoid the question — as other Republicans have been more forceful in condemning the president's response. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, had her own turn in the national spotlight in 2015 when a mass shooting at a historical black church by a white gunman who had posed with Confederate flags sparked a push to remove such a flag from statehouse grounds. While Haley did not immediately decide to remove the Confederate flag after the shooting, she called for it to come down five days later, which brought her praise and criticism from across the country. “Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our Capitol grounds,” Haley said on June 24, 2015. “What I realize now more than ever is people were driving by and felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain.” And she echoed that rhetoric to address how Trump handled Charlottesville, saying that she believes he clarified the important distinction between freedom of speech and hate speech. “Anyone that goes and tries to spew hate on someone because of their color or religion or their place in life, that’s terribly wrong,” Haley said. “It’s something that we don’t stand for in America, and I think the president clarified that last night.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. A California 'featureless' rifle with fixed stock, no pistol grip, muzzle brake, maximum 10-round capacity magazines. It has a regular magazine catch. NRA/CMP competition rules were modified in 2017 to accommodate rifles like these from restrictive law states. It seems California lawmakers’ efforts to force rifle owners to register their personal details, or resort to cumbersome reloading or giving up their arms altogether, may have missed the mark. Although months behind schedule, the State of California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) this week opened up its online registration for gun owners to enroll their bullet-button toting AR-15 rifles – now deemed to be “assault weapons” – in line with a controversial set of sweeping gun control laws signed into state law last year. But gunmakers and owners say they already have come up with creative workarounds to be legally compliant but avoid giving the government even more personal information. “The registration is seen by many as a trap to purge the owner since they ask for very specific information about acquisition of the original rifle that most owners don’t have or remember,” Steven Lieberman, a California-based attorney and founder of firearms training company Artemis Defense, told Fox News. “As a result, the ‘guesstimate’ as most would, they are potentially committing perjury.” The registration process is considered by many to be “more intrusive” compared to prior registration processes. In the past, one simply needed to submit a list of serial numbers to the state’s DOJ. This time, the level of information required includes everything from locating their receipts to confirm when they originally purchased their firearms, as well as multiple photos of each gun to be uploaded, and all on a website technology rather than mobile device optimized. This leaves the California gun owner who chooses not to register with the option of opting for a “featureless” model – deemed an AR-15 that does not contain a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a vertical grip, or a flash suppressor. And, perhaps ironically, it has actually breathed new life into the otherwise declining gun sales. California gun owners thus can bypass registration by either revising their current platform to the featureless style or buying a new one altogether. “If there had been no change in the law, the California market demand for guns would have fallen just like it did in the rest of the country as demand for these types of firearms fell with the coming of the Trump presidency,” said California firearms instructor and risk analyst Dennis Santiago. He was referring to the drop in demand nationwide for guns, given that sales soared during the Obama era as gun proponents feared stringent gun control measures would be put in place. “Instead, lawmakers just propped up demand again, and opened up the market for gun owners to convert their guns and manufacturers to make new guns that easily circumvent the law with a few cosmetic changes,” he added. Comparison of California ""bullet button"" (top) and  ""featureless"" pattern (bottom) magazine releases. At the heart of the legislation is the outlawing of the AR-15’s “bullet button” – already a feature not used in other states and designed to slow down the reloading process given that it requires a tool to be pushed on the ‘button’ to eject a spent magazine before being able to reload. By focusing on detachable magazines, California lawmakers were endeavoring to make it an even more laborious reloading process. Marc Levine, a Democratic State Assembly member who was a huge backer of the new gun laws, told Fox News: “By closing the bullet button loophole, it is slowing down the reloading mechanism. Lawmakers will continue to do whatever it takes to keep communities safe.” But savvy designers, Santiago contends, have other ideas. “Lawmakers were probably thinking that guns would require being taken apart to reload them as a result of their new law. They were mistaken,” Santiago explained. “Ironically, the next generation of unregistered semi-automatic rifles will be better; almost all new designs will have detachable magazines again.” Chris Eger, a staff writer for Guns.com, pointed out that within days of the new legislation, there already were workaround devices and tweaks being concocted by “some clever person ... invented to defeat it.” “We have covered several new inventions that have popped up just in the past few months, and you can imagine right now that there are rooms of people burning lean muscle tissue into the night trying to come up with more,” he said. Manufacturers have redesigned their products to take advantage of the new law's ""featureless"" build definition. “As long as states continue to pass feature-based bans and/or until the Supreme Court finally decides that all of these laws are unconstitutional,” Alan Thordsen, President of Thordsen Customs in California, said, “There will be companies like us and others designing ways to keep law-abiding citizens in compliance.” Eger noted that the new way without the bullet button may end up making reloading more efficient. “The new way can be faster, especially with some aftermarket attachments made to break open the receivers more quickly,” he said. SALE OF FIREARMS THAT USE BULLET BUTTONS SURGE AHEAD OF NEW CALIFORNIA GUN LAW CONCEALED-HANDGUN CARRY BILL TRIGGERS PUSHBACK FROM COASTAL MAYORS, POLICE CHIEFS But despite the apparent outmaneuvering, California’s gun control proponents stand firm that the new legislation is still a step in the right direction. “It’s no surprise that gun manufacturers are coming up with ways to try to get around reasonable restrictions,” said Levine, adding that they will continue to address the “workarounds” with legislation as necessary. And Ari Freilich, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, concurred that although “workarounds have already been introduced,” they are confident that this legislation will “save lives and reduce the lethality of mass shooting events.” Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

103,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-idUSKBN1AK28F,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Noel Randewich 3 Min Read SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Background checks related to U.S. firearm purchases suffered their deepest quarterly decline in over three years in July, suggesting a sales slump despite price discounts aimed at improving customer demand following President Donald Trump’s election. Fears that Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton would win the election and limit gun sales led to record purchases last year, but Trump’s surprise victory has had a reverse effect, with 2017 sales falling and investors selling gunmaker shares. U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation background checks in July fell 25 percent to 907,348, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. That was the worst year-over-year decline in background checks since November 2013, a year after Democratic President Barack Obama won his second election. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2hv75dS) Background checks are a strong proxy for monthly gun sales, whose figures manufacturers do not publicly release. Reflecting lower demand for guns, Sturm Ruger & Company Inc RGR.N on Thursday reported revenue for the quarter ending on July 1 down 22 percent at $132 million. The company said the drop was due to unusually strong demand last year related to the Nov. 8 election. During the second quarter, shops bought fewer guns as they worked through existing inventory, and revenues also fell as other manufacturers offered rebates, Sturm Ruger said. Also on Thursday, sporting goods retailer Cabela's Inc CAB.N posted a 4.2 percent decrease in quarterly revenue. “Since the fall election, we have continued to see a slowdown in firearms and shooting related categories,” Cabela’s Chief Executive Tommy Millner said in a statement. Millner also pointed out that the quarter came a year after a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which led to an increase in gun sales due to worries that about potential new gun restrictions. Shares of American Outdoor Brands Corp AOBC.O, the owner of Smith & Wesson, hit all-time highs last year. But since the election, the stock has fallen 30 percent, while Sturm Ruger has lost 17 percent. Ammunition seller Vista Outdoor Inc VSTO.N has dropped 41 percent. The National Shooting Sports Foundation strips its background checks data of applications for conceal-carry permits, typically made by people who already own guns, to give a better reflection of actual purchases. Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor both rose over 1 percent on Friday but were down for the past week by 7 percent and 2 percent, respectively. American Outdoor Brands was down 1.1 percent on Friday and 3 percent lower in the past five sessions.

104,https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/No-study-committee-needed-on-Confederate-plaque-11942775.php,"AUSTIN — Taking aim at House Speaker Joe Straus, Rep. Eric Johnson said Friday that no study committee is needed to remove a Confederate plaque near his Capitol office that denies that slavery led to Texas secession, only a “history book and a crowbar.” So far, Straus is the only member of the board that oversees the Texas Capitol grounds who has even indicated a desire to review the “accuracy of signs and monuments” on the complex, amid a push by Johnson to remove all Confederate imagery in the wake of deadly protests in Charlottesville. Johnson, D-Dallas, contends that this kind of review could take years, and he said previous efforts, including one after the racially motivated mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, resulted with no meetings ever taking place. “With all due respect to Speaker Straus, we’ve been down this road before, and it has gotten us nowhere,” he said. A spokesman for Straus, R-San Antonio, did not immediately return a request for comment. Johnson wrote a letter to the State Preservation Board this week calling for the removal of all Confederate imagery on the Capitol grounds, in addition to the plaque. At least half of the six members who govern the board, however, are opposed to removing monuments and say the state should learn from its past, instead of trying to bury it. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who chairs the board, condemned the violence in Virginia but said that “tearing down monuments won’t erase our nation’s past, and it doesn’t advance our nation’s future.” But in a written response released late Friday, Rod Walsh, the board's executive director, assured Johnson that the board has initiated a review of the plaque and applicable state law. Texas is one of several states considering removal of Confederate imagery after the racially driven protests in Charlottesville, which left one woman dead and dozens more injured. Several rallies and counter-rallies are in the works; a rally set to take place in Austin to “promote the true Confederate heritage” has been delayed until Sept. 23 after discussion with the city’s police, according to the Austin American-Statesman.

107,http://observer.com/2017/08/bronx-interfaith-vigil-charlottesville-white-nationalists/,"Bishop Angelo Rosario, head of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr.’s Bronx Clergy Task Force, speaks at interfaith vigil in Riverdale. Madina Toure/Observer Interfaith leaders gathered in the Riverdale section of the Bronx on Sunday evening with dozens of others to show support for victims of violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend.
A group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia’s campus on Friday night holding tiki torches and screaming “blood and soil,” a Nazi slogan, encircling counter-protesters and hurling their torches at them.
The following day, white nationalist and alt-right groups hosted a “Unite the Right” rally to protest the city’s decision to get rid of a statue of confederate General Robert E. Lee. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, drove his car into counter-protesters and killed 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer, while injuring at least 19 other counter-protesters. Fields’s high school teacher said that he “was very big into Nazism” and “really bought into this white supremacist thing.”
The “Emergency Anti-Hate Vigil” was held at the Riverdale–Spuyten Duyvil–Kingsbridge Memorial Bell Tower in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Participants said they wanted to stand up in protest against the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville and condemn hate, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism and terrorism committed by white nationalists. The Interfaith Clergy Council of Riverdale, Kingsbridge and Spuyten Duyvil sponsored the vigil.
The Rev. Andrew Butler, rector at Christ Church Riverdale, said that it “seems like we were here for one of these not long ago,” referring to a vigil they held in the wake of the mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, in June. He noted that “whenever we turn on the radio or the TV, there’s always something bad.”
Butler said that he is from Virginia and spent a lot of time in Charlottesville “so it’s especially touching for me.” He said that he “grew up in that culture” — he went to Stonewall Jackson Middle School, Lee Davis High School and his marching band was called the Marching Confederates.
“That was 30 years ago and I look back on that and I think, ‘Wait a minute. There’s something wrong with that,'” Butler said. “And now I’m living in Riverdale in the Bronx in the most incredible, diverse community. My parish is the most diverse church I’ve ever served at and there’s something beautiful about different people coming together around a single purpose. For my folks, it’s for worship.”
He noted that the majority of the people in attendance at Sunday’s vigil were white, and stressed the importance of being aware of the challenges with which people of color and marginalized groups generally deal.
“I know that there is a vigil tomorrow down at Church of the Mediator at the bottom of the hill, at 231 and something,” Butler continued. “Same time tomorrow night. And there are people there who felt like there seems to be more minorities down the bottom of the hill than up here Sometimes even though we’re diverse, I feel like we live in a bubble.”
In another incident, white nationalists hit Deandre Harris, a 20-year-old who moved to Charlottesville from Suffolk, Va., in 2015 for a job at a local high school, with a pole. The U.S. Department of Justice said that it has opened a civil rights probe, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called on white supremacists to “leave America.”
Bishop Angelo Rosario, the pastor of the Church of God’s Children who runs Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr.’s Bronx Clergy Task Force, said that human beings have the ability to “fight against evil.” He recalled going to Vietnam in 1968 during the Vietnam War and how people of all faiths and of all races “were fighting together to stop evil.”
“I remember coming back home and not being recognized for what we’d done but we had Christians, Jews, Muslims, African American, Hispanic shedding their blood in order to keep the United States free so that we may be able to stay free,” Rosario said. “Thou shalt not kill. And the only way that we can destroy evil is by coming together, holding arms and holding our hearts together to make a difference.”
He noted that the task force he oversees is diverse — and that people unite over prayer.
“We have all denominations and everyone coming together in prayer,” Rosario continued. “And the greatest thing besides prayer is our standing together with one faith because we are people of faith. We stand together.”
Bronx Assemblyman Jeffry Dinowitz, who represents Riverdale, Woodlawn Heights, North Riverdale and Kingsbridge, said that the fact that such a large crowd turned out for the vigil “on just a few hours notice” is indicative of the community’s commitment to peace. He said President Trump’s election last year “crystallized” a new form of open white nationalism in the United States, although he also acknowledged that this strain of racist views preceded Trump’s election. “The people who are saying these horrible things, they’re saying they’re great Americans. They wanna take America back. They wanna make America white again, or is it great again — I forget, one of those,” he said. “That’s what they want.”

Bishop Angelo Rosario, the pastor of the Church of God’s Children who runs Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr.’s Bronx Clergy Task Force, said that human beings have the ability to “fight against evil.” He recalled going to Vietnam in 1968 during the Vietnam War and how people of all faiths and of all races “were fighting together to stop evil.”
“I remember coming back home and not being recognized for what we’d done but we had Christians, Jews, Muslims, African American, Hispanic shedding their blood in order to keep the United States free so that we may be able to stay free,” Rosario said. “Thou shalt not kill. And the only way that we can destroy evil is by coming together, holding arms and holding our hearts together to make a difference.”
He noted that the task force he oversees is diverse — and that people unite over prayer.
“We have all denominations and everyone coming together in prayer,” Rosario continued. “And the greatest thing besides prayer is our standing together with one faith because we are people of faith. We stand together.”
Bronx Assemblyman Jeffry Dinowitz, who represents Riverdale, Woodlawn Heights, North Riverdale and Kingsbridge, said that the fact that such a large crowd turned out for the vigil “on just a few hours notice” is indicative of the community’s commitment to peace. He said President Trump’s election last year “crystallized” a new form of open white nationalism in the United States, although he also acknowledged that this strain of racist views preceded Trump’s election. “The people who are saying these horrible things, they’re saying they’re great Americans. They wanna take America back. They wanna make America white again, or is it great again — I forget, one of those,” he said. “That’s what they want.”

Butler said that he is from Virginia and spent a lot of time in Charlottesville “so it’s especially touching for me.” He said that he “grew up in that culture” — he went to Stonewall Jackson Middle School, Lee Davis High School and his marching band was called the Marching Confederates.
“That was 30 years ago and I look back on that and I think, ‘Wait a minute. There’s something wrong with that,'” Butler said. “And now I’m living in Riverdale in the Bronx in the most incredible, diverse community. My parish is the most diverse church I’ve ever served at and there’s something beautiful about different people coming together around a single purpose. For my folks, it’s for worship.”
He noted that the majority of the people in attendance at Sunday’s vigil were white, and stressed the importance of being aware of the challenges with which people of color and marginalized groups generally deal.
“I know that there is a vigil tomorrow down at Church of the Mediator at the bottom of the hill, at 231 and something,” Butler continued. “Same time tomorrow night. And there are people there who felt like there seems to be more minorities down the bottom of the hill than up here Sometimes even though we’re diverse, I feel like we live in a bubble.”

108,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/24/gun-sales-decline-trump-controls,"Barack Obama was called the ‘best gun salesman on the planet’. But with Trump in the White House, gun companies’ sales are down, and profits are falling Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST After years of buying up military-style rifles out of fear that the government would ban them, firearms industry insiders say, some Americans may finally think they have enough guns.  Since the election of Donald Trump, who called himself the “true friend” of gun rights activists, stock prices of gun manufacturers have fallen, and American retailers have reported slowing sales of guns and firearms accessories. The number of gun background checks processed each month, a rough proxy for gun sales, has dropped compared to last year, except for May, the month a suicide bomber attacked an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, leaving 22 people dead. Major terrorist incidents have been shown to drive increased sales in the past. “The fact that everyone perceived Obama to be anti-gun and wants to take your gun rights away made everybody buy, buy, buy until everybody had a surplus,” said Jeremiah Blasi, the marketing director for Mid America Armament, a small firearms and firearm accessories manufacturer based in Pryor, Oklahoma. “I think people have gotten … I think I’d use the word complacent,” Blasi said. Because Trump appears to be supportive of gun owners, “nobody’s as concerned that we’re going to lose gun rights in the immediate future”. It’s the great irony of America’s gun debate: anti-gun politicians boost profits for the firearms industry, and pro-gun politicians hurt them. The perverse dynamics of the gun market have long turned political attempts to change the role of guns in American life into massive marketing campaigns. Barack Obama, who led the most serious push for tougher gun control laws in more than a decade, was called “the best gun salesman on the planet”. In contrast, the current president’s influence on the gun industry has been labeled the “Trump slump”. Blasi said Mid America Armament’s sales were down about 25% compared with last year, and sales at gun shows had dropped even more steeply, about 50%. The company builds both AR-15-style rifles and firearms accessories. But it is currently focused more on selling accessories than the guns themselves. “The market really seems saturated. A lot of people are still doing upgrades and builds, but not a whole lot of rifle purchases,” he said. “Even on the accessories end, there’s been a slowdown.” Major manufacturers have also felt the hit. The stock prices for Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly Smith & Wesson, dropped sharply after election day, and after rebounding this spring fell again. Cabela’s, an outdoor goods retailer, reported a 9% drop in store sales in its second quarter this year and blamed the weakness in gun sales. “Since the fall election, we have continued to see a slowdown in firearms and shooting-related categories,” the company’s CEO, Tommy Millner, said in a statement in early August. The retailer acknowledged that the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year had also driven sales up. Year-on-year comparisons of gun sales, however, show that in spite of the marked fall, sales of guns in America are still at a relative high point. More than 14 million background checks had already been processed by the end of July, which is more than the year-end totals for any year between 1998 and 2009, the final years of Bill Clinton’s presidency and the two terms of George W Bush’s presidency. “Reports of the industry’s pending demise are greatly exaggerated,” Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, wrote in an email. “2017 is still a very strong year by historic standards and, in fact, we are on track to see the second or third highest year since the [background check] system began.” Fear of violent attacks and fear of government crackdowns on gun ownership have long been recognized as twin drivers of American gun sales. The number of firearm background checks processed each year, an imperfect but rough proxy for gun sales, jumped from about 13 million a year in 2008, the year Obama was elected, to 27.5 million a year in 2016, the last year of Obama’s presidency. After the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, prices for some military-style rifles more than doubled, with cheaper Chinese guns rising from $100 to $500 and higher-end rifles going from $700 to $1500, Blasi said. The Sandy Hook shooter had used a military-style Bushmaster rifle, and some gun owners assumed the federal government might renew a ban on military-style “assault weapons” that had lapsed eight years before. The 1994 assault weapon ban, which targeted many weapons comparatively rarely used in crimes, produced no evidence of life-saving impact, researchers concluded. Some experts have speculated that Democrats’ choice to target military-style guns actually fueled their popularity, and pushed them from the fringes of the firearms market to a central driving force in gun sales. The continued threat of an assault weapons ban has, perversely, continued to drive their popularity, even though researchers concluded that a tougher renewed ban’s effects on gun violence “are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.” There were at least 265m guns in American civilian hands in 2015, according to the most rigorous recent academic survey, although other estimates put the number even higher. Those millions of guns are highly concentrated, with just 3% of American adults owning half of the country’s guns, researchers found. These gun super-owners own an average of 17 guns each.",2017-08-24 06:00:17,The 'Trump slump': gun sales decline as fears of tighter controls fade,"politics and government,gun control,terrorism,firearms",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
109,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-trump-police-military-gear-20170827-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to restore the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies under a program that had been sharply curtailed by the Obama administration amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war-fighting gear to confront protesters. Documents obtained by The Associated Press indicate President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order undoing an Obama-era directive that restricted police agencies' access to the gear that includes grenade launchers, bullet-proof vests, riot shields, firearms and ammunition. Trump's order would fully restore the program under which ""assets that would otherwise be scrapped can be repurposed to help state, local, and tribal law enforcement better protect public safety and reduce crime,"" according to the documents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could outline the changes during a Monday speech to the national conference of the Fraternal Order of Police in Nashville, Tenn., a person familiar with the matter said. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of an official announcement. The changes would be another way in which Trump and Sessions are enacting a law-and-order agenda that views federal support of local police as a way to drive down violent crime. National police organizations have long been pushing Trump to hold his promise to once again make the equipment available to local and state police departments, many of which see it as needed to ensure officers aren't put in danger when responding to active shooter calls and terrorist attacks. An armored vehicle played a key role in the police response to the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Groups across the political spectrum have expressed concern about the militarization of police, arguing that the equipment encourages and escalates confrontations with officers. Obama issued an executive order in 2015 that severely limited the surplus program, partly triggered by public outrage over the use of military gear when during protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police responded in riot gear and deployed tear gas, dogs and armored vehicles. At times they also pointed assault rifles at protesters. Obama's order prohibited the federal government from providing grenade launchers, bayonets, tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, and firearms and ammunition of .50-caliber or greater to police. The agency overseeing the program then recalled more than 100 grenade launchers, more than 1,600 bayonets and 126 tracked vehicles — those that run on continuous, tank-like tracks instead of wheels — that were provided through the program. Trump vowed to rescind the executive order in a written response to a Fraternal Order of Police questionnaire that helped him win an endorsement from the organization of rank-and-file officers. The documents, first reported by USA Today, say Trump's order would emphasize public safety over the appearance of the heavy equipment. They describe much of the gear as ""defensive in nature"" intended to protect officers from danger. The Justice Department declined to comment on the expected move. Most police agencies rarely require military equipment for daily use but see a need to have it available, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ""It is hard to imagine any situation where a grenade launcher or bayonet would be something that a major police department would need, but defensive shields and armored vehicles kept on reserve will be welcome,"" he said. Sessions has said he believes improving morale for local law enforcement is key to curbing spikes in violence in some cities. The plan comes after Sessions has said he intends to pull back on court-enforceable improvement plans with troubled police departments, which he says can malign entire agencies and make officers less aggressive on the street.

The statues -- which depict confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston, former U.S. Sen. John Reagan and former Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg -- were taken down early Monday morning. The news comes in the wake of a deadly outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia -- which began in protest of the planned removal of a monument of Confederate General Robert E. Lee -- that left one dead and 19 injured after a car-ramming attack. Police arrested James Alex Fields, 20, and charged him with second-degree murder in the incident. “Last week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation,”  University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves said in a statement Sunday. “These events make it clear, now more than ever, that Confederate monuments have become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.” Fenves said he spoke with faculty, students and alumni, and reviewed a 2015 task force report before making the decision. The bronze monuments of Lee, Reagan and Johnston will be relocated to the school’s Briscoe Center for American History for scholarly study, Fenves said. The statues of Hogg, governor of Texas from 1891 to 1895, will be considered for re-installation at another campus site, he added. “The University of Texas at Austin has a duty to preserve and study history,” Fenves said Sunday. “But our duty also compels us to acknowledge that those parts of our history that run counter to the university’s core values, the values of our state and the enduring values of our nation do not belong on pedestals in the heart of the Forty Acres.” ""We do not choose our history, but we choose what we honor and celebrate on our campus,"" he added. The school removed statues of Jefferson Davis and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson from campus back in 2015 after a deadly mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Other Confederate monuments are being removed around the country under pressure from those who consider them symbols of racism and white supremacy. Four Confederate-era monuments were removed last week in Baltimore, Maryland, and the governors of Virginia and North Carolina requested the removal of Confederate monuments in their states. President Donald Trump, however, has pushed back against removing the Confederate symbols, calling it ""changing history."" “This week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” Trump said in a press conference last week. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-08-21 05:31:44,UT-Austin removes 4 Confederate statues overnight,"education and schools,politics and government,blacks,demonstrations and riots",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Scott Baio recently came under fire for suggesting that the death of Heather Heyer was a staged ""false flag"" operation and accusing Heyer's mother of being a ""crisis actor"" hired by the government. He posted a photo of Heyer's mother next to a photo of the mother of slain Sandy Hook teacher Vicki Soto. After an angry reaction, Baio deleted the post and apologized, but the social media sniping hasn't stopped. When Marquez-Greene upbraided Renee Baio for her husband's disregard for the feelings of Heyer's family and Sandy Hook survivors, Mrs. Baio got downright hateful.

Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C.

America’s latest conflict about race began with a mass shooting, a flag, and some statues. In Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist protesters descended onto the city earlier in August to protest the city’s plan to take down Confederate monuments, particularly the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The city responded to the protests on Wednesday by covering the monuments with a black tarp. In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray responded to the Charlottesville protests by speeding up his own city’s plans to tear down Confederate monuments. In Durham, North Carolina, protesters in August pulled down a statue dedicated to Confederate soldiers. Baltimore took down its Confederate monuments literally overnight as well. Why does America suddenly care so much about these old pieces of metal and stone? The current battle actually goes back to a mass shooting in 2015, when self-described white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people in a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof drew a lot of attention for posing with the Confederate flag in images that came out after the shooting — and that helped spur a fight within South Carolina about whether it should take down a Confederate flag that had flown at the state capitol for years. The state eventually agreed to officially take down the flag (after it was unofficially taken down by activist Bree Newsome). Since then, many cities and states, particularly in the South, have been questioning their own Confederate symbols. The argument is simple: The Confederacy fought to maintain slavery and white supremacy in the United States, and that isn’t something that the country should honor or commemorate in any way. Critics argue, however, that these monuments are really about Southern pride, not commemorating a pro-slavery rebellion movement. They argue that trying to take down the Confederate symbols works to erase part of American history. President Donald Trump invoked such an argument in response to Charlottesville: “This week, it is Robert E. Lee and, this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” He later reiterated these arguments on Twitter, calling it “foolish” to take down Confederate monuments. This is where the debate gets complicated, raising important questions about the US and its history: What exactly did the Confederacy stand for? And if it stood for slavery, does honoring it in effect commemorate white supremacy? The historical record is actually pretty clear: The Confederacy was always about white supremacy, and so are the monuments dedicated to it. Much of America is now coming to terms with that — but not without a passionate, sometimes violent reaction from those who argue the statues are necessary symbols of white heritage and culture. Since South Carolina took down its Confederate flag, several cities and states around the country have been considering similar moves — not just for flags, but also for the statues and other monuments all over the South honoring the Confederacy and its soldiers. There are a lot of these monuments out there: The Southern Poverty Law Center’s study found at least 1,500 “Confederate place names and other symbols in public spaces,” and it acknowledged that its count was “far from comprehensive.” Before Charlottesville, the most high-profile move came earlier this year, when New Orleans finished tearing down four Confederate monuments. One of the statues was erected in 1891 to celebrate a deadly insurgency in 1874 — led by the white supremacist Crescent City White League — against an integrated police force and state militia. The others honored Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, all of whom betrayed the US and fought against the union during the Civil War to preserve slavery. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu passionately defended the move in a speech. “They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for,” he said. “They may have been warriors, but in this cause they were not patriots.” This drew a huge backlash. Mississippi state Rep. Karl Oliver, a Republican, wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post that people tearing down Confederate monuments “should be LYNCHED” — invoking language that’s obviously attached to the oppression of black Americans: The destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, is both heinous and horrific. If the, and I use this term extremely loosely, ""leadership"" of Louisiana wishes to, in a Nazi-ish fashion, burn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED! Let it be known, I will do all in my power to prevent this from happening in our State. Oliver later apologized for the horrible choice of words, but he stood by his intent to preserve “all historical monuments.” Similarly, Charlottesville has been working to remove two Confederate statues — one dedicated to Robert E. Lee, and another dedicated to Stonewall Jackson. Already, the city renamed the parks where these statues were located — Jackson Park is now Justice Park and Lee Park is now Emancipation Park. And the city council voted to tear down the Robert E. Lee statue, although those plans are currently on hold as a court reviews whether the city can do so without the state’s permission. The plan to tear down the Robert E. Lee statue led to the white supremacist protests. Their protest mainly took place at Emancipation Park, where they rallied around the statue for much of their demonstrations. As they see it, attempts to take down the statue are erasing white history; one of their slogans — “you will not replace us” — is meant to suggest that lawmakers can’t do this and get away with it. Of course, many people disagree that this is about erasing white history. They argue that these monuments were built originally to honor the Confederacy and the racism and white supremacy that it stood for. One of the statues in New Orleans, for example, literally celebrated a white supremacist insurgency in the city against a racially integrated police force and state militia. In fact, most of these Confederate monuments were built during the Jim Crow era and in response to the civil rights movement — a sign that they were meant to explicitly represent white supremacy in the South: Given that America is now trying to make amends for the racist policies of its past, it seems natural that the monuments that celebrated this horrific past come down. It’s also not the case that this history is being erased, since the statues, flags, and other monuments aren’t necessarily being destroyed. They’re often, as was the case in South Carolina and potentially New Orleans, moved to museums or, as is the plan in Charlottesville, sold to someone else to take care of them. At the center of this debate is what the Civil War was really about. The people who defend these Confederate monuments frequently argue it was really about states’ rights, while those on the other side argue that the Civil War was about slavery. But the historical record makes it very clear that the Civil War was about slavery.  And to the extent it was about states’ rights at all, it was about a state’s right to maintain slavery. As Ta-Nehisi Coates noted in the Atlantic, South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, said in its official statement that it saw any attempts to abolish slavery and grant rights to black Americans as “hostile to the South” and “destructive of its beliefs and safety”: A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that ""Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,"" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety. In a letter encouraging Texas to secede and join the Confederate States, Louisiana Commissioner George Williamson was even more explicit. He argued that the Confederacy was needed “to preserve the blessings of African slavery” and that the Confederate states “are bound together by the same necessity and determination to preserve African slavery.” Many other states made similar arguments, consistently pointing to slavery and white supremacy, in their cases for secession. These statements leave no doubt that the South fought in the Civil War to protect the institutions of white supremacy and, in particular, slavery. In fact, Confederate symbolism, particularly the flag, only reemerged in US culture as a backlash to the rise of the civil rights movement. As historian John Coski wrote in The Confederate Battle Flag: America’s Most Embattled Emblem and Libby Nelson explained for Vox, use of the flag surged after Southern universities, stock car racers, and social groups embraced it in the 1950s as a symbol of white and Southern culture. It was no coincidence that this happened as the civil rights movement rose — and, in particular, after President Harry Truman vowed to do more to promote civil rights by, for example, integrating the military and telling the NAACP that civil rights could not wait. The Ku Klux Klan, for one, grew in response, and it embraced the Confederate flag as a potent symbol. Southerners were clear at the time about what they were doing and what the Confederate flag stood for: “It means the Southern cause,” Roy Harris, the legendary Georgia politician, said in 1951, according to Coski. “It is becoming … the symbol of the white race and the cause of the white people.” Since then, the Confederacy’s purpose has been obfuscated in attempts to whitewash an ugly period of US history, framing the Confederate flag and monuments more as symbols of white heritage and states’ rights rather than explicit symbols of racism. And the flag has in some ways become a dog whistle — another example of the sneaky language public officials use to wink to the public about racism while claiming its use as a point of heritage. But the fact that white supremacists, including literal neo-Nazis, are marching onto cities like Charlottesville to defend Confederate monuments shows that this isn’t just some innocent quest to preserve history; there’s a clear racist interest behind much of this too. Underlying the battle over Confederate statues is really a bigger debate about race in America. Over the past few years, we have seen a greater push for racial justice. That’s led to pushback from the other side — what some commentators have described as a “whitelash.” Black Lives Matter in particular gave a lot of attention to these issues. Although the movement gained national fame through its efforts to call attention to racial disparities in police use of force (particularly in the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown), it’s fostered a bigger conversation, especially among the left side of the political spectrum, about the many ways in which minority Americans are systemically disadvantaged. As America becomes more and more racially diverse, this discussion will likely become an even bigger issue. Meanwhile, the election of President Donald Trump arguably symbolizes the backlash to much of this conversation. Trump, who constantly deployed racist, anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail, gave a voice to white Americans who have long felt that the rise of civil rights and diversity has left them behind. Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist and author of Strangers in Their Own Land, provided an apt analogy for many white Americans’ feeling of neglect: As they see it, they are all in this line toward a hill with prosperity at the top. But over the past few years, globalization and income stagnation have caused the line to stop moving. And from their perspective, other groups — black and brown Americans, women — are now cutting in the line, because they’re getting new (and more equal) opportunities through new anti-discrimination laws and policies like affirmative action. Another way of understanding this is a sociological concept called “white fragility.” Robin DiAngelo, who studies race at Westfield State University, described the phenomenon in a 2011 paper: White people in North America live in a social environment that protects and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium. DiAngelo’s paper explained that white Americans have a range of “triggers” that can make them defensive about race, from suggestions that a person’s viewpoint is racialized to the rise of people of color into prominent leadership positions. All the triggers she listed were present in the past year — through the presidency of Barack Obama, Trump’s racist rhetoric, and Black Lives Matter protests against the dominance of white privilege. Consider how often throughout the 2016 election people would respond to even the slightest suggestion of racism, whether in media or everyday life, with immediate vitriol, disdain, or dismissal. This, DiAngelo argued, is a defense mechanism to confronting questions about privilege. And it makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation about race, effectively perpetuating a status quo favorable to white Americans by averting discussions about how to change the existing circumstances. DiAngelo offered a telling example, from an anti-racism training session she facilitated: One of the white participants left the session and went back to her desk, upset at receiving (what appeared to the training team as) sensitive and diplomatic feedback on how some of her statements had impacted several people of color in the room. At break, several other white participants approached us (the trainers) and reported that they had talked to the woman at her desk, and she was very upset that her statements had been challenged. They wanted to alert us to the fact that she literally “might be having a heart-attack.” Upon questioning from us, they clarified that they meant this literally. These co-workers were sincere in their fear that the young woman might actually physically die as a result of the feedback. Of course, when news of the woman’s potentially fatal condition reached the rest of the participant group, all attention was immediately focused back onto her and away from the impact she had had on the people of color. This illustrates just how defensive people can get in the face of accusations of racism: Not only did the woman who faced the criticisms genuinely feel like she was having a heart attack, but the white people around her believed it was totally possible she was. This is the reality of trying to have a conversation that challenges white privilege in America. You can apply this concept to what we saw in the Charlottesville protests. Many of the people involved have likely led advantaged lives — just because they’re white men in a society that has historically given them more rights than everyone else. But they’ve seen their racial security challenged. They saw the first black president with Barack Obama. They see demographic statistics that show white Americans will no longer be the majority in the coming decades. They see all of this talk about Black Lives Matter and the importance of diversity, including through policies like affirmative action. They see recent moves to tear down Confederate monuments in the South. And they themselves have likely been accused of racism at some point in their lives, making them defensive and angry. These are the forces behind the current discussion about Confederate monuments and race in America. Many white Americans feel like they’ve been neglected, and now their history is being erased as Confederate monuments come down and the country becomes more diverse. So some have taken up radical measures, causing violence and chaos in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest plans to tear down a statue. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

On Monday, protesters in Durham, North Carolina, pulled down a Confederate statue — without any official permission. In the following days, police arrested several people for the act on riot and property destruction charges. But on Thursday, a crowd of residents in Durham showed solidarity with the arrested: Dozens lined up to turn themselves in for the “crime” of tearing down a Confederate statue — in an attempt to get all the charges dropped for those arrested. Wow! Line of residents in Durham, NC attempting to turn themselves in for 'crime' of removing Confederate Monuments (photo Katina Parker) pic.twitter.com/DjdNS8S6rc According to the Herald Sun, three activists actually turned themselves in, while about 100 others went to the jail to show support. More of these activists planned to turn themselves in as a symbolic gesture, but they were stopped from entering the building. “It was a community all together who did that, who was responsible for that toppling of racism,” activist Lamont Lilly said in a speech to the crowd. “Very often, it does take one person to be the spark — to be the initiator like sister Bree Newsome. But it takes a movement, it takes a mass of people to support that — and keep those movements sustainable.” This is just the latest phase in America’s ongoing battle over Confederate symbols and monuments. The current debate goes back to a mass shooting in 2015, when self-described white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people in a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof drew a lot of attention for posing with the Confederate flag in images that came out after the shooting — and that helped spur a fight within South Carolina about whether it should take down a Confederate flag that had flown at the state capitol for years.

There were many horrible sights and sounds at the Charlottesville, Virginia, protests over the weekend, from Nazi and Ku Klux Klan iconography to chants of “Jews will not replace us” and the Nazi slogan “blood and soil.” But perhaps the most horrifying of all came after the protests were technically over, when a 20-year-old Nazi sympathizer sped his car into a crowd of counterprotesters. In just a few seconds, he killed a woman and injured at least 19 others. For many Americans, the realization came as a shock. This wasn’t supposed to happen in 2017. But it’s true: America has a white supremacist problem. It’s not just Charlottesville. In another horrific terrorist attack by another young white supremacist, Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people in a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Generally, more terrorist attacks in the US are perpetrated by right-wing extremists than by Islamists, according to data from Reveal (although, overall, there are still very few terrorist acts in the US). It raises the question: What is leading these people to such extremes? I turned to experts on radicalization and terrorism for answers. One thing that surprised me: They consistently said that the processes of radicalization are similar across ideologies, whether the person is a jihadist, a white supremacist, or some other belief system. “The processes are pretty much the same,” Mary Beth Altier, an expert on radicalization at New York University, told me. “There aren’t really distinctions between joining a group like the KKK and ISIS.” Now, there are differences between having radical beliefs, joining a radical group, and actually committing violence or terrorism. Someone may hold white supremacist beliefs but may not join the KKK or any other racist group. And someone may be part of a racist group but never engage in racist violence. In fact, one tough lesson is that there’s no one archetype for extremists. A 2014 study from researchers Paul Gill, John Horgan, and Paige Deckert looked at 119 lone-actor terrorists, and concluded that “[t]here was no uniform profile of lone-actor terrorists.” Basically every major demographic factor except gender (most were male), from age to educational level to marital status, greatly differed. Still, experts have identified some common contributors to radicalization. Knowing these is crucial to potentially preventing tragic attacks like those in Charlottesville and Charleston: By understanding what puts someone on the path to radicalization, that path can be cut short before it becomes a potentially violent threat. One thing experts emphasize: There is no single pathway to radicalization, and there are many contributors to radicalization. But generally, radicalization takes root when someone has some sort of problem — whether about his own life, society at large, or something else entirely — and a radical ideology or group provides an answer to that problem. He may seek out that radical ideology himself, or a group will come to him. J.M. Berger, an expert on terrorism and author of Jihad Joe: Americans Who Go to War in the Name of Islam, explained in a talk that sources of grievances can be broadly broken into two categories: personal issues and social issues. For personal, he cited economic insecurity, loss of a loved one, exposure to violence, relocation, religious conversion, and some kinds of mental illness. For social, he cited war and insurgency, rapidly changing demographics, swift changes in civil society or civil rights, watershed changes in communication technology, efforts to foment uncertainty by state actors, and economic upheaval. Many of these issues are present for some white Americans. Manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas. The opioid epidemic is killing family and friends, and addiction is on the rise. Meanwhile, demographic statistics show that white people will no longer be the majority in the US in a few decades. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and other social media tools are giving white Americans an outlet to voice these concerns. President Donald Trump is giving voice to many people’s uncertainty with his own racist rhetoric. Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist and author of Strangers in Their Own Land, provided an apt analogy for how many white Americans feel: As they see it, they’re all in a line toward a hill with prosperity at the top. But over the past few years, globalization and income stagnation have caused the line to stop moving. And from their perspective, other groups — black and brown Americans, women — are now cutting in the line, because they’re getting new (and more equal) opportunities through new anti-discrimination laws and policies like affirmative action. One of the things that makes this so complicated is many of these factors can be present in someone’s life and still not lead to radicalization. And if they do contribute to radicalization, it’s often not just one but multiple factors simultaneously that play a role, often with unique, individualized issues playing a part as well. So in the case of white Americans, many of them share the concerns noted by Hochschild. But only a very small number of white Americans will become radicalized and, in even rarer situations, commit a violent act as a result. As Mia Bloom, an expert on radicalization at Georgia State University, told me, “There is no simple explanation.” There are just some broad, common contributors. A common thread among people who are radicalized is a lack of purpose in life, which radical views — especially if a person acts on them — can help fill. “People tend to be seeking some meaning in their lives,” Bloom said. “They want to be part of something bigger than themselves.” Peter Bergen, an expert on radicalization at New America, put this bluntly: They’re people we would often consider losers. “If you look at the attackers in this country, that is not a bad description,” Bergen said. “They are often people whose lives aren’t going well.” He pointed to Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida: “He was going nowhere in life. He was working as a security guard at a golf retirement resort. He had dreams of being a cop; he tried to get in a police academy, and failed. By his first and second wives’ accounts, he had abused both of them. By suddenly quote-unquote becoming a soldier of ISIS, even though he had nothing to do with ISIS, he became the heroic figure that he believed himself to be.” This applies to white supremacist terrorists as well. James Fields, the man accused of killing a woman in Charlottesville with his car, reportedly had trouble making friends, left the military after only four months of service (“due to a failure to meet training standards”), and until a few months ago lived with his mom. It’s hard to say for sure, but those issues may have contributed to his radicalization. In other cases, it might not be personal grievances but rather political ones that lead to radicalization. For example, a white man may have concerns about immigration and, specifically, white Americans losing majority status in the coming decades. He also might feel like he can’t bring up these issues in public discourse without being quickly dismissed as racist. So as he sees these issues go unaddressed or become worse, he might dig deeper for any answer — and that might, over time, lead him to extremism. “Rather than personal meaning, someone might deeply feel the political grievances that are being articulated and are drawn into the movement through that articulation,” Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a counterterrorism scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told me. Groups take advantage of any of these types of issues to try to recruit people — often with downright devious tactics. Altier gave an example she saw in her research on white supremacists: “I interviewed one fellow. He said they would go into schools and they would put things — racist fliers — in black children’s lockers. The black kids would think it was certain white kids doing it. Although the white kids weren’t actually putting the fliers in, [the black kids] would beat them up. Then the white supremacists would come in and protect them.” Once they lock someone in, these groups can then foster radicalization. “You may start interacting with a group before you’re radicalized,” Altier explained. “And then because you’re hanging out with those people, you might become radicalized. … Once you’re actually in the group, you’re constantly subjected to the ideology. It’s reinforced by the people you’re around. And you may cut yourself off from other people, so it becomes this self-reinforcing mechanism.” This is why various extremist groups, from ISIS to white supremacists, look for people who are socially isolated and lack purpose in life. Once these groups reel people in by giving them some sense of purpose, they can then begin to radicalize them. It’s also one reason, Altier argued, that some people eventually get out of these groups after realizing they don’t really believe in what they’re doing, particularly in cases that involve a mental illness or some other issue that an extremist group took advantage of. Of course, there are plenty of true, hardcore believers in such causes as well, but that’s not always the case. This only covers some of the contributors to self-radicalization and how groups can take advantage of people to radicalize them. There is still a lot of debate about what leads to radicalization, which common factors are more important, and so on. But the examples above give something of a rough consensus between the experts I spoke to, showing the many kinds of issues that can lead someone to extremist views and acts. If radicalization is a result of messaging that extremists deploy to attract people with specific grievances, then one way to prevent radicalization may be to develop countermessaging that addresses those grievances in a way that avoids radicalization. In the context of white supremacists, part of addressing this may mean expanding the Overton window — meaning what’s acceptable to talk about in public discourse. “The more we put things off limits, the more we empower bad actors who will talk about things other people aren’t willing to,” Gartenstein-Ross said. For instance, right now it’s difficult for a white man to bring up concerns about changing racial demographics without getting labeled as racist. But maybe his concerns don’t have anything to do with race. He may be concerned that as the group he belongs to loses status, he will as well — economically, socially, and so on. A good response to this could point out that, for example, New York City is very diverse and still people, including white men, lead prosperous lives (and it has a below-average crime rate, contrary to what some dog whistles may suggest). But if that person never has that kind of discussion because he’s dismissed as a racist, his concerns about changing demographics won’t go away. So he might search for answers outside the mainstream, and that might lead him to an extremist group. That is especially true if he experiences what sociologists call “white fragility”: When white people are asked to answer for potential racism, some become defensive — pushing them into denial that they’ve done anything wrong and, in some cases, hardening their racist attitudes. (Much more on that in a previous piece I wrote about this research.) This doesn’t mean people can’t call out racism when it’s in front of them. But it does suggest that public and political discourse about race may need to better address the underlying concerns that lead people to racism while also making it clear that racism is unacceptable. It may not be a comfortable conversation, but it’s potentially necessary. Gartenstein-Ross pointed to President Donald Trump’s rise as a less extreme example of this. For much of the 2016 election, Trump was considered a long-shot candidate — someone who held far too many extreme, unconventional views to become president. But it may be those same extreme, unconventional views that made him successful; by reflecting the concerns some people have about immigrants and Muslims, he appealed in a way other candidates did not. And the underlying concerns behind those racist views weren’t addressed by Trump’s opponents; instead, they often just dismissed Trump as crude, racist, or insane. Another example of countermessaging several experts pointed to: Life After Hate. This organization, largely made up of former members of the far-right movement, directly intervenes with radicalized individuals to help them leave extremist organizations and lifestyles. The organization explains: “Through personal experience and highly unique skill sets, we have developed a sophisticated understanding about what draws individuals to extremist groups and, equally important, why they leave. Compassion is the opposite of judgment and we understand the roles compassion and empathy play in healing individuals and communities.” Countermessaging can also involve robbing extremist messages of a platform. For example, Twitter can ban people with explicitly racist views, or those who are trolling people of color and getting others to harass them. That makes it much harder, if not impossible, for someone to use that platform to get his message out. “To me, the issue is not radicalization; the issue is violence,” Bergen said. “There are a lot of people with radical ideas — very stupid ideas — all over the country. But very few of them are going to commit acts of violence.” To this end, there was one issue that several experts raised: People need to be vigilant in their communities and even families, watching for signs of radicalism and potential violence. And they’ll need to give that information to authorities when necessary. Consider this chilling statistic, from the 2014 study by Gill, Horgan, and Deckert: “In 64% of cases, family and friends were aware of the individual’s intent to engage in a terrorism-related activity because the offender verbally told them.” (Although right-wing offenders were, compared to others, “less likely to … make verbal statements to friends and family about their intent or beliefs.”) “These findings suggest that friends, family, and coworkers can play important roles in efforts that seek to prevent or disrupt lone-actor terrorist plots,” the researchers concluded. “In many cases, those aware of the individual’s intent to engage in violence did not report this information to the relevant authorities.” Or consider the warning signs to the attack in Charlottesville. Based on reports, we now know that Fields, the alleged perpetrator, had a history of violence — leading his own mother to call 911 twice. In one situation, he struck her in the head and put his hands over her mouth. In another, he brandished a 12-inch knife. He also showed a fondness for Adolf Hitler, and apparently was fairly vocal about his racist views. And he told his mom that he would go to a rally for the “alt-right” (an umbrella term for white nationalists) in Charlottesville. If authorities, family, and peers took the warning signs and threats more seriously in these kinds of cases, the attack could have — although it’s hard to say for certain — been prevented. Experts readily acknowledge this will be difficult. People don’t, after all, want to report their children, family, or friends to the police. But in some cases, it’s truly necessary. Part of this involves taking right-wing terrorism more seriously. “It’s a very serious threat, and one that’s often underplayed,” Altier said. “There’s an inherent bias in how we frame Islamist versus far right-wing, white supremacist terrorism.” She pointed to the Charlottesville car attack as an example: “The guy ran people over with a car. If a Muslim deliberately ran people over with a car, immediately it would be a terrorist attack.” By downplaying far-right violence in this way, society diminishes the sense of urgency that people might otherwise have when they hear of their relatives hinting at acting out violently. And that makes it harder to actually prevent these attacks. Some experts also suggested addressing root causes of radicalization and terrorism, particularly the socioeconomic, mental health, and other issues that turn into the kinds of grievances that can lead to such extremism. But that gets into fairly weedy discussion about how, exactly, you do that: Do you create a stronger social safety net? More jobs? A better mental health care system? What, exactly, is the best prioritization of resources here? Other experts are skeptical that solutions to root causes would have much effect. There are, after all, people with jobs and families who end up committing terrorist attacks — just look at the perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, who were married and had a child; the husband also held a job. And there are plenty of white supremacists who are not mentally ill, received a good education, and maintain solid jobs — many of them even showed up in Charlottesville. (As my colleague Dylan Matthews explained, there is no good evidence that more jobs can combat racism.) As with many policy issues, then, adequately confronting radicalization will require a variety of ideas and solutions. Even the best policy approaches won’t stop every attack. But they could, at the very least, help make events like Charlottesville less likely. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

Michael James Holt appeared Friday in an Australian court for a sentencing hearing after pleading guilty to a variety of firearms charges after police found his cache of homemade guns two years ago at his home, his grandfather's home and a hotel, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The 26-year-old later pleaded guilty to possessing and sharing child pornography after police found those images while investigating the shooting plot. Prosecutors said the New South Australia man admitted to planning a mass shooting at a mall and also wanted to shoot teachers and students at a nearby school. Holt admitted to an ""infatuation"" with neo-Nazi ideology and told a counselor that he believed Adolf Hitler was ""the greatest person to live,"" prosecutors told the sentencing judge. Prosecutors presented more than 40 pages of text messages from Holt revealing his plan to shoot tourists and police, the newspaper reported -- and he blamed his violent urges on his inability to find a willing sexual partner. ""Gonna have to just start killing people if I don't get laid soon,"" Holt said in one text message. Defense attorneys said Holt had been obsessed with guns since he was 5 years old, partially as a result of his autism. The judge compared Holt to a mass shooter in Port Arthur who killed 35 people in 1996, and said his obsessions and interests were ""deeply disturbing."" Holt will be formally sentenced Sept. 29.

The New York Daily News said Friday that the former ""Happy Days"" and ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" actor tweeted a conspiracy theorist meme alleging that Heyer's mother and the mother of slain first grade teacher Vicki Soto are the same ""crisis actor."" Baio tweeted the message to his 218,000 followers to forward the idea that the U.S. government is staging fake incidents as part of a disinformation campaign to smear conservatives and limit gun ownership. The notion of ""false flag"" attacks and ""crisis actors"" is a bedrock belief of the conspiracy community, promulgated by provocateurs like InfoWars' Alex Jones, ""Pizzagate"" blogger Mike Cernovich and fanatical Trump booster Jack Posobiec. Jillian Soto -- Vicki Soto's sister -- joined in the furious backlash against Baio's tweet. The actor deleted the tweet and apologized, but also blocked Jillian Soto and all of her family members on Twitter. ""I can't accept an apology from someone who spews hate. Whether he believes it or not, just sharing it has an impact,"" she said. ""His apology is not real. He personally chose to share this, then he chose to block my family when we tried to defend ourselves. That doesn't feel like a sincere apology."" Baio has since tweeted that he wished he'd ""thought longer"" before sending the offensive tweet, which Soto said is just another painful reminder of her sister's death and the relentless threats and abuse her family has endured from angry right-wing revisionists seeking to make hay of the 2015 tragedy. ""To be honest, it's heartbreaking,"" Jillian told the Daily News on Friday. ""My family has been attacked over and over. What people don't understand is that no matter what they believe, every time this comes up, it rips my family apart to see my mom being attacked yet again."" The cottage industry of right-wing paranoia and its distorted view of her sister's death, Soto said, is a ""never-ending low blow."" Normally, she said, she strives to stay out of the fray, but when she saw Baio's message accusing her mother of being a government-paid imposter, she hit the ceiling. ""I know it's all a load of crap, but to have people attack my mom, that's one of the hardest things for a child to see,"" she said. ""We're constantly being put on the defensive, having to defend Vicki, that she was a real person who was alive and we're not these crisis actors,"" she concluded.

As reported by the Charleston Post-Courier, gubernatorial candidate Catherine Templeton is already grabbing headlines, first for asserting that she is ""proud of the Confederacy,"" and again by saying she thinks transgender people should use the bathrooms associated with the gender they were assigned at birth. When asked about her position on “Southern heritage and Southern defense” by a man who identified himself as a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans group, Templeton said that no Confederate monuments would be removed on her watch. ""I don’t think there’s anything else to say about it,” Templeton said during the forum on August 1. “You cannot rewrite history. I don’t care whose feelings it hurts. You cannot rewrite history."" When asked if she would ""buckle down like North Carolina did"" or ""stand up for the Lord's word"" by a voter at the same forum, Templeton responded that she believes trans people should use bathrooms that correlate to their birth gender -- but didn't mention whether she would try to make that a law. As the Post-Courier noted, her comments about the Confederacy particularly offended African-American lawmakers in the state, who are still reeling from Dylann Roof's racist mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in the heart of Charleston in 2015. “I don’t think she understands the diversity we have in South Carolina and that we’re not all a bunch of flag-waving yahoos,” Joe Darby, a presiding elder for the AME church in the region, told the Post-Courier. “When you elevate the Confederacy, you stomp on the memories of those who were subjugated, the slaves. She’s stomping on my ancestors.
