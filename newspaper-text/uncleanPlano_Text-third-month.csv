Attackers are linked by frequent mental health problems – and access to guns Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST While nearly anything, including human hands, may be used to kill, the gun is created for the specific purpose of killing a living creature. Gun-love can be akin to non-chemical addictions like gambling or hoarding, either of which can have devastating effects, mainly economic, but murder, suicide, accidental death, and mass shootings result only from guns.  The definition of “mass shootings” varies, but is generally defined by four or more deaths in one location by a lone gunman or in a few cases, such as Columbine and San Bernardino, two. Although each of these mass killings is idiosyncratic, they often share many features, including but not limited to the most obvious, which bears repeating – their use of guns. There were 127 mass shootings with 874 victims in the United States between 1966 and 2016, an average of seven deaths in each. Nearly all of them were carried out by white men. Only three of the 130 shooters were women. If domestic shootings are included – meaning a man shooting his partner, often including their children and other relatives – the number of mass shootings rises dramatically. A New York Times report, titled How Often Do Mass Shootings Occur? On Average, Every Day, Records Show, uses the measure of four or more wounded, and includes domestic shootings. More than two-thirds took place in private residences and included “a current or former intimate partner or family member of the attacker”. Half of all victims were women. Investigative journalist Jane Mayer has further linked domestic violence and many non-domestic mass shootings. Shortly after the June 2017 shooting that wounded House majority whip Steve Scalise and four others, it was learned that the shooter, James Hodgkinson, had a history of domestic violence. The shooter in the 2015 Planned Parenthood Clinic attack had an arrest record of rape and sexual violence. Mayer writes: “Many domestic-violence suspects, like Hodgkinson, are arrested only to have the charges dropped later, which leaves them armed and dangerous. The National Rifle Association and its allies have successfully argued that a mere arrest on domestic-violence charges … is not sufficient reason to deprive a citizen of his right to bear arms.” Devin Patrick Kelley, the former US air force serviceman who killed at least 26 people and injured another 20 in a Texas church this past Sunday morning, had been court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. He was able to purchase his murder weapons even though, since 1996, federal law has banned people with domestic violence convictions from owning guns. Some mass shootings have taken aim at women simply because they are women. On 16 October 1991, a 35-year-old civilian named George Jo Hennard drove his pickup truck into the plate glass window of Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas – home to the enormous Fort Hood army base – while some 150 patrons were having dinner. Armed with a Glock 17 and a Ruger P89, he then jumped out of his vehicle and into the restaurant yelling: “All women of Killeen and Belton are vipers!” Then he began shooting, killing 23 people, 14 of them women whom he appeared to be targeting, yelling “bitch!” as he shot. The violence ended when he shot himself. Like Sunday’s massacre, the first notable mass shooting was carried out by a white man with a military background who lived in Texas, where there is an unbridled gun culture. Some experts have also argued that this attack, in 1966, may have been a model for Stephen Craig Paddock, the shooter who murdered 58 people in Las Vegas this October. The University of Texas (UT) mass shooting is often not counted among lists of such killings, because there were no more that fit the definition until 1982, when they began with some regularity. But, in retrospect, the 1966 attack was no anomaly – more like a comet that would return. Former marine sniper and UT engineering student Charles Whitman shot and killed 14 people and wounded another 32 while perched for 90 minutes on top of the 27-story clock tower on the University of Texas, Austin, campus, before he was killed by police. Early that morning, he had strangled his mother to death and murdered his wife by stabbing her in the heart as she slept. He later explained that he didn’t want them to be ashamed of him and suffer for his actions. Whitman had been in the Marine Corps, but did not serve in combat and completed his service before US troops were deployed to Vietnam. However, he had suffered a head injury from a Jeep accident during his service. Whitman kept a detailed journal in the months before the shootings, recording his severe headaches and feelings of rage and his failure to get help from multiple doctors he consulted and the ineffectiveness of the medications they prescribed. In the autopsy of his body, doctors discovered a pecan-sized tumor in his brain that could have caused his derangement. In the wake of the tragedy, rather than taking action to improve preventive healthcare at the university or the state, authorities created the first Swat team, soon to be replicated in nearly every police force in the country. In January 2016, a new Texas law went into effect allowing handgun permit holders, who had been required to conceal their weapons, to carry handguns openly except not on public or private university or college campuses. Then, on 1 August 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the University of Texas tower shooting massacre, the legislature included public university campuses in the right to openly carry handguns. “Especially among Texas politicians, there’s a locker-room lust for weaponry that belies noble-sounding proclamations about self-protection and Second Amendment rights,” the writer Lawrence Wright, himself a Texan, has written. “In 2010, Governor Perry boasted of killing with a single shot a coyote that was menacing his daughter’s Labrador. Perry was jogging at the time, but naturally he was packing heat: a .380 Ruger. The gun’s manufacturer promptly issued a Coyote Special edition of the gun, which comes in a box labelled ‘for sale to Texans only’.” James Oliver Huberty was born and lived most of his life in Ohio. A serial failure at starting a business, he moved to Tijuana, Mexico, then San Ysidro, California, in 1983. Back in Ohio, he had been a dedicated survivalist, accumulating an arsenal and also hoarding food and other survival necessities, all of which he took along in the move west. He believed government regulations had caused his business failures and that international bankers controlled the Federal Reserve, with communist dominance everywhere, economic collapse and nuclear war imminent. (These were the Reagan years.) Guns are a sign of potency for many white Americans who otherwise feel they have been wrongly disempowered or disenfranchised, whether by the government, by an employer or colleagues, or by members of other social, political or ethnic groups. The mass shooting that Huberty carried out in a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, in 1984, was the largest up to that time. It left 22 dead, including the shooter, and 19 wounded; one of the victims was pregnant, and another victim was an eight-month-old baby. San Ysidro is inside the United States, on the border across from Tijuana, Mexico, but 90% of its population is composed of people of Mexican descent; nearly all the shooting victims were. Huberty, a 41-year-old Anglo-American, was armed with a shotgun and an Uzi. After 78 minutes of his killing spree, with at least 245 rounds fired, a Swat team moved in and shot him. Nearly 30% of all mass shootings that have resulted in multiple deaths have occurred in workplaces, usually by an angry former employee. The first workplace shooting that resulted in a large death toll took place in Edmond, Oklahoma, a small college town north of Oklahoma City. In August 1986, a 44-year-old former marine and part-time US Postal Service worker, after receiving a negative work review, stormed into the town’s small, busy post office. Dressed as if for work in his mail carrier’s uniform and carrying three handguns in his mailbag, he killed 14 and wounded six before shooting himself. In the decade before, there had been five other post office shootings by former or current workers, with one or two fatalities. More followed almost annually, giving rise in the early 1990s to the grim term “going postal”. Dozens of other workplace shootings have taken place – in office buildings, strip malls, factories, night clubs, restaurants, military bases, and universities (employee-related, in addition to the separate category of “school shootings”, targeting students) during the time period of mass shootings, from the late 1980s on. Thirteen per cent of mass shootings have occurred in schools. Not the first but the most shocking one up to that time was the 1999 Columbine high school shootings by students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold that took 13 lives – 12 students and a teacher. The apparently normal upper-middle-class families of the two high school students seemed an unlikely setting to produce such violence under their noses, without their noticing anything awry about their sons. The shooting rampage inside the school took place over several hours, while most students escaped. Only after the sound of gunfire ceased did police storm the building, where they found the two killers had shot themselves. Certainly there had been many shootings in schools from the early 1800s to the 1966 Texas tower massacre, but none had been mass shootings with multiple victims. There were dozens of school shooting incidents between the 1966 UT tower shooting and 1989, but they began with troubling frequency and became more deadly in the 1990s, culminating in Columbine at the end of the millennium. After 2000, the number of school shootings increased from single digits to double digits by 2005, with three catastrophic ones, none of which fit the alleged “patterns” that had been theorized – mainly about possible reactions to bullying –bringing into question whether any of them did. None was more baffling and tragic than the December 2012 mass shooting at the elementary school in Newton, Connecticut, where 20-year old Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 first-graders along with six adult school personnel before ending his own life. Children and babies had been killed in past mass shootings, but not specifically targeted, as at Sandy Hook. Earlier, Lanza had shot and killed his mother while she slept in the home they shared. The mother, Nancy Lanza, was a gun hoarder and avid recreational shooter. Because her son had Asperger’s syndrome, he was mostly home-schooled and had little social life, and she found that he enjoyed going with her to the shooting range, which she apparently considered appropriate therapy. She obviously had no fear of possible violence from the son, as she kept her multiple high-powered firearms and ammunition in the house where they both lived. On 16 April 2007, a new record was set for mass shootings, with 32 dead and 23 wounded on the Virginia Tech University campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. The shooter was 23-year-old senior Seung-Hui Cho, using Glock 19 and Walther P22 pistols, and stocked with four hundred rounds of ammunition. The other national news coming from Virginia that spring was eclipsed by the shooting –the 18-month celebration of the founding of the first British colony of the 13 that followed over the next 125 years. The Virginia Tech shootings were described in 2007 as the worst “mass killing”, the “worst massacre”, in US history. Descendants of massacred indigenous ancestors took exception to that designation. Lakota Joan Redfern expressed the reaction of many, saying: “To say the Virginia shooting is the worst in all of US history is to pour salt on old wounds. It means erasing and forgetting all of our ancestors who were killed in the past.” The Virginia Tech shooter, born in South Korea and brought to the United States by his parents at eight, was himself a child of colonial war: the US war in Korea and the continued presence of tens of thousands of heavily armed US troops on the Korean peninsula. He had been diagnosed as depressed but was likely bipolar. He appeared to be overwhelmed by wealthy, white students, who made up 75% of the undergraduate student body. In the videotaped manifesto Cho made and sent to the press before his rampage, he called his fellow students “sadistic snobs” and further said: “You have never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life. Did you want to inject as much misery in our lives as you can just because you can? You had everything you wanted. Your Mercedes wasn’t enough, you brats. Your golden necklaces weren’t enough, you snobs. Your trust fund wasn’t enough. Your vodka and cognac weren’t enough. All your debaucheries weren’t enough. Those weren’t enough to fulfill your hedonistic needs. You had everything.” On Wednesday evening, 17 June 2015, perhaps the most historically symbolic, specifically targeted, and racially motivated mass shooting took place in Charleston, South Carolina. The site of the slaughter of nine people was a church. For evangelical Protestant congregations in the United States, Wednesday evening is prayer meeting and Bible reading in gatherings of the most dedicatedly faithful. But this was a very specific Protestant church, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church of Charleston – “Mother Emanuel” – the oldest historically black church in North America, and a historical site of slave resistance. Later explaining that he sought to ignite a race war by his vile deed, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who is white, arrived at the Wednesday prayer meeting and was welcomed by the 12 African American attendees, including the nationally and internationally known and respected AME senior pastor, who was also a South Carolina state senator, Clementa C Pinckney. After an hour of Bible study, Roof pulled out a Glock 41, and a .45 caliber pistol, both loaded with hollow-point bullets, reloading five times, killing all but three people present. He may have been expecting a larger attendance as he was carrying eight magazines filled with bullets. Roof fled the bloody scene and was later apprehended and arrested. The date he had chosen to hatch his plan was obviously premeditated – it was the 193rd anniversary of a slave revolt planned by the founder of Mother Emanuel. Images circulated on social media quickly made clear that Roof was a white nationalist. First there was his manifesto – loaded with slurs against African Americans, Jews, Latinos, and Asians – that claimed he had become “racially aware” following the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. He said that while searching the web to learn about the case, he concluded that the killer George Zimmerman was right; what convinced him was the information he came upon at white nationalist websites and chatrooms. Then there was Orlando. Outdoing all the mass shootings of this type that had preceded it, 49 were killed and 53 wounded. The shooter, Omar Mateen, a 29-year old US citizen of Afghani Pashtun descent, used a SIG MCX semi-automatic rifle and a 9mm Glock 17. Like Cho, he was at war with his peers. His victims were from the LGBTQ community, most of the fatalities that night being of Puerto Rican descent; it was Latino night at the Pulse gay nightclub on 12 June 2016. Mateen had frequented the club. This was the second mass shooting of civilians directly associated with ongoing US wars. Mateen, a Sunni Muslim, had sworn loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), the most recent terrorist jihadist group to rise out of US wars in the Middle East. Six months earlier, Syed Riz-wan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple who were legal immigrants from Pakistan, interrupted a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, where Farook was an employee. They pulled out automatic weapons, firing randomly, it appeared, killing 14 and injuring 22. Quickly, the FBI traced the terror attack back to before their immigration to the US and their allegiance to the Islamic State terror organization that the US is at war with in Iraq. On Sunday evening, 1 October 2017, records were broken again for the number of people killed during a mass shooting perpetrated by a single gunman. On that occasion, 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock shot to death 59 people, including himself, with nearly 500 hospitalized with injuries resulting from the incident. Paddock was born in Iowa and had lived in Florida, Texas and an upscale retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, near the Arizona and Utah borders. Four days before his massacre-suicide, Paddock checked into a 32nd-floor suite at the luxury Mandalay Bay casino-hotel in Las Vegas. Having been a high-rolling professional gambler at the hotel for some time, Paddock was familiar to the staff, who comped him the expensive suite as a perk for gambling on their premises. Under the lax scrutiny of “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas”, Paddock managed to stockpile his room with 22 high-powered scoped rifles ranging in size from .308 to .223 caliber, two tripods, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Just after 10pm that Sunday night, Paddock broke two windows in the suite and began firing semiautomatic weapons that had been fitted with a “bump stock” device that allowed him to increase the speed he could fire bullets into the crowd. His target was a packed, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd of 22,000 people enjoying the final set of a country music festival taking place in the open air across from his hotel. Paddock attacked the audience with 10 long minutes of non-stop shooting. Paddock owned multiple properties in Nevada, where police found more weapons, approximately 50 in all, half of which Paddock had purchased during the previous 12 months in Nevada, Utah, Arizona and California. Every weapon and device Paddock owned was legal and registered under his name, including the bump stock. For gun enthusiasts and those familiar with them, the number of weapons Paddock possessed was far from shocking. During the days following the mass murder in Las Vegas, the NRA and Republican leadership, as well as President Donald Trump, cautioned those who immediately demanded gun control legislation not to “politicize” the tragic event during a time of mourning. Yet on 5 October 2017, in an unprecedented move since its extreme mass shootings radicalization, the NRA announced its support for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to consider firearms regulation: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” Indeed, the history of public mass shootings by a lone gunman killing or wounding strangers parallels the rise of the gun rights movement and the United States’ ramped-up militarism, suggesting that it is not only the sheer number of guns in the hands of private citizens or the lack of regulation and licensing, but also a gun culture at work, along with a military culture, a more difficult matter to resolve than imposing regulations on firearms. Disturbing as mass shootings are, they currently account for only 2% of gun killings annually. The total gun deaths in the US average around 37,000 a year – roughly equal to death-by-vehicle incidents – with two-thirds of those deaths being suicides, leaving approximately 12,000 homicides, 1,000 of those at the hands of the police. In a satirical essay written following the Orlando nightclub killing, historian and theologian Garry Wills concluded that gun control in the United States is “inconceivable”: So this time let us skip all the sighing and promising and moments of silence. Why keep up the pretense that we are going to take any real and practical steps toward sanity? Everyone knows we are not going to do a single damn thing. We can’t. We are captives of The Gun. The Gun is patriotic. The Gun is America. The Gun is God. In response to mass shootings, no money can be found to finance mental health facilities, mental health problems being the one attribute that nearly all the mass shooters share.

1,http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2743515-las-vegas-marathon-2017-route-course-map-times-rock-n-roll-event-details," Las Vegas is a city that never sleeps. It's also a place that hosts one of the country's signature marathons, part of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series. This year marks 20 years of the Marathon Series, as runners from all over the country meet in Sin City for a race that shuts down the entire Las Vegas strip. Here's an excerpt from the marathon's official website describing the backdrop of the race: ""As the only private event to shut down the famed Las Vegas Strip, this is a unique opportunity for marathoners of all backgrounds. With the race starting just as the sun is setting, the city comes to life with lights shining like you’ve never seen before. Even when the course moves off of the Strip, music and lights will keep you moving one foot in front of the other, all the way back to the finish line.""  The 2017 Las Vegas Marathon takes place Sunday, November 12, from 4:30 to 10 p.m. For road closures during the race, check out the official list here. For the complete course map, you can view it here. As one of the country's more popular tourist destinations, the city will be filled to the brim with runners, supporters and gamblers all looking to soak in the atmosphere. On a more serious note, security has been kicked up a notch for this year's race, which is Las Vegas' first major outdoor event since October's mass shooting, according to The Wall Street Journal. Clark County Nevada's official Twitter account also provided some information for race participants to check out: The Las #Vegas @RunRocknRoll Marathon is Sunday! It's the first gathering of a large number of people since #1october. The Strip will close to vehicles &amp; other road closures will be in place.  Visit https://t.co/fvdVcRlEqY for more #Traffic information. https://t.co/2cPzwK5a07 Las Vegas police Capt. Andy Walsh promised the safest conditions possible for runners and the best security detail they've had in the race's history, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “We took a good punch in the stomach, obviously. But we’re going to get back on our feet and show the world that Las Vegas is a safe place for people to live, work and visit.” Race organizer Dan Cruz echoed those sentiments in the same story: ""No question this race in Las Vegas on the Strip in the aftermath of October's tragedy will have the most intense protocols and procedures that we’ve experienced with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series ... Runners should expect an increase in security, both visible uniformed law enforcement officers as well as private security officers, but also know that many other safety measures are taking place behind the scenes.""

A man puttered around his front yard, tidying up. A backhoe tore into a pile of rubble, shattering the morning quiet. Kevin and Janet Shaevitz watched it all. Their Anaheim Hills home burned down last month in the Canyon Fire 2, one of 15 homes in the area that were destroyed.  Janet Shaevitz looks over the remains of her Anaheim home as workers prepare to bulldoze the remains and haul it away. Shaevitz said she had about 45 minutes to grab her most cherished possessions which included family photos, a dog and three cats. “Everything else we can replace,” she said.(Photo by Mindy Schauer, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Kevin Shaevitz finds soot-covered Christmas cards in the rubble of his Anaheim home on Sunday, November 5, 2017.(Photo by Mindy Schauer, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Kevin Shaevitz walks through all that remains of his Anaheim home that was ravaged by the Canyon 2 fire last month. He keeps a positive attitude by remembering what he has instead of what he lost. “At least I didn’t lose anyone in Las Vegas,” he says about the mass shooting there.

(Photo by Leonard Ortiz, Orange County Register/SCNG)  And on a recent Saturday, as workers removed charred timbers and shattered tile from damaged lots, Janet Shaevitz perked up as she clambered over some debris to retrieve items she recognized — Christmas ornaments made by her kids. She held up a green paper stocking and saw her son’s face smiling from the top. Recovering from a devastating fire is a journey that’s just beginning for the Shaevitzes and several of their neighbors on Canyon Heights Drive. But not far away, in neighborhoods much like theirs, are dozens of homeowners who went on the same trip, after the 2008 Freeway Complex Fire. And some of them have returned with a road map. “You know what they’re facing. They’ve got two years of just absolute misery,” said David Ramocinski, a retired dentist who rebuilt his home in Yorba Linda’s Hidden Hills neighborhood after the 2008 blaze. But as much as he went through, Ramocinski said, he’s glad he came back. “It’s good to be home.” The Canyon Fire 2 took about 9,200 acres and destroyed 15 homes. The Freeway Complex Fire was bigger, burning more than 30,000 acres and destroying 187 homes, mostly in Anaheim Hills, Brea and Yorba Linda, which took the heaviest hit. Brian Stanley, 54, who lost his home in Anaheim Hills in ’08, said his son — then 4 years old — was “completely shell-shocked” after the fire and that the trauma lasted for years. “Every time he hears fire trucks or a helicopter, even today, he’s still a little gun-shy,” Stanley said. Because of the fire, Stanley said, he lost his passport and had credit cards set up in his name by identity thieves. He’s had to change his email address nearly a dozen times in eight years. Since the fire, he said, some couples in the neighborhood have separated or divorced. And, he added, he’s become “paranoid” about his rebuilt house. It’s designed with extra indoor sprinklers, spark-stopping attic vents and hose hook-ups all around the outside. “I probably have 14 or 15 smoke detectors.” But those feelings aren’t visible. What can be seen, in Hidden Hills, looks pretty secure. Today, trees have grown back to the edges of the road that carves the canyon. There’s no sign that five dozen homes in the neighborhood had some degree of fire damage, though a few empty spots show where houses were never rebuilt. Rebuilding their home, near the top of the canyon, took Ramocinski and his wife, Cheri, two years and eight months. It cost them half a million dollars from their retirement savings and the energy of routine bureaucratic, legal and emotional struggles. They had to deal with the city, an insurance company and the courts, where a lawsuit filed by fire victims against the Yorba Linda Water District resulted in a $70 million settlement. The process, David Ramocinski recalls, involved regular conflict. “First, it was every day, then it was once a week; you’d have a little battle of some sort.” It took time for the couple to process the loss of heirlooms they’d spent a lifetime collecting. A battered photo album chronicles that part of their pre-fire life, filled with pictures that Cheri Ramocinski snapped just before they evacuated, to show the insurance company later. “I miss that piece a lot,” she said, pointing to a photo of an antique Belgian china cabinet. In 2008, she hoped that they might return to their burned-out home and uncover some of the family silver or her jewelry. Instead, their home’s ruins were looted at least twice. Someone even stole all the burnt copper wiring. Within a year or two of the Freeway Complex Fire, recovery was well underway for many families. Jim and Sylvia Joubert were on a cruise when their Hidden Hills home of 16 years burned to the ground. They lost everything but the clothes in their suitcases and a few family photos that their daughters grabbed as they evacuated. The Jouberts treated the disaster as an opportunity. They invited friends over to watch the final demolition of their old home. They browsed eBay to replace the Waterford crystal Christmas ornaments that Sylvia Joubert had collected since the 1970s. The crisis ultimately brought the family closer, Jim Joubert said, because everyone pulled together. While some neighbors sold their charred lots and moved away, those who stuck it out supported each other. Rosemary and Anthony Philippello, retirees who live across the street from the Jouberts, said their doctor drove to their house after the fire to make sure they were safe. Since the recent fire, a similar spirit of community is emerging. An Anaheim Hills couple who lost their home has used their real estate office as a collection center for donations to help victims of the much larger wildfires in Northern California. Kevin Shaevitz, a 53-year-old chiropractor and father of four, stood amid the rubble of his home and said he’s received encouragement from neighbors. As he spoke, he stood near charred hulks of his washer and dryer and a backyard hot tub, murky with algae. He knows there’s a long road ahead. “You can’t hurry up and do this,” he said. “There is a grief process. And there’s several stages to that. And most of my family’s in denial.” Those who rebuilt after the 2008 fire are more prepared today. Saad Rajab, a 43-year-old physician who bought a partially rebuilt Hidden Hills home from an investor, completed the structure with stucco and avoided any exposed wood. Most of the front yard is concrete pavers, and he pays a fee to have brush cleared regularly from the slope behind his house. Brian Stanley scans all his important documents and stores them in the cloud. He keeps a “go box” with several days’ worth of clothes and other necessities for his family, and, in case of a fire, they always have an escape plan and a meeting place if they’re separated. The Ramocinskis have become advocates for other victims. After a 2015 fire that burned 11 square miles and destroyed 40 homes in the eastern Sierra Nevada, the couple reached out to homeowners, advising them about insurance and referring them to an attorney with whom they’d worked. David Ramocinski called it “the information I wish I never had to share.” But his wife said, “When you help, you heal.” Brian Stanley also tries to use what he’s learned. He took a disaster-preparedness course, runs a neighborhood watch and has hosted community meetings on how to be ready for a wildfire. Recent fire victims “need to take a deep breath, take a few days, and get away from the area,” he said. “If you have to look at it every day, it’s depressing.” Jim Joubert said it gets easier, and it helps to talk with others who have experienced the same thing. “You grieve the things (you lost) early on, but as time goes by you don’t think about them that much.” A constant that remains is the risk of another fire. Some residents said they’re apprehensive when the Santa Ana winds blow or they see a wisp of smoke in the hills. But they’ve accepted fire is part of the landscape. “I think I consider this part of living in California,” said Rajab, who finished the half-rebuilt home. “There is no protection from fire anywhere.” For some fire victims, the lesson learned was about letting go. Stanley said since the fire he quit wearing suits, buying designer clothes and driving a BMW. Now he wears shorts and T-shirts. “You realize everything you have means nothing,” he said. A few days after the most recent fire, Kevin Shaevitz said the family’s belongings were all replaceable. Still, when he found his wife’s Precious Moments Nativity scene intact, he was happy. “Maybe it’s symbolic,” he said. “I’m choosing to see it like that and take that as a sign that good things are going to come even though there’s tough times now.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

According to Reuters, the pastor, Frank Pomeroy, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed in the massacre at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, met with Southern Baptist Convention leaders and “expressed his desire to raze the building,” convention spokesperson Roger Oldham told the news wire. The building, which can hold approximately 75 people, is riddled with bullets. Pomeroy said that using it again could be just too painful, and Oldham said the pastor is considering planting a memorial garden on the site. The church, however, will continue on, and is already planning a worship service on Sunday behind a community center not far from the church building. The service will “show the world that we may be knocked down temporarily but WE ARE NOT DEFEATED,” Pomeroy’s wife, Sherri, wrote on Facebook on Thursday. “Please come help us honor their lives doing what they died for: worshipping our sovereign God!” Read more at Reuters. That poor man—he’s right though. God is everywhere so he can surely serve the masses from a diff location.

9,http://www.startribune.com/opinion/letters/456735293.html,"Like some of the candidates who just ran for office in the Minneapolis city election (“Three cheers for multiple choices,” Nov. 10), I support ranked-choice voting when it is applied to single-seat positions. However, RCV is more problematic where multiple seats are being filled — such as for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board’s at-large seats and the Board of Estimate and Taxation seats. Such voting could be more acceptable and understandable if the three seats were designated — No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. Candidates would thus know whom they were running against, and voters would have the option of designating a first choice, second choice and third choice for each seat. If there is to be confidence in the election system, voters need to understand how winners are determined, and in the case of multiple-seat winners, it is nearly impossible to do so without extensive explanation. I urge the Minneapolis Charter Commission to initiate consideration of how this might be done. Margit Berg, Minneapolis ELECTION TURNOUT Our ‘duty’ to vote? Only if we are also dutifully informed A Nov. 10 letter writer stated: “It is your duty as a citizen to vote.” That is ludicrous! Radio and TV reporters will interview people on the street. Many people don’t have a clue what is going on — locally or nationally. A citizen should vote only if they have a reasonable understanding of the issues and candidates. Dick Hansen, Edina ELECTION INFLUENCE Social media saturates the local campaign landscape, too No question — we know the Russians tried to influence the 2016 presidential election. We mustn’t be naive — the Minneapolis election also was heavily influenced by social media. We are in a new era of campaigning that extends far beyond door-knocking and yard signs. If you are on social media, you have been constantly peppered with campaign ads for candidates during the past few weeks. Candidates buy “audience target” ads that radiate everywhere, even beyond their knowledge or control. Several candidates placed inadvertent ads in Breitbart — an association not viewed favorably in Minneapolis. A one-issue socialist candidate won the first-choice balloting in the Third Ward City Council race — supported by constant postings targeting Third Ward residents. Fortunately, ranked-choice voting eventually determined the outcome. A weekend opinion piece posted by a respected ex-mayor circulated widely and rapidly. It probably doomed a Park Board candidate. Social media serves a primary role as it transforms campaigning. Like it or not. Alexander Adams, Minneapolis GUNS A persuasive moment, as with sexual misconduct? Well … Judging from the number of incidents recently reported and the comments regarding them, the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment revelations were truly a “watershed moment.” Now the question becomes, why haven’t we had a similar watershed moment concerning gun violence? John Fredell, Minneapolis • • • Great idea! Sue the manufacturers and dealers of the firearms used in these mass shootings! (“After another mass shooting, it’s time for class action,” Readers Write, Nov. 9.) Only one problem. Congress was a step ahead of us. Not long after the federal assault-weapons ban expired in September 2004, Congress, lobbied by the NRA and realizing the likelihood that mass shootings would occur and wrongful death suits would follow, passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which stripped victims of their right to sue these manufacturers and dealers. So, in a wicked irony, the victims of these mass shootings cannot sue the suppliers of these deadly weapons, but the perpetrators, in the event their weapon misfires or jams, can. Elizabeth T. Cantrell, Burnsville • • • The Nov. 9 letter writer forgot to mention another billion-dollar industry in her call for class action. A quick Google search showed that in 2016, there were more than 40,000 deaths caused by automobiles. It is time to take the auto industry to court and sue the industry for every penny it has. These multibillion-dollar companies advertise there death machines on national TV. How many families have suffered due to someone being killed by or in an automobile? Let’s not forget the motorcycle, ATV and snowmobile folks. Let’s get the elderly and medicated people to court, also. Line up, lawyers; you will make millions. The writer is an obvious gun hater, probably never used one. I am 65 and got, and still have, my first gun at 12. As I write this, my guns are downstairs as usual doing nothing. You will never stop a person who is bent on killing. They will find a way. Do not paint all us gun owners with the some brush. Barry Peterson, Prior Lake • • • Why is it that when an AR-15-style rifle is used for good, as in the case of Stephen Willeford stopping the Texas gunman who killed 26, the weapon is simply referred to as “his rifle” (“Area resident hailed as hero for engaging Texas gunman,” Associated Press article on StarTribune.com, Nov. 7). But when the weapon is used for evil (“Act now, America, while the pain is fresh,” editorial, Oct. 3), it is referred to as being among “AR-15-style assault weapons.” Why is the Star Tribune creating a public perception that “AR-15-style assault weapon” equals bad and “rifle” equals good when at the end of the day they are the same firearm? Is it to avoid the fact that the firearm didn’t make the action good or evil? The person using it did. Marc Ohmann, Bloomington TAX REFORM Don’t be obtuse; state and local deductions should remain I found D.J. Tice’s Nov. 5 column expressing ironic surprise at Gov. Mark Dayton’s dismay with possible loss of state and local tax (SALT) deductions purposely shortsighted. Although the direct benefits go to the higher earners, they are the people all of us depend upon to finance our state’s superior services and quality of life. The loss of SALT deductions would give more ammunition to lower the state taxes toward, say, Wisconsin or the Dakotas. Nobody likes to pay taxes, it always hurts to some degree, but how else do we pay for law enforcement, education, protection and enhancement of the environment, medical/social services, and roads and infrastructure? These are the measures that lead to high quality-of-life ratings, and why people put up with our taxes. We already send more money to Washington than we get back; this will make things worse. I think the Republicans are delighting in the fact that they would be sending blue-state money to red states. If we value our quality of life here, we should let our Republican representatives know that the loss of SALT deductions would be a grave error. David Brockway, Edina • • • Recently President Trump tweeted: “How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would’ve done the same.” I urge people to keep this tweet in the forefront of their minds when considering the proposed tax plans. Scott Christenson, Minneapolis © 2021 StarTribune.

10,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/10/commentary-country-music-is-becoming-the-soundtrack-of-a-nonexistent-apolitical-no-place/,"Trending: By hris Richards, The Washington Post Country singers like to talk about how they provide fans with a form of escape, but that just can’t be right. How are songs about everyday life supposed to help us escape from our everyday lives? Country music isn’t a way out of reality. It’s a way to get deeper inside of it. But then I heard Brad Paisley — mainstream country’s most progressive utopian — sing an ode to small towns called “Heaven South” during Wednesday’s Country Music Association Awards in Nashville and everything felt upside down. “Turn on the news, you’d think the world ain’t got a prayer,” the song went. “But if you turn it off and look around, it’s just another day in Heaven South.” So all our planet’s problems will go away if we stop paying attention to them? I guess that’s one way to escape reality, but it was still disheartening to see Paisley, the CMA telecast’s co-host for the 10th consecutive year, acquiescing to Nashville’s disengagement reflex and encouraging listeners to “turn it off.” Especially at this year’s CMAs, where not one artist found the courage to say a single word about gun control after 58 fans were shot dead at a country music festival in Las Vegas last month. And sure, nobody expected the CMAs to transform itself into a three-hour town hall discussion about the Second Amendment. But did anyone expect such monolithic quiet after such a catastrophic event? Apparently, the ghost of the Dixie Chicks’ career still haunts this town in terrifying ways. (In case you forgot, the colossally popular country trio spoke out against President George W. Bush at a concert in 2003 and were instantly boycotted by radio stations across the country, sending the entirety of mainstream country into a state of political paralysis that has lasted 14 years and counting.) Now, a style of music that used to proudly address the real-life struggles of real-life Americans won’t go near the issue that everyone in our harried republic is currently struggling with. After last month’s massacre in Las Vegas, another 28 people were killed in a mass shooting inside a church in Texas — the setting of countless country songs. Yet, instead of singing about life in America, today’s country stars are singing about an apolitical no-place that doesn’t actually exist. I guess it’s called Heaven South, and apparently, you protect it by circling the wagons. That was the plan at Wednesday’s CMAs. “Tonight, we’re gonna do what families do,” co-host Carrie Underwood promised at the top of the telecast. “There’s a family in this room,” Miranda Lambert said after winning female vocalist of the year. “We’re a family,” Garth Brooks said after taking the night’s biggest prize, entertainer of the year. And so the brightest names in country music stood together in the name of standing together — which is basically what happens at this tight-knit industry function every November. It was still the same annual group-hug, this time just a little tighter. Despite the circumstances, the telecast’s organizers were hoping for a business-as-usual kind of night anyway. Last week, after CMA officials announced that they reserved the right to eject any journalist who asked an artist about their politics, Paisley immediately spoke out against that pre-emptive censorship, tweeting, “I’m sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines.” And voila, they were promptly rescinded. But that didn’t embolden any of the artists to volunteer their thoughts on the state of the nation on Wednesday night, not even Paisley. “I love the way we’ve all come together,” he said during one interstitial segment, as if he might be warming up some spontaneous bombshells. Then he confessed that he’d “gone off script,” and returned to the business of introducing the next performer. As for the night’s performances, many of them felt intentionally ordinary, save for Keith Urban singing “Female,” a new solidarity anthem intended as a response to the sexual assault and harassment scandals currently detonating across Hollywood. He wasn’t taking a risky position here, and the song’s lyrics aren’t the greatest, but the sentiment was welcome. Then again, we were watching a man sing about feminism at an awards show where the top prize had no women nominees. But Urban had the right idea. Awards shows give you an opportunity to say something significant in an acceptance speech, but a great song tends to send a message much farther, and some artists have already gotten to work on that front. In the days following last month’s shooting in Las Vegas, Maren Morris released “Dear Hate,” a ballad about the eternal fight between love and evil. Eric Church penned a song about survivor’s guilt called “Why Not Me.” And while both Morris and Church performed at Wednesday’s CMAs, they didn’t sing either of these new tunes. Why not? It left Underwood to give the evening’s most somber performance, singing the hymn “Softly and Tenderly” during an in memoriam segment that honored the concert attendees slain in Las Vegas. In the song’s final phrases, she sounded as if her voice had suddenly vanished from her throat — there were a few short pauses where the words couldn’t get out. And when it was finally over, you may have wondered about all of the words that everyone else in the building had purposefully chosen to swallow throughout the night. Surely, today’s country stars have more to say about this nation, its leaders and its laws, and the fate of the people they’re singing to. But if those words aren’t coming out now, when will they ever?

11,https://www.nationalreview.com/article/453655/roy-moore-sutherland-springs-shooting-two-calls-conversion,"Follow Us National Review How the West Lost God Ethel Rosenberg: Tragedy or Traitor? Friends in High Places Why Is Naming Sports Teams after Europeans Any Better? Why Meritocracy Makes Us Miserable Two things in the headlines this week should be like sirens calling us to conversion. The first was the largest mass shooting in a church in U.S. history. The evil that was done to the people of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs made hearts ache with compassion for those who died as they were worshipping God and for those who mourn them. And yet it somehow seemed to take no time before social media users were atwitter, pouncing on “thoughts and prayers.” The standard “What would Jesus do?” convention took on the form of an attack on prayer, with many insisting prayer was not an action but an excuse not to get behind gun-control legislation as the remedy for evil. And yet, both that question and the frenzied response of repulsion to the idea of “thoughts and prayers” ought to challenge us to ponder what the Gospel does require of us. Father Donald Haggerty, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York, who is currently stationed at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, has some insights on that topic. In his new book, Conversion: Spiritual Insights into an Essential Encounter with God, he writes: There is a link between the crisis of unbelief in Western culture and the loss of religious intensity among those who claim the importance of faith. Belief is never simply an interior conviction about religious matters. It entails a personal cleaving to Jesus Christ as God and man that cannot be unaffected by his manner of life. But do we forget to keep our eyes fastened on the poor and crucified man of Nazareth whom we proclaim as divine and the object of our love? Belief in Jesus of Nazareth as God in the flesh has to face with some pain and distress the poor life he preferred for himself and the love for poor people that he chose. Otherwise, our faith in the Incarnation risks becoming an abstraction only useful for maintaining a correct belief. It misses an essential truth of this actual thirty-three years that calls for some effort of resemblance on our part. Which brings us to the accusations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. (There have been several vile defenses of him, in particular, one that shamelessly made use of the holy family.) Again, I quote from Father Haggerty: A conversion is not just a change of life-style. The new recognition of God infuses strong desires in our soul that God should be known by others as we now know him. A kind of missionary zeal for souls can take hold of our heart and enter into our impulses with other people. We would like to see conversions spread contagiously among our contacts with people. More immediately we would be happy at times to bowl over an unbelieving soul with the overwhelming truth of God. This enthusiasm for winning souls may be naïve in its optimism regarding the appeal of God to people who do not know him. But, in another sense, it is a sign of our love for God. And a zeal for souls as we continue life is essential to a love for souls. We taste a graced impulse in wanting to bring others to the truth of God and to Catholic faith. We have to be led by God in this love for souls, learning wisdom of heart and suffering for souls, if we truly want their conversion to the faith. Even God in his omnipotence cannot convert a soul that does not want to know him. People need to know converted souls. While conversion happens daily, if people are meeting Christians who are not surrendering themselves to the hard work of conversion, of course they are not going to believe that thoughts and prayers are worth anything. And if they see people using and abusing religion for ideology or other worldly power, of course they won’t have any interest in conversion either. I can’t help but keep thinking of (there I go with thoughts again!) and be drawn into prayer (!) for Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church and his wife, who lost their daughter in the shooting Sunday. He has a peace about him even in his devastating grief. I can’t help but think it comes from something Father Haggerty describes: Surrender to God from a deeper layer of soul always conceals a promise that must also be heard, even without words. God is not casual and nonchalant when great offerings are made. He does not receive them so frequently that he can be dispassionate toward a soul that casts itself in abandonment into his hands. His fingers are strong in holding on tightly to such souls. If these souls are asked to bear their share of suffering in future days after their suffering in future days after their offering, even so, the firm hand of God never releases them but, rather, clasps them to his heart. And that embrace compensates for every risk that might earlier have intimidated a soul. There is a fearlessness and freedom that comes with real faith, the kind where the soul begs for further conversion. For every misuse and abuse and manipulation of, or even mere miscommunication about, religion, there are those who truly try to live configured to Christ, a true transformation. In the introduction to his book, Father Haggerty quotes Saint Edith Stein, the famous convert to Catholicism from Judaism who died in the Holocaust. She writes: Immediately before and for a good while after my conversion, I was of the opinion that to lead a religious life meant one had to give up all that was secular and to live totally immersed in thoughts of the Divine. But gradually I realized that something else is asked of us in this world and that, even in the contemplative life, one may not sever the connection with the world. I even believe that the deeper one is drawn into God, the more one must “go out of oneself,” that is, one must go to the world in order to carry the divine life into it. Not only do we need room for people of faith to be people of integrity, living their faith in the world — i.e., religious freedom — but we need people who are overwhelming our lives and culture and yes even politics with real religion, not the fake kind that remakes God into our own image instead of offers our lives for Him to remake them. The people of Sutherland Springs not only need and deserve our prayers, their very witness to faith is a prayer for us to go deeper, for real, for the sake of our souls and the souls of all we hold dear — which includes our country and its politics and its culture. Our thoughts and prayers ought to be for conversion to the kind of faith that radiates confidence in true hope in God, clinging to Him, not to ideological and other selfish self-reliant manipulations.

12,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/11/tracking-trump-mood-swings-in-asia-and-election-struggles-at-home,"The US president’s comments wavered from aggressive to conciliatory as he visited Japan, South Korea and China – and finally made a stop in Vietnam Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.04 GMT Donald Trump spent the week bouncing around Asia, his mood swinging wildly from deferential and complimentary to, well, fiery and furious. After dropping in on Hawaii – “See you in Pearl Harbor!” he had told the press cheerfully on Friday – he quickly picked up the theme of the North Korean nuclear menace, telling dictators at a US base near Tokyo not to “underestimate American resolve” but also suggesting he would be happy to sit down with Kim Jong-un at some point. Trump made sure he got in a round of golf with one of his best friends on the world stage, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, along with the five-time PGA Tour winner Hideki Matsuyama, who elicited a rare show of self-awareness and perhaps even modesty from Trump: “If I come back and say I was longer than him, don’t believe it.”  If that defied one stereotype, Trump seemed happy enough to indulge in another when he reportedly asked why Japan, “a country of samurai warriors”, had not shot down the missiles North Korea has fired over its territory. Ever the businessman, he pressed Abe to buy more military equipment from the US to counter this threat from Pyongyang. Back home, another mass shooting had taken place on Sunday, in Texas, and by Monday many were quick to point out the contrast between the thoughts and prayers to which Trump confined himself in response, and his rush to implement harsh new policies when a killer was Muslim, as appeared to be the case last week in New York. Arriving in South Korea, Trump went further in rejecting calls for stricter gun laws in the wake of the killings in Texas, suggesting gun control might in fact have made the incident worse. But he struck a more conciliatory tone in international relations, suggesting in Seoul that “we’re making progress” in resolving the issue of Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. And he found time to plug the Trump golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he escaped for more than a few weekends this summer. By Wednesday, Trump had changed his tune again on North Korea. Speaking in front of lawmakers at South Korea’s national assembly, he told Kim: “Do not underestimate us.” But it was the US president who seemed to have underestimated the difficulty of organising a trip to the DMZ, between North and South Korea. Despite the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, getting dressed up in some army clothes for the occasion, heavy fog meant that the American helicopters could not land. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, had prudently flown in earlier, but he waited for his guests at the front line in vain. A political fog had rolled in back on the home front, too, with Republicans losing a string of races for governor, state legislature, and mayor across the country, one year  after Trump’s 2016 presidential victory. The president made it quite clear that he personally could not be expected to shoulder any blame, attacking the failed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he “did not embrace me or what I stand for”. While Trump strode the world stage in China, his erstwhile opponent Hillary Clinton took her book tour to Wisconsin, a state she infamously failed to visit during the 2016 campaign, and lost. She hailed Tuesday’s election victories, saying: “The fever has broken,” while on the other side of the globe, Trump continued his charm offensive towards Xi Jinping, blaming his US predecessors for the “huge” trade deficit between the world’s two largest economies. “Your ancient values bring past and future together into the present,” Trump noted. “So beautiful.” It was all a far cry from his rants about “China!” on the campaign trail, and the Chinese press duly gave the US president what he would probably refer to as “great reviews”. By contrast, the US media were less than impressed when the White House bowed to a Chinese insistence on gagging reporters during a supposed press conference, in defiance of much past US precedent. Trump infamously dodged the Vietnam war draft due to a letter from his doctor – ”a very strong letter on the heels” – and once mused to the shock jock Howard Stern that trying to avoid sexual transmitted diseases amounted to his own personal Vietnam. But on Friday, he finally made it to the real Vietnam, for an Apec leaders’ summit. Hot on his heels (thank you) was an old friend – Vladimir Putin, who received a friendly handshake from Trump and signalled his alignment with the American president by copying the multi-shirt style made famous by Trump’s ally Steve Bannon. But Trump had harsh words for the rest of the group, with an attack on their trade policies, and he even delivered some coded criticism of Beijing’s regional ambitions: Asian nations were “each a bright star, satellites to none”, he said. Trump presses on to another of those bright stars this weekend, where he will meet probably the only world leader more aggressive and offensive than himself: Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who claimed on Friday that he had once stabbed someone to death, decisively outdoing Trump’s infamous boast that “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters”.

15,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/LmtqBXOk5xE/,"An ex-wife of Devin Kelley, who authorities have identified as the gunman responsible for the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, earlier this month, described his alleged abuse in a television interview. “He just had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him,” Tessa Brennaman, 25, said on CBS’ Inside Edition. Kelley had a history of domestic violence; TIME reported earlier this week that, in 2012, Tessa Kelley accused him of beating and choking her, breaking her infant son’s skull and threatening her with a gun. A military court charged Kelley with domestic violence and sent him to a mental hospital in New Mexico, but he briefly escaped. Later that year he pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges, and a year after that was discharged for bad conduct after spending a year in military prison, according to CBS News. In her interview with CBS News, Brennaman describes how Kelley allegedly threatened her with a gun over a speeding ticket. “He took that gun out…. and he told me ‘do you want to die? do you want to die?'” she recalled. She also said he threatened to kill her and her whole family. Kelley, 26, who died after the shooting, killed more than 26 people — including an 18-month-old baby — and injured at least 20 others when he opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on the morning of November 5. Officials said they believe the attack was the result of a domestic dispute, citing threatening messages Kelley had sent his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. According to the Associated Press, Kelley was able to obtain the weapons that he used because the Air Force did not relay his criminal past to the FBI. If they had, he wouldn’t have been able to buy a gun.

16,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/11/sutherland-springs-shooting-recovery/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The people of Sutherland Springs have not held news conferences, they haven’t made appearances on network morning television shows, and while they’ve been polite to the media, they’re not exactly forthcoming. Instead, this rural community is turning to the one thing that has buoyed them in good times, and sustains them now: an unshakeable faith in God. David Colbath, one of 20 people who were injured but survived Devin Patrick Kelley’s rampage at the First Baptist Church, held Bible study from his hospital bed. Judy Green, a church member who avoided the carnage because she and her husband were running an errand, sought counseling at another church because of what she saw when she drove up to the building that day. Crystal Barkley, a Sutherland Springs resident who doesn’t even attend the church, prayed and “stayed at home for a couple of days, collecting strength.” There have been no fewer than three prayer vigils for the victims. One, held Wednesday and attended by Vice President Mike Pence, was so large that it had to be held in the neighboring town’s football stadium. On Sunday, the town will gather for church services in its community center, which is next door to the church and was part of the crime scene for several days. Residents have included reporters in impromptu prayer circles and have tried, quietly, to let the world know that it is a God-loving town, not a place of violence. “We want to be known for more than this,” sighed Tambria Read, president of the local historical museum, schoolteacher and lifelong resident. “We are not a shoot-’em-up community.” It’s difficult to put into words what happens to a place after a mass shooting, and each has its own way of dealing with the horror. In big cities like Orlando and Las Vegas, it was possible for those not directly affected to mourn and move on, to try to get back to normal as quickly as possible and mend aching hearts. Suburban sprawl and the comforts of urban life helped smooth over the raw emotion and residents could ignore the media, the outsiders coming to help, the constant reminder of loss. In Sutherland Springs, there’s been no escaping Sunday morning’s shooting that left 26 dead. Every resident in town knew at least one person who was killed, and most knew several. The victims were cousins, former students, people who they laughed with not long ago at the annual Fall Festival. Eight were children, and one victim wasn’t yet born. “It’s a good, simple community,” said Rod Green, Judy’s husband. Green said he got a call from the church pastor, who was out of town. “He said, ‘what’s going on,’ and I said, ‘what do you mean?’ He said, ‘there’s been a shooting at the church. Aren’t you there?'” By the time Green and his wife arrived, police and first responders were there. There were wounded people in the parking lot. The Greens tried to comfort the wounded, while ambulances crisscrossed the road outside. Helicopters landed nearby to fly the critically wounded to hospitals. “I saw a lot of stuff in Vietnam, and I never expected to see that type of thing here,” he said. And now there are outsiders in Sutherland Springs, who stick out by virtue of the fact that they’re asking questions during a time when people are pleading for answers from God. It’s difficult for any community that’s been blindsided by sudden horror to cope with grieving in the public eye. But for Sutherland Springs, population 600, it’s been a particular challenge for several reasons — not the least of which is the fact that it’s set in rural Texas, a stoic and insular place. Scores of media trucks, vans and cars have hunkered down at the town’s one major intersection (there are no stoplights here, only a flashing yellow). Anchormen did live shots near a flower-covered cross nailed to a post, while across the street, chaplains stood in a prayer circle next to a Frito-Lay truck in a gas station parking lot. Charlene Uhl, whose 16-year-old daughter Haley Krueger died last Sunday, has spent the days since the shooting at home, comforting her other three children and planning a funeral. She hasn’t wanted to leave her house because the town is crawling with reporters. The media attention “has made it harder,” she said. “It’s hard for me to talk about it.” It’s no exaggeration to say that reporters have knocked on almost every door in Sutherland Springs, seeking stories about the victims. Just a few days after Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost eight members of their family spanning three generations — including a son, grandchildren and great grandchildren — Mike Hopper stood guard outside the gate to the family’s ranch to keep the crush of media at bay. As Hopper talked with a reporter on Tuesday, family members drove up in a pickup truck and said they would soon be calling authorities to keep the media away. They lamented how journalists were staking out their relatives’ homes, depriving them of their peace and time to grieve. The word “vultures” was used. A shiny, new black-and-orange “No Trespassing” sign was stapled to the farm gate. Hopper said a woman from town drove around, handing them out. The signs sprouted in front of driveways and on fences all over the area. “There’s just a lot of emotion and protection,” Hopper said. It’s not that Sutherland Springs hasn’t weathered its share of tragedies. In the decades since people settled there in 1854 — the community was named after a doctor who treated soldiers at the Alamo — the town flooded, a high school burned down, and dozens were killed during a flu epidemic in 1919. But in recent decades, things have been quiet in this sleepy town southeast of San Antonio. It’s surrounded by rolling hills and cow pastures, and at night, overarched by vast Texas skies. “We ain’t got much news,” shrugged 84-year-old Richard Cardenas, who was born here and served as a county public works supervisor for decades. There was a flood in 1998, he recalled, and once, a woman with Alzheimer’s wandered into the woods and her body was found two months later. In 1993, the parents of Stephen Willeford were both killed in a motorcycle accident, said Cardenas’ wife, Theresa. (Willeford confronted Sunday’s attacker, shooting him, and has been hailed as a hero). The Cardenases were home Sunday when a friend called, wanting to know what was happening at the church. Richard Cardenas wept over the next few days as he watched his town’s tragedy played out on a television from a hospital bed in the family’s front room. He and his wife used to maintain the town cemetery, and now that duty’s fallen to his daughter Bertha and her husband. As a television anchor interviewed people about the shooting, Cardenas turned to his daughter and asked, “How many are they going to bury over there?” Bertha shook her head. “We don’t know yet.” She would be interviewed in The New York Times a few days later. Tambria Read, the teacher, says the presence of the media has put a certain pressure on the town, one it just isn’t used to. Live satellite trucks hum in the middle of town day and night as schoolkids pass by on buses, and white-hot lights illuminate the faces of the cable news hosts. “Did you look to the east sky and see the full moon this week?” she said. “The media’s lights have ruined the night sky.” ___ Associated Press writers Brian Skoloff and Emily Schmall contributed from Sutherland Springs.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Two white hearses carrying the bodies of a couple killed in last weekend’s Texas church shooting were followed by a long procession of vehicles Saturday evening that avoided passing the church, where more than two dozen people were fatally shot. Mourners instead drove around the tiny community of Sutherland Springs before reaching a small cemetery on the edge of town, where dozens more vehicles waited along a rural road for the private burial of Therese and Richard Rodriguez. Sheriff’s SUVs shielded mourners at the cemetery’s three entrances. The services for the recently retired couple followed a ceremony earlier in the day where about 100 people gathered to commemorate Veterans Day and to honor the shooting victims, nearly half of whom had ties to the Air Force. “Maybe this will start the healing process that will get Sutherland Springs and Wilson County to put this horrific tragedy behind us and look to the future,” county Judge Richard Jackson, his voice breaking, told the crowd, which included first responders and law enforcement officers. Jackson, the county’s top administrator, thanked the first responders and others who rushed to First Baptist Church in the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting. What they saw there will affect them the rest of their lives, Jackson said during the ceremony outside the town’s community center, where a wreath was placed near flags to remember those killed.

The gunman killed 25 people — authorities put the number at 26 because one was pregnant — and wounded about 20 others. The gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two men who heard gunfire from the church. Investigators have said the shooting appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving the attacker, Devin Patrick Kelley, and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn’t there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. Sutherland Springs is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio and not far from several military posts, including Lackland Air Force Base. The Air Force’s chief of staff, Gen. David Goldfein, said 12 of those killed were either members of the Air Force or had family ties to it. Among them were Scott and Karen Marshall, both 56, who had decided to retire in nearby La Vernia after meeting when they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. On Thursday, a military funeral was held for them at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Retired Chief Warrant Officer Mike Gonzales, who led Saturday’s Veterans Day ceremony, moved to Sutherland Springs with his wife to raise their children in 2009. He said many veterans choose to live in the San Antonio area because of its deep military ties, and families tend to migrate to the city’s surrounding rural areas. “We come here to enjoy life, to get quiet and to raise our children,” he said. “We’ve been to war zones and seen that tragedy firsthand. Never did we think that tragedy would strike here.” U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar told the gathering to lean on one another for support. The Texas congressman said $10 million in federal assistance has been secured to help cover overtime costs for law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation. Some in the crowd Saturday wore shirts that said “Sutherland Springs Strong” and included an outline of Texas with a heart of the town’s location. The shirts were donated by Brenda Bierd, who lives on the Gulf Coast and whose home was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in late August. “I hadn’t even heard of Sutherland Springs before the shooting, but this is what you do,” she said. “I just had this feeling I needed to be here.” A steady stream of people also visited a makeshift memorial of crosses adorned with flowers, photographs, red hearts and white, purple and pink balloons. Among the visitors was Jackie Lee, who said she asked her friends on Facebook if anyone would come with her from San Antonio this weekend. She said about two dozen people quickly said they would. “It was on my heart since it happened,” she said. “I needed to come to show the community some support, to show these people some support.”  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2017-11-11 21:25:28,"Sutherland Springs church shooting victims honored, funeral held",,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

19,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/12/maybe-it-s-time-to-get-a-gun-20171112/,"We're outnumbered. There are more firearms than people in this country now. In 2015, the Washington Post guessed there were 357 millions guns and 317 million people. There's probably more than that, for the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms data they relied upon only cover legal guns. Unregistered firearms are just that, phantoms floating across state and national borders. Nobody knows how many. No serious person is considering confiscating them. The only way you're going to take some people's guns is at gunpoint. And people with guns can point them right back at you. Even so, most people in this country don't have much to do with guns; only about a third of households in the U.S. have any. Around here, the percentage is somewhat higher. One study had it at about 57 percent in 2013, which made Arkansas No. 2 in gun ownership rates behind Alaska, at 61 percent. A lot of them are what I'd call casual gun owners, the sort of people who might keep a .22 rifle in a closet or a .38 in the drawer of a bedside table but never think much about them. They don't hunt or go to shooting ranges. But there are also a lot of Arkansans who duck hunt or deer hunt, who might have a couple of pricey long guns they lock away in safes. You might not have a gun in your house, but your friends and neighbors do. The topic probably doesn't come up often in casual conversation. On the other hand, there are also people who really like guns. I've known a few of them. I've gone out in the woods with some of them and chopped up targets and small trees with them. I can understand their enthusiasm, for there's something beautiful in a well-made tool; a sense of satisfaction available in the balanced, greasy precision of a good weapon. Add in its lethal potential and the understanding that for hundreds of years real heroes have used similar instruments in noble struggles for worthwhile things all over this blighted planet and yes, it's possible to work up a solemn emotional attachment to a hunk of iron and wood or bakelite. I don't think we need to worry about these folks, though some of them seem to be overly susceptible to the sales pitches and scare tactics of the National Rifle Association, which after spending a few decades functioning as the marketing arm of the gun and ammo industry has recently branched out into general right-wing paranoid politics. (With Barack Obama out of office and Hillary Clinton defeated, they've had to step up their search for bogeypeople and have started producing their own streaming content, demonizing immigrants, liberals and the ""violent left"" that wants to punch self-proclaimed Nazis in the throat. ) I don't know anyone who'd argue that the vast majority of gun owners are decent people. They've just made a choice to exercise their right to own a firearm. They don't have to explain themselves. While there's probably a discussion to be had about what weapons are appropriate for individuals to own (we already restrict fully automatic weapons), while we might be able to require people who own dangerous instruments to carry liability insurance or to stop the sale of high-capacity magazines, unless you're a felon or mentally ill you have a right to own a gun. And you should have that right. But that right was given you by a group of old-timey white men rebelling against governmental authority, not by God. Just because we invoke God doesn't mean we speak for him. God has always been silent on the issue of gun rights. Nothing in our Constitution is scripture. Gun rights are pretty much an American idea. Which doesn't necessarily mean it's the best idea, only that it's a product of our culture and history. Other countries do just fine without their citizens enjoying an enshrined right to a killing appliance. Some people like to suggest that we're not that different from other countries in terms of the number of firearms per capita. They'll say there are a lot of guns in Canada and Switzerland too, but they don't have the sort of problems with mass shooting that we do, so it must be that there's something sick and desperate in our culture that causes our problems. Some facts: There are a lot of guns in Canada and Switzerland relative to most of the world. But there are more than three times as many guns per capita in the U.S. than in Canada; more than four times as many guns per capita than in Switzerland. There are almost twice as many guns per capita in the U.S. as there are in the second-place country, which is Serbia. (We have about 113 guns per 100 people. Serbia has about 58.) But these people aren't entirely wrong. There is something sick and desperate in our culture. And part of that manifests in the toxic, erotic attachment a certain class of gun owners hold for their weapons. These are the folks who revel in gun porn and imagine themselves good guys who would stop the massacres that now occur on a weekly basis in the country. I know that whenever I address the subject--and I've been writing basically the same column about guns in America now for about 30 years--I'm going to hear from them. They're going to tell me about all the times they've prevented crimes by pulling their guns out in public (four times, one correspondent assured me). They insist that folks who mistakenly call AR-15s assault rifles are idiots who ought to have no standing in any debate about how we move forward on this issue. These are the real gun nuts, and they exist. They're the ones who buy all those cool military-looking non-assault rifles and the bullets to feed them. They're the ones with tactical body armor and bump stocks. They're the ones who fantasize about being good guys. They're the ones who get their feelings hurt and shoot up churches. Who deny the reality of Sandy Hook and Las Vegas. Who insist their rights trump your kid's life. And they're right. You get the thoughts and prayers; the NRA gets the legislation it wants. It's just business. You can't rely on government to help you, you got to exercise some self-reliance, son. So get yourself a gun. pmartin@arkansasonline.com Read more at www.blooddirtangels.com Editorial on 11/12/2017 Print Headline: Maybe it's time to get a gun Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

20,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/12/california-program-on-guns-in-spotlight/,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- It's difficult to keep guns away from ex-cons and the mentally disturbed, but a one-of-a-kind California program is designed to do just that. And in light of the Texas church shooting that left 26 dead, some are debating whether a program like it could have thwarted Devin Kelley's murderous rampage. The Armed and Prohibited Persons System program, proposed in 1999 and updated in 2006, makes California the only state in the country to establish an automated system for tracking firearm owners and to provide the legal authority to proactively disarm convicted criminals, people with certain mental illnesses, and others deemed dangerous. Supporters like Richard Aborn say programs like that one need to be replicated in other states given the increased frequency of mass shootings. Aborn is president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City and an architect of the defunct federal assault weapons ban, as well as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which implemented routine federal background checks for gun purchasers. ""What we saw on [Nov. 5] is what happens when a deranged individual has possession of lawful firearms,"" Aborn said. ""Every time [the Armed and Prohibited Persons System] is enforced and guns are returned, we're preventing a tragedy. Mass shootings are a form of domestic terror. We should equip citizens to prevent mass shootings as much as we can."" But the program has endured periodic criticism since its inception. A lack of resources has prevented the California Department of Justice from keeping up with the backlog of prohibited people. And gun-rights advocates have said uneven administration of the policy is unduly infringing on Second Amendment rights. The biggest challenge is that a large number of people are not supposed to be in the program, said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Calguns Foundation. DeLuz and fellow advocates say a big problem with the system is that there's no quick way to remove someone's name once his court-ordered weapon restriction ends. ""There is no guarantee that when your time is up, your name is going to be removed,"" DeLuz said. ""A big part is simply keeping up with the system and doing basic administration that could really make a difference."" Aborn acknowledges that the execution of the program can always be improved, but that should not be taken as an indictment of its broader policy aims. ""If the test of the validity of government programs is they act 100 percent perfectly, there would be no government programs. We'd never do anything,"" he said. ""We can do better, but just because we can't do everything doesn't mean we can't do everything we can."" In late 2006, California set up a database to track firearms owners and cross-reference those names with criminal and mental-health records to identify individuals ""who have been, or will become, prohibited from possessing a firearm subsequent to the legal acquisition or registration of a firearm or assault weapon."" The trouble is, the list of those people grew faster than the state could take away guns from those who shouldn't have them. In 2013, after the Sandy Hook shootings in Connecticut, there were more than 20,000 people on the prohibited list who had never been contacted by the state. In response, the state Legislature granted $24 million to the state Department of Justice to hire more agents to reduce the backlog. Those growing pains appear to have subsided -- to a degree. According to the latest Armed and Prohibited Persons System report released in March, the number of individuals in the database prohibited from owning firearms in calendar year 2016 grew by more than 14 percent, in large part because the state expanded its data-collection beyond handguns to include long guns like shotguns and rifles. But overall the number of people in the database was cut from 12,691 on Jan. 1, 2016, to ""an historic low of 10,634 subjects,"" according to the report. The last time the database contained so few subjects was February 2008, the report stated. In 2016, the Armed and Prohibited Persons System enforcement program completed 9,183 investigations, resulting in 511 arrests and the seizure of 3,954 firearms. Other significant seizures include 947,653 rounds of ammunition, 3,742 magazines, and 663 large-capacity magazines. Challenges remain, especially when it comes to hiring enough agents to knock on the doors of everyone on the Armed and Prohibited Persons System list. According to the 2016 report, the program got 36 limited-term agent positions, 10 of which the state Department of Justice was able to fill last calendar year. With the Texas church shooting, attention is once again focused on California's unique campaign to get guns away from people who shouldn't have them. In Kelley's case, the U.S. Air Force admitted that it had failed to submit his domestic-violence conviction to a federal database after he was discharged from the military. That conviction could have prevented him from buying the rifle he used -- although only in California might it have led authorities to seize guns he already had. The military's failure to enter his name into the National Criminal Information Center, a federal database, apparently allowed Kelley to pass several background checks and buy the firearms. The lapse fueled the ongoing push-back from gun-rights groups about California's gun-confiscation policy. ""What we saw in Texas is what happens when unfortunately one government agency doesn't do its job,"" DeLuz said, adding that nationalizing a policy like the Armed and Prohibited Persons System, and trying to unite assorted record-keeping and registration standards from state to state, would only worsen the situation. ""We wouldn't let someone's free speech or property rights be violated in the same way we do with the Second Amendment,"" he added. Aborn said imperfection does not justify inaction, particularly by Congress, which has the ""moral imperative"" to invoke changes in an era where mass shootings have become more frequent. He noted that since the federal assault weapons ban that he helped craft was rescinded in 2004 after a decade, the number of mass shootings has nearly tripled to at least 30, and the number of mass-shooting victims has increased more than fivefold to nearly 1,000.

21,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-sutherland-springs-texas-sunday-church-20171112-story.html,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS — Hundreds of mourners crowded into the tiny town of Sutherland Springs for the first Sunday service since a gunman stormed the First Baptist Church a week earlier, killing more than two dozen people in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. After an emotional sermon held outdoors under a massive white tent, congregants and the public were invited to return to the church for the first time since the tragedy. A chilling memorial set up inside the church included 26 white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of a victim who was pregnant — bearing each victim's name or nickname painted in gold. Pastor Frank Pomeroy shared his personal heartache and a message that the community bound together by faith can move past the evil that attacked the church seven days earlier. ""Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life,"" Pomeroy said during the service, his voice cracking as he spoke about his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, who was among those killed in the Nov. 5 rampage. ""I know everyone who gave their life that day,"" he said, pausing to gather himself. ""Some of whom were my best friends and my daughter."" He wiped his eyes, then added, ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today."" Initially, the church had planned to hold Sunday's service at an adjacent community center, which can accommodate a few dozen people. But when organizers realized hundreds planned to attend, the service was moved to a massive white tent erected in a baseball field. So many people turned up that the tent's side flaps had to be opened for an overflow crowd so that those who couldn't get a seat could see and hear what was going on inside. Mark Collins, a previous pastor at First Baptist, said it was the largest gathering in the church's 100-year history. The front three rows were reserved for survivors of the attack and the families of those killed. Many arrived early, as a steady rain fell on the tarp roof, offering hugs to each other and prayers. Congregants wept during the service and a moving version of ""Amazing Grace,"" led by three singers and a man on guitar, as the voices of hundreds sang along. Some bowed their heads, others raised their hands and swayed as the music played, and tears streamed down their faces. ""Amazing Grace"" was also played at halftime at Floresville High School at Friday night's game, in tribute to the victims. Later Sunday, the First Baptist Church opened its doors for the first time since the shooting. The inside had been transformed into a memorial with its walls, floor and pulpit painted white. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced and bullet holes filled. The church's pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. All that filled the space were the 26 white chairs, each with a red rose tied to it except for one that had a pink rose for the unborn baby. A line of about 85 people snaked from the church entrance and curved around the block, including people who traveled from as far away as the East Coast, said Collins, the church's former pastor who has returned to help in the tragedy's aftermath. Constructing the memorial wasn't an easy decision, he said. Some members have said they never wanted to step foot inside the site, he said, while others have said they needed to see it. Next Sunday's service is expected to take place on the grounds of the church, likely in a makeshift structure, Collins said. Church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, as some have said is likely, he said, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went aisle to aisle looking for victims and shot crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old. About 20 people were wounded in the shooting. Kelley died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was shot and chased by two men who heard the gunfire at the church. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn't there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. The church has reached out to Kelley's family and was praying for them, Collins said. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to his family,"" he added. For Sunday's service, people from other churches dropped off handmade prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses, among other gifts. Mental health organizations provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Republican Sen. John Cornyn spoke at the service, saying lives were stolen as darkness overtook one man's heart. ""The pain of losing 26 members is overwhelming,"" Cronyn said. ""Many lives have been changed forever. ... I can't imagine what you've been grappling with ever since.""

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas – The Latest on the Texas town recovering from last weekend's mass shooting at a church (all times local): 5:45 p.m. A line of about 85 people snaked from the entrance of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs and curved around the block as the house of worship opened its doors to the public at 5 p.m. for the first time since a deadly shooting last Sunday. Associate Pastor Mark Collins says people traveled from as far away as the East Coast to pray at the site of the shooting. He says that while they will be allowed inside the church to take part in the memorial, it was set up with members in mind. Collins says constructing the memorial wasn't an easy decision because some members have said they never wanted to again step foot in the place where they lost so many friends or family members. But, he says, other members and family of those who were killed needed to see the church. He says the memorial was a way to honor the victims without focusing on the shooting. He says the church has reached out to the family of shooter Devin Kelley, and that church members are praying for Kelley's family. The congregation will hold services on the grounds of the church next week. Collins says those services likely will take place in a makeshift structure. He says church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. ___ 4:45 p.m. A Texas church where more than two dozen people were killed in the deadliest shooting in the state's history has opened its doors to congregants and the public for the first time since the tragedy. The inside of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs had been transformed into a memorial when it was opened Sunday, one week later. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced. Bullet holes were filled. But the vibrant church's sandy stained pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. The walls, floor and pulpit were painted white. Twenty-six white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of one victim who was pregnant — were placed where each congregant was sitting when they were shot. A red rose was tied to each chair, and a pink rose for the unborn baby. Names or nicknames were painted in gold on each chair. A recording of scripture readings from a previous church service played as small groups of people walked around the room silently. ___ 2 p.m. Organizers say their fundraiser barbecue has raised more than $50,000 for the families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Texas church. Mike Ritch, a chef who co-founded Smokin' Angels BBQ Ministry after Hurricane Harvey battered the Texas coast, said Sunday that the exact tally hadn't been determined but that it exceeded the group's $50,000 goal ""by some portion."" He says the group wants to notify the families before announcing the total raised by the weekend event, which was held at St. Mark's Lutheran Church in Adkins, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Sutherland Springs. Plates were priced at $10, but Ritch said dozens of people came through the line and paid more for to-go orders. He says all of the money will go directly to the families. ___ 1:15 p.m. Congregants have departed crying and hugging one another after the first worship service since last week's mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The service Sunday was expected to draw about 500 people. It attracted an overflow crowd to a tent set up a baseball field in the small South Texas town that became the scene of the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Children also attending began playing on the baseball field as people at a community building are preparing to feed about 350, including families and survivors of the shooting. Former Pastor Mark Collins says next week's service will be held at the church site. ___ 12:50 p.m. The former pastor at the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church where a gunman opened fire a week ago says the first service since the worst mass shooting in Texas history is the most attended in the congregation's 100-year history. Former Pastor Mark Collins says the First Baptist Church ""is still alive"" and is encouraging people to give themselves to Christ. He says those who died would want those supporting them now to stand up and give themselves to Christ. Church officials had expected about 500 people to attend Sunday's service but dozens more chairs were added. The flaps on the sides of a tent that's serving as the worship site had to be lifted so hundreds more outside could see and hear. Collins says there's hope, saying it's only been seven days since the shooting and ""already this community is back to worship, bound together by faith."" ___ 12:40 p.m. The pastor of a small Texas church says evil was responsible for the worst mass shooting in the state's history. Frank Pomeroy spoke during the congregation's first Sunday service since last weekend's shooting that killed more than two-dozen people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Pomeroy says he wanted to ensure everyone who walked in to the service ""knows that those who died lived for their Lord and savior."" He says rather than chose darkness as the gunman did seven days ago, ""we choose life."" The congregation held the service at a baseball field, setting up folding chairs under a large white tent. Pomeroy's voice cracked as he paused, and described the victims as ""my best friends and my daughter."" Then he wiped his eyes before saying: ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today."" The crowd stood, clapped and raised their hands to heaven. ___ 11:10 a.m. Organizers have set up hundreds of folding chairs under a large white tent on the baseball field in Sutherland Springs, Texas, for the first Sunday service since last weekend's mass shooting at the First Baptist Church. The front three rows are reserved for First Baptist Church members and their families, as a steady rain falls on the tarp roof while church-goers slowly file in. Some are hugging and others are praying or sitting quietly. People from other churches have dropped off handmade presents such as prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses and mental health organizations have provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Initial plans called for gathering at a community center that could house a few dozen people. But when organizers realized about 500 people were planning to attend, the service was moved outside.

Swift, Contributing Photographer)  Chase Rice was performing “Everybody We Know Does” on Saturday night when he paused to emphasize one verse’s heightened relevance after the mass shooting last month in Las Vegas. Then the Driftwood Festival headliner told the large crowd, “That’s what country music’s all about. When you get knocked down, you get back up.” Many concertgoers in Dana Point wore Route 91 Harvest Festival hats, T-shirts and “Vegas Strong” slogans. Since it was Veteran’s Day, artists like Lit and A Thousand Horses thanked military personnel everywhere. Two local vets were also brought onstage between sets and saluted. Alcohol tastings (mostly craft beer, but also wine and vodka) were a big draw at the fest and long booth lines near the sand held steady through the afternoon. At one point, a dozen concert-goers line danced in the rear concourse area. Rice made an immediate impact with a hard-hitting band often reminiscent of Metallica. He opened with the ominous Fall Out Boy-styled “Lions,” from upcoming album “Lambs & Lions, due Nov. 17. The rap-style cadence of “50 Shades of Crazy” went down well. The set fared better when the mood shifted – and actually sounded country – on acoustic guitar-based latest single “Three Chords & the Truth” and another memorable new one, “Eyes on You.” Sensual hits “Gonna Wanna Tonight” and “Ride” drove female fans crazy. Rice jokingly sang directly to a pal’s girlfriend on the latter while seated on stools. Florida Georgia Line’s “Cruise,” his first big success as a co-writer, drew a hearty response. Later, as the evening wound down, band introductions led into bits of Blink-182 songs. “This is the most beautiful show I’ve been part of; my heart is bursting with joy,” said Frankie Ballard, the Driftwood MVP. Far better than at Stagecoach ’15, the Michigan native emerged to Rufus Thomas’s 1953 Sun Records tune “Tiger Man (King of the Jungle)” and a revving engine sound. A similar charge ran through his set, with ample displays of Ballard’s electric guitar prowess and mighty drummer Travis McNabb (Sugarland, Better Than Ezra). Standouts included country airplay chart toppers “Young & Crazy,” “Helluva Life” and “Sunshine & Whisky” (all hearty audience singalongs), “It Started with a Beer” (the popular hit off 2016’s underrated “El Rio”) and a fine bluesy medley of “Hound Dog/Heartbreak Hotel.” Cassadee Pope’s ebullient performance began with one of her best-known songs, “I Wish I Could Break Your Heart.” The audience responded loudly to “Think of You,” the No. 1 recording with Chris Young (done here as a duet with the guitarist), but they were far less attentive to midtempo fare, several unreleased numbers and unfortunately a riveting solo acoustic cover of Keith Urban’s “Stupid Boy” – initially done when Pope won NBC’s “The Voice.” Fullerton band Lit, always solid live, previewed promising new material from a new album scheduled next month, including a thought-provoking “Fast” (whose video did well at CMT), the earthy “Just Feels Right,” “All Eyes on Us” and “Real Good Problem” (where leader A. Jay Popoff coaxed co-writer Michael Hobby of A Thousand Horses onstage to sing a few bars). Popoff had no trouble getting the crowd excited, especially during closer “My Own Worst Enemy.” A Thousand Horses’ delivered soulful Southern country/rock with fervor. Locking into a groove from the get-go with “Burn Like Willie,” the foursome seldom let up on the power, from the catchy, newer “Blaze of Something,” The Faces-styled “First Time” and spiritual vibe of “Sunday Morning” to the memorable radio faves “Smoke” and “(This Ain’t No) Drunk Dial.”  Caroline Jones, who hosts a SiriusXM radio show, put out the “Bare Feet” EP over the summer and recently toured with Zac Brown Band. The multi-instrumentalist’s pleasant set was most notable for “Worth the Wait,” which nicely segued into Loggins and Messina’s “Danny’s Song” and “Old Blue,” a 19th-century folk ballad in which Jones showed off her wide vocal range with producer Ric Wake watching near the soundboard. Mark Mackay lived up to the unenviable task of playing to early arrivals. The San Francisco native’s current album “Trials and Tribulations” is one of the best indie releases I’ve heard all year. Backed by a band that included a lap steel player, Mackay dazzled with his electric guitar work. Standouts included the rousing “Mustang,” a John Mellencamp-styled “Settle for a Small Town,” an affecting “I Can’t Stop You” (co-written by country heavy hitter Jeffrey Steele) and winning cover of Jackson Browne’s “Running on Empty.” With: Chase Rice, Frankie Ballard, Cassadee Pope, A Thousand Horses, Lit, Caroline Jones, Mark Mackay When: Saturday Where: Doheny State Beach, 25300 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point Next: Music starts at 1 p.m. today (Sunday), with Kip Moore, Dan + Shay, Maddie & Tae, Canaan Smith, Raelynn, Gethen Jenkins, $49-$129 VIP, www.driftwoodfest.com   Get the latest news delivered daily!

25,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-texas-church-shooter-ex-wife-20171112-story.html,"NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS — The former wife of the man responsible for killing 26 people in a Texas church last week said he had threatened to kill her over the course of their relationship, once putting a gun to her head and asking her whether she wanted to die. The comments, the first public statements made by gunman Kelley's first wife, Tessa Brennaman, add to the growing portrait of Devin Kelley as an unstable young man whose path through life was marked by disruption, anger and the potential for violence. In an interview with ""Inside Edition"" published in part on CBS' website, Brennaman, 25, described her former husband as someone with ""a lot of demons or hatred inside of him"" and said he once threatened her for getting a speeding ticket. ""He had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out and he put it to my temple and he said, 'Do you want to die, do you want to die?' "" she told a television interviewer. Kelley's treatment of Brennaman, then Tessa Kelley, during their marriage has come into harsh focus in the aftermath of the mass shooting — the worst in Texas history — leaving unanswered questions about how the conviction and prison sentence he was given for domestic abuse against her and her son were not reported to federal authorities. Brennaman and Kelley divorced after the incident, which resulted in him being court-martialed and sentenced to a year of confinement. The domestic violence charges should have prevented him from being able to buy the guns he used in the shooting, the Air Force said. Other information about Kelley's turbulent life has emerged in recent days. Officials in New Braunfels, where Kelley lived with his family, have been unable to explain why his court file is marked with a yellow flag, which denotes psychiatric issues, in their digital records. ""We can't figure out who put it in and why,"" the county's sheriff, Mark Reynolds, said. Records released by the New Braunfels Independent School District show that Kelley racked up a lengthy disciplinary record in high school, including seven suspensions for falsifying records, insubordination, profanity and a drug-related offense. He graduated 260th in a class of 393 in 2009, with a 2.32 grade-point average. His martial arts instructor from those years said Kelley had signed up because he had been bullied as an adolescent. ""He had it tough,"" said the instructor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he hoped to avoid unwanted attention. ""He didn't quite fit in. He was a good athlete, not a great athlete. He was a good student, not a great student. So I think he was struggling to find his place."" The instructor said he had believed that Kelley's karate work — Kelley earned a black belt about midway through high school after about four or five years of training, he said — had helped set the teenager on solid footing. Unlike other family members who went to Texas A&M University in nearby San Antonio, including his father and two sisters, Kelley joined the Air Force after high school. But his problems seemed only to grow there. Jessika Edwards, a former Air Force staff sergeant who said she worked with Kelley at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, told CNN that he was constantly getting into trouble. ""It was problem after problem,"" she said. His behavior caused her to worry about his potential for violence toward others; Edwards said he displayed a fascination with mass murders. ""He would make jokes about wanting to kill somebody,"" she said. Edwards said Kelley had threatened to harm himself before the Air Force referred him for mental-health treatment, according to CNN. He escaped from a mental-health facility near the base in 2012; police dispatched to find him said they were told that he ""was a danger to himself and others."" A police report said he had been caught sneaking guns onto an Air Force base ""attempting to carry out death threats"" against military superiors. After Kelley was given a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014 stemming from his domestic violence case, Edwards said, he reached out to her, asking her whether she'd be a reference for him as he applied to jobs. But some discussions they had over social media continued to alarm her, she said. He told her that he bought dogs on Craigslist so he could shoot them, and he expressed admiration for Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a South Carolina church in 2015, CNN reported. ""He would say 'Isn't it cool? Did you watch the news?' "" Edwards said, according to CNN. ""He would say he wished he had the nerve to do it, but all he would be able to do is kill animals."" Kelley was charged in 2014 with a misdemeanor count of animal mistreatment in El Paso County, Colo., where he lived at one point, after neighbors complained that a man matching his description had punched a dog. Edwards said that though she blocked Kelley on Facebook because of his messages, she didn't think he would act on them. ""In a sane person's mind, when people say something like that, you don't think it's something they're going to do,"" she said. She gave him her number and an instruction to call if he felt as if he was going to hurt himself or someone else. He never did. Instead she got a text from a friend after Kelley had been identified as the gunman last Sunday evening. ""I dropped a glass and started crying,"" Edwards said. Two parishioners of the First Baptist Church also said that Kelley's demeanor at a recent fall festival held by the church had concerned them. Judy and Rod Green told CBS that Kelley had showed up in all black and seemed ""completely distant and way out in thought."" Rod Green told the outlet that he had tried to determine whether Kelley was armed at the time, saying he would have escorted him from the area if he had been. A woman who identified herself on Saturday to The Washington Post as Kelley's grandmother said the whole family was devastated. ""I know he lost it,"" she said. ""It's broken all of our hearts. We feel so very sad."" Of Kelley's parents, she said: ""They're walking through a living hell right now."" Todd Friesenhahn, justice of the peace for Guadalupe County's Precinct 4, said a complete autopsy report on Kelley's body, which will include toxicology information, might be done ""within three weeks.""

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Eric Gay  SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Hundreds of mourners crowded into the tiny town of Sutherland Springs for the first Sunday service since a gunman stormed the First Baptist Church a week earlier, killing more than two dozen people in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. After an emotional sermon held outdoors under a massive white tent, congregants and the public were invited to return to the church for the first time since the tragedy. A chilling memorial set up inside the church included 26 white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of a victim who was pregnant — bearing each victim’s name or nickname painted in gold. Pastor Frank Pomeroy shared his personal heartache and a message that the community bound together by faith can move past the evil that attacked the church seven days earlier. “Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life,” Pomeroy said during the service, his voice cracking as he spoke about his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, who was among those killed in the Nov. 5 rampage. “I know everyone who gave their life that day,” he said, pausing to gather himself. “Some of whom were my best friends and my daughter.” He wiped his eyes, then added, “I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today.” Initially, the church had planned to hold Sunday’s service at an adjacent community center, which can accommodate a few dozen people. But when organizers realized hundreds planned to attend, the service was moved to a massive white tent erected in a baseball field. So many people turned up that the tent’s side flaps had to be opened for an overflow crowd so that those who couldn’t get a seat could see and hear what was going on inside. Mark Collins, a previous pastor at First Baptist, said it was the largest gathering in the church’s 100-year history. The front three rows were reserved for survivors of the attack and the families of those killed. Many arrived early, as a steady rain fell on the tarp roof, offering hugs to each other and prayers. Congregants wept during the service and a moving version of “Amazing Grace,” led by three singers and a man on guitar, as the voices of hundreds sang along. Some bowed their heads, others raised their hands and swayed as the music played, and tears streamed down their faces. “Amazing Grace” was also played at halftime at Floresville High School at Friday night’s game, in tribute to the victims. Later Sunday, the First Baptist Church opened its doors for the first time since the shooting. The inside had been transformed into a memorial with its walls, floor and pulpit painted white. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced and bullet holes filled. The church’s pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. All that filled the space were the 26 white chairs, each with a red rose tied to it except for one that had a pink rose for the unborn baby. A line of about 85 people snaked from the church entrance and curved around the block, including people who traveled from as far away as the East Coast, said Collins, the church’s former pastor who has returned to help in the tragedy’s aftermath. Constructing the memorial wasn’t an easy decision, he said. Some members have said they never wanted to step foot inside the site, he said, while others have said they needed to see it. Next Sunday’s service is expected to take place on the grounds of the church, likely in a makeshift structure, Collins said. Church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, as some have said is likely, he said, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went aisle to aisle looking for victims and shot crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old. About 20 people were wounded in the shooting. Kelley died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was shot and chased by two men who heard the gunfire at the church. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn’t there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. The church has reached out to Kelley’s family and was praying for them, Collins said. “Our hearts and prayers go out to his family,” he added. For Sunday’s service, people from other churches dropped off handmade prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses, among other gifts. Mental health organizations provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Republican Sen. John Cornyn spoke at the service, saying lives were stolen as darkness overtook one man’s heart. “The pain of losing 26 members is overwhelming,” Cronyn said. “Many lives have been changed forever. ...

Filed under: Netflix’s The Punisher might not be what you’re expecting — but it’s not that good either Netflix’s line of Marvel shows is by now so disconnected from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that we may as well call it the Marvel Netflix Universe, and its latest installment is perhaps the most divorced from the MCU yet. But The Punisher is already an odd one out in the Defenders setting — it’s the first of its line to not have been a part of initial planning for the streaming service’s Marvel offerings, the first to not have been built on a road that led to The Defenders. It’s also about a character who is an odd one out even in comics; his anti-hero ethos existing explicitly to contrast the superheroic black and white morality of the majority of Marvel’s superheroes. The Punisher isn’t a superhero, but a reflection of them. Reviewing Netflix’s Marvel shows before release always comes with some risk, as the company only offers the first half of the season to press. Still, it seems fair to judge a show based on those episodes alone, and update once the rest become available. But here, again, The Punisher feels like a different beast. (Update: The full review is below.) The Punisher has a small array of subplots, some of which are wrestling with incredibly weighty issues, like the grooming of young, dissatisfied men into political tools and the care (or lack thereof) the system gives to the mental health of veterans. With some of these elements, it’s unclear how they are going to (presumably) connect back to the show’s main plot. How well the Punisher writers’ room has crafted those eventual connections and conclusions will make or break a lot of the show. So consider this our Punisher pre-review. And, so far, The Punisher might not be exactly what you’re expecting. Frank Castle’s classic image — a white guy with lots of guns who typically fires many of them into other people — has given his series an uncertain appeal in, shall we say, our current environment of current events. Star Jon Bernthal has talked about the show’s uncomfortable relatability in interviews. Netflix has even canceled a major appearance of the Punisher cast at New York Comic Con in October, in deference to the Las Vegas mass shooting in which 58 people died and 546 were wounded, and delayed the release of the show. (In the intervening weeks, 26 churchgoers were killed by a single shooter in a small town in Texas.) And The Punisher is certainly about a lone gunman — but in its first six episodes it’s much more about America’s intelligence ecosystem in the era of the War on Terror, and the lives of soldiers once they return to our shores. What I remember most from those episodes isn’t the blowout fights or the car chases, it’s the spycraft and intrigue of trained intelligence professionals who can’t afford to trust anyone figuring out how to work together toward common goals, and the clever positioning of Frank Castle and a government agent as opposing figures investigating the same corruption. The Punisher’s first episode is sleepy and repetitive; nothing in it is anything we didn’t see in the second season of Daredevil. Along those same lines, The fifth and sixth episodes already drag more than the others, an indication of the usual mid-season Netflix slump. But at least Punisher’s repetitive beginning is part of the first narratively necessary step in the show’s plot: moving the goalpost on Frank’s revenge. Yes, The Punisher is our second story about Frank Castle taking revenge on the people who destroyed his family, but it obeys the canonical law of the sequel: If you’re going to have the same plot, at least make it bigger and more complicated. To that end, the show fills out Frank’s supporting cast with some real character gems. As in his comic book incarnation, Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Micro becomes Frank’s new partner, or, in the immortal words of Spider-Man: Homecoming, his “guy in the chair.” We’re introduced to a whole host of Frank’s old army buddies, only some of whom are aware that he’s still alive. But my favorite of the bunch is Amber Rose Revah’s Dinah Madani, a welcome twist on the usual trope of the good cop in a corrupt system who wants the same thing as the anti-hero, but could never work with them — unless, of course, desperate circumstances might force them to. (Consider my fingers crossed.) Madani is practically our second lead; she’s given loads of time in the plot to explore her history as an upwardly mobile, female, first-generation Iranian-American Department of Homeland Security agent. And Punisher puts Madani and Frank Castle on a collision course (at one point, literally), as they both charge after the same conspiracy from within and without the system in which it secretly flourished. Charging after that conspiracy is the main plot of the show and is where it does its best work. The tensest moments for me were all about Micro trying his best to impress a highly paranoid and extremely dangerous Frank Castle — and also gain his trust at the same time. The ways in which Micro and Frank wrestle for leverage over each other even after they recognize their shared goals is just as engaging as Madani’s struggle for recognition in the DoHS. In comparison, the drawn out firefights, bloody commando flashbacks and soft-focus remembrances of Frank’s family bored me. However, the focus on the Department of Homeland Security — as well as scenes within the CIA and the flashbacks to Frank’s military career — bring one of the show’s strangest choices to the fore. The Punisher makes the frankly unbelievable presumption that, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the history of the War on Terror as well as the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security have undergone no especially notable divergences from our own reality. It’s not a show-breaking detail, but it does seem like a missed opportunity. The Punisher has the fewest connections to the Marvel Universe in a group of shows that were billed on their interconnected setting and have since notably ignored that they’re in the same world as Iron Man, War Machine and Captain America. In the first six episodes, superheroes have been mentioned once, and then only in a sentence that wouldn’t be out of place for a show where they only existed in comic books. The Punisher also has a habit — not a unique one, by any means — of setting up characters who are obvious in their intolerance so that their leads can swat them down, a lazy way of establishing their bonafides as Not That Kind of Guy. Creating an unsubtle caricature of a racist for your hero to oppose with a quip does not actually contribute to the conversation around Islamophobia in post-9/11 American culture, nor properly depict the nuances of the issue you’re trying to address. And how The Punisher approaches its nuances in the last half its season will have a big impact on its overall quality. If Frank’s unit was part of a military conspiracy without his knowledge, is the show trying to absolve him of or implicate him in its misdeeds? This other veteran character, struggling to connect, violently lashing out and looking for another fight to join — will he eventually represent a “realistic” version of Frank Castle’s story? Or does he represent the kind of uncontrolled violence that Frank channels so carefully and deliberately at criminals? These are the questions the last half of The Punisher has to answer, and I’m curious to see how it does. My biggest concern, coming out of episode six of The Punisher, was that it would make a serious misstep in its attempt to address gun violence and mass killings in America. In the end, the subplot stood on its own sturdy legs without much fuss — but without really taking a stand, you might say. While it’s admirable that The Punisher acknowledges the parallels between the behavior that we’re all tuning in to see Frank Castle commit — bloody, gun-fueled, extra-judicial revenge — and America’s seemingly ever-present incidents of mass shootings, the show goes no farther than that. Punisher stays dedicatedly neutral on what the solution to lone-gunman mass violence in America should be, by creating character stand-ins for both the guns rights and gun control side of our national debate and then depicting them both as hypocritical, lying, cowardly stereotypes. Without a broader, braver message on the subject, the acknowledgment of the fact that Frank’s personal quest for revenge can be so easily conflated with an anti-government, pro-guns bombing campaign enacted on innocents undercuts the heroic vigilante ideal. Frank is a fantasy. Bringing him this close to reality takes all the wind out of him. But then, in its totality, The Punisher already feels like something that’s had the wind taken out of it. It feels like too little plot stretched over too many episodes, a tight action movie with a dollop of spycraft that was pulled like taffy until it was thirteen hours long. But maybe it’s just that it’s hard to keep a sense of rising stakes in a show where the lead fundamentally doesn’t care if he lives or dies throughout the entire climax — and very few other characters do either. The main narrative thrust of The Punisher actually ends an episode before the show does, leaving the audience to drag on another hour through an unnecessary extension of Frank’s revenge quest. And by this point The Punisher has undercut itself in other ways as well, by slowly exposing its villains as near cartoonishly evil, complete with crazed laughter, walking-away-slowly-from-an-explosion and one-weird-dead-eye. Then, without giving anything away, the resolution of the climax manages to both feel out of character for Frank (in a way I expect many Punisher fans will find alienating) and implausibly favorable to him. This is Punisher’s second biggest problem after how slow it moves: that it wants to be a show about the real experiences of veterans and terrorist, political mass violence in America today and it wants to be a show about Frank Castle putting a skull on his chest and surviving a near-death beating from a cackling secret agent. The Punisher’s tone and pacing problems ultimately overwhelmed any goodwill I had towards Frank and Micro and Agent Madani from the outset. A late-season brush with a Rashomon-style episode was only a brief breather from an otherwise dull experience. The Punisher didn’t having me rolling my eyes at its dialogue, as I have with the worst of Marvel’s Netflix fare, but its attempts to tackle weighty real-world tensions undercuts its attempts to be a bullet-filled revenge fantasy. And its hesitance to follow through on its real-world elements and take a stand leave it feeling like a bridge with no middle; two opposed poles with just the wind between them.",2017-11-13 03:00:01,The Punisher pre-review,,69395,http://www.polygon.com/#spider

The Holcombe family comprised more than a third of the 26 people killed in the sanctuary of First Baptist Church: Bryan and Karla Holcombe, John’s father and mother; his wife, Crystal, and children Emily, Megan and Greg Hill from Crystal’s first marriage; their unborn child (under Texas law, an unborn child is counted as a victim); and John’s brother, Marc “Danny” Holcombe and Danny’s 17-month-old daughter, Noah. Crystal’s oldest son, 15-year-old Philip Hill, was sick and didn’t go to church that day, the Hill family says. Crystal’s 7-year-old daughter, Evelyn, was in the congregation but survived along with John. On Facebook Monday, Sarah Slavin, who is John’s sister, wrote: “If something you say makes me burst into tears, please just let me cry. “Don’t apologize. It doesn’t mean you said the wrong thing,” she continues. “Don’t try to cheer me up. Just love me and let me cry. Hug me if you want but let me go if I try to pull away. Cry with me if you feel it. Love you all.” The funeral services at the Floresville Event Center in nearby Floresville are open to the public, with burial at a later time, according to the announcement. John and Crystal, 36 and a mom of five, had already picked out a name for their new baby: Carlin Brite Holcombe. John posted on Facebook they didn’t yet know the sex of the child. Crystal was 18 weeks pregnant, a relative tells PEOPLE. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Joe Holcombe, John’s grandfather, has told PEOPLE that the family’s tremendous faith has helped them through the tragedy. “It’s not as hard on us, because we know we’ll be together again and it will be for a long time this time,” he said. Slavin spoke of her tremendous faith in a Facebook video about their parents, Bryan and Karla: “They are at peace right now, and I feel that peace. It’s tangible and undeniable.” On Sunday, on the same day that its first worship service since the mass shooting was held, Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church opened its doors for visitors to pay their respects. The church sanctuary has been transformed into a moving memorial for the victims, with 26 white folding chairs commemorating the dead at each of the spots where they were killed, reports CNN. On each chair is a single red rose and the name of the shooting victim inscribed into the chair’s back, with a small pink rose for Crystal Holcombe’s unborn child next to his or her mother’s chair.

42,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/zrvrU_2fGKc/,"In his first service since 26 members of his congregation were killed in Texas’ largest mass shooting, Pastor Frank Pomeroy said, “We choose life.” The pastor’s 14-year-0ld daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed when a gunman entered the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs on November 5. Following the service, the church opened the doors of the building where 26 people lost their lives and 20 others were wounded. Church officials converted the building to a temporary memorial. A memorial for the victims of the shooting at Sutherland Springs Baptist Church includes 26 white chairs, each painted with a cross and and rose, placed in the sanctuary, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) Pomeroy was not in attendance that fateful Sunday, having traveled to Oklahoma with his wife. However, on the Sunday before the massacre, Pomeroy told his congregants, “Even if things happen you don’t understand, you still need to do what God is calling you to do,” CBN News reported. The pastor presented a choice to those who attended this weekend’s service, held in a white tent on a baseball field not far from the church. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) “Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life. We have the freedom to choose, and rather than choose darkness as that one man did that day, I say we choose life. Amen?!!,” Pomeroy said. Of those who died, he said, “Those 26 that are no longer with us are dancing in His presence today.” The mother-in-law of the shooter attended the service this week. She did not attend services on the day Devin Patrick Kelley came to kill her and the other members of the church community. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Church leadership placed white chairs on the spot where each person was killed. Pomeroy previously stated that he wants to tear down the building and convert that part of the land to a permanent memorial. He would like to build a new sanctuary on a different part of the land.

43,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-judicial-nominee-brett-talley-20171113-story.html,"Brett Talley, the young lawyer nominated by President Donald Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama, was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed. In response, Talley said he would evaluate ""real or potential conflict, or relationships that could give rise to appearance of conflict"" and recuse himself from cases if necessary, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. He did not, however, identify any family members - including his wife, who is one of Trump's attorneys. Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II's chief of staff. Talley's failure to mention his wife in the 30-page written questionnaire was first reported Monday by the New York Times. Talley could not be immediately reached for comment. The White House did not respond to questions about whether the administration sees a potential conflict of interest, and whether Talley should have disclosed that he is married to a White House attorney. A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chair, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, did not respond to a call seeking comment. As a district judge, Talley could end up presiding over cases in which the federal government or the White House is one of the parties. For example, district judges in Hawaii and Maryland had previously heard cases challenging the Trump administration's travel ban. Talley attracted controversy for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown in the past. The Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley's nomination last week on a party-line vote. His nomination is now headed to the Senate for a full confirmation vote. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Senate should not confirm Talley in light of the new revelation. ""By failing to disclose that his wife is one of President Trump's lawyers, Talley has betrayed his obligation to be open and transparent with the Senate and American people,"" Feinstein said in a statement, adding later: ""Talley's nomination shouldn't be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission that clarifies matters concerning when he would recuse himself."" Feinstein said reports that Donaldson has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team as it investigates Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election show ""a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed."" The Times reported that Mueller's team recently talked to Donaldson about her notes on conversations with McGahn regarding the firing of former FBI director James Comey. Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee have opposed Talley's nomination, citing his lack of trial experience and political comments he previously made on social media, on his political blog and in several opinion pieces he had written for CNN. The American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees, has rated Talley as ""not qualified."" Trump judge nominee, 36, who has never tried a case, wins approval of Senate panel Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alabama who also writes horror stories on the side, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case. Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views. For example, one tweet from his account, which has since been made private, says, ""Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet."" On his political blog called Government in Exile, he wrote a post with the title, ""A Call to Arms: It's Time to Join the National Rifle Association,"" in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Conn., killed 27 people before taking his own life. He criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, ""have exploited"" the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. Answering written questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about his previous political statements, Talley said he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues ""will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case."" He also said the blog post calling on people to join the NRA was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion. Challenged about his lack of trial experience, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs rather than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit appeals court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment on his recommendation for the federal bench - a decision made by two U.S. senators from Alabama, Richard Shelby and Luther Strange. Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years in a federal-district court and another two at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, from 2013 to 2015. In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January. In a statement defending Talley's nomination, Grassley said he does not believe ""extensive trial experience"" is the only factor in deciding on a nominee's qualifications. ""Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,"" Grassley said. Talley's nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists on the federal bench. Talley and Donaldson were married in August 2015. Donaldson was an associate for the Washington law firm Jones Day before she was appointed to the White House post. She is one of several lawyers from the firm who were tapped to join the Trump administration, some as attorneys for the White House, including McGahn. Among the others: Greg Katsas, James Burnham and David Morrell, who now work in the Office of the White House Counsel. Katsas, Trump's deputy counsel, is also a judicial nominee. The Senate last week approved Katsas' nomination to an appellate court in Washington.

            First published on Tue 14 Nov 2017 07.00 GMT They see the alerts on their phones. They turn on the news. And then, like the rest of us, the survivors of America’s previous mass shootings watch the grim details of the latest attack unfold. This month a gunman killed 25 people at a rural church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, just over a month after 58 people were murdered and more than 500 wounded in Las Vegas, the worst mass shooting in recent US history. The tragedies join a long, somber list of high-casualty killings that dominate the headlines and then gradually fade from public view. We asked survivors and family members of victims from six previous mass shootings – including some that were, briefly, the deadliest, the worst – what they do after each new incident. How do they make sense of the country’s response to these shootings? What do they want to see change? How do they cope with the intense coverage of the latest incident – and the silence when the news cycle suddenly moves on? In the 911 tapes, you can hear art teacher Patti Nielson screaming at Austin Eubanks and his friend Corey DePooter in their high school library, to get “under the table, kids!” The juniors had heard a burst of gunshots earlier but had dismissed it as construction noise. As Nielson screamed, the boys ducked down. Two of their classmates entered the library and opened fire. A few minutes after the shooting stopped, Eubanks saw other students running, and he ran, too, through a library filled with smoke, the fire alarm blaring. Outside, he called his family from a police car. It was only when his father arrived and jumped over a fence to get to him that his state of shock began to fracture. “I said, ‘They killed Corey,’ and I just broke down in his arms.’” Eubanks had been shot in the hand and the knee. In the hospital, he was given his first pain medication. His physical pain wasn’t so bad, but the opiate medication had a dramatic impact on his emotional suffering. “It was like somebody put a warm blanket” over him, he says. Related: It’s time to end America’s gun violence epidemic. Help us change the conversation He was sent home with a 30-day supply of opiate medication. Within months, he was addicted, manipulating doctors to prescribe him more medication, eventually buying online and on the street, moving on to cocaine and ecstasy and whatever else he could find. His parents saw his behavior changes early, but, knowing little about the signs of addiction, attributed them to the trauma he had been through. It took him 12 years, after racking up multiple arrests for fights, theft and impulsive behavior, and making multiple attempts at recovery, before he finally got sober. Today, Eubanks is the chief operating officer for a long-term residential treatment program in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and beginning to speak nationally on the opioid epidemic. At the root of America’s addiction crisis, he explains, is untreated trauma. “We have this society that is filled with emotional pain and trauma, and we have people prescribing narcotics that are very effective with treating emotional pain and trauma,” he says. In recovery, more than a decade after Columbine, Eubanks finally went through stages of grief for the friend he lost. About 80% of the clients in recovery he has worked with can identify the trauma at the root of their addiction. It doesn’t have to be as dramatic as surviving a mass shooting: painful events in early childhood, like a divorce, can have a deep emotional impact but are often dismissed. Eubanks has watched the increasing pace of mass shootings with fear. “We’re lessening the threshold of how crazy someone needs to be to commit a mass shooting,” he says. “Now we had a guy [the Las Vegas shooter] who committed this crime for no other known motive other than notoriety, and that is incredibly scary to me. “Every time this happens, the ripple effect gets larger,” he says. “I don’t think we have a five-year or a 10-year solution. I think we’re looking at a 25-year solution.” Caren Teves and her husband Tom were on vacation in Maui in 2012 when they received a frantic phone call from Amanda Lindgren, their son Alex’s girlfriend. Amanda and Alex had been at a movie. There had been a shooting. She didn’t know what had happened to him. For the next 12 hours, the family desperately tried to locate Alex. In between frantic phone calls to the police and different local hospitals, they watched the sensationalistic TV news coverage about the mass shooter who attacked a midnight viewing of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado. Photos of the perpetrator, with his garishly dyed red hair, kept appearing on the screen. Related: 10 gun violence prevention victories since Sandy Hook Lindgren would later describe how she had kept standing up in shock as the shooting began, and how Alex had pulled her down and covered her body with his own. He had been killed trying to shield her. In the days after they learned Alex had been killed, Tom Teves challenged news anchors to report on his son’s heroism, and the bravery of other survivors and first responders, instead of trying to delve into the mind of the shooter. It was an uphill battle. Some TV segments simply cancelled their interviews with the Teves family over their request that the perpetrator’s photograph not be displayed during an interview with them. “I wish I had not done that,” Caren Teves says, believing now that their principled stance only served to silence them. “I would have still been able to talk about Alex and call them out, whether the picture was up or not.” Since 2012, the family has launched a campaign to prevent media coverage from playing into the perpetrators’ craving for fame by spreading the shooters’ photographs, focusing on body counts and ranking different shootings against each other. Over the past few years, the No Notoriety campaign has seen bipartisan progress, with endorsements from law enforcement groups and victims’ families, and some journalists pledging to abide by the principles of trying to use shooters’ names and images sparingly. Law enforcement officials in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last week announced they would follow a similar approach. “If you notice I use ‘shooter’ instead of the suspect’s name, we do not want to glorify him and what he’s done,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, said last week. Related: What do you want to know about America's gun crisis? But many media outlets still resist the “No Notoriety” principles, which Erik Wemple of the Washington Post has called “a public service, not some nefarious ‘glorification’ quest’”. Teves is scathing about the media’s refusal to change how they cover shootings. “Their argument boils down to: you’re not going to tell us what to do,” she says. “It’s a moneymaker for them. Sensationalism sells.” Today, she worries that the sheer horror of mass shootings is a barrier to Americans endorsing political change. “A lot of people don’t want to grasp it, because it’s that awful.” But if, after mass shootings 20 years ago, “we all stood up and said, ‘enough is enough,’ Alex would still be alive. He’d still be here.” Erica Lafferty was barely awake one morning at the beginning of last month when she saw a Facebook alert from a childhood friend who had recently moved to Las Vegas, marking herself “safe.” Lafferty called her immediately. The friend had wanted to go to the country music concert the Las Vegas shooter had targeted, but “It was sold out by the time she had tried to get tickets,” her friend told her. For Lafferty, the first hours after a mass shooting are the most excruciating. She knows that family members of the victims of a new attack are waiting, like she once did, for news, and “they’re still holding out this little bit of hope” that somehow their loved ones are still alive. Five years ago, her mother, Dawn Hochsprung, an elementary school principal in Connecticut, had been in a meeting when she heard gunshots. She came out into the school hallway and was immediately shot by a disturbed young man with a military-style rifle who had forced his way inside. Lafferty had to wait until until the early hours of the day after the shooting before she was finally told her mother had been murdered. After the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, the Obama administration endorsed a slate of gun control reforms, with the biggest push in favor of bipartisan legislation that would expand background check requirements on gun sales. The congressional vote on the background check legislation “was my biggest moment of hope”, and when it narrowly failed to get enough votes in the Senate, “also my biggest letdown”. She was devastated again after Hillary Clinton, whom she had enthusiastically supported, lost the 2016 presidential election. “Gun laws had been this taboo subject in politics for so long, and not only did we have our first woman presidential candidate, this woman was constantly talking about gun violence and how it’s plaguing our country and her actual plan to do something about it.” Asked what she thinks accounts for Clinton’s loss, she says, “I still don’t know. I feel like I lost all faith in humanity after that one.” Lafferty, who now works for advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, says she is comforted by the people who have made the issue a priority, even without being personally impacted by it. “If they can get up and do it out of the kindness of their hearts, I better be able to do it for my mother,” she says. After the mass shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando last year, Lafferty could not function. She lay on her couch, watched the news coverage, and cried. But this year, after Las Vegas, she felt stronger, and immediately began to work to respond to the shooting, and to rally other people to call and email their elected officials and get involved in fighting for tougher gun laws. “In the wake of the election, my anger is just a lot more intense than it used to be. I don’t have time to be sad,” she says. Damian Meins could just as easily not have been in the office that Wednesday afternoon. Retired and working a new job as an inspector with the San Bernardino health department, Meins was expecting to be out in the field until he got last-minute word that he had to come in to the Inland Regional Center for a meeting. Even still, with his wife battling a brutal case of the flu, he considered staying home before thinking better of it and going in. These are the types of “what ifs” that rack the minds of people like Tina Meins, Damian’s daughter: the small choices and facts of happenstance that place a loved one in the wrong place at precisely the wrong time. “That was tough to accept,” she said. “He shouldn’t have even really been there in the first place.” But he was there. According to Damian Meins’ co-workers, he had been standing by the Christmas tree at the office holiday party when two people entered the building with semi-automatic rifles and handguns, donning tactical gear and firing off rounds in rapid succession. They managed to kill 16, including Meins, and injure 24 before being gunned down by police in a shootout. Tina Meins, then 33, remembers showing up with the rest of her family a few hours after the news broke and being hustled off to the reunification center, which was set up a few blocks away from the site of the shooting. Busload after busload of survivors pulled into the location, each bringing with it a moment of hope followed by a little bit more dread. “Finally the last bus came and he wasn’t on it,” Meins says. “It’s really weird because you hold on to hope even if you know …” She pauses. “Even if you basically know, you hold on to hope until the very last second. “There’s obviously the emotional and psychological trauma of trying to deal with the fact that you no longer have a dad. But there’s also the logistical and practical side of you that thinks: ‘OK well. What does this mean? Financially is my mom going to be able to live in this house?’ … You find a different way to live but it takes a long time for things to even feel OK.” Part of that new life for Meins, her mother and her sister has been as advocates for what she calls commonsense gun control for things like universal background checks on gun purchases nationwide. “You kind of wonder with every passing shooting, what will be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back. They [Congress] have already had two people in their own ranks shot,” Meins says, referring to Steve Scalise and Gabrielle Giffords. “But I do feel some optimism that things will change eventually. I don’t think it’s a short path, but I think it’ll change eventually.” For Brandon Wolf, ever since he came to Orlando as a young man, the Pulse LGBT nightclub was a refuge, a safe haven. “Pulse was a place where I met people that were like me – that were young and had moved here in search of new things and to find themselves,” says Wolf, who was among the hundreds in the crowd the night that a gunman entered the club with an AR-15 and began firing indiscriminately at patrons. Wolf was in the bathroom getting ready to leave when he heard the first gunshots. He remembers seeing more than a dozen people frantically run into the bathroom and pin themselves back against the corner of the wall. “A few seconds after this group of people was the smell of gunsmoke … and you could almost get a hint of blood behind it.” Wolf and his now partner, Eric, made a split-second decision. They locked hands, ran out from the bathroom through the caustic plume of smoke until they saw an exit, then they kept running for several blocks until the panic and shock took over. “My legs were like cement and I couldn’t run any more and I just collapsed on the sidewalk,” Wolf says. It struck him that his close friends, Christopher “Drew” Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, were still inside. After a frantic and sleepless night, Wolf’s worst nightmare would be confirmed by law enforcement the day after the shooting. Leinonen and Guerrero were among the 49 killed in what was, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Wolf shut down. For days he could barely even make it out of bed. Even as he resumed work, he described living in a deep fog for months. “I was a zombie. I was going through the motions. I was making it happen but it was always on my mind.” It was largely through speaking up and out about his experiences that Wolf was able to start to rebuild a new normal. “Words are my coping mechanism. I use words to heal myself as much as to spread the message to other people.” Wolf says he has lost track of the number of speaking engagements and events he has attended in the wake of the shooting to lobby for gun control, which have included speaking on stage at the Democratic national convention and addressing January’s Women’s March in Washington DC. And as for how he feels in crowded places like nightclubs now: “I think it’s different for everyone, but I feel powerful. I feel emboldened to be able to go into a public space and be myself and not be afraid because, ultimately, that’s what he wanted,” Wolf said. “The person who did this to us, he wanted us to feel afraid. He wanted us to feel small, and so to be able to have that power back is really freeing for me.” The Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina is practically part of Malcolm Graham’s DNA. He was baptized there, he sang in the youth choir as a young man and watched a number of relatives get married there, too. “Emanuel was a part of my foundation and our foundation as a family. That was the family church,” Graham says. So it was no surprise to him when he discovered that his sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, was one of the nine people killed at Bible study when a gunman pulled out a pistol and began firing during a round of prayer. As is so often the case for the families of victims, Graham first learned about the shooting the way many Americans do: from the news. “I called Cynthia because she was well known in the community and she attended Emanuel so she was my source of information to find out what’s going on down there. “She didn’t answer. Then an hour went by and I started getting concerned.” Graham, then living in Charlotte, North Carolina, eventually got word from a niece that his sister was missing and that the family believed she had been at the Bible study. Malcolm, who knew a number of officials in Charleston law enforcement, learned from police that she had been killed before official word was released. “It was probably the most intense two weeks of my life because I lost my sister in a very public way, dealing with internal family issues and then feeling the obligation to talk about it publicly,” says Malcolm Graham. A veteran politician who had spent 16 years in elected office through 2014, Graham took on something of a spokesperson role for his family as questions from the press became a major part of their lives through the immediate aftermath and the two trials in which the shooter was found guilty and sentenced to death. Related: Inside the minds of American mass shooters “That was my therapy, if I can use that analogy,” Graham says. “She would want me to get out and and stand up for her and speak out for her so that’s just what I did.” In 2016, fueled in part by his sense of loss over his sister, Graham launched an unsuccessful bid for a US congressional seat. He hoped to use that position to advocate for “commonsense gun laws” and for families like his who have been forever changed by this type of violence. “It’s a strange fraternity to belong to, of people who’ve been wronged in such a public way,” Graham says. “When I saw Las Vegas and Orlando I could relate to how the families felt. I could relate to how the community was hurting. I could relate to people not understanding and asking the question why,” Graham says. “It’s awful for any community to have to bear that name: Charleston strong. Orlando strong. Las Vegas Strong.” Read more: • It’s time to end America’s gun violence epidemic.

For the first time since the mass shooting that took place during Jason Aldean's set at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, the country singer sat down with the Today Show on Tuesday morning (Nov. 14) to explain how he felt on that horrible night. Aldean described the moments leading up to him running off stage after he realized what was going on. “So when it first happened, I thought a speaker had blown is what I thought. It just sounded like a crackling something,"" he said. ""And so, you know, I’m kind of looking around like, 'What is that?' Trying to figure out what it is. Well then it stopped. So I was like, alright well they must have got it fixed. And so I kept doing my thing, and then it happened again and it lasted longer the second time."" Jason Aldean Aldean explained that as the sound continued, the reality of the situation did not hit him until he looked around to see where his guitarist was. ""So then I was actually kind of getting aggravated, so I looked over at my monitor guy that’s on the side of the stage as if to say, 'What is that?' And, 'fix it.' And when I turned to look my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, to 'let’s go,' and my security guy was running on stage telling me to run.” “It was so hectic, I mean you just, everybody was scrambling,"" Aldean said of the hectic moments that followed. ""You just didn’t know what was going on. It was just panic, is probably the best way I could describe it. I think everybody just kind of panicked and didn’t really know where to go or what to do, ‘cause I mean we’re not in that situation. I mean, I’ve never been in that situation before you know, and obviously nobody else out there had either. So it was just kind of crazy. Pandemonium.” The singer explained that seeing his family was his first priority after leaving Vegas, but that quickly leaving the area didn't give him time to properly process the trauma. Of course, as we have seen from the Nov. 12 Country Rising benefit show where he and some fellow country stars including Lady Antebellum, Sam Hunt, and more performed and raised $4 million for victims of this tragedy, as well as for hurricane relief - getting back to work was therapeutic. Aldean added, “Honestly being back onstage probably helped us more than anything.” Aldean has obviously been very moved by the tragedy -- which took the lives of 58 fans and injured more than 500 -- offering a bit of insight as to how the worst mass shooting in modern American history made him think about some of the political issues that arose in its wake regarding gun control. “I feel like at the end of the day there’s so much focus on you know, politics and race and all these other things that just, you know at the end of the day we’re all in this together,"" he said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time working on the issue that’s really the problem.” Of course, one of Aldean's first priorities is healing for himself, and for his fans - which he's tried to accomplish by returning to Vegas to visit those harmed at the festival.  ""I just hope everybody can start to heal and some of this stuff you never get over, but I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.” View the entire interview, below.

More than 20 years later, Tom Wheeler can still remember the sound that several thousand tons of aluminum train make when they crash into an abandoned vehicle. Wheeler, who would eventually serve as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Obama, was at the time working on the opposite end of the regulatory spectrum, as CEO of the cell phone lobbying group, CTIA. He was sitting in the office of then-FCC chairman Reed Hundt. On the desk between them sat an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. Hundt hit play, and urged Wheeler to listen closely. It was a recorded 9-1-1 call, in which a frantic woman reported being stuck in her car on the railroad tracks. She wasn’t sure of her exact location; she tried her best to describe her surroundings instead. Then came the train whistle. The woman rushed out of her car, moments before the train collided with it. “Reed turns to me and says, ‘We’re going to solve that problem. Your technology has got the ability to be located, and we’re going to solve that,’” Wheeler remembers. And he agreed. He just didn’t realize how long it would take to do it. Years later, FCC pass a rule in 1998, backed by the CTIA, that would require all wireless carriers to enable location tracking for 9-1-1 purposes. That landmark decision kickstarted a decades-long domino effect in which location-tracking abilities inside devices rapidly improved, relying first on the location of cellular towers and, eventually, on GPS. The technology advanced to the point where, today, your Uber driver not only knows what block you’re on, but whether to pick you up on the north or south side of the street. And yet, while the app economy has profited handsomely from these developments, they’ve gone woefully underutilized in emergency scenarios, particularly as it pertains to wireless emergency alerts, those push notifications that tell you when a flood or wildfire is heading your way. That’s partly because wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers have lobbied extensively against new forms of regulation. Earlier this month, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the commission would move forward with an Obama-era order calling for wireless carriers to pinpoint emergency alerts down to the cellular tower level. Until recently, these alerts have targeted entire counties, an area so vast that, typically, people either receive alerts that are irrelevant to them, or emergency managers forgo alerts altogether—with potentially disastrous consequences. The alerts will also include embeddable links that can redirect people to additional information. For public safety and communications experts, including Wheeler, these upgrades represent a crucial step in a multiyear battle with the cell phone industry. “It is great the FCC has announced they're going to do something,” Wheeler says. “Too bad it took tragedies to get that to happen.” Sonoma County stretches for 1,768 square miles. When wildfires swept wine country this fall, emergency managers had a choice: Send alerts to all of its roughly 500,000 citizens, or don't, to avoid mass panic and roads clogged with an unnecessary number of evacuees. They opted against. The fires engulfed the area, killing more than a dozen people in Sonoma alone. Sonoma State University President Judy Sakaki told the San Francisco Chronicle she ran out of her home in a bathrobe after waking up to find her house on fire. “There’s been a steady stream of stories about individuals in Sonoma County whose first signal they had to get out of the house right now was from a neighbor or a police officer coming to the house, or from the embers,” says Retired Admiral David Simpson, former chief of the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. After the wildfires, California senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein co-authored a letter urging Pai to update geotargeting requirements for emergency alerts. Hurricane Harvey's historic flooding confronted Harris County, Texas with a similar decision in August. In fact, weeks before Harvey touched down in Texas, one Harris County official warned the FCC that the local government rarely uses wireless emergency alerts, because “it does not want to potentially alert the entire county when a WEA message may only pertain to a certain portion of the county.” But while this year’s series of natural disasters painfully illustrate the need for more sophisticated targeting, the FCC and the wireless industry have known about the problem for years. According to Retired Admiral Jamie Barnett, who preceded Simpson at the FCC, the agency saw the potential for smartphones to improve emergency alerts as early as 2009, just two years after the iPhone debuted. “Even back then we knew that geotargeting could be done much better,” Barnett says. And yet, he notes, the wireless industry proved to be “reluctant partners.” 'If you can hail a ride using that part of the phone or order a pizza, of course we should be able to use that for something as worthy as microtargeting alerts.' Retired Admiral David Simpson Participating in the wireless emergency alert system is voluntary, but if carriers do agree to participate—and all of the major ones do—the FCC holds them to certain requirements. Time and again, the industry has argued that those requirements are technically unworkable. Apple has resisted device-based geo-targeting, urging the FCC to “carefully assess the feasibility of this approach.” AT&T, meanwhile, has warned the FCC that “imposing, and enforcing, unrealistic duties at exorbitant cost will jeopardize future voluntary commitments,” by the company and others in the industry. The CTIA has pushed back against the inclusion of clickable links, and against proposed FCC rules that would require multimedia content, including photos, to be embedded in alerts. In a petition to the order, the association called the changes “unnecessary and burdensome mandates that have not been studied,” and suggested that the industry’s voluntary participation hangs in the balance. Their fear, according to Matt Gerst, associate vice president of regulatory affairs at CTIA, is that local emergency alert managers are already inadequately trained in deploying alerts efficiently. Adding additional media to alerts, he argues, could do more harm than good. ""We were concerned about things like network congestion,"" he says. ""All of a sudden you can have a lot of people downloading a lot of data."" And yet, in the wake of recent, high-profile failures of the existing system, the five major carriers—AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon—have all begun supporting links in alerts, and allowing emergency managers to more narrowly target those alerts. “People’s continuing experience with location services in the commercial arena really is raising the expectations legitimately,” Simpson says. “As consumers get greater functionality and wireless carriers make money on that functionality, if they don’t also do the right thing for public safety, they’re going to get called out on that.” This also means, he argues, that the FCC could go even further in pushing wireless carriers and device manufacturers to improve upon emergency alerts. By utilizing the same triangulating technology that Uber uses to figure out exactly where you’re standing on a crowded corner, carriers could, say, pinpoint where potential victims are inside a building in the event of a mass shooting. Emergency responders could then send targeted instructions to people in one part of a building and a different message to people in another. Recommended Issie Lapowsky Brian Barrett Issie Lapowsky “If you can hail a ride using that part of the phone or order a pizza, of course we should be able to use that for something as worthy as microtargeting alerts,” Simpson says. The FCC has also floated proposed rules that would require carriers to send alerts in different languages and support multimedia alerts. Of course, none of these improvements will matter unless local governments decide to use them. According to Simpson, only 20 percent of local jurisdictions today are registered with the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System today. That's one reason why Gerst says alerts are often used ineffectively—or not used at all—because community leaders remain unaware of how the technology can be used. Now that the FCC has encoded these capabilities into its rules, it will be up to local governments to use them to their advantage. They have fewer excuses than ever for leaving their constituencies stuck on a proverbial railroad track, the next train barreling down. WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

The lack of congressional action has prompted outrage, despair and a sense that the gun debate is intractable.  But outside Washington, at the state and local level, the fight to prevent gun violence is anything but over. Here are 10 victories since 2013 in the fight to prevent gun deaths and save lives – including a major effort led by the gun industry itself. Laws designed to keep guns away from domestic abusers have advanced across the country since 2013, including in conservative states such as Alabama, Louisiana, Utah, North Dakota and South Carolina. In some cases, the National Rifle Association has quietly supported the legislation, marking a rare point of bipartisan agreement on laws that multiple studies have found prevent murders and save lives. In a single week in 2009, a gun store in New Hampshire sold three guns to people who used them to commit suicide. Shaken, the gun store’s owner teamed up with mental health and suicide prevention experts to develop the Gun Shop Project, an effort to educate gun store workers and customers about what they can do to prevent gun suicide, which claims more than 20,000 American lives a year. Variations on the model have spread nationwide. Early this year, the approach got a major endorsement from the gun industry’s association, which announced it was partnering with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, hoping to save thousands of lives through education and outreach. As one gun rights advocate in Vermont put it: “This is not an anti-gun or a veiled anti-gun campaign – this is strictly us helping ourselves.” In early 2013, the pastor Michael McBride led a group black ministers to Washington to press, unsuccessfully, for the Obama administration to make a major investment in  preventing gun violence among young men of color. The Live Free Campaign argues that tougher gun laws alone are not enough: violence prevention also requires criminal justice reform, police reform and community-based strategies. The campaign received a $2m boost from Google.org this summer, with some of the funding going to community efforts in eight cities, including San Bernardino, which suffered from everyday gun violence long before it became famous as the site of a mass shooting. “People are starting to see that we can prevent gun violence in urban communities, which have the largest share of homicides, without getting bogged down in a second amendment fight,” McBride said. Weeks before he murdered six people and injured 13 more in a rampage across a California college town, Elliot Rodger received a visit from local law enforcement. His mother had seen the disturbing videos he posted on YouTube and requested a welfare check. Rodger would write about the incident later, noting that he had firearms hidden in his apartment. The local sheriff’s department would defend its officers’ lack of options in dealing with an apparently calm, polite young man. Later that year, California passed a law creating a “gun violence restraining order”, which gives family members and law enforcement a way to petition a judge to temporarily bar a high-risk person from owning or buying firearms. Washington passed a similar law last year and advocates have launched a joint effort this year across 20 states to pass similar extreme risk protection order laws. In 2011, a gun control group analyzed the records in the national background check system, and found that 23 states had submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the federal database – and some had submitted none at all. This meant, as happened with the Sutherland Spring shooter this month, that high-risk people disqualified from legally owning guns were still able to walk into gun stores and buy them. Today, the number of mental health records in the database has nearly quadrupled, and, as of last year, only three states – Montana, Wyoming and New Hampshire – had submitted fewer than 100 records, according to William Rosen, the deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety. More effort is still needed. The Department of Defense is investigating whether the air force’s failure to submit the Sutherland Springs shooter’s domestic violence record was part of a broader problem in military reporting. After a pilot program funded by the justice department showed promising results, New York City invested $12.7m in expanding a strategy that uses neighborhood “violence interrupters” to monitor and defuse conflicts before they turn fatal. An in-depth evaluation of this “Cure Violence” approach, which tries to work directly with the people at highest risk, found steeper declines in violence in neighborhoods with the program than without it. The program is now active at 18 sites as part of a broader violence prevention strategy. New York City saw shootings hit a record low in 2016. Sandy Hook Promise, a not-for-profit group formed by family members of some of the victims of the 2012 shooting, has developed free training programs to help schoolchildren and adults recognize the signs of at-risk behavior and know how to respond. More than 2 million students and adults have taken part, including students in large public school districts in Miami and Los Angeles. After Sandy Hook, parents of the children murdered joined with the Obama administration to make a major push to close loopholes in the national requirements for conducting background checks on gun buyers. Despite support from a majority of the Senate, the legislation failed. Since then, 10 states have passed universal background checks or expanded background check requirements, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, part of a laborious, costly effort to close the federal loopholes one state at a time. What safety benefit these new laws have had at the state level alone is not yet clear: a new study found that in at least two states, the new laws had little measurable effect, probably due to a lack of enforcement and the failure of citizens to comply with the new regulations. In Nevada, the new background check law passed last year has yet to be enforced, sparking a standoff between gun control advocates and the state’s Republican attorney general, an NRA ally. It’s hard to ban any kind of gun or firearms accessory in the US – even “bump stocks”, a dangerous toy with zero self-defense value that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired more quickly, mimicking fully automatic fire. After the Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in modern American history, officials said the shooter had multiple bump stocks. Some congressional Republicans and even the NRA said they would consider tougher regulation of the gimmicky device. But bump stock ban legislation went nowhere, even as the company that manufactured the devices announced it was accepting new orders. Massachusetts became the first state since the Las Vegas shooting to ban the device. One way that new gun control advocates found quick wins in the months after national reform failed in 2013 was to focus on pressuring corporations to oppose gun-carrying in their stores. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has celebrated Starbucks, Chipotle, Target and other stores for asking customers not to bring guns into their stores (with the exception of law enforcement officers). As Starbucks’ CEO put it, this is “a request and not an outright ban”, but the consumer battles have given gun control advocates a symbolic way to respond to the expansion of America’s gun-carrying culture.",2017-11-14 02:00:24,10 gun violence prevention victories since Sandy Hook,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

50,https://www.inquisitr.com/4622759/carrie-underwood-no-longer-inducted-oklahoma-hall-of-fame/,"Carrie Underwood will reportedly no longer be inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame this week after suffering a fall outside her home near Nashville, Tennessee. Though Carrie was set to be inducted into the Hall of Fame this week by fellow Okie and country music star Vince Gill, because she can no longer attend the ceremony, her induction has now seemingly been revoked. According to News OK, after Underwood suffered a broken wrist and a number of other injuries following her nasty fall, she's now unable to attend the ceremony in her home state this week, and as a result, she will not be inducted with the Oklahoma Hall of Fame's 90th class at all this year. A spokesperson for the organization confirmed that Carrie's inability to return home to Oklahoma City from Tennessee means the honor won't be handed out in her absence and suggested that she will now need to be considered again by the committee in order to be inducted in the future. ""First and foremost, we want Carrie Underwood to know our thoughts and prayers are with her during her recovery,"" said Oklahoma Hall of Fame President and CEO Shannon L. Rich in a statement issued to News OK. ""She exemplifies the very definition of an Oklahoma Hall of Fame Honoree and we are certain that she will be considered for future induction."" [Image by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images] The outlet then noted that Carrie, who was born in Muskogee but lived in nearby Checotah until finding fame on American Idol in 2004, ""will be eligible to be nominated again and considered for induction in a future class."" It's not clear exactly why Underwood's absence means she now won't be inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside the class of 2017, though fans of the seven-time Grammy winner made it pretty clear they were not happy about the rules that mean the star won't receive the honor this year due to her inability to travel. ""A person gets injured so Oklahoma revokes their hall of fame induction? Nice & compassionate,"" @maddkat57 responded to the report, while another Twitter user added, ""Makes no sense why she isn't receiving the award anyway. Have to be considered again? Why?? She had better be inducted next year!""""Wait. What?"" tweeted another after hearing that the star will not be inducted this year. ""So you don't attend, then you don't get inducted and have to be considered again? Does that sound crazy?"" Carrie also canceled her scheduled performance at the Nashville Rising benefit, which took place on November 12, after her injuries were revealed. The concert raised funds for those affected by a number of recent disasters, including the Las Vegas mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest festival in October and the recent natural disasters in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Underwood hasn't responded to the organization's decision not to honor her this year but took to Twitter on November 11 to thank fans for the well wishes following her fall, which took place on the evening on November 10, but Carrie said that she would need a little time to recover from the accident. [Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for CMT] ""Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody... I'll be alright... might just take some time,"" she tweeted, just days after co-hosting the 2017 CMA Awards with Brad Paisley for their tenth straight year.

Welcome to the christofascist world. I decided to run this story because I see a variant of it going on in Alabama with the Moore/Jones election. My view of the election is that this is where the state of Alabama defines itself. The people of that state are going to speak. I think we should all listen. This is the Great Schism Trend, and it is shaping America. Alex Jones Alex Jones, the tinfoil-hat creator of the conspiracy outlet Infowars, claimed there was “no doubt” that the mass shooting at a Texas church that killed 26 people last weekend was “staged.” Jones was joined by Shepard Ambellas, editor-in-chief of the conspiracy theory site Intellihub, on air today to further Infowars’ dissection of the Texas church shooting, which has so far included theories that news media gave the shooter “permission” to kill, that the far-left group Antifa was responsible, and that the shooter was under “mind control” from the “deep state.” Jones expanded on his prior theories to claim that the shooting was staged by forces who want to embarrass the president. “There’s a civil war going on the embarrass Trump. I mean, no doubt this is staged,” Jones said. “And the media is going to spin it and say I said it didn’t happen. That’s not what I said. They let him out of that mental institution when he was planning to kill his command chain. They let him go. They knew.” Ambellas agreed and told Jones, “They let it all fall through the cracks and then they use it to their advantages.”… Comments are closed.",2017-11-14 05:32:46,Alex Jones Claims Texas Church Shooting Was ‘Staged’ To Embarrass Trump,,300516,http://www.schwartzreport.net/

54,http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/492461552/0/alternet_all,"Just days after the mass shooting at a Texas church, the Michigan Senate voted to allow people to carry guns in schools, churches, daycare centers, preschools and hospitals. The bills had been up for consideration last month when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas. Senator Arlen Meekhoff, who sponsored the legislation, called the timing “awkward.” In a year that has already seen 307 mass shootings, turns out it’s nearly always an awkward time to pass ever looser gun laws. The legislation has parents alarmed about the safety of their children, and educators concerned about what allowing guns into schools will do to the learning environment. The showdown over what some are calling “Pistols in Preschools” is just the latest battle between Michigan schools and gun-rights advocates. Last year, Ann Arbor Public Schools took a challenge to its gun-free zone from a gun-toting parent to the Michigan Court of Appeals and won the right to prohibit guns in their schools. Earlier this year, with that legal precedent, Kalamazoo Public Schools followed by instating their own gun-free policy in all of the buildings in their district. So much for local control Ironically, while Republican ideology lauds local control, these bills would strip authority from local school districts in Michigan, and force them to concede to guns in their school buildings. Meanwhile, voters who go in search of information from their representatives, including tallies of how many constituents called or wrote their senator in opposition to the bills versus how many called or wrote in support of them, are likely to be disappointed.That's because Michigan is one of only two states that exempts the state legislature from disclosing records and communication. If the comments on 20th District Senator, Margaret O'Brien's Facebook page are any indication, her constituency was overwhelmingly opposed. On the same day that she voted in support of the bills, O'Brien posted information on her Facebook page about an active shooter preparedness event. The comments section contained dozens of angry replies, along with a handful of supporters. Notably, Kalamazoo, which is part of O’Brien’s district, experienced a mass shooting last year which left six people dead and two more seriously injured. Educators on edge While the bills must pass the GOP-controlled House and be signed into law by the governor before going into affect, Michigan educators are already feeling uneasy. Carey Gardner is a middle-school behavior specialist in the Kalamazoo Public Schools, a district where officials have been outspoken about the need to keep guns out of schools. Gardner says she understands why people could feel like guns in schools might make people feel safer. “You have people who are faced with a shooter and they have nothing. I mean, they're at their mercy,” she says. But she says the idea of having guns in school buildings is scary and intimidating and sends the wrong message. “I think I could speak for everybody without even talking to anyone, we would all be on edge at some point. Because we don't know everybody's history,” Gardner says. “What if a student comes behind me and was to pull something, whether it was from myself or from a coworker? Or we have a parent that comes up, or parents that come up that are aggressive and agitated and frustrated? How do we know if a person's going to be too quick to react because they're scared?” Gardner imagines a school environment that turns into the Wild West with shootouts in the building. With the presence of guns or even the mere wondering about who has guns, Gardner sees the inevitability of someone getting hurt. Her concern is backed up by data. Recently NPR reported on the work of Stanford law professor John Donohue. His research on three decades of data around right-to-carry laws has found that as concealed carry rates increase, the rates of violent crimes also increase. On average, 93 people are killed by guns in the U.S. each day, and the U.S. gun homicide rate is 25 times the average of other high income countries. Gardner says that not knowing whether or not people in her school building were carrying guns would change the culture and the climate of the building. “It's supposed to be your safe haven, your safe place, where you learn your social skills and academically, and it changes the whole dynamic of the culture of the school.” Wild West worries Brandi is a special education resource room teacher in a Michigan elementary school (she asked to be identified only by her first name). Brandi says she and her coworkers already feel the tension of the possibility of an active shooter. Their first back-to-school staff meeting of the year involved a presentation about active shooter preparedness that included audio from a teacher's phone call during the Columbine shootings. “It was sobering and difficult to hear. But I wouldn't say it makes a difference on how we do our day-to-day activities,” she says. That's because teachers in her building, like everywhere else in the state, are juggling so many things already that trying to be constantly vigilant about the possibility of an active shooter is next to impossible. Brandi works in an older school building that makes it hard to comply with building security. Sure, doors are locked and people need to be buzzed into the building, but, she says, office staff members are busy and can't guard the door, so once buzzed in, it's mostly like an honor system for visitors to come directly to the office. “As a staff we are expected to stop people in the hallways if they are not wearing a visitor's pass and ask them to return to the office, but I know that I've felt uncomfortable doing that and have not stopped people, nor have other staff members. The teachers are supposed to cover the windows on classroom doors (so an active shooter could not see in), and keep doors locked at all times, but many do not,” Brandi says. Teachers are already being asked to simultaneously be instructors and building security guards—jobs with completely different skill sets. Brandi says she's never been a proponent of giving more people guns to combat other people with guns, but especially not in a school full of children. “I know I personally would not be physically stable enough to handle a gun properly, and I don't really trust another random citizen to do the same. I would personally rather see buildings made more secure and providing teachers and classrooms with non-violent tools (e.g. for barricading doors) than adding more gunfire to a combative situation.” Neither Brandi nor Gardner feel like they have a solution for gun violence in the country or in schools, but they both agree that having guns in schools is not the answer. “Having more people with guns to fight other people with guns sounds like a war zone, not a school,” says Brandi.

Authorities have not named the shooter but said he was killed by law enforcement officers after firing shots in numerous places in a rural area in northern California, including Tehama elementary school. “It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets,” said assistant sheriff Phil Johnston, the Associated Press reported. Two hospitals were treating a total of seven people, including at least three children, according to the AP, which reported that one student was wounded at the school and another child and a woman were hit while driving. Officials said there were calls of “multiple shots fired” around 8am local time in Rancho Tehama, an area three hours north of San Francisco. “That evolved to multiple victims and multiple shots at the elementary school,” Johnston told reporters earlier.

We have the children that were attending school in a safe location. “We are spread thin,” he said. Johnston also told reporters that he was “aware” of a domestic violence incident involving the suspect, which neighbors had reported. Authorities said they recovered a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns. The shooting happened the same day that family members of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims were in court in a case challenging gun companies for marketing and selling an AR-15-style rifle. That weapon was used to kill 20 children and six adults in December 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, in one of the worst mass shootings in America. The families face an uphill battle due to a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from liability when their weapons are misused by criminals. The northern California shooting happened less than two weeks after a gunman used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 25 people, including many children, at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In Las Vegas weeks earlier, 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.",2017-11-14 14:45:15,California shooting: at least three dead as children wounded at school – police,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
56,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/492456166/0/milwaukee/home~Gunman-kills-at-least-wounds-in-Northern-California/,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — An apparent felon who had been shooting hundreds of rounds of bullets in recent days in a small community in Northern California began firing at random Tuesday, killing at least four people and wounding 10 others. The gunman shot at people and property in at least seven locations, said Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston. He called the incident a ""bizarre and murderous rampage."" Johnston confirmed two children were shot and wounded in the shooting at Rancho Tehama subdivision, but said children were not among the dead. He said the motive ""looks like a guy trying to get even with his neighbor."" The Sacramento Bee and members of the Rancho Tehama subdivision identified the gunman as Kevin Janson Neal, 43. The rampage began shortly after 8 a.m. PT near Bobcat and Fawn lanes when the gunman stole a car. He crashed the car, and a man stopped to ask whether he was OK, Johnston said. The suspect shot at that man but didn't hit him. He did steal his vehicle. Johnston said officials at Rancho Tehama Elementary School heard gunfire and immediately locked down the facility. He says it was “monumental” that school workers took the action they did, and he had no doubt they saved children's lives. The school was the shooter's third stop, and he became frustrated when he couldn't get into the school, Johnston said. The gunman shot 20 to 30 rounds at the school, and went into a bathroom, the only part of the school not locked down. Coy Ferreira told KRCR-TV that he was dropping off his daughter for kindergarten when gunfire erupted and a secretary ran out and yelled for the kids to race inside. Ferreira says he wound up in a classroom where 14 students cowered under desks while shots rang out for what seemed nearly a half-hour. He says some bullets hit the windows and a boy was shot in the chest and foot. His family told KRCR-TV that he was in critical condition. The gunman was at the school for six minutes, then drove off and continued to shoot at people in various parts of the community, including at a pickup with a woman and two children inside. The woman was seriously injured, and one child received minor injuries. Law enforcement saw the suspect shooting at the pickup and gave chase, ramming his vehicle and forcing it off the road before two deputies killed him in a shootout. Johnston said the deputies, who weren't injured, found the gunman dead inside a car. They also found the semiautomatic rifle and two handguns they say he used. A second long gun was also recovered. One of the long guns was an AR-15, Johnston said. The entire incident lasted 45 minutes. ► Tuesday: Mass killings prompt college to drop mascot's name, Shooter► Sunday: Texas church members gather for first service after mass shooting► Friday: 'Guns don't kill people; men and boys kill people,' experts say ""This man was very, very intent on completing what he set out to do today,"" Johnston said. ""The shooter was bent on killing and shooting people at random."" Rancho Tehama resident Salvador Tello said he was taking his three children to school when the gunman fired at a truck in front of him. Tello saw bullets hit the truck, so he made his children get down and put his own truck in reverse, he said. As he left, he saw a woman lying in the street with her husband next to her. The 10 wounded were taken to various hospitals around the area: Three to Mercy Medical Center in Redding, two to St. Elizabeth Community Hospital in Red Bluff and five — three of whom were treated and released — to Enloe Medical Center in Chico, employees at those hospitals said. One of those patients was transferred to University of California-Davis Medical Center, a spokesperson there said. Deputies escorted a busload of students from the school, which houses about 100 kindergarteners to fifth-graders, to a safer location, the Rancho Tehama Association community building less than a mile away. No students or staff were killed, said Superintendent Rich DuVarney of the county education department. Joseph Raven was doing tile work with a co-worker at a Rancho Tehama home when the shooting started.""We heard the bullets fly right next to our ears,"" Raven said. ""There were screams: a female screaming, a male screaming. There were helicopters all over the place."" Brian Flint said he got a call in the morning that his roommate was injured and that his truck had been stolen. It turned out his neighbor was the gunman. “The crazy thing is that the neighbor has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines,” Flint said. “We made it aware that this guy is crazy and he’s been threatening us.” Living near the gunman was ""hell,"" Flint said, adding he was a known felon who often harassed Flint and his neighbors. The exact motive remains unclear, but officials at an afternoon press conference said Neal had a history of problems with neighbors. Neal had been arrested in January for stabbing a woman and robbing another woman, both of whom obtained restraining orders against him. Johnston said the woman Neal stabbed was killed in Tuesday's rampage. Neal was released on $160,000 bail after that arrest. Prosecutors also alleged Neal fired a gun — possibly an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle — during the attack, according to court documents. The rifle was specifically mentioned as illegal in a criminal complaint filed earlier this year. Police declined to identify the shooter until his relatives are notified but confirmed the same man was charged with the January assault. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee the man in that case is Kevin Neal. Court records also show Neal had misdemeanor hit-and-run case in 2013. ► Thursday: Shootings ramp up pressure for NRA-backed concealed-carry gun bill► Nov. 6: In a world that no longer feels safe, how do we cope? The FBI was sending teams to assist Tehama County investigators, said Jason Wandel, chief division counsel at the FBI's Sacramento field office. State Sen. Jim Nielsen, a Republican from Gerber, Calif., whose district includes Rancho Tehama, called the incident ""senseless violence."" Other politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, also offered their condolences. Corning Union Elementary School District released a statement Tuesday evening saying that all Rancho Tehama students and staff had been accounted for and that the school would be closed until law enforcement completed an investigation and repairs could be made to the building. ""School staff is commended for their courageous and professional response to this terrible incident,"" the statement read.

Tuesday wasn't the first time the Rancho Tehama school had a gun scare. In December 2015, a then-43-year-old woman was arrested after a school employee called law enforcement because she allegedly was walking around with a sawed-off shotgun. The woman also was arrested, in part, because deputies said they found a stolen pickup in her yard. Rancho Tehama Reserve, a subdivision that is home to almost 1,500 people, is described on its website as a “quiet private country community” located 12 miles west of Interstate 5 and about 110 miles northwest of Sacramento. In 2010, more than 86% of the community's residents were white, and Rancho Tehama's poverty rate was 43%, according to Census Bureau data from 2010. The property Neal lived at is a collection of mobile homes scattered around a home. Google Earth images show numerous marijuana grows in the neighborhood. Rosie DeOliveira, administrative assistant at the association, said deputies for much of the morning had instructed the community, including the elementary school and airport, to shelter in place and stay low. ""Our doors are locked,"" she said. Contributing: The Associated Press.

We need leaders to embrace sustainable solutions Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST Like all Americans, I am devastated by the senseless massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that claimed the lives of 25 people, including 14 children. The idea that anyone could intentionally plan to kill and hurt so many people is impossible to comprehend. The anguish, shock and heartbreak felt by the victims’ families, survivors and their entire community is impossible for most people to imagine.  Sadly, I can not only imagine it, I live with it every day. It has been almost five years since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school that also took the lives of 26 innocent people, including my six-year-old son Dylan and 19 of his first-grade classmates. The pain of his loss, especially to such a senseless and preventable act of gun violence, is with me every day, but it is also what compels me to find and deliver solutions that help prevent future loss of life. Unfortunately, we as a country deal with loss of life to gun violence far too often. It has become rampant, an epidemic that no other country experiences. Two of the five deadliest US shootings in modern history happened in the last 35 days. After every mass shooting, I hear arguments that have become all too familiar to me since Sandy Hook. Some argue for “gun control” or “gun freedom”. Others like me aren’t arguing about the gun, but are rather focusing on the person behind the gun and how their violent actions could have been prevented. As quickly as the debate about guns starts, it ends. These horrific attacks fade from the news headlines quickly, and over and over we are told ‘Now is not the time to talk about gun violence.’ The time to talk about gun violence is long past for the 25 in Texas, the 58 in Las Vegas, the 49 in Orlando, the 26 in Newtown, the 32 in Virginia, and the thousands of others who die from gun violence every year. The time to act is now. After the Texas shooting, President Trump said that this isn’t a “guns situation” but that “mental health is the problem”, and that a “very deranged individual” brought this horrific act of violence to First Baptist church in Sutherland Springs. Not only is this immensely stigmatizing language, it’s not wholly truthful. Millions of Americans live with mental health conditions daily and live healthy, prosperous, violence-free lives. People who live with severe mental health conditions are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrate it, and are more likely to hurt themselves rather than hurt others. In fact, mental illness contributes to less than 6% of gun violence. The truth is that mismanaged and uninterrupted fear and anger, coupled with nearly unfettered access to guns is what happened in Texas, and sadly in most mass shootings. It’s fear and anger that often escalates to a point at which the person sees no other path ahead of them except for self-harm or violence to others. Often, shooters give off warning signs that are either missed, misunderstood, or ignored. These tragedies could have been prevented if someone had recognized the signs and made an intervention. We know the shooter in Sutherland Springs had been jailed for assault against his wife and child, and that he sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, had a fascination with guns and other shootings, and should not have been able to pass a background check. Though there was an oversight by a number of parties, and policy failures along the way, the truth is that this shooter could have gotten a gun via a private or online sale in Texas, whether or not his records were correctly sent to NICS. Once again, the signs and signals were there but missed – another preventable tragedy. Citizens alone can do a lot within their own community to know the signs and take action to intervene before violence takes place. But there is also much that federal and state legislation can do to prevent violence. I am asking you, Mr President, to use your influence to create more meaningful and sustainable solutions. You, along with Congress, have the power to save lives of thousands of Americans and make our country safe again. You have the power to nationalize intervention programs that will train youth and adults how to recognize the signs and signals of individuals at-risk of violence. You also have the means to put pressure on states to comply with laws that help protect their citizens. Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) are one way to protect families and communities from gun violence. With ERPOs in place, family members or local law enforcement can support someone who is adjudicated as at-risk to themselves or others – as in the case of domestic violence, suicide or homicide – and temporarily remove their access to firearms and block attempted purchases until they are no longer a risk. ERPOs have been proven to save lives and to protect due process and second amendment rights. ERPOs are established and have been successfully managed by several states including California, Oregon, Washington and Connecticut. Extreme Risk Protection Orders are legislation both Republicans and Democrats can, and should, support. The federal government should be doing everything it can to encourage states to enact such legislation that’s been proven to save lives, using the carrot or stick of federal grant money. Historically, when the president and Congress have wanted to mandate national safety rules, like a highway speed limit or minimum drinking age, it has used the power of the purse, making funding contingent on states taking certain actions. So, if the government is serious about combatting gun violence, it should put its influence where its money is. Use federal public safety grants – like highway or law enforcement funding – as a carrot to incentivize states to pass ERPOs. In the end, everyone wins – the federal government gets states to do what it wants, the states get the money they need, and people’s lives will be saved by a commonsense law. There is proof that this approach has worked not only to ensure state compliance, but to save lives. In 1974, when the president and Congress set the national speed limit at 55 miles per hour, road fatalities declined 16.4% in just one year. In 1984, Congress proposed cutting 10% of federal highway funds to states that did not comply with a new national drinking age of 21. President Reagan said, “In a case like this, where the problem is so clearcut and the benefits are so clearcut, then I have no misgivings about a judicious use of federal inducements to encourage the states to get moving, raise the drinking age, and save precious lives.” According to the NIH, drunk-driving accidents have dropped by 50% since the law was passed. Please, Mr President. Refuse to accept these national tragedies as the norm in America. Refuse to stop progress and prevention by remaining silent. Refuse to be part of an endless debate that goes nowhere but leaves more death and grieving families every day. Help stop gun violence before it starts and let this be part of your legacy of protecting American lives.",2017-11-15 02:03:03,"President Trump, please listen to a Sandy Hook mom on gun reform | Nicole Hockley",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

61,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/DNYjDJqIqSg/,"President Trump appeared to tweet condolences to victims of the wrong shooting late Tuesday night, after a gunman killed four people in northern California. A gunman opened fire on the small town of Rancho Tehama Reserve, which is about 130 miles from Sacramento, and fired off shots at four separate locations including an elementary school. At least four people were killed and 10 were injured in the attack, where the shooter appeared to target people at random, according to local authorities. The gunman was later shot dead by law enforcement. But instead of tweeting condolences to the small California town, Trump tweeted late Tuesday night: “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.” Seven hours later, the tweet was still online. Sutherland Springs, Texas was the site of a shooting two weeks ago. On Nov. 5, a gunman opened fire inside a church — killing 26 people in what is now the deadliest mass shooting at a house of worship. Shortly after the shooting, Trump tweeted his condolences using very similar language to his tweet Tuesday night. “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan,” he wrote two weeks ago. Social media users were quick to point out Trump’s apparent mistake — chiding him for conflating two separate shootings. Some were quick to draw comparisons between Trump’s gaffe and the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. “Pretty sad when there are so many mass shootings that you just use the same generic tweet to respond to them all,” one Twitter user wrote. “That was last week’s mass shooting dude,” another tweeted. The shooting at the Sutherland Springs church happened about a month after a lone gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas, which became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Both the Las Vegas massacre and the Texas church shooting are among the five deadliest mass shootings in modern American history.

62,https://www.inquisitr.com/4624659/trump-twitter-mistake-trump-tweets-about-wrong-mass-shooting-on-tuesday-november-14-calls-cnn-loser/,"On November 5, President Donald Trump published a tweet on his official Twitter page, offering sympathy to the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. In the wake of the mass church shooting, the tweet seemed an appropriate expression of condolence offered by Trump as he wrote that he was keeping an eye on the situation from Japan.""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""Perhaps that's why Trump's Twitter followers were surprised when Trump tweeted a similar message, which has been deleted from Trump's Twitter account, but can still be viewed via Google's cache of the tweet as of this writing.""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.""Trump's Twitter mistake gained thousands of likes and retweets before being deleted, as the comment section filled with notions of people wondering if Trump simply copied and pasted his Twitter message and simply removed the part about monitoring the shooting from Japan. Comments like those listed below began to fill Trump's Twitter page prior to the error being removed from Twitter.""Did u just copy & paste this & forget to change the city?"" [Image by Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images] ""I think that is EXACTLY what happened."" ""I'm surprised that his staff haven't removed this yet to correct it. They must be asleep."" ""Honestly I am too. U would think someone would have had to have noticed it. It's 100% a mistake, there's no denying it."" ""In their defense, babysitting his Twitter acct 24/7 is an exhausting job. They need their sleep."" ""No doubt about it. It's like a 5 person job."" ""Trump just tweeted about the wrong mass shooting..."" ""The people of Sutherland Springs' probably didn't want to be back in the news as the subjects of your latest dotardedness."" ""Sad that the template has to be changed. That's a lot of editing for one person."" ""Whaaat? That was like 2 weeks ago.""The ribbing about Trump's Twitter mistake continued, as Newser noted that Trump was potentially jet-lagged when he arrived back in the U.S. on Tuesday and immediately took to Twitter to make the big error. The publication noted that it was close to midnight when President Trump took to Twitter to publish condolences to victims of the wrong mass shooting, however, the tweet has a timestamp of 8:34 p.m. Trump is believed to have been attempting to publish his thoughts about the mass shooting on Tuesday, which took place in northern California, as reported by Newser. The Twitter mistake caused confusion and prompted the speculation that Trump may use a standard template about what to write when a mass shooting happens, wherein Trump simply changes the location of the shooting and the wording, as reported by People. Meanwhile, as if to cover up or divert from his Twitter mistake directed to the victims of the mass shooting in the Sutherland Springs church on November 5, Trump turned his Twitter attention to CNN. As seen in the below tweet, Trump claimed that he was forced to watch CNN whilst traveling overseas and as a result, the leader of the free world dubbed CNN a ""loser!""[Featured Image by Alex Wong/Getty Images]",2017-11-15 08:52:01,"Trump&#8217;s Twitter Mistake: Trump Tweets About Wrong Mass Shooting On Tuesday, November 14 &#8211; Calls CNN &#8216;Loser!&#8217;",,26924,http://www.inquisitr.com

66,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-northern-california-shooting-huppke-20171115-story.html,"I’m not going to bring up gun control. We’re still under the “too soon” rule from last week’s massacre during Sunday service at a Texas church, so it’s certainly too soon to talk about guns in connection to Tuesday’s shooting spree. Maybe you didn’t hear about that one — such things tend to come and go with little fanfare these days. It happened in Northern California. A man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns started randomly shooting people all over a small town, including at an elementary school. Five people were killed and at least two children were wounded, one of them at the school. There’s no motive yet, just reports of a neighborhood dispute. Phil Johnston, assistant sheriff of Tehama County, told reporters: “This is an individual that armed himself with the motive of getting even with his neighbor and just went on a rampage. I don’t know how to describe it to you any different.” Maybe that’s because these tragedies all start to sound the same: some random guy; an inexplicable outburst of violence; lives shattered. Remember, I’m keeping quiet about the firearms. One has to be respectful. Instead, I’m going to talk about mental health. The wise folks, the ones who tell us guns aren’t the problem when it comes to a Texan shooting 26 people to death in a church or a Nevadan opening fire from a hotel window in Las Vegas and killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, say mass shootings are a mental health issue. Period. I’m inclined to agree with that, except for the “period” part. There’s more than that to blame, but it involves something I’m not talking about right now because it’s too soon. So let’s just say mental health is a factor when it comes to murderous rampages. Law enforcement officials say the Northern California shooter tried to get into the elementary school to shoot more kids but was stopped because the school was on lockdown. Nobody’s going to convince me a person capable of such a thing is sane. So we have a mental health problem in this country. We’re reminded of that after every mass shooting. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle extend their thoughts and prayers, those who line their pockets with cash from the National Rifle Association say guns aren’t the problem and everyone brings up mental health and says it must be addressed. But it doesn’t get addressed, at least not in any significant way. Nothing changes with that other thing — the one that it’s too soon to speak about — either, but since there seems to be agreement on the mental health issue, let me ask this: Why no action? It feels like we’re being played. A New York Times story from September 2013, in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, read: “Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.” Yeah, that didn’t really go anywhere. Republicans worried it might be a back door to tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and Democrats worried Republicans might use it as an excuse to not pass tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and everyone just gave up and started waiting for the next mass shooting to roll around. Tragedy. Outrage. Too soon. Mental health reform. Nothing. Repeat. It has been only a month and a half since the Las Vegas massacre, which was followed by the Texas church shooting and now this shooting spree in California. That’s 89 people dead and hundreds injured. If we’re going to declare mental health the real problem behind these shootings, it seems fair to say America is facing a mental health crisis. What has happened this year, as bodies continue to hit the ground at concerts and in churches and elementary schools, is this: Republican lawmakers tried to repeal Obamacare, proposing a phaseout of the law’s Medicaid expansion that provides mental health care for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The law also makes employer health care plans cover mental health services on the same level as medical services. Obamacare repeal failed, but now Republicans are trying to push through a tax cut package that would sabotage the health care law by eliminating the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office says would cause millions of Americans to lose their health care. I thought mental health was the big problem. I thought that was the thing we were supposed to be talking about in the wake of a tragedy like the one Tuesday in California. After the Texas church shooting, President Donald Trump said: “I think that mental health is your problem here. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation.” It’s good it’s not a guns situation, because we’re not allowed to talk about those things. We can only talk about mental health. What I don’t understand, then, is why the people talking about mental health in the wake of a mass shooting never seem to do anything to make our mental health care system better. I almost think they’re trying to distract us, hoping thoughts and prayers will be good enough. But people keep dying. And those thoughts and prayers aren’t solving anything. rhuppke@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-11-15 10:00:00,"After latest shooting, let's talk about mental health instead of you-know-what",,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

69,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/15/california-gunman-wife-found-dead-in-home/,"Trending: RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — The wife of a gunman who went on a shooting rampage in a Northern California town was found dead inside their home, authorities announced Wednesday, raising the death toll from the attack to five. Investigators discovered the body of Kevin Janson Neal’s wife hidden under the floor. They believe her slaying was the start of the rampage, said Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston. Neal shot and killed four other people and wounded 10 at different locations around the rural community of Rancho Tehama Reserve. Police later shot and killed him. At the time of the attack, the gunman was out on bail after he was charged with stabbing a neighbor. Others had complained about him firing hundreds of rounds from his house, and the assistant sheriff acknowledged officers had visited the home. “We can’t anticipate what people are going to do. We don’t have a crystal ball,” Johnston said. Yet Neal was free and able to use a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns Tuesday to shoot 14 people, including at an elementary school, before he died in a shootout with police. It’s not yet clear what the terms of Neal’s bail were, and whether he would have been allowed to possess and fire the weapons on his property at the end of a dirt road in Rancho Tehama Reserve. But his many contacts with authorities raised questions of why he was out of custody and able to go on the 45-minute rampage. Two of his neighbors were killed in an apparent act of revenge before he went looking for random victims. Cristal Caravez and her father live across a ravine from the roadway where the gunman and his first victims lived. She said they and others heard constant gunfire from the area of the gunman’s house, but couldn’t say for sure it was him firing. “You could hear the yelling. He’d go off the hinges,” she said. The shooting “would be during the day, during the night, I mean, it didn’t matter.” She and her father, who is president of the community’s homeowners’ association, said neighbors would complain to the sheriff’s department, which referred the complaints back to the homeowners’ association.

The gunman’s sister, Sheridan Orr, said her brother had struggled with mental illness throughout his life and at times had a violent temper. She said Neal had “no business” owning firearms. The shooter was facing charges of assaulting one of the feuding neighbors in January and that she had a restraining order against him, Johnston said. He did not comment on the shooter’s access to firearms. Johnston declined to identify the shooter until his relatives were notified, but he confirmed the gunman was charged with assault in January and had a restraining order placed against him. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee he is prosecuting a man named Kevin Neal in that case. Neal’s mother told The Associated Press her son, who was a marijuana grower, was in a long-running dispute with neighbors he believed were cooking methamphetamine. The mother, who spoke on condition she be named only as Anne because she fears for her safety, lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she raised Neal. She said she posted his $160,000 bail and spent $10,000 on a lawyer after he was arrested in January for stabbing a neighbor. Neal’s mother said the neighbor was slightly cut after Neal grabbed a steak knife out of the hand of the neighbor who was threatening him with it. She wept as she told The AP she spoke to Neal on the phone on Monday. “Mom it’s all over now,” she said he told her. “I have done everything I could do and I am fighting against everyone who lives in this area.” She said Neal apologized to her during their brief conversation, she thought for all the money she had spent on him, saying he was “on a cliff” and the people around him were trying to “execute” him. “I think the motive of getting even with his neighbors and when it went that far — he just went on a rampage,” Johnston said. Police said surveillance video shows the shooter unsuccessfully trying to enter a nearby elementary school after quick-thinking staff members locked the outside doors and barricaded themselves inside when they heard gunshots. Johnston said the gunman spent about six minutes shooting into Rancho Tehama Elementary School before driving off to continue shooting elsewhere. Johnston said one student was shot but is expected to survive. He said the 45-minute rampage ended when a patrol car rammed the stolen vehicle the shooter was driving and killed him in a shootout. Johnston said officials received multiple 911 calls about gunfire at an intersection of two dirt roads. Minutes later, more calls reporting shots flooded in from different locations, including the school. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and children screaming at the school, which has one class of students from kindergarten through fifth grade. Rancho Tehama Reserve is in a sparsely populated area of rolling woodlands dotted with grazing cattle about 130 miles north of Sacramento. ___ Elias reported from San Francisco.

70,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/hxCsgHChGn4/ct-las-vegas-shooting-lawsuits-20171115-story.html,"CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both ""physical and mental injuries."" The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can't dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. ""I don't sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,"" said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Ill., just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. ""I thought it was gunshots."" Seng, who wasn't physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday's filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock's bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn't yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold ""the entire supply chain"" responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren't returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting ""a meticulously planned, evil ... act"" in a statement Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through ""the appropriate legal channels."" Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains ""heartbroken for the victims."" Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Fla. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general's office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: ""Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy."" Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can't fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn't notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. ""They can catch a person counting cards,"" she said. ""But they can't catch someone carrying bags of guns.""

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Three thousand people mourned eight members of a family who were among the more than two dozen killed in a shooting at a small Texas church Wednesday before the funeral procession headed to a cemetery near the site of the massacre. Surrounding the multicolored caskets, mourners released light pink and blue balloons at a graveside service for the Holcombe family in rural Wilson County. Church member and survivor John Holcombe had invited the public to attend the funeral of his pregnant wife, Crystal, 36, and three of her children from a previous marriage, Greg Hill, 13, Emily Hill, 11, and Megan Hill, 9; his parents, 60-year-old Bryan and Karla Holcombe, 58; a brother, 36-year-old Marc Holcombe, and Marc’s 18-month-old daughter, Noah. Fire marshals had to turn hundreds more people away from the services at an events center in Floresville, Texas, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, where the Nov. 5 shooting occurred.

News reporters were barred from entering the event center and were being held in a pen with two trucks obscuring the view inside. In an earlier Facebook post, John Holcombe thanked friends and well-wishers for their support, adding: “Please continue to pray for us.” The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, began firing into First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs as Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor, ascended to the pulpit. Walking up and down the center aisle, Kelley killed 25 people at the church, including crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because Crystal Holcombe was pregnant. John Holcombe was managing the church’s audio-visual operations at the back of the building when gunfire erupted. He and Crystal’s 7-year-old daughter Evelyn escaped the barrage. Crystal’s eldest child, 14-year-old Philip, had stayed home from church services that day. After his rampage, Kelley fled in a vehicle parked near the church, pursued by a barefoot observer with an AR assault rifle and another man in a pick-up truck. The man with the rifle shot and struck Kelley but authorities say the gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute Kelley was having with his mother-in-law, a member of the church who wasn’t present that day. However, among the victims was Lula White, the gunman’s wife’s 71-year-old grandmother. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. Under federal law, anyone convicted of domestic violence cannot purchase a firearm. But the Air Force failed to inform federal law enforcement authorities that Kelley had been court-martialed. When he tried to buy guns after his release from a military prison, his conviction was not in the database used to conduct background checks, and the purchases went through. In addition to those killed, another 20 people were injured in the shooting. Eight survivors remained hospitalized Wednesday at two San Antonio-area hospitals, their conditions ranging from good to critical.

The complaints, filed in Clark County on Wednesday, allege that Mandalay Bay, the hotel from which the gunman fired on the crowd, did not adequately train its security staff and did not have a plan for what to do during an active shooter situation. Additionally, the plaintiffs want to know why there weren't more security cameras in place on the 32nd floor, where the shooter's room was located. The suits also claim that Live Nation Entertainment, the festival's organizer, did not train employees properly on what to do in an emergency and did not have clearly marked exits, and alleges that Slide Fire Solutions, the manufacturer of the bump-stock devices used by the gunman to fire faster into the crowd, sells its products ""without any reasonable measures or safeguards and which the killer used to such horrifying ends."" Attorney Timothy Titolo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the plaintiffs are from Nevada, California, and Illinois, and include concertgoers and at least one employee who worked the festival. ""Of these 14 cases, there's a couple who were shot and survived, a wrongful death, and a lot of other people who were hurt not by a gun, but by shrapnel or during the escape,"" he said, adding that all experienced emotional trauma.

76,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/16/heroes-of-las-vegas-the-hospital-staff-called-to-action-after-the-mass-shooting,"When a festival became the scene of the worst mass shooting in modern America, Sunrise hospital staff had only minutes to prepare. Here are their stories Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Sunrise Hospital’s emergency room was already full at about 10pm on 1 October when a police officer dropping off an accident victim received a call on his radio announcing: “Shots fired.” Doctor Kevin Menes and nurse Rhonda Davis looked up from their charts. “Is this for real?” Menes asked. A series of gunshots crackled through the officer’s radio in automatic bursts. It sounded like a combat zone. As he ran out, the officer said, “That’s the Route 91 concert.”  Immediately, Menes realized there would be hundreds if not thousands of victims, and Sunrise – Las Vegas’s largest trauma center and the hospital nearest to the site of the country music festival – would probably receive the most. He and Davis started to prepare. Menes contacted house supervisor Kat Comanescu, who then summoned all available nurses to the ER to help move or discharge patients. Davis requested crash carts and gurneys. With only four ER doctors and one trauma surgeon on shift at the time, a mass casualty incident alert went out to bring in day-shift doctors, nurses and support staff. On a typical day, Sunrise receives 20 trauma patients, but in the coming hours they would see approximately 200, including 124 people with gunshot wounds, the first of which would arrive within 15 minutes. The staff waited with a line of stretchers and wheelchairs in Sunrise’s ambulance bay as the sirens grew closer and louder. The plan was to separate patients into triage zones based on whether each person had seconds, minutes or hours to live, then stabilize or resuscitate them in preparation for surgery. Everyone who was there that night described the blood and chaos, but also shared oddly uplifting stories of teamwork, humanity and grit. The Guardian interviewed 10 Sunrise staff members – here are their experiences. The first thing Menes did was get a police radio from his car. As well as being an ER physician, he is a medic for the Swat team, and listening to the Las Vegas Metropolitan police channel he began to grasp the scope of the tragedy. Menes gathered the four other ER doctors on shift, and they agreed that Menes would handle lead triage. That meant organizing patients for nurses and physicians who would focus on blood, intubation, chest tubes and everything else needed before surgery. Menes told secretaries to prep all 24 operating rooms and call every surgeon and anesthesiologist. “The surgery department is really what’s going to save people’s lives,” he told the Guardian. “As ER doctors we bring people back to life and keep them alive for a short time, but surgeons are the ones who work the miracles. They’re the ones who get the bleeding to stop and continue to get them better over next days and weeks, and eventually get them home.” All available gurneys and wheelchairs were taken out to the ambulance bay, where non-ER staff would wheel patients in. They set up and waited. “At about that time I was out on the driveway,” Menes recalled. “You could hear it in the distance. You could hear the sirens coming soft initially, then getting louder and louder. The first cars that came were police cruisers. They can run red lights and had filled up with as many patients as they could.” There is a textbook way to handle a mass casualty surge. Patients are given colored tags based on whether they have seconds or minutes to live (red), an hour or so (yellow), are unlikely to die (green), or have died (black). But to save time, Menes designated the four trauma bays as red, orange, yellow and green, inventing an extra severity level and skipping black – those he believed to be dead would go to the red tag area so a second doctor could assess them in case Menes was wrong. Those who had died went to a temporary morgue in the endoscopy room. It was a plan he had developed through studying the hospital’s layout and the city’s vulnerability. “It’s an open secret that we have a lot of crowds here in Las Vegas and there is always the potential for something like this to happen. For years I’d been thinking about what I’d do. I never said anything to anyone though because I didn’t want them thinking I was crazy.” After 150 people had been brought in, a nurse came out to the ambulance bay to say, “Menes, they need you inside; they’re getting behind.” He went to help stabilize or resuscitate people who were near death, while a trauma surgeon decided who would go into the operating room next. At one point Menes told nurses to take every unit of O-negative from the blood bank and fill their pockets with the intubation drugs to save the precious time it normally takes to fill out paperwork and use digital devices that track supplies. “These are complete no-nos in nursing – carrying drugs in pockets that aren’t accounted for,” Menes admitted. “But we had to do it to save patients’ lives, and it worked.” After 30 minutes, more staff showed up, additional operating rooms were opened, and after an hour more surgeons and doctors arrived. “We were getting more and more patients out of the ER and into life-saving surgeries. This dance continued on for hours, and when everything was said and done, at 5am, it was like a ghost town. Almost everybody had been taken care of.” Sixteen people of at least 200 patients seen that night died in their care, but during the first six hours the trauma team performed 28 surgeries to stop internal bleeding, and 67 operations in the first 24 hours. More than 100 physicians and 200 nurses had come in. “As a medical community we came together. But it wasn’t just us. This happened all over the [Las Vegas] Valley, and in a smaller way this happens every night all over the world, 365 days a year.” “We actually got a few minutes’ heads-up quicker than anyone else because that officer just happened to be standing in our ER,” recalled Davis. “It kind of took a while to process what was really going on. Hearing a barrage of bullets was shocking – I was stunned.” After worrying about friends at the show her “nurse brain” kicked in. “I thought: oh my goodness, this is going to be huge.” She helped notify doctors and surgeons. They started getting the trauma bays ready, which required moving non-critical patients to other areas of the hospital. Emergency dispatchers for Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, usually estimate how many people each hospital will receive, but this time all they could do was stress: “You will get a lot of patients.” “Even then I didn’t quite get the grand scale of what it would be,” Davis recalled. “It’s hard to imagine that you’re going to get hundreds of patients in minutes.” This first wave arrived in police cars and private vehicles. She saw a young man with a gunshot wound to his leg, and seconds later the most critical patients started coming in, covered in blood. The most critical cases were gunshot wounds to the head, chest and stomach. Some of the patients did not have a pulse. “We were trying to do CPR, putting chest tubes in, all of the life-saving measures that you would do,” she said. “We get patients like this all the time, but maybe two at a time at most. You do all these steps to try to save their life. At this moment we had several who needed all these life-saving critical interventions at the same time. We went patient to patient as quickly as possible, trying to help save them. I wasn’t thinking. You just kind of do. Quickly it turned into a sea of blood and patients.” Nurses usually get assigned patients to care for through their shifts, but in this case “you literally did whatever you could to whatever patient”, she recalled. The four trauma bay rooms typically hold six patients in total, yet each one was being used for four or five people, and there were more in the halls. She recalled receiving a young female who had been shot in the chest. With every square inch of the trauma bay taken, Davis and an anesthesiologist worked on her in the hall. He was trying to put a chest tube in, because she wasn’t breathing, and when they could not detect a pulse Davis started doing CPR immediately. “I was leaning up on top of the gurney doing chest compressions, trying to save this poor girl’s life, and there’s just blood coming out of her chest from the wound.” At one point Davis looked up and saw three more patients being moved into the hallway. Doctors and nurses were doing the exact same things for them. There was blood all over the floor. Unfortunately, the patient she was working on could not be saved. Davis had to move on very quickly to the next patient: another young female in the same situation. Not a day goes by without Davis thinking about that night. “Some moments during the day I’m completely fine, then I’ll hear something or see something and the memory of that scene in the ER will pop in my mind. It’s very vivid still.” When she received the first Mass Casualty Incident alert, Sondereker turned on the news and saw nothing. She called her unit and was told: “There’s blood everywhere. Get in here now.” While driving in she heard that 75 ambulances had been dispatched to the Strip, which was “beyond comprehension”, she said. “That’s never happened before.” Ambulances flew past as she drove in, and while turning into Sunrise, pickup trucks cut her off; she heard injured people crying in their flatbeds. “In 35 years in medicine I’ve worked in ambulance, EMS, trauma and helicopter crews. I’ve seen burn ward devastation, but nothing like this.” The victims arrived in cars, trucks, rideshares, police SUVs and of course ambulances, which instead of the usual one patient would transport six to eight at a time. She too mentioned a “sea of blood”: “I’ve never seen this amount of trauma in a few hours come through the door. The bullet wounds were the size of your nail bed, but the devastation those bullets caused in the human body was catastrophic. People could be talking with a small wound in their chest then be gone within seconds. “The night flew so fast,” she said. “You directed it, but it was surreal how things just happened; the flow was amazing. We’d call for more stretchers and recliners and they’d appear. The ER was full, so we moved people up and discharged from the top floors. In all the chaos was a calmness I can’t describe because everyone was working their hearts out. That’s one reason it was successful – a camaraderie and teamwork like I’ve never experienced in my life.” She added: “Hospitals have an option to divert [patients]. EMS kept asking me, ‘how many more can you take?’ I kept saying 10 more. It was an eyeball thing – like where are we at? How many have I moved to cardio, to ICU, to surgery?” Within an hour, 100 physicians and 100 nurses had arrived to help. “I’m from small-town Iowa; I’ve seen camaraderie, but nothing like Las Vegas has put out in the past few weeks. The way they came together was heroic – concierges helping people in, nurses’ assistants holding hands, even the patients who said “take care of those who are hurt worse. I’m good.” It wasn’t an ER of screaming. There was a calmness, because people were being taken care of.” Sanguinet had to wait for her mother to come to watch her kids before she could get to Sunrise at 4am. The hospital was on lockdown and the halls were quiet. “The fear and anguish was palpable,” she said. “Everyone had the same look of shock.” At that hour victims’ families were also trickling in, some from out of state. Sanguinet went to the family resource center to help provide food, blankets and emotional support. Victims who had already been discharged from the ER were interspersed with families, holding each other’s hands. “People swirled around us,” she recalled, “because they saw a badge and saw us taking names. It definitely put my skills to a test. I tried to set aside my own emotions as a parent, but obviously I’m still human, so as I’m walking and doing my job, I’m also crying.” She and two colleagues took it upon themselves to search for people. They photographed images from the families’ cellphones and walked floor to floor, in some cases scrutinizing victims’ tattoos or piercings. “A lot of people unfortunately had issues where they weren’t recognizable. You also look different in a hospital than when you’re on the street smiling and happy.” If a victim was alive and could be touched, staff immediately ran to the family to bring them to their side. But if the person was in the morgue, it was more complicated. Sanguinet personally matched eight or nine fatally wounded victims to their family members, a bittersweet experience. She delivered the news with a team that included clergy, medical staff and a case manager. “I was there for the comforting part.” A couple of days later, one of those parents called to see if her late daughter’s boots had been found – the family wanted to bury their daughter in her favorite outfit. Very few patients’ belongings were at Sunrise – a lot of loose items fell off or were torn away at the site. But at the bottom of the ER’s storage box were the young woman’s boots in a bag. “I went to package them,” Sanguinet said. “I took them out of the bag and saw they were covered in blood, dirt, and filth from the event. I’m a mom. I have kids, and God forbid this would ever happen to me, I wouldn’t want that to come back. I wouldn’t want that reminder. I closed my door, I put something on the floor, and I sat there for two hours scrubbing those boots. A co-worker brought me a tool to help clean the soles. “It was really a cathartic time for me to sit and reflect on everything that had happened. It brings home the fact that Las Vegas is my home now, and Sunrise hospital is my home now. I know that that mom is grateful that I took the time; for me it was a bit of closure to know that even out of tragedy you could do something to make a difference in an outcome that was so horrible.” As a former trauma nurse, Comanescu knew exactly what was needed when Menes called saying: “Something has happened at the Mandalay Bay,” the hotel from which the killer shot into the crowd. Her ER experience also allowed her to stay calm. “I was thinking we needed manpower, space and supplies if a lot of people are coming. Our hospital was almost full.” She broadcast to intensive care and telemetry units: “Send all your available nurses to the ER.” Less critical patients needed to be moved out of trauma bays. Each department was also instructed to keep one “crash cart”, or mobile cabinet, and these were rolled to the ER, their trays full of chest tubes, drugs and other life-saving supplies. They were in high demand when the ER became overrun with gunshot wound victims as patient after patient needed to be stabilized and intubated for emergency surgery. “They were amazing,” Comanescu says of her staff. “People were just coming to help, bringing all these supplies. The fact that people came from home and opened spaces that weren’t open … That night will stay with me for the rest of my life.” Parish ran full speed pushing crash carts to the ER. They are heavy machines, and to keep supplies flowing she would sprint back and forth between the pharmacy and the ER throughout the night. A nursing student, once the ER was stocked with drugs, she told the charge nurse: “There are limited things I can do, but I can help.” So many patients were in danger of bleeding out that she helped assess wounds, apply tourniquets, place IVs and monitor vital signs to notify doctors when patients crashed, until on-call staff nurses arrived. “Some of the nurses from upstairs were traumatized,” she recalled. “They’ve seen patients pass before, but on a scale this size it’s overwhelming.” She helped colleagues focus on a checklist: assess and if necessary pack the wounds – stopping the bleeding came first. And she helped victims call their families. “There were people who couldn’t operate their phones because they had blood in their eyes, were in shock, or had lost their phones. I let them use mine, and it’s been a little hard now. I have families contacting me to say thank you even though their people didn’t make it.” By that time the staff was operating with mechanical efficiency, she said. “Everybody was doing exactly what they needed to do to help as many people as they could. At that point I was in awe … Ever since I started nursing school, the human race has been declining and hating on each other. I was debating whether I wanted to be a nurse. But when I looked around, I was like, this is what it’s about: saving people. We were the helpers. That was the most memorable moment. Yeah, there was a lot of trauma happening, but at the same moment humanity was happening and it was amazing.” “A lot of mass casualty alerts end up not significant, or false alarms,” said Fisher. “But when I first pulled in it was an unbelievable sight. I got a pit in my stomach walking up because I knew something huge happened. There were multiple Metro vehicles, ambulances pulling in, nurses bringing out multiple gurneys to take people in stretchers from private vehicles.” Two other surgeons were already in and three more were en route. Fisher went to the operating room where the first patient was on the table, prepped and draped. The anesthesiologist came in while Fisher located the wounds. He started operating. The key difference from a normal night, apart from the sheer volume of patients, was that the wounds were from a rifle, which is more serious because the rounds have a higher velocity than handgun bullets. Their assembly-line approach worked “fantastically well”, he said. “Patients didn’t have to wait to be operated on. We used all 24 operating rooms. All the staff came in right away, and that made a huge difference.” Fisher operated on five people during a 24-hour shift. In between, he helped coordinate where patients would go and who would be next while performing triage. Everyone was in the zone, and the gravity of the mass shooting did not hit him until he went home the next night and his dogs smelled and licked the blood on his shoes. He put them in the trash. At first, Szymanski experienced the night’s trauma as a concertgoer. She and her husband were about to leave the Route 91 festival when the gunfire started. They believed they were hearing the sound of firecrackers. Security officers screamed that people should turn around and take cover, so they ducked into a bar with a roof overhead. They ran out in between shots, and she called her hospital to tell them what was happening. As they got away, they passed injured people resting against dumpsters, and Szymanski asked them: “Are you OK?” “Honestly, it felt very debilitating,” she recalled, “because I’m a non-clinical member of our team.” All she could do was help Sunrise prepare. Showing up in her concert T-shirt and shorts, she turned the auditorium into a waiting room for victims’ families. There, she gave people in blood- or dirt-stained clothes fresh outfits and handed cellphone chargers out, got the cafe open to provide coffee, and began working with case managers to help find missing loved ones. “Going back and forth between the war zone was unlike anything I’ve ever seen, but the patients were so wonderful. Many of them laying on gurneys in the ER were saying, ‘No I’m not that bad, go to work on them not me’.” The next day she managed a massive influx of food and water donations and brought in therapy dogs. Between five and 12 golden retrievers would visit Sunrise over the next few weeks, interacting with families, patients and staff. “My phone was blowing up with names of people who needed fuzzy love. It made a big difference.” Brown was part of the team that moved people upstairs from the ER, and then came back down to help triage the emergency cases. “It was difficult,” she said. “We’re not used to being the first line, per se. I had to revert back to training and try to think of basic things that needed to be done.” When she returned to the ICU at 7am, she cared for patients whom she had helped stabilize downstairs who had now gone through life-saving surgeries. In the weeks that followed, she watched them further improve. “Some people we thought might not wake up, or talk or walk again were able to get up and move. From everything we saw that night to a week later the progress was amazing.” Her most vivid memory, though, was of a patient who had arrived at the ER before the shooting, an older blind woman who asked to leave. “She couldn’t see what was going on in the ER at all, but she could sense it, and hear it obviously. She had a daughter in town who’d gladly take her home, she said. In the middle of everything that was going on, when she came up to ask me that, it was touching. She was realizing she didn’t need to be in our busy ER for what she had at that exact moment. It kind of stuck. There were other victims who were the same way after that. You start to see all that good from people who’ve gone through something traumatic, and it keeps you going for all the ones who aren’t able to do that.” “As a level two trauma center we see all sorts of trauma, from stabbings to gunshots, to car accidents,” said Sklamberg, speaking in front of signed placards from medical staff in Orlando, San Bernardino, Denver, Boston and Newtown. “We drill and we prepare on a very regular basis, but nothing could have prepared us for this event in terms of the quantity of patients that came. Over 120 gunshot victims came into Sunrise over a two-hour period of time – unprecedented numbers in the history of the US. But the preparation, the drilling we do, gave us the foundation upon which to provide that care to all the patients who came in. “No patient was turned away.”",2017-11-16 02:00:21,Heroes of Las Vegas: the hospital staff called to action after the mass shooting,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
77,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/16/vegas-concertgoers-sue-over-shooting/,"Legal action after the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert picked up Wednesday with lawsuits filed on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who said she is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. Named as defendants are the hotel-casino from which Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries.” A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with dead and injured people. Among the deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, the filings say, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are being fired. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

Just days before this year's New York Comic Con,  Marvel and Netflix cancelled their panel for The Punisher. The mass shooting in Las Vegas a few days prior had left 58 people dead and more than 500 injured and ""it wouldn't be appropriate"" for the violent, gun-heavy show to participate in the convention at that time,  the companies said in a statement. Tomorrow, a little more than a month after NYCC, The Punisher finally hits Netflix. More time has passed since the Las Vegas shooting, but the tragedies haven’t stopped. Less than two weeks ago, a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas left 26 dead and another 20 wounded. Five people were killed by a gunman in Northern California earlier this week, and the US has averaged about one mass shooting incident per day in 2017. All of which is to say, if it wasn't appropriate to promote Netflix's latest Marvel adaptation at a comic book convention because it was in the wake of a horrific incident of gun violence, is it right to release the show itself after another one? Moreover, if there are always mass shootings in America, will there ever be a suitable time to release The Punisher? Related Stories Angela Watercutter Joanna Pearlstein Angela Watercutter, Peter Rubin, Adam Rogers, Jason Parham, and Brian Raftery Questions about the intersection of entertainment and real-world violence come up often. Folks asked them when Suicide Squad came to theaters so soon after last year's Orlando nightclub shooting. They were incredibly salient following the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, which happened during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. And yet, the creators of The Punisher—a show named after the alter-ego of gun-toting vigilante Frank Castle—seemingly didn't give them much thought when creating the series. In fact, in a recent interview with Syfy.com showrunner Steve Lightfoot said the issues of mass shootings and gun control weren't considered by the writing staff at all. ""With regard to certain recent events, we started making the show a year and a half ago,"" Lightfoot explained. ""We wrote most of the show before the election so I think we'd have to think back to then when we started and the short answer is not really. We had just started with the character."" Lightfoot said he also didn't consider the fandom law enforcement officials have for the character: ""I can speculate about why the Punisher resonates so strongly with them, but I sort of didn't give it too much thought as we were writing."" That the man in charge of a Punisher show didn't give such things ""too much thought"" is telling. It's indicative of a sense that Lightfoot, and perhaps Marvel as a whole, doesn't want to engage with the idea of Frank Castle as anything other than a damaged, but ultimately sympathetic, antihero—one who does whatever necessary to get the bad guys. For them, seeing Castle as any sort of reflection of reality is a step too far. That's certainly their prerogative. The Punisher is a fictional character, and it's up to Marvel and Netflix to decide how to tell his stories and how deep those stories go in interacting with the world. It’s not like Thor and Squirrel Girl are expected to act as commentary on the current political climate—what's the big deal if the Punisher is treated as just a Death Wish-esque fantasy character? (Death Wish, of course, started as something far more sober than its later sequels would suggest, and it's worth pointing out that its upcoming remake is under fire for its seeming political stance.) The Punisher isn't Thor or Squirrel Girl, though. He's not even Iron Man or Spider-Man. He’s a street-level character living in Marvel's version of the real world, with no powers but his arsenal. (The closest any other Marvel character gets to the Punisher's contemporary cultural relevance is Captain America, and that's only because he was temporarily a Nazi)  In a country where gun violence is permanently an issue, albeit one never fully examined or discussed, the Punisher's modus operandi of channelling his frustration through firearms means he ends up representing—or at least reminding people of—real-world issues, whether his creators want to admit it or not. It's understandable that Marvel would want to avoid the issue if at all possible, but ducking the question might not work, especially when the cancellation of the New York Comic Con panel proved that the company is aware of the character's wider cultural context. There may be another option, though. At NYCC, Marvel's publishing arm devoted part of its panel to the relaunch of the Punisher comic book, which features the Punisher using old Iron Man armor to overthrow a European despot for S.H.I.E.L.D.. That vision of the Punisher may be outside the traditional Frank Castle norm, but it points to a future for the character that doesn't evoke quite so much real-world grief. If Netflix grants The Punisher a second season, this new version of Castle might just warrant some consideration. WIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.  The 14 civil complaints, filed together on Wednesday in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire on 1 October from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries”. The challenge for mass shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can’t dispel – of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. “I don’t sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,” said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. “I thought it was gunshots.” Seng, who wasn’t physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock’s bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn’t yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold “the entire supply chain” responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire were not returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting “a meticulously planned, evil … act” in a statement on Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through “the appropriate legal channels”. Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it could not comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains “heartbroken for the victims”. Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Florida. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia supreme court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general’s office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: “Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.” Cho killed himself after his rampage.",2017-11-16 09:33:47,Las Vegas shooting: lawsuits filed on behalf of 14 concertgoers,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

In a statement issued Wednesday by a Bennett-led group called Athletes in Action, they said, ""No one should be denied employment for having the courage to follow their convictions and take action for equality and social justice."" ""Join me and many others to get Colin Kaepernick signed!"" Bennett, a Seahawks defensive end, said on Twitter. Kaepernick has been a free agent since parting ways with the 49ers in March, and many believe that he is being deliberately shunned by the NFL for being the first in the league last season to stage protests during the national anthem. The 30-year-old Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment, and attorneys for the quarterback are seeking to obtain depositions from several team owners, as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""Every day that goes by and he doesn't get signed is another nail in the NFL's defense,"" one of the attorneys, Mark Geragos, told The Post's Mark Maske earlier this month. Bennett's group, which also includes former Olympian John Carlos, famous for raising a black-gloved fist on the medal podium during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, is seeking to harness people power on behalf of Kaepernick. Other Athletes for Impact campaigns include initiatives on gun safety, mass incarceration, police violence, LGBTQ rights, immigration and climate change. In its statement Wednesday, the group traced a tradition of athletes protesting social injustices back to the 1960s, then through the 1996 anthem protests of former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and demonstrations last year by WNBA players, before Kaepernick began sitting, then kneeling, during renditions of ""Star-Spangled Banner"" ahead of preseason games. ""Kaepernick was clear in live interviews and in writing about the intentions of his protest,"" the group said, ""stating time and time again the specific reasons for his demonstration, and that it was not intended to disrespect the military but start a national conversation and action around issues of injustice."" ""It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,"" the statement claimed. ""As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, 'if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can't name one better than him . . .'

Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle's sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their ""Salute to Service"" night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. After Goodell said last month that his league believes ""everyone should stand"" for the anthem, but would not force players to do so, Bennett said, ""I plan on sitting down."" With talks occurring between the NFL and its players about how to negotiate an end to the protests, the two-time Pro Bowler said at the time, ""I think the first step to even being able to even have a conversation is to make sure that Colin Kaepernick gets an opportunity to play in the NFL.

Last week, Geragos disputed a claim by an NFL spokesman that Kaepernick’s camp had not responded to an offer from the league for the quarterback to have a one-on-one meeting with Goodell. The attorney said that Kaepernick “would be happy to attend” a meeting with the commissioner, but that the presence of a mediator would be required because of the grievance the quarterback has filed. 
In its statement, Athletes for Impact said, “We call on all NFL owners, general managers and coaches with a positional need to summon the courage to sign Colin Kaepernick and to stand with us on the right side of history.”

Submit a News Tip The 30-year-old Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment, and attorneys for the quarterback are seeking to obtain depositions from several team owners, as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell. “Every day that goes by and he doesn’t get signed is another nail in the NFL’s defense,” one of the attorneys, Mark Geragos, told The Post’s Mark Maske earlier this month. 
Bennett’s group, which also includes former Olympian John Carlos, famous for raising a black-gloved fist on the medal podium during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, is seeking to harness people power on behalf of Kaepernick. Other Athletes for Impact campaigns include initiatives on gun safety, mass incarceration, police violence, LGBTQ rights, immigration and climate change. 	




In its statement Wednesday, the group traced a tradition of athletes protesting social injustices back to the 1960s, then through the 1996 anthem protests of former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and demonstrations last year by WNBA players, before Kaepernick began sitting, then kneeling, during renditions of “Star-Spangled Banner” ahead of preseason games. “Kaepernick was clear in live interviews and in writing about the intentions of his protest,” the group said, “stating time and time again the specific reasons for his demonstration, and that it was not intended to disrespect the military but start a national conversation and action around issues of injustice.” 
“It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,” the statement claimed. “As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, ‘if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can’t name one better than him . . .’ 
“Legendary athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos were disparaged by many in their day for using their platform to speak out against racism and injustice. Today their statues stand proudly in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and they are widely celebrated as truth tellers ahead of their time. It is time we start celebrating our truth tellers from the start.” 
Bennett was among the first NFL players to stage anthem demonstrations this season. Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle’s sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their “Salute to Service” night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

84,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/jgWSYKBkJmw/,"Senators from both parties want to prevent mass shootings — not by proposing harder gun control measures, but by boosting enforcement of existing law. The Fix NICS Act, unveiled Thursday, aims to make federal agencies and states more vigilant. Both are already asked to report crimes that would legally prohibit someone from buying a firearm. But, in many cases, they fail to pass that information on to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System,or NICS. The Washington Post notes the NICS database is missing millions of records for these kinds of convictions. That problem became more evident after a mass shooting in Texas earlier this month. The suspect in the shooting was able to buy a gun because the U.S. Air Force didn't report his past general court-martial for domestic violence. Related StoryThe Law That's Keeping Congress From Getting The Facts On Gun Violence The proposed act offers either carrot or stick, depending on the target. Congress has power over federal agencies, so the new act would punish them if they fail to upload criminal records. But the federal government can't enforce states on this, so the act would offer them financial incentives. A number of high-profile senators are behind the proposal. But two are said to be leading this bipartisan group: Republican Sen. John Cornyn from Texas and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut. Murphy joined the Senate shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and has been a vocal supporter of gun control measures. Cornyn, on the other hand, has been a consistent supporter of the NRA. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

85,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress,"Compared with others, the 145-year-old lobby group isn’t a vast spender – but the NRA has the power to mobilize a grassroots support and make Washington listen First published on Fri 17 Nov 2017 07.00 GMT Why is the National Rifle Association so powerful? Here’s a clue: it’s not (just) about the money. The vast majority of Americans support gun control, and yet Congress has failed to toughen laws even in the wake of a series of mass shootings. With the NRA pouring money into political races at record levels it is an easy argument to make that the gun lobby has bought Washington – but that fails to paint a full picture.  In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. That’s real money, but for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The US Chamber of Commerce, the largest spender of all, has spent $104m. The NRA’s influence does not stem solely from lobbying. Thanks to the supreme court’s Citizens United decision, the spigot is now wide open for “independent expenditures” allowing groups and individuals to back – or attack – candidates, as long as those campaigns are not made in cooperation with, or at the request of, a candidate. The NRA bet big on 2016’s presidential election, making independent expenditures worth $53.4m. And the cash seemed to have been well spent. The NRA poured $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. Its only big loss was in Nevada, for the seat vacated by the Democratic minority leader, Harry Reid. Nor does the power of the guns manufacturers fully explain the NRA’s power. Guns are big(ish) business. Gun and ammunition manufacturers will have revenues of $13.3bn and profits of $1bn in 2017, according to IBISWorld. Gun and ammunition stores this year will have revenues of $85.bn and profits of $256m. But there are far bigger industries. The auto industry (which has spent $51.8m on lobbying so far in 2017), is on course for revenues of $105.3bn and profits of $3.1bn in 2017. The NRA’s influence, too, is out of proportion to its financial firepower. This is a world with far bigger spenders in Washington – the billionaire Koch brothers spent $889m on the election. And far bigger industries: Apple’s revenues were a record $52bn in the last three months alone and their cash, along with the other tech giants, makes the gun industry look like a rounding error. Dan Auble, a senior researcher at CRP, said NRA’s spending was at a record high but remained “paltry” in comparison to groups like the pharmaceutical industry. If the gun lobby is to be successful, it needs to spend money in Washington, and it does. But the amount alone does not explain the NRA’s success. “The NRA is not successful because of its money. To be sure, it is hard to be a force in American politics without money. The NRA has money that it uses to help its favored candidates get elected. But the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. By choosing its battles wisely, the NRA has shown an ability to swing primary elections in favor of pro-gun candidates, Winkler said. “That’s the real source of their strength,” he said. That and its use of a relatively small number of highly motivated people to push an agenda that appears out of step with the general population, which, according to recent polling, is in favour of stricter gun laws. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, although that number is disputed. But whatever its actual size, that membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, professor of crime, law and policy and gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland and the author of five books on guns. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “I mean more than voting. I mean going to a meeting, writing a letter, contacting a friend,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect. “Elected officials feel the impact of constituents when they hear their voices,” said Spitzer. “Politics is often about the squeaky wheel – who makes the loudest noise, who gets the most attention.” There are, however, problems on the horizon for the NRA. For one, the gun control lobby is growing. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety is threatening to spend more than $25m in 2018 races. Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun control political action committee set up by Gabrielle Giffords, a former Democratic congresswoman whose career was ended when she was shot along with 18 others in an Arizona suburb, spent $13.4m in 2016. The issue for gun control advocates is that they have yet to develop as powerful a voice – or as deep contacts in Washington – as the gun lobby. “I think it’s fair to say that so far they have been thwarted at the federal level,” said Auble. “They are just not as well funded, not as established, and don’t have the history the NRA has.” Even if the gun control groups gave the same amount of money to the same candidates, said Winkler, those candidates would not vote in favor of gun control. “It’s not just money,” he said. “If Michael Bloomberg said he will give you $2 for every $1 the NRA gives you, it is not going to work.” The truth is that gun control is not an area where money is leading politics, he said. It’s an issue that some voters care a lot about and elected officials respond to those voters. “Especially the intense, mobilized, minority of voters that support most vigorously the right to bear arms.” But putting the money and its current influence aside, the NRA faces existential issues in the years ahead as its opposition grows. The election of Donald Trump was a major victory for the NRA. On the eve of his 100th day in office, Trump addressed the NRA’s annual conference, the first sitting president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1983. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “I am here to deliver you good news: the eight-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.” That cheering crowd – largely white, male and older – was a snapshot of the people who swung Trump’s victory. It’s also a picture of a demographic in decline. By mid-century the US is expected to become a majority minority nation. The NRA’s core constituency is basically older white males. Younger people are not taking up gun ownership at the same rate as older people did, said Spitzer, and polls of minorities show they feel more strongly about gun control. Attempts by the NRA to broaden its appeal do not seem to have paid off. “They are facing an existential demographic problem,” said Spitzer. Even a Trump presidency may not be good for the NRA. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton presented the NRA with obvious foes. Gun sales are falling after the glory years of the Obama administration, when each mass shooting led to a spike in sales as Democrats called for gun control and gun owners ran to the shops. With their people in office, the industry – and the NRA – lack a demon to drive sales and membership. The NRA has shifted gears post-Obama, taking a leaf out of Trump’s all-caps textbook and attacking the media for demonizing gun owners and the president. Such a move is unlikely to win over minority support. “If the NRA really wants to reach a new generation, maybe they need to reach out to Black Lives Matter. Who are the people who are being abused by government agents the most? You would think that Black Lives Matter would have some affinity with that idea that you need guns to protect yourself against a hostile government that can’t protect you,” said Spitzer. But even the NRA knows that the best thing that the gun control movement could see right now would be a lot of African Americans or Muslims carrying guns around America. The NRA has changed many times in its history, for much of the 20th century it supported gun control. For all its current power there is nothing to suggest the organization is invulnerable to change. Indeed, in this month’s special elections NRA favorites fell to candidates who support more gun control. “The NRA face really significant challenges. How they manage them remains to be seen,” said Spitzer.",2017-11-17 02:00:06,The NRA is smaller than you'd think – so why does it wield such influence?,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

87,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-rosenstein-crime-speech-20171117-story.html,"He didn't bring the same fire as his bosses, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein did carry the same message about Chicago and crime as he spoke Thursday night at the annual dinner of the Chicago Crime Commission. “Chicago is one of America's great cities, but it has a serious crime problem,” Rosenstein said during a 20-minute address. “The city is afflicted with gangs, drugs, violent crimes, shootings and murders. We can spend hours debating the root causes, historical circumstances that compel people to commit crime. … But we do not have the luxury of time to stop the killers.” Rosenstein didn't go as far as President Trump, who has called the city a ""total disaster"" because of its violence.  And he didn't blame the violence on Chicago's status as a sanctuary city, as Attorney General Jeff Session has, linking policies on undocumented immigrants to soaring crime rates. But he did note that the more than 4,300 shooting victims and 760 homicides in the city last year translated into a person shot every two hours and two people killed each day. Rosenstein took issue with some recent decisions by the Chicago Police Department, including a requirement that officers fill out forms for routine investigative stops.  They were ordered after the American Civil Liberties Union released a study showing minorities have been predominately targeted for stops here. The information was intended to help a retired federal magistrate judge evaluate whether officers were following the constitution when they make street stops.  But the police union has claimed traffic stops declined 80 percent because officers found the forms burdensome.  They have since been streamlined twice. Rosenstein said the requirement contributed to a  “dramatic disruption in policing” that has contributed to the spike in violence crime.  “Deterrence is about fear,” he said. “If dangerous criminals are not afraid, then law-abiding citizens are not safe. “So when we see a surge in violent crime that follows a dramatic disruption in policing, as happened in Baltimore and Chicago, it’s obvious there is a lapse in the deterrent effect of law enforcement,"" he continued. ""The debate about what caused the lapse will endure, as will efforts to remedy the root causes and improve relationships between police officers and residents of high crime neighborhoods.” Rosenstein implored the law enforcement officials at the dinner to “rededicate themselves to nonpartisan principles of law enforcement” and their commitment to serving high-crime neighborhoods. “We must never give up on the people who live in those neighborhoods,” he said. ""The majority of the residents are not violent people. They struggle every day to survive violence that surrounds them. They are our people and it is our duty to protect them. Every city should be a sanctuary where people live in peace, not afraid.” Earlier in the day, Rosenstein met with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for two hours at a strategic decision support center in the Englewood police district, according to chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  The department says the level of violence in Englewood has dropped to its lowest point since 1999, and it credits the decline to the expansion of gunshot detection technology and analytic tools. Rosenstein said he found the decrease “very encouraging” and praised the department proactive policing, including raids on people on a “strategic subject list,” a compilation of people most likely to commit or be targeted by violence. “Targeting dangerous repeat offenders is not a zero tolerance strategy. It does not involve arresting random people for minor offenses,"" Rosenstein said. Much of Chicago’s top brass, including Johnson, were not at Rosenstein’s speech because it coincided with a Chicago Police Board meeting. Many suburban police chiefs, including those from Maywood and Robbins, were among  several hundred law enforcement officials in attendance. Rosenstein’s appearance came after months of blistering criticism of the city from the Trump administration. After the mass shooting at a Texas church, Trump downplayed the need for gun control, incorrectly asserting Chicago has “the strongest gun laws in our nation.” He described the city as a “total disaster.” Rosenstein’s immediate boss, Sessions, has feuded with Chicago and other “sanctuary cities,” threatening to withhold grant money if local law enforcement doesn't cooperate with immigration agents. Rosenstein has been embroiled in controversy over much of Trump's tenure. Trump initially pointed to a memo from Rosenstein as a basis to fire FBI director James Comey, who had been overseeing the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. Sessions later recused himself from the matter and Rosenstein, the department’s second-in-command, appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Rosenstein joked about the audience he drew in Chicago, fielding questions from law students at John Marshall Law School in Chicago.  “I have not answered so many questions since my last congressional hearing,” he said.

Lydia and her sister at Mass Firearms School, in Holliston, Massachusetts Lidia Jean Kott Lydia Emmanouilidou's older sister has been begging her to go to the gun range with her for years. But Lydia has always said no. “One year, she even asked me to go with her as her birthday present,” says Lydia. “I refused.” Growing up, guns just weren’t part of their lives. Lydia’s family immigrated from Greece — a country where it's uncommon to own a firearm unless you’re a police officer or in the military — when she was about 12, and her sister about 15. But after they moved to the US, her sister bought a gun for self-protection and began going to the gun range to practice with it, developments that Lydia found confusing. But, recently, Lydia agreed to go to the gun range with her sister. She hoped the trip would help her better understand why her sister got into American gun culture, and why she herself never did.

People pray in the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed in a shooting attack on Nov. 5, 2017. The church was opened to the public as a memorial to those killed. Rick Wilking/Reuters News about the mass shooting at a Texas church in early November hit Pardeep Kaleka particularly hard. Kaleka is a member of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. Back in 2012, a white supremacist went into the temple on a Sunday morning and fatally shot six people, including Kaleka’s father. When he heard about the deadly attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Kaleka says he started reliving that horrible day five years ago, once again. “Those wounds that are there already are sort of ripped open again,” Kaleka says. “The whole day is pretty much gone for you, because now you can’t get your mind off what they’re going through [in Texas].” Related: When trying to determine why the US has so many mass shootings, only one statistic matters Kaleka is a gun owner, which makes sense because he’s also a former police officer. And it squares with his religion too. He says Sikhs are known for being warriors. “We have a saying in our faith that after you exhaust all other means, it is proper to pick up the sword. And now, people have replaced that sword with a gun.” But Kaleka says gun violence in America is a public health crisis. And he fears things are going to get worse before they get better. “My nine-year-old came home a couple of days back and told me about an active shooter drill that they’re doing at their elementary school,” Kaleka says. “Why is that necessary?” “I just think we have way too many guns [in America],” he says. These days, it seems like no place is safe. The deadly attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs was the 14th fatal shooting at a house of worship since 2012, according to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, which tracks gun violence. Related: How other countries can help us understand America's mass shooting crisis “It’s only gotten worse as the power of the NRA and the gun industry has grown and is holding Congress hostage,” says director Rabbi Jonah Pesner. Along with representatives from 50 religious organizations, Pesner signed a letter calling on US lawmakers to take tougher action on gun control. “Enough is enough with empty thoughts and prayers that are not followed by action,” Pesner says. “As a Jew, I believe that every prayer is a call to action.” And Pesner is reassured by recent polling data that shows broad support from American voters for what he calls common-sense gun regulations. “Evangelicals tend to see it differently,” says Joe Carter, editor at The Gospel Coalition, a network of evangelical churches founded in 2005. “One reason is regional,” Carter says. “A lot of evangelicals are from the South. A lot of them served in the military. A lot of them are more familiar with guns than the average American, and they own more guns than the average American.” Conservative evangelicals are skeptical about the wisdom of passing new gun control regulations, Carter says. “They’re just not being enforced.” “I mean, if you’re going to shoot up a church, you’re not going to worry about a gun control law,” says Carter, who is also a vet and a gun owner himself. Gun ownership is not the solution in all cases, Carter says. But a good guy with a gun can prevent somebody who is armed and prepared to do innocents harm, he says. Carter says many of the mass shootings at US churches or elsewhere are the result of domestic violence, which is something religious leaders need to take more seriously. “That’s the problem with the gun control issue,” Carter says. “That’s always the go-to thing. And it drowns out other conversations we should be having.” Mara Nathan has changed the way she thinks about firearms. She grew up in the New York City area, where relatively few people owned guns. Now, as the senior rabbi at Temple Beth El in San Antonio, Texas, Nathan says some members of her congregation are ranchers or hunters. And, she’s pretty sure that some of them come to synagogue and bring their gun. “I know that there are people who do,” Nathan says. “Whether they left it in their car, or whether it’s in their bag or whether in their cowboy boot.” Nathan says she respects gun owners and the right to own firearms. But she still thinks that a big part of the solution to gun violence in America is tougher gun controls. There is no agreement on this issue, Kaleka says. But he thinks people of faith bring an important perspective to the conversation. “We can do something about this,” he says. “God exists in every person, regardless of race, creed, caste, class.” “God exists in our compassion, in our forgiveness, in our ability to see the soul in another person, and say, ‘Hey, I need to protect life.’ And that’s where people of faith need to step up.” Want a seat at the table?

Business in the NHL can be difficult, and the team has enough to juggle right now that it’s difficult for them to give Landeskog whatever he wants. With the 92nd pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft, the Colorado Avalanche have selected overage forward Andrei Buyalsky from Kazakhstan. Having been passed over in each of the last two drafts, Buyalsky is a 6’3 center who spent last season playing for Dubuque of the USHL.

One of the most exciting young players in hockey has a new contract. The Colorado Avalanche have announced a six-year, $54M extension with Norris Trophy finalist Cale Makar. The Avalanche selected winger Oskar Olausson with the 28th overall in the first round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft on Friday. The Swedish forward, who shoots left but plays on the right-wing, plays for HV71 in the Swedish Hockey League. With 28th pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft, the Colorado Avalanche have selected Oskar Olausson from HV71 J20 of the SuperElit League. About Oskar Olausson The combination of skill and size is always one that will have NHL general managers drooling, and Oskar Olausson is a picture-perfect example of that type of player. The NHL has announced the release of its 2021-22 schedule, which will return to a traditional 82-game regular season. The Avalanche will host the Chicago Blackhawks at Ball Arena for their season opener on Oct. Avalanche forward Matt Calvert announced his retirement Thursday after 11 seasons in the NHL. With the 27th pick, MHH selects Olen Zellweger of the Everett Silvertips With the 27th selection in the 2021 SB Nation NHL Mock Draft, Mile High Hockey selects Olen Zellweger - a defenseman from the Everett Silvertips - for the Colorado Avalanche. The 31-year-old will end his career with 566 regular-season games under his belt, all with with either the Columbus Blue Jackets or Colorado Avalanche. Shawn Kemp was a ripped specimen and heck of an athlete when he played in the NBA. One wouldn’t have a clue about that if they saw him on Wednesday and didn’t know better. The Seattle Kraken have selected forward Joonas Donskoi from the Colorado Avalanche in the expansion draft. Some were surprised to see the veteran exposed, but the Avalanche opted to keep Valeri Nichushkin and Logan O’Connor instead. Elliotte Friedman said during Tuesday’s 31 Thoughts podcast that he thinks the Colorado Avalanche are going to take one more run at trying to re-sign forward Gabriel Landeskog. Things will undoubtedly get interesting for the Kraken in the coming days, and only time will tell which stars they select to be the face of their new franchise. A few sources have reported on Friday that negotiations between the Colorado Avalanche and captain Gabriel Landeskog are not going well. Darren Dreger Grubauer could be in for a big payday after he went 30-9-1 with a 1.95 goals-against average and .922 save percentage during the 2020-21 NHL regular season. Adrian Dater of ColoradoHockeyNow.com tried to ask MacKinnon if the Avalanche, one of the most talented teams in the NHL, have been thinking too much in the playoffs.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Post Malone Post Malone has the No. 1 song in the U.S., so naturally, he’s been doing some press. In his joyously tone-deaf Rolling Stone profile last week, he talked about his large arsenal and the “pure” feeling of shooting guns just weeks after the Las Vegas mass shooting. He gave another interview to the Polish media outlet NewOnce, where he was asked about modern hip-hop. The results aren’t that much better. Around the 5:30 mark, Post Malone speaks at length about what you should be looking for in hip-hop. Post Malone If you’re looking for lyrics, if you’re looking to cry, if you’re looking to think about life, don’t listen to hip-hop. There’s great hip-hop songs where they talk about life and they spit that real shit, but right now, there’s not a lot of people talking about real shit. Whenever I want to cry, whenever I want to sit down and have a nice cry, I’ll listen to some Bob Dylan. Or whenever I’m trying to have a good time and stay in a positive mood, I listen to hip-hop. Because it’s fun. I think hip-hop is important because it brings people together in a beautiful, happy way. The video edits out the interviewer’s questions, so you only get Post Malone wildly gesticulating with a burning cigarette between his fingers without much context. But some of the other answers he gives throughout the interview suggest he isn’t quite aware about what’s going on in hip-hop. For one, he hat-tips Kanye West and 21 Savage, whose music both mine pain. 21’s “Nothin New” broods about black death and “Wolves” hits the abject darkness of a stolen sandwich. There’s also Post Malone citing Elvis Presley as one of his favorites: “I think Elvis was just a beautiful singer. Beautiful guitar player. He had the swag. He had the sauce.” It’s a darkly comedic line when you consider the black-appropriative parallels.

98,http://newsblaze.com/usnews/politics/senators-unveil-bipartisan-gun-control-legislation_91165/,"Republican and Democratic senators have released a bipartisan gun control bill that would increase background check requirements for gun sales and encourage states to rigorously input convictions into the federal background check system. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, drafted and presented a bill that would improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. Potential buyers must be run through that system before sellers can give them a gun, according to NBC. Multiple other senators are sponsoring the bill, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, according to The Hill The bill is titled ‘Fix NICS Act’ and has not yet received public opposition from gun rights lobbyists like the National Rifle Association. The bill creates grants and other incentives for state agencies and federal agencies to produce and process documents that determine whether someone is eligible to purchase a gun or not so they can be entered into the system. The bill would withhold particular bonuses for states that don’t comply, and would provide funding for states to include domestic violence crimes to NICS, according to NBC. Cornyn said in a statement that the bill is intended to “fix what’s become a nationwide, systematic problem” in order to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and offenders, according to The Hill. It would also include a specific provision to ensure that states can more easily share information with NICS related to domestic assault cases. The bill comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when Devin Kelley burst through the doors of the First Baptist Church and killed 11 people inside. In the days after the shooting, the Air Force revealed that former airman Devin Kelley had been court-martialed, according to a warrant search on domestic violence charges. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report the court martial to the FBI, which would have entered his crime in the database and prevented him from purchasing a gun under current law. Gen. Mark Miley, the U.S. Army chief of staff, told ABC that as many as 20 percent of the army’s cases are never reported to the FBI, an issue he said is found throughout the U.S. military. Miley said the United States needs to “tighten up” its reporting policies, acknowledging that there have been a significant number of omissions in the past that would allow violent individuals to purchase guns. Miley said about 150 people annually are dishonorably discharged after being court martialed, and said all incidents need to be reported to the FBI in the future, according to ABC.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC People pay tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting at a vigil along near Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 4, 2017 in Las Vegas. Attorneys who filed one of the first lawsuits after the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 concert-goers and left hundreds injured on the Las Vegas Strip filed four new negligence cases Monday on behalf of more than 450 victims. This time, however, Houston-based lawyers Chad Pinkerton and Mo Aziz filed the cases in Los Angeles against companies including MGM Resorts International, the corporate owner of both the Mandalay Bay resort and the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert venue. Pinkerton said the intent was to get the cases before a jury less likely to be influenced by the size and clout of a casino company that is both an active political contributor in Nevada and the largest employer in the state. ""Los Angeles is a better venue for fairness for our clients,"" Pinkerton said in a telephone interview ahead of a news conference announcing the filing of two wrongful death lawsuits, a third case stemming from a woman's head wound and a fourth on behalf of 450 people claiming injuries in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. ""There would be certain advantages for MGM to defend its case in Nevada,"" Pinkerton said, adding that a jury in MGM Resorts' hometown might include people with direct or indirect ties to the company and its more than 70,000 employees. The company has said through representatives it won't litigate shooting lawsuits in the media. In statements, it has blamed the massacre on the gunman, Stephen Paddock. Defendants in the new lawsuits also include Live Nation Entertainment, the concert promoter. In a statement, the Beverly Hills, California-based company expressed sorrow for ""countless people forever impacted by this senseless act of violence"" and said it was cooperating with an active FBI investigation. It declined to comment about the lawsuits. Documents submitted Monday in Los Angeles also seek compensation from Paddock's estate. They included a refiling of a negligence claim originally filed Oct. 10 in Las Vegas on behalf of a wounded California woman, Paige Gasper. That case was dismissed Friday in Nevada. ""Most of our clients from California."" Pinkerton said. ""Most all are getting their treatment here."" The new lawsuits followed a wave of cases filed last week in Nevada state court in Las Vegas on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot, injured or say they were traumatized trying to escape. A Chicago law firm helped prepare those filings, involving plaintiffs from the Chicago area and a California man who was shot and wounded. Police and the FBI say the 64-year-old Paddock rained bursts of gunfire for 10 minutes from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people in the concert venue across Las Vegas Boulevard. Paddock, a high-stakes video poker gambler with homes in Reno and the southern Nevada resort town of Mesquite spent several days amassing an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammunition in a two-room suite. Authorities say he killed himself before officers reached his room. A motive for the deadly rampage has not been identified. Plaintiffs in mass-shooting lawsuits face a high legal bar to prove responsibility and liability by someone other than the shooter, and lawsuits can take years in court. But Pinkerton said he believes he can show that tragedy could have been avoided if hotel and corporate officials followed hotel weapon possession policies already in place and implemented recent safety recommendations. ""We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that,"" the lawyer said. ""This was the largest venue security failure in U.S. history.""

The concert promoter is among several parties named as defendants in a new wave of lawsuits filed on Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, including the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (where the shooter was located) and its parent company MGM Resorts International. According to The Los Angeles Times, the victims’ lawyers claim that the festival did not have “adequate exits or properly trained employees for when the crowd began trying to evacuate,” resulting in more harm. The October 1 shooting ended with 58 killed and hundreds more injured from gunshot wounds or trampling. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Live Nation for further comment.

Barbra: The Music… The Mem’ries… The Magic!, a new Netflix concert film out Wednesday, shows a side of Barbra Streisand that audiences have rarely seen. Comprised of moments from her 2016 show in Miami and the making of her 2016 album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, the nearly two-hour film takes fans on a ride through her six-decade career. But as the title suggests, it’s not just songs: Streisand shares funny stories with her audience, touching on everything from her directorial debut in 1983’s Yentl (“There’s nothing like your first time”) to shooting the cover of A Star is Born (“If you’re wondering what I was wearing during that shoot… it was musk”). The tales are also illuminating, clueing fans in on how Streisand controls everything in her career, right down to the winged tip of her eyeliner. “I’ve done it from the beginning,” she says of her makeup. “When I was doing Funny Girl,they said, ‘We’re going to make you up.’ I said, ‘What? Let’s do two tests: You make me up for one, and I’ll make myself up for one.’ They did agree that mine was better.” Read on for more must-see highlights from Barbra: The Music… The Mem’ries… The Magic! Midway through the first act, Streisand interprets Carole King’s “Being at War with Each Other” from the singer-songwriter’s 1973 album Fantasy. “Maybe I’m crazy, but I don’t understand it/Why do we seem to vote to dig more holes?” sings Streisand, whose support of the Democratic Party stretches back several decades. “It’s such a waste of a planet.” Standing in front of pictures showing war-torn cities, mass-shooting tragedies, and pride parades, Streisand’s message is simple and powerful: Love is always the answer. One of the most powerful reminders of Babs’ vocal prowess is when she pays homage to Yentl, for which she became the first woman to win Best Director at the Golden Globes. Her voice soars during “Papa Can You Hear Me?” — an excellent reminder of how just a few notes from Streisand can give you chills. In the second act, Streisand introduces the song “Isn’t This Better” from Funny Lady — the Funny Girl sequel — with an amusing story about Liza Minelli performing the song at a Streisand tribute. “It was so beautiful, the song, but I couldn’t place the song or why she was singing it, so I asked her, ‘Liza, why did you sing that song?’ And she said, ‘Barbra, you sang it in Funny Lady!” Then Babs fully takes on the role of her character, Fanny Brice, delivering sassy renditions of “How Lucky Can You Get” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” The resulting ovation is deserved. Even though Streisand can still carry a show on her own, she welcomes Jamie Foxx to the stage for a mesmerizing duet of “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” from The Sound of Music. “I wanted to sing with Jamie Foxx because he just has such a fantastic voice and soulful — very, very soulful — sound,” she says. That’s quite a compliment coming from Streisand, and Foxx lives up to it alongside the legend.

According to a news release from the Siloam Springs Police Department, Timothy Constantin was arrested Tuesday. On Nov. 14, officers responded to a residence hall at John Brown University after reports of a suicidal student who had “made references to committing a mass shooting or bombing.” After searching Constantin's dorm room at J. Alvin Brown Hall, police found firearms and ammunition, according to the release. Authorities said that witnesses told officers Constantin had been constructing and testing explosives off-campus. Police said Constantin later admitted to constructing explosive devices, though no evidence had been located Tuesday. In a statement, the university said it was increasing the number of armed guards on campus and reviewing training procedures after the arrest. “While the student indicated thoughts of harm to himself and potentially to others, to the best of our knowledge there was not a specific plan to carry out any type of campus attack nor was there a specific person targeted,” the university said. As of Tuesday, the 20-year-old remained at Benton County jail on a charge of criminal possession of explosives. No bail has been set. The investigation is ongoing.

103,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-ask-amy-ae-1122-story.html,"Dear Amy: I'm a young SAHM (stay-at-home mom) of a 5-month-old baby. My husband and I worked hard to budget, pay off debt and cut expenses prior to our baby being born. I'm the only mom in my friend group who stays home, and recently I've been getting asked to babysit (for free) quite frequently. One friend asked me well in advance to drive across town to pick their daughter up from school two days in a row and watch her until they got home. I agreed, knowing that the child care they had lined up had fallen through. Under those circumstances, I was happy to help. A week later, that same friend is asking me to watch their child for an entire day because she works and her husband has made other plans. I really don't want to do it, but feel bad knowing that I have no excuse. I just don't want to. Their child is much older than my own and requires a lot of attention. It's way different than my infant and takes away from my bonding with him. If there was some financial compensation I would be more inclined to do it, but I feel like free babysitting should be kept for times when they are REALLY in a bind. How can I politely decline without feeling guilty, or making up an excuse? -- SAHM Dear SAHM: If you are the only SAHM in your friend group, you might be fielding requests from several different sets of parents. Your job is to take care of your child, and to live your own life the way you want to. Because you are a good person and a good friend you will occasionally want to help out other parents who are facing an emergency. However, ""I'm working and my husband has other plans"" does not qualify as an emergency. And this friend should always offer to reciprocate when you step in. One way to handle this might be to leverage your own needs when replying to a request: ""I can take 'Sara' for the day, but could you reciprocate by taking care of 'James' this Saturday afternoon?"" Or if you want compensation, ask for it: ""What would you normally be paying your sitter for these days? I'll do it for the same fee."" Many parents would be thrilled to pay for a steady and reliable backup. Here are other words to say: ""I'm sorry you are in such a jam but I can't help you out. You really need to find backup child care, other than me."" Don't succumb to the temptation to pile on explanations, rationales, etc. Keep it simple. Dear Amy: This year has been one of the hardest of my life. My grandmother passed away, my uncle died from a stroke, my sister was killed in a car accident, I went through my first romantic heartbreak and I suffered a miscarriage. I've always been a positive person, and I am fighting to maintain that in my life right now. In an effort to do that, I am avoiding news reports on current events. I do this just so I won't break. Recently a co-worker asked me about a mass shooting and I expressed why I didn't keep up with such things. She scolded me, telling me I needed to be aware of these tragedies. Amy, I don't want to! I don't want to know that people kill each other for no reason. I am doing everything I can just to get out of bed some days! This co-worker complained that I was being rude. Was I? Am I wrong because I don't want to know about these things? -- Surviving in Texas Dear Surviving: I hear you. And I completely understand your instincts to avoid bad news. Unless you work in the news business, you have no obligation to keep up-to-date on the almost daily string of tragedies befalling us right now. I don't know if you were rude to your co-worker. But protecting and then defending yourself isn't rude -- it's your duty. Dear Amy: ""Not Easy"" described pressuring a guy in a fairly new relationship (four dates!) about being exclusive. I agreed with you that it is wise not to have sex until you are exclusive, but this means that all parties need to be patient. Sounds like a mismatch to me. -- Been There Dear Been There: It seemed to me like ""Not Easy"" was trapped between her values and the fact that she really wanted to have sex.

104,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/22/nyc-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-security/,"Trending: NEW YORK — Sand-filled sanitation trucks and police sharpshooters will mix with glittering floats and giant balloons at a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade that comes in a year of terrible mass shootings and not even a month after a deadly truck attack in lower Manhattan. New York City’s mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that layers of security, along with hundreds of officers, will be in place for one of the nation’s biggest outdoor holiday gatherings, and that visitors should not be deterred. “We had a couple of tough months as a nation,” Police Commissioner James O’Neill said. “We won’t ever accept such acts of hate and cowardice as inevitable in our society.” A posting last year in an English-language magazine of the Islamic State group, which took credit for the Oct. 31 truck attack that killed eight people, mentioned the Thanksgiving parade as “an excellent target.” Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat. “I want to assure the people that we swore to protect that anytime something happens anywhere in the world, the NYPD works with our law enforcement partners and studies it and we learn from it and it informs our decision making going forward,” O’Neill said. This year’s security plan includes dozens of city sanitation trucks, which weigh about 16 tons empty and up to twice that with sand, that will be lined up as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street along the 2 ½-mile parade route stretching from Central Park to Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street. In addition, officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors will walk among the crowds, and sharpshooters on rooftops will scan building windows and balconies for anything unusual. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday that security at the parade increases every year “because we understand we are dealing with a very challenging world.” He told crowds gathered to watch the parade’s giant balloons being inflated that “the amount of resources and personnel we put in has increased each year to make us safer.” New York officials also are asking the tens of thousands of spectators to be alert for anything suspicious. “There will be a cop on every block,” said NYPD Chief of Patrol Terence Monahan. “Go to that cop and say something.” The 91st annual parade begins at 9 a.m. and will be broadcast live on NBC. Smokey Robinson, Jimmy Fallon, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean will be among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway’s “Anastasia,” ”Dear Evan Hansen” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” New balloons added this year include Dr. Seuss’ Grinch, Olaf from the smash movie “Frozen,” and a puppy called Chase from Nickelodeon’s “Paw Patrol.” Beyond the pageantry, police say they have been working on security for the parade since the moment last year’s parade ended. It’s a plan that got renewed attention after a terror attack in lower Manhattan Oct. 31, when a man in a rented truck barreled onto a crowded bike path near the World Trade Center, killing eight people. Authorities said the 29-year-old suspect operated from a playbook put out by the Islamic State group. Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, was charged with federal terrorism offenses that could qualify him for the death penalty. According to a criminal complaint, he made statements about his allegiance to the Islamic State group. Police also are mindful of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas in which a high-stakes gambler and real estate investor unleashed gunfire on country music concert-goers, killing 58 and leaving hundreds injured. The first major New York event since the bike path attack — the New York marathon, which drew tens of thousands of spectators and 50,000 runners from around the world — went off with no problems. “We said right away New York’s response is to remain strong and resilient,” de Blasio said. “We do not back down in the face of terror threats.

She has posted a video on Twitter and YouTube describing the incident and asking others to share their stories. Speier says, Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  Jackie Speier was a 23-year-old congressional staffer excited about her new job on Capitol Hill when her chief of staff got her alone in a room. The 50-year-old grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat. Now, four and a half decades later, the Peninsula congresswoman is leading the charge in Congress to clean up what she calls a culture of sexual harassment in the Capitol. Since she went public with her story in late October, she’s been thrust into the national spotlight, introduced legislation to streamline harassment reporting procedures, testified at hearings on the topic and shed light on the big settlements paid out with taxpayers’ money to silence harassment complaints. “I’m embarrassed to say it, but I think Congress has been an enabler of sexual harassers for a long time,” Speier, a Democrat who represents San Mateo County, said in an interview this week. Speier has worked on sexual harassment policies for decades, beginning in California’s state Capitol. But when she was accosted in 1973, there weren’t any official channels to report what had happened — and even the term “sexual harassment” hadn’t entered the vernacular. “There was nowhere I could go,” she said. As wave after wave of sexual harassment revelations hit Hollywood and the media this fall, Speier shared her story in a YouTube video. She looked directly into the camera, urging other congressional staffers to come forward with their experiences with harassment and blasting the “breeding ground for a hostile work environment” that she says Congress has become. Speier is now the lead sponsor of a bill that would reform the Office of Compliance, the obscure congressional office that investigates — and, activists say, often covers up — sexual harassment. Victims of harassment in Congress who want to report their experiences have to go through a byzantine process, submitting to mandatory counseling, signing a nondisclosure agreement and waiting months before an investigation into their claims even begins. And interns and fellows still have no official channels to report sexual harassment. Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. Sign Up From 1997 to 2016, the office paid out $15 million to settle sexual harassment complaints and other discrimination cases, without any real transparency or accounting of the claims. The office “was really created to protect the harassers,” Speier said. Her legislation would shake that up, prohibiting nondisclosure agreements as a requirement to start an investigation, speeding the process and including interns and fellows. It would also require members of Congress reimburse the federal Treasury for any sexual harassment settlements paid out because of their actions going forward. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has received bipartisan support. While Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, hasn’t publicly commented on the effort to reform the office, he has supported another Speier bill to mandate sexual harassment training for members of Congress and their staff. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat who is co-sponsoring the reform bill, said she had never known about Speier’s experience with harassment as a young staffer, even though the two were both working on Capitol Hill at the time. She praised her Bay Area colleague for speaking up. “It empowered people, and she just opened a floodgate,” Lofgren said. “I think we probably will have momentum on her bill.” As a California state assemblywoman and senator from 1986 to 2006, Speier wrote legislation mandating sexual harassment training. She said the recent allegations of sexual harassment in Sacramento — where almost 150 women recently wrote a letter decrying a culture of harassment — were disturbing. “I’m dismayed that (the training) didn’t have the effect we wanted,” she said. “It does seem like it’s an Animal House up there right now — it’s disgusting.” She urged California’s legislative leaders to take swift action. “It starts at the top,” she said. “To the extent that the leadership tolerates it, the conduct exists.” Since being elected to Congress in 2008, Speier has worked on issues like sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. In 2014, she tried to pass an amendment to the legislative budget mandating sexual harassment prevention training, but the chairman of the rules committee didn’t allow the measure to be debated. She also tried to add in more funding in the legislative budget for the compliance office to do more outreach, only to have that money removed in later revisions. “There was no willingness to look at this issue at all,” she said, unlike in recent weeks. “To see the change this dramatic is reassuring that if you take full advantage of timing, you can accomplish a lot.” But Speier said that she knows that national attention can be fickle, and thinks that she and other advocates may have a limited window to pass reforms while the focus is on sexual harassment. She pointed to the long-running debate over gun control, noting how congressional resolve to pass more firearm regulations gains steam after a mass shooting, only to dissolve within weeks or even days. “This has captured the interest of every American,” she said of the harassment issue. “I do think that we are in a defining moment culturally — which, at my age, I’m just reassured is happening.” That moment definitely hadn’t happened 44 years ago when Speier was forcibly kissed by her chief of staff, Joe Holsinger, who died in 2004. The two worked in the office of Rep. Leo Ryan, whose old district Speier now represents. Speier was shocked when Holsinger grabbed and kissed her, not understanding how he could think it was acceptable. “I recoiled, and I made sure I was never alone with him in a room ever again,” she said. Going public in the YouTube video wasn’t the first time that Speier used her own experiences as powerful arguments in policy debates. She made headlines in 2011 when she gave an impromptu speech on the House floor about having an abortion in the early 1990s after doctors told her she was losing a baby that she desperately wanted. In 1988, Speier became the first California legislator to give birth while in office. And she’s also known for surviving five gunshot wounds in November 1978 while investigating the People’s Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, with Congressman Ryan, who was killed in the attack. Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University, said that Speier’s decision to share her experience of harassment was a smart way to prod Congress to act. “Lawmakers make better policy when they have a variety of experiences,” Levinson said. “It’s vitally important that this isn’t just something where we get outside testimony of how sexual harassment can affect people, but it’s someone on the inside who can say, ‘Let me talk to you about my personal experience.”’ Since she released the video, Speier said she’s talked in person to four House staffers who have experienced harassment or assault, and on the phone to “many others.” Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles newscaster, said she decided to publicly accuse Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, of harassing and groping her after interviewing Speier and hearing her story. Tweeden wrote in an article that she came forward because she wanted to have the same effect on other victims of harassment “that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me.” Speier has said she knows of two current members of Congress, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, who have been accused of sexual harassment. Neither of those is Franken or Rep. John Conyers, who was also the subject of public allegations this week, Speier said. And she’s not naming names. “Women and men who are inspired by public service come to Congress,” she said, “and we have to create an environment that’s not hostile.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-11-22 16:17:23,How Jackie Speier used her own experience to shine the spotlight on sexual harassment,,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/

110,http://theweek.com/10things/732681/10-things-need-know-today-november-13-2017,"Athit Perawongmetha/AFP/Getty Images 1 President Trump said Monday he had a ""great relationship"" with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte after their first formal one-on-one meeting. Trump declined to answer questions about whether he had pressed human rights issues with Duterte, an authoritarian leader accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the issue of human rights ""briefly came up in the context of the Philippines' fight against illegal drugs."" Duterte's spokesman said Duterte talked about the ""drug menace"" but Trump never mentioned human rights. Duterte, who had tense relations with former President Barack Obama, expressed his affinity for Trump at a Sunday dinner by singing a Philippine love ballad that includes the line, ""You are the love I've been waiting for."" 2 A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck near the Iraq-Iran border in the Iraqi city of Halabja on Sunday, killing at least 330 people, most of them in Iran. Iran's state-run news agency reported that at least 328 people were killed and about 3,950 were injured in the country. News videos showed people fleeing their homes in the night. More than 100 aftershocks were reported. At least seven people died in Iraq, and at least 535 were injured. The quake, which was centered just over 200 miles north of Baghdad, was felt across Iraq and as far away Pakistan, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Turkey. Iran sits on several major fault lines and experiences frequent earthquakes. A magnitude 6.6 temblor killed 26,000 people in the historic city of Bam in 2003. 3 The congregation of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, gathered Sunday for its first service since a gunman murdered 26 worshippers a week ago. The members of the small church and hundreds of others met at a baseball field about a half-mile from the church, which would have been too small to accommodate the crowd. The church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, has vowed to start arming himself when he preaches, but said his faith was unshaken. Pomeroy, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in the mass shooting, said the surviving church members should ""not allow the lives that were lost or the families hurt lie in vain."" 4 Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore continued to mostly deny allegations from four women that he initiated inappropriate physical relationships when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers as young as 14, telling a Christian Citizen Task Force forum on Sunday that The Washington Post, which reported the accusations after speaking with 30 people who knew Moore in the late 1970s and early '80s, had printed false allegations ""for which they will be sued."" Meanwhile, four polls since Thursday show a dead heat between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones, and Senate Republicans and the White House are increasingly distancing themselves from Moore. Two GOP senators — Tim Scott (S.C.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) — said Sunday they find the accusations more credible than Moore's denials. 5 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said Sunday in his first TV interview since he unexpectedly announced his resignation last week that he would be returning home from Saudi Arabia ""within days."" Hariri rejected suggestions by opponents and allies alike that Saudi Arabia, which is increasingly clashing with Iran, had coerced him into resigning and accusing the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its ally, Iran, for destabilizing Lebanon and the region. Hariri said he was free to travel ""if I wanted to,"" but that he was being careful about returning to Lebanon to avoid being assassinated like his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in a 2005 car bombing blamed on Hezbollah members. 6 Two former top U.S. intelligence officials on Sunday said Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be manipulating President Trump with flattery. A day earlier, Trump dismissed the intelligence chiefs, former CIA Director John Brennan, and ex-National Intelligence Director James Clapper, as ""political hacks"" and questioned their agencies' shared conclusion that Russia meddled in last year's U.S. presidential election. Trump walked back his criticism on Sunday, saying that he believes that Putin really feels that Russia did not interfere in the election, but that, ""I believe very much in our intelligence agencies,"" which Trump said are ""currently led by fine people."" 7 Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar, a 34-year-old Green Beret who died in Mali in June, had discovered that two members of SEAL Team Six, who are now being investigated in his death, were stealing money from a fund used to pay local informants, The Daily Beast reported on Sunday, citing five members of the special-operations community. Melgar's wife said he had told her he had a bad feeling about two SEALs he was working with and would tell her more when he returned home. The SEALs told superiors that Melgar was drunk during hand-to-hand fighting exercises, but no drugs or alcohol were found in his body in an autopsy. Military investigators believe Melgar lost consciousness in an early morning altercation with the SEALs. 8 North Korean troops shot and injured a fellow soldier on Monday as he dashed across the heavily armed border into South Korea as the two countries remain on high alert due to tensions over the North's missile and nuclear weapons programs. South Korean soldiers found the defector about 55 yards south of the border line and took him to a hospital, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to an elbow and shoulder. The incident occurred as the U.S. and South Korea conduct joint naval exercises involving three American aircraft carriers off South Korea's east coast. This is the first time in a decade the U.S. has used three carrier groups in the drills, in a show of the kind of force President Trump has said Americans ""hope to God we never have to use"" against Pyongyang. 9 Uber on Sunday approved SoftBank's offer to invest billions in the ride-hailing company. The Japanese conglomerate will lead a consortium of investors to buy at least 14 percent of Uber. SoftBank reportedly plans to buy about $1 billion of fresh Uber stock at the ride-hailing service's current valuation of about $68.5 billion, and purchase about $9 billion worth of existing shares from current Uber shareholders. The deal is expected to pave the way for sweeping governance changes at Uber, which has shaken up its leadership following complaints about sexual harassment and a toxic corporate culture, and a move to take the company public by 2019. 10 Longtime New York tabloid gossip columnist Liz Smith died on Sunday at her Manhattan home. She was 94. Smith chronicled the lives of the rich and famous for more than 30 years, writing her column for publications including the New York Daily News, Newsday, and finally the New York Post, where it appeared from 1995 to 2009, before it moved onto the internet in the New York Social Diary. For years, her column was syndicated and was published in up to 70 other newspapers. She occasionally got big scoops, such as Donald and Ivana Trump's 1990 split and Madonna's 1996 pregnancy, but Smith was known for a more gentle approach to gossip than the brutal, sensationalist style of many of her competitors, which led critics to accuse her of going easy on celebrities to stay in their good graces.

112,http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/26/tri-valley-letters-3/,"Trending: As customers of the East Bay Municipal Utility District, we are appalled and very concerned that something is not right with our meter readings. Perhaps we are feeding the salaries of upper management. Hundreds of customers from Danville and Alamo are saying that their water bills have doubled or tripled in the last five or six months. We are only two adults, our children are out of the house. Our last bill was for 1,665 gallons a day, amounting to a whopping 103,224 gallons for two months. We have a landscaped yard, but we do a lot of hand watering. I understand EBMUD uses a tier system to compute the bill amount. For instance, if we go to the top tier after a certain amount they charge $6.27 a gallon. So is it plausible that every time we flush the toilet it costs that amount? This is ridiculous, ludicrous and infuriating. California has over-the-top gas prices, sales taxes, etc. A bill of $937 for two people for two months is over the top. Some people have had bills of $1,500 or close to $2,000. They go on vacation for three weeks, and the bill goes higher. A child goes off to college, and the bill exceeds the last bill. We adhered to conservation during the drought and now we are being swindled by the utility company that apparently has not one ounce of morality or honest business practices — another corporation abusing their customers. We are all fed up. — Dianne and Steve Scheck, Alamo I became involved in the gun violence prevention movement after the Isla Vista shootings in 2014. I’m outraged to see another mass shooting in the news, this time across multiple locations in Tehama County, including an elementary school. Tragically, this is the 49th school shooting in America this year. Reports indicate that the shooting may have started as a domestic violence incident and that the gunman’s neighbors had expressed concern about threatening behavior. California is a leader in passing gun violence prevention laws like the Gun Violence Restraining Order that more people ought to know about, which can help save lives. GVRO creates a mechanism for family and household members to work with law enforcement to temporarily remove guns and prevent the purchase of new guns by individuals who pose a potential risk to themselves or others. Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, The Brady Campaign and others fought hard to pass GVRO. I encourage readers to visit speakforsafety.org for more information. This law can save lives from gun violence. — Joan Kazerounian, Tri-Valley Moms Demand Action, Danville The name “Lions Club” inspires well-deserved respect for the organization’s nonsectarian philanthropy. Unfortunately, a rogue chapter has recently chosen to pursue an action that will certainly disparage the Lions Club’s good name. In 1971, the Albany Lions erected a large cross on the summit of Albany Hill. There was no opposition at the time because the land was privately owned by a Lions Club member. Several years later, the land was transferred to the city of Albany. At the same time, an easement was surreptitiously granted to the Albany Lions Club for maintenance of the cross. In recent years, opposition to this religious symbol on government land has increased. The obvious resolution of this issue is to remove the cross to private property. What has been the Lions’ response? They filed a lawsuit against the city of Albany in federal court. Shame on the Albany Lions. Certainly the vast sums this legal case will consume could be put to better use — by all parties involved. — Burt Bogardus, Danville The news that Don Trump Jr. was corresponding with WikiLeaks is not surprising. Trump Jr., like his father, radiates the aura of a slick salesman who will do anything for a buck. The fact that the editor, Julian Assange has allegedly been under investigation for espionage, computer fraud, hacking and receiving stolen sensitive data doesn’t seem to bother Junior. As I recall, the United States was working on charges against Assange as recently as last spring, but I haven’t heard anything since. Does this mean that the Trump administration has conveniently forgotten about it? Jeff Sessions does have a memory problem. I would like to say to Sessions a few words from Gen. Flynn: Lock them up. — H.T. Nelson, Danville A letter writer essentially says that men must overcome our evolutionary programming to refrain from sexual assault. But if we’re just evolved animals, why should we do this? After all, we don’t judge other animals for their sexual behavior. The only reason men shouldn’t commit sexual assault or that any of us should refrain from anything regarded as wrong is because we’re not just animals. The only sustainable explanation for why right and wrong (and human rights) exist is because we have been made by God to be rational and moral beings. It’s also why the writer’s claim that men are programmed to dominate and to get as much sex as possible is wrong. Rather, men and women have been programmed by God to regard sex as the ultimate physical expression of the love between a man and a woman in marriage. I realize many will reject this and some will regard it as ridiculous. But what you can’t do is refute it or provide any other rationale for why we are moral beings. — Christopher Andrus, Dublin The #metoo uproar isn’t a political issue. It’s about our human consciousness as a whole. I come from a time when it was normal for men to not respect women. My dad would whine about women drivers. It was normal for boys to talk about girls in degrading ways. There is no excuse for sexual assault. As animals, we guys are programmed to dominate and to want as much sex as possible. Many mammal species organize around alpha males dominating and having harems of females. That programming is in all of us, me included. But I see my choices as having consequences that I am responsible for, which is why I act more as a man and not an animal. Humans are still evolving. The most powerful lessons we learn in life are typically the most painful, and that’s why this is hurting so many. — Russ Button, Alameda Keeping the Net neutral is one of the most important issues of our time. The Internet is a hotbed of innovation, a platform for free speech and an educational tool without peer. The people we speak with and the sites we visit online influence or reflect our way of thinking. Consider then how disastrous it would be to hand over control of this to corporations, whose first and foremost interest is profit — for people to be gated and herded towards content that perhaps supports the political views that benefit that corporation best. For businesses to be shut out of the global market because they weren’t big enough to stand up to an ISP. Or for a customer to be denied access to so many of the resources that currently arm our populace with knowledge, with skills. Keeping the Internet neutral is critical.

113,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/26/las-vegas-gun-shows-route-91-shooting,"Two months after 58 people died and nearly 500 were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, a pillar of tourism is wobbling – maybe Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST This weekend saw the return of the Great Las Vegas Gun Show, one of the first firearms shows in the city since it saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. On 1 October, Stephen Paddock holed up inside the Mandalay Bay hotel with nearly 50 weapons and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition. Shooting down on the Route 91 Harvest festival, he killed 58 people and injured 489.  On Saturday, in an off-strip convention hall, vendors sold handguns, semi-automatic rifles and ammunition to locals and tourists. Displays advertised holsters, rifle cases, tactical gear and multi-colored grips. For women, there were bedazzled concealed-carry purses and petite, lightweight guns in Tiffany blue; for the kids, camouflage bags that read: “My first rifle”. But a black fabric partition cut the convention hall by a third, shrinking a room that in recent years has been filled to the brim. In terms of attendance, the Great Las Vegas Gun Show did not appear nearly as great. “This is actually smaller than it’s been,” said Robert Fares of Silver Bullet Concealment, a company based in the city. “Just a year ago, it stretched all the way down.” Las Vegas hosts gun shows at casinos and convention centers throughout the year. Several were canceled following the Route 91 shooting. One show, Crossroads of the West, would have occurred a few weeks after Paddock’s attack, in the same convention hall as this weekend’s show. After conversations between organizers and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, it was cancelled out of respect to the dead. Mike Zolczer has a home-based company, Polyphonic Audio, which sells custom hearing protection. Following Route 91, he said, “business has been a dead crawl, because most of my money comes from gun shows”. Like Zolczer, Silver Bullet Concealment referred to a decline in business shortly after the mass shooting. It said sales were slowly returning to normal. Midwest Arms Collector, the organizer of the Great Las Vegas Gun Show, declined to release numbers on attendance, describing it as “average”. It did not associate any spike or decline in sales with the Route 91 shooting, instead citing an overall national decrease in gun sales since Donald Trump’s election victory. Some argue that gun sales decrease under Republican presidents because gun owners do not fear increased regulation. Still, the modest crowd at the first Vegas gun show in weeks did not reflect expectations on the busiest shopping weekend of the year. Discussion of Route 91, of Paddock, of good guys versus bad guys with guns – as well as a general distrust of media – could be heard throughout the hall. “You can identify as anything you want,” said Robert Fares, a vendor. “Just don’t make me pay for it, and don’t infringe your desires upon me. If I want to own a dozen high-capacity magazines, that’s my right.” On Saturday, many pursued that right. Vendors selling assault rifles drew a stream of attendees. Women waited as their boyfriends aimed rifles toward the ceiling, peering through scopes. Among the crowd were families with kids and strollers passing tables lined with tub after tub of clips and magazines. Handwritten signs displayed the number of rounds, from five to 40. What were not clearly advertised or on display were bump stocks, the device Paddock used to make his semi-automatic weapons fire more like automatic ones. In the aftermath of the shooting, political momentum seemed to gather to ban them. But in Congress, at least, that momentum has stalled. A string of gun shows are due to be staged in Nevada over the next two months, culminating at the end of January with the daddy of them all, the Shot Show, the world’s largest, which usually attracts more than 60,000 attendees. It will be housed in the Sands Expo Center on the Las Vegas Strip, three miles north of the Mandalay Bay. Convention sales constitute a major portion of Las Vegas tourism revenue, sales at gun and firearms shows prominent among them. Since 1 October, the city has been actively combating any suggestion that it is no longer safe. Billboards on the strip, city events and commercials blaze slogans: “Vegas Strong”, “Vegas Resilient”, “Vegas Together”. Two of the canceled October gun shows were to take place in casinos. How the return of such shows to resort properties will affect tourists remains to be seen. For over a month after the shooting, the Route 91 festival site remained largely intact, still displaying banners, signage and vendor equipment, as law enforcement slowly released items from the crime scene. At the Mandalay Bay, glass now covers the windows Paddock shot out. But they are a slightly different color from the panes around them. They stand out like a scar.",2017-11-26 11:35:50,‘Dead crawl’: Vegas gun shows said to slow in wake of Route 91 massacre,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
114,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-las-vegas-survivor-dies-hit-and-run-20171126-story.html,"Roy McClure had been gone for days. Calls to his phone had gone to voice mail, his wife wrote in a Thursday Facebook post asking people to let her know if anyone had seen her husband. Denise McClure learned on the same day that Roy was killed in a hit-and-run crash days earlier, on Nov. 17, seven weeks after he survived the Oct. 1 Las Vegas massacre. Roy McClure was in Pahrump in southern Nevada, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas, the day he was killed. He had a fight with a friend and took off about 2 a.m. and was not heard from since, Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. The crash occurred at Homestead Road and Highway 160 in Pahrump, NBC affiliate KSNV reported. A spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a call and email from The Washington Post, but the agency told local media that McClure was walking illegally on the highway when the crash occurred. Roy McClure left behind not only his wife, but also two sisters, Denise McClure said. The Washington Post was not able to immediately reach McClure on Sunday, but she told KSNV that her husband had been attending therapy sessions since the Route 91 Harvest festival massacre. On that day in October, a gunman on the 32nd floor hotel suite of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino rained down bullets on thousands of concertgoers. The shooter, Stephen Paddock, was found later found dead inside the suite. Nearly 60 people were killed and hundreds were injured. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting in the country's recent history. Denise McClure said she and her husband were at the concert. As they were escaping from bullets, Roy McClure stopped along the way to help people, she told KSNV. ""Those who knew him know he had his battles but also knew he had a big heart. He was a survivor of the Route 91 shooting, instead of running away he went back in. He helped transport people to the hospital. Roy also loved helping people and would literally give the shirt off his back,"" Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. Criminal charges are pending against the driver, KSNV reported. It's unclear why the driver fled or whether alcohol was involved. ""This isn't what I wanted for him,"" Denise McClure told the TV station. ""I don't understand why he wasn't taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he's safe now."" A month before Roy McClure's death, a California couple who also survived the Las Vegas shooting died outside their Southern California home in Murrieta. Dennis and Lorraine Carver were killed in a fiery crash just before 11 p.m. on Oct. 16. Dennis Carver was trying to round a curve when the 2010 Mercedes-Benz sedan he was driving veered off the roadway and into a grassy area, said Officer William Strom, a traffic officer for the California Highway Patrol. The car crashed into a metal intercom speaker. Its back struck a brick column that was part of a fence; the impact ripped the car's rear axle and ruptured the gas tank, Strom said. The car struck another brick column, rolled onto its side and caught fire. Strom said the couple died immediately. Police do not suspect foul play. The couple, who lived part-time in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, left behind two daughters, ages 20 and 16.

X OUR PICKS: The FBI received more than 200,000 requests for instant gun background checks Friday, nearly a 10 percent increase from the year before and a record for a single day. That’s not an anomaly. According to the FBI, the previous two records for background checks also were set on Black Fridays. The checks, required of anyone who buys a gun from a federally licensed dealer, are a rough indicator of firearm sales. While 203,086 background checks were requested Friday, the actual number of firearms sold is likely higher, USA Today reported, because multiple firearms can be included in one transaction by a single buyer. The growth in sales comes during a national discussion over gun regulations. On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and ATF to look at potential problems in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. Sessions wants the agencies to fix problems with how the military and other federal entities report convictions that could keep someone from having a gun. The database “is critically important to protecting the American public from firearms related violence,” Sessions wrote in his memo. “It is, however, only as reliable and robust as the information that federal, state, local and tribal government entities make available to it.” The directive comes after the U.S. Air Force conceded it had never submitted the domestic-abuse conviction of Devin P. Kelley to the NICS database. Kelley purchased a Ruger AR-556 rifle with a 30-round magazine and used it to mow down a church full of parishioners in Sutherland Springs, Texas, earlier this month. It was the largest mass shooting in Texas history.Related Articles

That's not an anomaly. According to the FBI, the previous two records for background checks were also set on the day after the federal holiday in which Americans give thanks for the year's blessings.

124,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-guns-mass-shootings-hoax-conspiracy-theories,"After mass shootings, survivors and victims’ families face a second round of attacks online – and fighting back is ‘like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter’ Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Mike Cronk was sitting half-naked on a street corner, hands covered in blood, when the TV news reporter approached. The 48-year-old, who had used his shirt to try to plug a bullet wound in his friend’s chest, recounted in a live interview how a young man he did not know had just died in his arms. Cronk’s story of surviving the worst mass shooting in modern US history went viral, but many people online weren’t calling him a hero. On YouTube, dozens of videos, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, claimed Cronk was an actor hired to play the part of a victim in the Las Vegas mass shooting on 1 October.  Conspiracy theorists harassed him on Facebook, sending messages like “How much did they pay you?” and “How does it feel to be part of a hoax?” The claims multiplied and soon YouTube’s algorithm began actively promoting the conspiracy theory. Two months later, Cronk’s online reputation appears damaged beyond repair. Type “Mike Cronk” into Google and YouTube, and the sites automatically suggest searches for “actor” and “fake”, leading to popular videos claiming he and his wounded friend were performers and that the Mandalay Bay tragedy that killed 58 people never happened. “It’s awful that we have to go through what we did and then you have a whole new level of attacks on you and who you are,” said Cronk, a retired teacher. “I don’t want negative stuff associated with my name, but how do we stop that?” As record-breaking mass shootings have become a ritual of life in the US, survivors and victims’ families across the country have increasingly faced an onslaught of social media abuse and viral slander. Bullying from the ugliest corners of the internet overwhelms the grief-stricken as they struggle to cope with the greatest horror they’ve ever experienced. The cycles of hoaxer harassment are now as predictable as mass shootings. And yet those with the most power to stop the spread of conspiracy theories have done little to address victims’ cries for help. Alison Parker was a television reporter who was shot dead by a disturbed former colleague during a routine morning broadcast. Her father, Andy Parker, first encountered the conspiracy theorists who believed her murder was a hoax on his YouTube page. Before the shooting, he had uploaded a selection of videos appropriate for a 62-year-old Virginia dad: kayaking footage, recordings of Alison’s dance recital, old commercials in which he appeared as a young actor in New York. Afterwards, strangers online had seized on his decades-old acting career as proof that his daughter’s August 2015 shooting had been staged and that Andy Parker had supposedly been hired to act the role of a grieving father. Commenters said he was part of a plot to trick the public into supporting gun control. “It was like a swarm of locusts,” he recalled. Andy quickly made his page private – but the hoax theorists did not go away. This spring, nearly two years after Alison’s death, as Andy’s wife, Barbara, was searching online for something related to the foundation they had set up to honor their daughter’s memory, she found something else. “The second thing that opened up on Google was a YouTube video that the foundation is just a scam for Andy Parker to make money, a complete hoax.” “I don’t care what they say about me,” Andy said, “but leave the foundation alone. Leave my daughter alone.” It didn’t take much searching for the father to find other YouTube videos. “There were pages, endless pages of stuff.” Posts about Alison’s murder that analyzed footage and photographs, asking why there was no visible blood from her being shot. Others claimed Alison was still alive, that she had had plastic surgery to change her appearance and was now living in Israel. Hoaxers said Andy’s “acting” in TV interviews was subpar. One video of the choked-up father talking about Alison had a caption floating above his forehead: “No tears!” More recently, Cori Langdon, a Las Vegas taxi driver who picked up survivors of the October massacre, became one of the prime targets for conspiracy theorists after she posted video from the scene. Her footage was stolen and republished across the internet and used as “proof” of a number of debunked claims, including the rumor that there was a second shooter. Violent threats quickly filled Langdon’s inbox and populated the comment sections on YouTube and Facebook. People called her “queen of cunts” and “one of the dumbest fucking idiots”.Others said she was “braindead”, “FAKE AS FUCK” and “fucking stupid!”, with one writing: “They should bring this cab driver in for questioning.” “I was a basket case, it was so overwhelming,” she said, recounting the first week after the shooting. One conspiracy theory surrounding Langdon was that she had been killed after the massacre as part of a cover-up. She tried to make light of it, hoping that if the trolls believed she were dead, they would leave her alone. But she recalled one friend telling her: “Somebody might try to kill you, Cori, so they can prove their conspiracy theories.” Meanwhile, Braden Matejka, who survived a gunshot to the head in Vegas, received such a high volume of online attacks and death threats from people calling him an “actor” that he had to close his Facebook account. One message said: “I hope someone truly shoots you.” Lenny Pozner, whose six-year-old son, Noah, was killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in December 2012, has faced some of the most vicious abuse and threats. This year, a woman was sentenced to prison for sending him violent threats, telling him on multiple occasions that death was coming “real soon”. Rob McIntosh, who survived a gunshot to the chest in Las Vegas, said he could not figure out the motives of anonymous users online accusing victims like him of lying: “I don’t know what the driving force behind people being like that is. I don’t understand.” There is no easy way to change the mind of a conspiracy theorist. Colleen Seifert, a University of Michigan psychology professor, said people were inclined to trust content they viewed on YouTube and might be drawn to mass shooting conspiracy theories simply because the tragedies were so implausible and frightening to them. “The idea that you could be innocently going to a concert and could be shot – you don’t want to believe that’s true. You’re protecting your own feeling of security and safety.” It’s unclear how much belief in conspiracy theories has changed over time. A study based on reader letters sent to two major newspapers between 1890 and 2010 found the percentage stayed flat. But in recent years, conspiracy theories have begun to spread at much faster rates online, and many different kinds of people believe them, said Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “It was always assumed that this is just a small group of lunatics,” he said. “We now know, because of representative samples in various countries, that this is really very widespread.” One recent survey suggested that more than half of Americans believe 9/11 conspiracy theories and that more than 40% support theories about alien encounters, global warming and John F Kennedy’s assassination. There is little research on the prevalence of the “crisis actor” theory – a belief that the government or other conspirators stage mass shootings – but the hoaxes now reliably populate social media within the first 24 hours of many shooting tragedies. “It’s typically very hard to discredit a conspiracy theory,” Van Prooijen said. “Anything people say that goes against a conspiracy theory can be seen as a sign that you are a part of the conspiracy theory.” When Langdon, the Vegas taxi driver, briefly took down her viral video from Facebook so she could remove identifying information about her passengers, some conspiracy theorists said it was proof that the FBI was trying to silence her and cover up the truth. “I’m a mainstream media gal. I don’t think the government is after me,” she said. “It just makes me sick.” It can be particularly upsetting to victims of conspiracy theories to discover that intelligent people – and even their own friends – believe hoaxes. Langdon said she learned that a mutual friend was duped by the fake news that she was murdered: “It made me realize, even in my own circle of friends and people I work with, there are people with some crazy imaginations.” Van Prooijen, a widely cited scholar on the subject, said one of his best friends was a conspiracy theorist. The professor hasn’t been able to change his views. Another reason it is so hard to challenge conspiracy theories is the threats and bullying that now arise from simply speaking up. One shooting victim who was subjected to an aggressive harassment campaign did not want to do an interview for fear of inviting further abuse. Journalists and academics are often spammed with hundreds of messages when they write about the subject. Some conspiracy theorists, however, change their tone when they are no longer writing to strangers on the internet. Amy Hallas, a 44-year-old Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, woman, sent dozens of Facebook messages to the family of Braden Matejka, the Vegas victim who survived a gunshot in the head, accusing them of being liars and demanding proof of his injuries. Criticizing a GoFundMe page the family promoted to help raise funds for Matejka during his recovery, she called the family “beyond fake”, saying the victim was guilty of the “worst acting” she had ever seen. In a phone call weeks later, Hallas claimed to the Guardian that she had never attacked the family and said she was just searching for answers. Reminded that she had posted a meme on the Facebook page of Matejka’s brother that called the shooting victim a “lying cunt”, she said she didn’t remember and must have been caught up in the moment. “I do feel bad. They are people, just like everybody else. Who am I to be calling anybody any kind of names?” she said. Asked if she regrets the attacks, she said: “I 100% do, and if I could apologize to them, I would.” Andy Parker, whose daughter was murdered on live television, said he was not interested in understanding the psychology of those claiming a hoax. He said he just wanted the videos off of YouTube. His first step was calling a customer service hotline for Google, which owns YouTube. A young man from Manila, he remembered, explained how he could flag the videos to be taken down. Parker began the work, but after marking about 10 videos, he said, he had to stop. There was footage of his daughter being killed all over the internet, but Parker had never wanted to see it himself. He had changed his YouTube settings so the videos would not automatically play, but even looking at their thumbnail images was too much. “I just couldn’t do it.” The situation made him angry. Couldn’t a company as powerful as Google, he thought, provide a better way to combat conspiracy theorist harassment than asking the father of a murdered journalist to clean up YouTube himself? The internet as we know it is founded on a simple legal principle: companies like YouTube and Twitter are not legally responsible for the content shared on their websites. But the tech corporations have been forced over the years to craft their own ethical standards, defining what kind of material is prohibited. Still, the companies have not shifted far from their core objectives of maximizing engagement – prompting users to share and consume high volumes of content and enabling the instantaneous purchasing of ads without scrutiny. The resulting algorithms are a perfect match for conspiracy theorists. Some grieving parents have turned the grim task of tracking down hoax theory videos into a daily job. In 2014, Pozner, whose child was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, founded the Honr Network, an organization dedicated to holding conspiracy theorists accountable. Hundreds of volunteers now help monitor the offensive content online. With YouTube, Pozner uses different tools to argue that videos should be taken down: invasion of privacy, harassment and, in some cases, copyright infringement. Often, it feels like he’s arguing with a robot – one that makes arbitrary decisions. Sometimes, the flagging process gets results. Other times the videos remain. The whole system, Pozner said, was frustratingly opaque. “If I’ll report something for privacy, they’ll [sometimes] say: ‘We’ve decided not to take any action on this.’ Who do you appeal to, who do you contact, who do you pick up the phone and call?” Parker talked to Pozner about his work, and Honr began flagging the Alison Parker hoax videos. But the conversation only reinforced Parker’s frustration with Google. “I am so grateful to these folks that are doing this … but the problem is, to me, we shouldn’t have to be doing this piecemeal,” Parker said. “It’s like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter. You kill a couple and a bunch of them come back. What we’re doing is demanding that they be responsible corporate citizens.” Parker said YouTube should pay a team of humans to proactively remove content: “The burden shouldn’t be on us to prove that this content is bad … They’re not acting like a human company.” Parker finally had a call with Google executives in October to discuss the problem, and he said he was now more optimistic that the company would work closely with the Honr network to address harassment. It’s true that it might not be a huge expense for Google to hire one person to deal with Sandy Hook and similar hoax theory videos, said David Karger, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, who researches online harassment. But, he said, “would they need to hire someone else to handle all the white supremacist harassment, and someone else to handle all the gender harassment? It’s an issue of scale.” YouTube, however, has no policy against conspiracy or hoax theory videos in general. In the wake of concerns from Parker and Pozner earlier this year, it clarified internally that hoax theory videos that targeted the victims or family members of public acts of violence would count as harassment, and could be taken down. “Our hearts go out to the families who have suffered these incredibly tragic losses,” a YouTube spokesperson said in an email. “We recognize the challenging issues raised by the victims’ families, and that is why we updated the application of our harassment policy last summer. As a result, we have removed hundreds of these videos as they have been flagged to us and we will continue to do so.” Cronk, the Vegas survivor and target of “crisis actor” hoaxes, said he tried to ignore the slander and attacks and focus on moving forward. He said he felt an obligation to live his life to the fullest, considering how lucky he was to survive. “I’m not going to let it define who I am,” he said. YouTube and Google, however, appear to have other plans for him. After the Guardian sent a number of videos targeting Cronk to company spokespeople, several were removed. Some of the worst ones, however, remained on the site. “They are a business. In my mind, if people can slander people and they are allowing this kind of stuff there … they should absolutely be held responsible,” Cronk said. One video that YouTube did not remove picks apart every comment and expression in one of his first television interviews as signs of his bad acting skills. In the video, titled “Las Vegas Hero Eyewitness or Actor???”, the narrator viciously mocks Cronk for appearing to smile in the interview. “Yeah, Mike Cronk, and I’m totally sure that’s your real name too, wink wink. It was so horrific, so horrific that you had to smirk and smile on camera as you duped us with delight,” the narrator shouts. “Huh, silly boy!” Despite multiple inquiries from the Guardian over several weeks, YouTube still suggests that Mike Cronk is a “crisis actor” in its search bar. The “Eyewitness or Actor?” video, viewed by more than 15,000 people, continues to be one of the top search results.",2017-11-28 10:25:39,US gun violence spawns a new epidemic: conspiracy theorists harassing victims,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Shootings happen, outrage is expressed, debate ensues, preventive measures are suggested. Then the backlash begins. And nothing happens. It’s clear that the cyclical way the media covers America’s gun violence is letting politicians off the hook. Within days of each massacre, the satellite trucks pack up, the headlines fade and the brief opening for a national conversation ends.  We seem to have reached a settled view about gun violence: the politics are too difficult; it is impossible to bring meaningful reform; and a mass shooting every few weeks is becoming normal. It’s time for a different approach. The Guardian US’s Break the Cycle series aims to change the way the media covers American gun violence – and to challenge the orthodoxy that gun reform is a hopeless pursuit. We are asking our readers to support the series by making a contribution. We want to take issue with the vested interests who distort the terms of the debate for their own benefit. We want to spotlight progress that has been made, and offer possible solutions. We recognise the challenges in changing the terms of the debate – but that is precisely the role of an organization like the Guardian. The series began with a story about 10 recent victories in gun violence prevention, as well as a profile of what it’s like for survivors of previous mass shootings to watch the coverage of a new one. To accept that America’s gun violence is an intractable problem is an insult the memory of all of those who have died from gun violence.Research suggests that while Americans support the second amendment right to bear arms, large majorities are also open to considering some measures of control. Partisan agendas are often out of step with shifts in public opinion that are happening on the ground. Our commitment is to report, over a sustained period, what works to prevent violence. Our coverage will be guided by research and evidence. It will acknowledge that there is much that is wrong with the polarised coverage – on both sides. Dismissing gun owners as paranoid or irrational is one of the fundamental errors of the current debate. If we want to save lives, we need to recognize that gun owners and gun rights advocates are important partners. But saving lives is not just a question of how to deal with the grotesque eruptions of mass shootings. More than 36,000 people die from gunshot wounds in America each year – and more than 20,000 of those are suicides. To drive change, we must also examine domestic violence, accidental killings, and the disproportionate burden of gun violence on communities of color. “This isn’t a guns situation,” the president said, after a gunman with a long history of violent behavior killed men, women, and children with a military-style rifle at a church on a Sunday morning in rural Texas. Except that it is. Gun violence is uniquely an American disease. The scale of gun ownership and deaths are unrivaled in any other developed country in the world. Millions of Americans want to do something about gun violence and we want to show them what’s possible, and what’s working. Caren Teves, mother of Alex, one of the victims of the Aurora movie theatre killings in 2012, says in our opening piece in this series that the sheer horror of mass shootings is a barrier to Americans endorsing political change. “A lot of people don’t want to grasp it, because it’s that awful.” But if, after mass shootings 20 years ago, “we all stood up and said, ‘enough is enough,’ Alex would still be alive. He’d still be here.” Politicians have taken to insisting after mass shootings that “now is not the time” to talk about reform. Tell that to Caren Teves.

126,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/501088984/0/phoenix/nation~Air-Force-Lapse-in-Texas-mass-shooting-case-was-part-of-pattern/," WASHINGTON — The Air Force said Tuesday that its failure to report the criminal history of the former airman who massacred 26 people at a Texas church in early November was “not an isolated incident,” suggesting it was part of a pattern of reporting lapses. In a written statement on progress in its investigation, the Air Force blamed gaps in “training and compliance measures” for the lapse involving Devin P. Kelley, who had been convicted of assaulting his then-wife and stepson in 2012. The fingerprint card and the report on the outcome of his court martial were not submitted to the FBI by Air Force personnel at Kelley’s base in New Mexico. If reported, this information should have stopped him from buying weapons. Kelley was sentenced to 12 months in confinement and given a bad conduct discharge. He left the Air Force in 2014. The Air Force inspector general is undertaking an in-depth review of the service’s compliance with long-standing requirements to report certain criminal history information to the FBI for inclusion in databases used to conduct background checks of gun buyers. It is part of a broader Pentagon-wide review of compliance with these requirements. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson has previously acknowledged that Kelley’s criminal history should have been reported to the FBI but was not. The Air Force has reported and corrected several dozen records since the review began and is reviewing approximately 60,000 cases involving serious offenses over the 15-year period to ensure full compliance. In its statement Tuesday, the Air Force said its review, which is not yet complete, found that the reporting failure in the Kelley case was by Office of Special Investigation officials and Air Force security force personnel at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. “The review also found the error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” it said. “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” The Air Force said it has made changes designed to prevent such failures in the future. For example, it is now requiring that leaders up the chain of command verify that criminal history reporting requirements have been met in every case. In the Kelley case, the failure to submit the required information to the FBI was not caught by higher-ups because no such verification was required. Additional training on these procedures is being conducted now. Also, the Office of Special Investigations will require physical verification, in the form of a printout or screenshot, from the FBI’s National Crime Information Center that it received and accurately entered the criminal history information in its database. Thus, the Air Force will verify that its information was received by the FBI, not just that it was sent. The Air Force is not alone is recognizing such reporting failures. The Army chief of staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said in recent days that his service failed in a “significant amount” of cases to alert the FBI to soldiers’ criminal history. “It’s not just an Air Force problem,” Milley said. “This is a problem across all the services where we have gaps in reporting criminal activity of people in service.” CONTRIBUTING: Jim Michaels",2017-11-28 14:54:12,Air Force: Lapse in Texas mass shooting case was part of pattern,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

PEOPLE confirms the filing, which states the Air Force failed to enter the killer’s name in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s database after he pleaded guilty to domestic assault five years ago. The shooter — 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley — served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, working in logistics readiness. He was stationed there from 2010 until he was discharged in 2014, following a 2012 court-martial after admitting to assaulting his spouse and their child, an Air Force spokeswoman previously told PEOPLE. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter. Joe “Papa Joe” Holcombe and his wife, Claryce, have filed the lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming negligence. They lost their son, Bryan Holcombe, in the mass shooting. Also killed were Bryan’s wife, Karla, his son, Marc, and Marc’s toddler daughter, Noah, as well as Bryan’s daughter-in-law, Crystal, and three of Crystal’s kids from a prior marriage, Greg, Emily and Megan. The suit says that if the Air Force had entered the shooter’s name in the database, it would have prevented the shooter from obtaining firearms. “Under a 1996 law preventing spouse and child abusers from possessing firearms, the service’s Office of Special Investigations should have entered that conviction into an FBI database,” says the family’s lawyer, Rob Ammons, in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. • For more compelling True Crime coverage, follow our Crime magazine on Flipboard. “The office didn’t, the Air Force has admitted,” the statement continues. “What’s more, the acts Kelley pleaded guilty to — breaking his baby stepson’s skull and hitting and kicking his then-wife — were punishable by imprisonment of more than a year. That qualifies them as felonies, which must be entered into the database.” RELATED VIDEO: At Least 26 Dead, Including Children, After Shooter Opens Fire on Texas Church Service The suit does not specify damages being sought, but the statement from Ammons says the Holcombes “are committed to making sure no other family has to suffer such a devastating preventable loss.” According to the shooter’s 2012 court-martial plea bargain, obtained by PEOPLE, he had a charge for pointing an unloaded gun at his wife dismissed. The Air Force spokeswoman told PEOPLE the shooter received a bad conduct discharge and 12 months’ confinement as well as a reduction in rank.

130,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-air-force-gun-background-checks-texas-shooting,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST An investigation into the US air force’s failure to report criminal records to the nation’s gun background check system has already found “several dozen” records that should have been submitted and were not. The investigation comes after the mass shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 people dead. The day after the murder the air force announced that the shooter should have been barred from legal gun ownership because of a 2012 conviction for abusing his wife and stepson.  The air force had failed to submit the records of Devin Kelley’s domestic violence record to the national background check system, allowing Kelley to go on to purchase multiple guns, despite his history of violence, an air force spokesperson said. Nearly a month into an investigation of these reporting errors, the air force has announced that “the error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations”. Air force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said on Tuesday: “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” The United States, which recognizes gun ownership as a constitutional right, allows citizens to buy guns from licensed dealers after a quick check to make sure they have not been listed in the national database of Americans disqualified from legally owning guns. The failure to report the correct disqualifying criminal or mental health records to the background check system has been a systemic problem for years, with at least three high-profile mass shooters getting weapons legally because of a breakdown in reporting or locating records. The full scope of the air force’s failure to report domestic violence records and other disqualifying convictions to the gun-buying background check system is still unknown. The air force “is reviewing approximately 60,000 cases involving serious offenses over the 15-year period to ensure full compliance,” spokesman Mark Graff said. But he could not clarify if the “several dozen” records that had failed to be reported were found after reviewing just a few hundred cases, or many thousand. The investigation is “ongoing” and “will be completed over the next several months,” he said. The defense department is also investigating whether records from other branches of the military have been submitted appropriately. While federal agencies are already required by law to submit criminal records to the gun background check system, a bipartisan group of legislators has introduced new federal legislation to make sure that the US military follows the law, including introducing new requirements for public disclosure about record submissions, and financial penalties for officials whose agencies do not comply with the law. “The failures are so stark here, and the danger to the public is so stark, so I think there’s clearly a need for some dramatic action,” Lindsay Nichols, the federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said when the legislation was introduced earlier this month. “If the air force failed to report somebody, and instead of resulting in the deaths of 26 people in a church, it resulted in the death of one person on the streets of Chicago, it probably would not have sparked the same national conversation,” she said. “I don’t know if we’d even know about it.” There are more than 11,000 firearm homicides each year in the US, according to official estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",2017-11-28 16:57:19,US air force failed to submit dozens of records to gun background check system,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

132,http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/29/president-trumps-triple-feature-another-brutal-wake-up-call-for-muslims/,"Trending: Raza Ahmad awoke Wednesday morning, which takes a certain amount of courage when you’re a Muslim in Donald Trump’s dumbed-down America. Shock — the news was unsettling. “I think it’s one of the very bad things to wake up to,” said Ahmad, assistant director of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Silicon Valley. Related Articles

Trump had retweeted three insidious videos, all purporting to show Muslims engaging in cruel and gratuitously provocative behavior. We won’t be linking them here. But the titles speak for themselves: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” Coming soon: “Man who was once polite to a Muslim shoots puppies out of a cannon!” Trump’s triple feature landed with a thud. It was a win-win for the president in that it sent hordes of decent-minded citizens of the world into frothing fits of denunciations, expending energy that could have been better spent raging against the Grinchian tax bill oozing through Congress. The videos were the handiwork of British First, an extremist political group that could be Trump’s brother from another oligarch. Their aim, and Trump’s aim in sharing their videos, is to other-ize segments of society. Muslims are a favorite Trump target, as Ahmad is reminded every morning when he wakes up in a world in which a social media post can have serious widespread repercussions. “These tweets are deeply concerning and problematic,” Ahmad said. “The first (video) portrayed a Muslim boy fighting with a Dutch boy. They were both Dutch. That’s false information. In the second one, a Muslim person was shown breaking a statue of the Virgin Mary. The Holy Quran reveres Mary as the greatest woman who ever lived. The third is a tragic video of someone throwing a boy off a roof. “They risk the safety of millions of Muslims,” Ahmad said of the videos. “They also risk advancing white supremacy. Sentiment against Muslims is at an all-time high.” Trump clearly wields the biggest megaphone in any debate by virtue of his office. But Muslims are trying to push back with informational campaigns of their own. One, formed in the aftermath of the 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting, is called True Islam. “Through that campaign, we are educating,” said Ahmad, who emigrated from Pakistan and works in computer science for a research company. “We’ve had several campaigns for blood drives, one on 9/11 at Ground Zero. We’ve donated thousands of units of blood. We are doing humanitarian services. We’re working actively in the Houston floods.” They have Coffee, Cake & True Islam events across the country. They get to know the local school boards. They’re not above standing in “any busy public spot” with a sign reading, “I’m Muslim. Don’t be afraid to ask me anything.” “This is something that is in our interest as a nation and a country,” Ahmad said. “We want to be free to express our beliefs and our religion. This is the right time to do these things. If we don’t do it now, when will we do it?” Ahmad likes Silicon Valley and its diversity. “We haven’t faced any problems here,” he said. But he fears what might happen if the drumbeat of anti-Muslim sentiment causes people to lose hope and take matters into their own hands. “People in increasing numbers in our religion have been targeted,” he said. “It’s been shown very clearly that social injustice leads to radicalization. Today it’s Muslims. Who knows, it could be Jews tomorrow. If we start cleansing out other minorities, it could be a great threat to America.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-11-29 19:58:22,Peterson: President Trump&#8217;s triple feature another brutal wake-up call for Muslims,,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/

134,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/30/nation-brief/,"Police kill gunman firing down on street RENO, Nev. — A gunman took a woman hostage and opened fire on a downtown Reno street from the eighth floor of a condominium, stirring fears of a massacre like the one in Las Vegas until he was fatally shot by police, authorities said Wednesday. The unidentified gunman, believed to be in his 20s, apparently knew the female hostage, who was not hurt. No one else was seriously injured in the Tuesday night incident. The gunfire came two months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, when 58 people were killed and hundreds of others were wounded when a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel-casino. But the streets in Reno were mostly empty on the cold weeknight when the gunfire began shortly before 7 p.m. Police Chief Jason Soto said Wednesday that there was no indication the gunman had planned the attack. “Preliminary information shows that this was an isolated incident and it does not appear that this was a pre-planned attack on our community,” Soto said in a statement. Jailed rancher declines release offer LAS VEGAS — A federal judge on Wednesday offered to release a rancher and states’ rights figure from custody during his trial on charges involving an armed standoff that stopped a government cattle roundup three years ago in Nevada. But Cliven Bundy refused to leave jail while others are still behind bars awaiting trial in the case. Bundy, 71, didn’t state his reason in court. But his wife, Carol Bundy, noted in a courthouse hallway that two other sons, Mel and David Bundy, are approaching two years in federal detention. “It’s not over. It’s not done,” she said. Defense attorney Bret Whipple told reporters that Cliven Bundy is a “very principled man.” The family patriarch could have joined son Ammon Bundy and co-defendant Ryan Payne in being freed during the trial. U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro said they can be released today to house arrest with GPS monitoring at the homes of Bundy family friends. Navarro did not say why she reversed her previous detention ruling. Gun at job leads to serial-killing arrest TAMPA, Fla. — The suspect in a string of four slayings that terrorized a Tampa neighborhood was arrested after he took a loaded gun to his job at a McDonald’s and asked a co-worker to hold it, authorities said. McDonald’s workers reported the gun to police officer Randi Whitney, who was doing paperwork at the fast-food restaurant, setting off an investigation that linked Howell Emanuel Donaldson, 24, to the crimes, in part by using location data from his cellphone, authorities said. On Wednesday, Donaldson was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. The arrest overnight was a relief for Seminole Heights, a community on edge over an apparent serial killer who targeted three people near bus stops after dusk beginning Oct. 9. Police had earlier released black-and-white surveillance video of a man in a hoodie as a possible suspect, and by Halloween the fear was so great that police escorted children as they went trick-or-treating. The fourth killing happened this month. In addition to matching shell casings found at the shootings, authorities said location data from Donaldson’s cellphone put him at the scene of at least three of the killings. Donaldson did not live in the neighborhood where the shootings occurred and said he was unfamiliar with it. Russia-tied reporters barred at Capitol WASHINGTON — Broadcast reporters for Russian state-funded TV channel RT will no longer be able to report daily from the U.S. Capitol. The executive committee of the Congressional Radio and Television Correspondents’ Galleries, a group that governs Capitol Hill access for broadcast journalists, voted to withdraw RT’s credentials after the company complied earlier this month with a U.S. demand that it register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law applies to people or companies disseminating information in the U.S. on behalf of foreign governments, political parties and other “foreign principals.” C-SPAN’s Craig Caplan, the chairman of that committee, wrote that gallery rules “state clearly that news credentials may not be issued to any applicant employed by ‘any foreign government or representative thereof.’” RT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Morgan's tweet came hours after Trump attacked May for criticizing his retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of a British far-right group.   Trump is yet to respond to Morgan's comments, and the television personality said he hopes the president makes a ""U-turn,"" just the way he did when Morgan made a similar criticism about his lifting of a ban on importing elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.  “Theresa@theresamay, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!” Trump tweeted Wednesday evening in response to May calling him ""wrong"" for retweeting three videos about alleged Islamist violence. However, the “@theresamay” Twitter handle that Trump targeted did not belong to the British prime minister, but to a woman called Theresa Scrivener. Minutes later Trump deleted and reposted the tweet, this time with the correct handle. On Wednesday, Trump retweeted three videos posted by far-right group Britain First's deputy leader Jayda Fransen. One video claimed to show a Muslim man destroying a statue of the Virgin Mary, another showed a “Muslim migrant” beating up a “Dutch boy on crutches,” and a third seemed to show Muslim men pushing a boy off a building. “Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people,"" a spokesman for the Downing Street said. “British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents - decency, tolerance and respect,"" he said, adding: “It is wrong for the President to have done this.” Trump's tweet triggered outrageous reactions in Britain, including from Brendan Cox, the husband of lawmaker Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a far-right extremist. ""You have a mass shooting every single day in your country, your murder rate is many times that of the UK, your healthcare system is a disgrace, you can't pass anything through a Congress that you control.

The brutal economic realities of photojournalism leave him “in a situation where I’m poverty-stricken, but I’m not going to give up”, he said by phone recently.  As employers increasingly offer temporary contracts and minimal benefits instead of traditional full-time roles, the security of many occupations has been eroded. Labor experts define such jobs as “precarious employment”. Adjunct teaching positions are a prime example, as we revealed recently. Facing shrinking newsroom budgets and the devaluing of their profession, photojournalists like Gold are also confronted by difficulties. He knows he can’t go on like this forever. He has a heart murmur and says he’s almost a decade overdue for a heart valve replacement. “I’m already starting to feel the symptoms of it, which is increased tiredness” and severe double vision, he said. Sometimes mere subsistence is a struggle. “I never eat properly,” he said. Yet Gold thinks in grander terms. “How many other people are doing this?” he said. “I’m giving people a voice who don’t normally have a voice, and that’s what’s the most important thing to me.” Follow me on Twitter for our latest stories: @alastairgee.

In October, the Guardian film-maker Adithya Sambamurthy saw a side of Las Vegas that is unimaginable to those visiting the city’s spangled, cacophonous casinos. He ventured into the storm-drain tunnels beneath the city and met some of the 300 homeless people estimated to be living there, in the silent darkness. Sambamurthy was told a moving story that never made it into the film we ran recently. When the horrific mass shooting that claimed 58 lives near the Mandalay Bay hotel began, a Swat team went to an entrance to the tunnels. “They were just yelling: ‘Get up, get out or you’re gonna die,’” a man named Joel said. He and others were brought out into the daylight. It was like an “apocalypse”, he said. Another tunnel-dweller, Dan, was aboveground when the shooting started, and heard gunfire. “It was like it wasn’t even Vegas at that moment,” he said. Although the streets were blockaded, he managed to get back home – he knew a secret route, he said. “If you know the tunnel system, you can get around wherever you want to get to,” he confided. One of the most appalling aspects of homelessness in America is the refusal by cities to provide toilets for those living outside, forcing them to relieve themselves in circumstances that would be deemed intolerable in a refugee camp. As we’ve written, conditions on Skid Row in Los Angeles are some kind of nadir: at night there are only nine toilets for almost 2,000 people sleeping on the street. There, at least, a small shift is on the horizon. On Monday, the Skid Row Community Improvement Coalition is unveiling a cheery, temporary hygiene center with toilets and showers. Initially, it will only be open during the daytime, but in the near future it plans to expand to nights. “There is no negotiation when it comes to basic needs,” said an activist who is known in the community as Louise Mbella “Sinai” (Frenchy). “People may say: ‘Oh, this hygiene center will bring more homeless.’ Well, it doesn’t matter whether there are homeless or no homeless – it is our duty as a society to provide clean public toilets and showers to those who do not even have a roof over their head. That should not even be a debate.” Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)  Steven Senne FOXBOROUGH — New England Patriots defensive end Lawrence Guy is familiar with trials on the football field. During his seven-year NFL career, the 27-year-old bounced around four other teams before landing in New England as a free agent this offseason. But his football journey has also intersected with a pair of life-altering tragedies. Last year Guy was is his second full season with the Baltimore Ravens when he and his wife lost a baby to a miscarriage during the fifth month of pregnancy. Then, last month he was blindsided again by news that his hometown of Las Vegas was the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Sunday, Guy will honor the 59 killed and more than 500 injured in the Vegas attack during the NFL’s My Cause, My Cleats initiative. He’s also wearing a cleat for Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, an organization that helped him and his wife heal from the loss of their unborn child. Guy is one of 14 Patriots who will be wearing specialized cleats in the second year of the NFL-wide event, aimed at highlighting the various organizations players want to bring awareness to. After the games, fans can bid on the one-of-a-kind cleats, with all proceeds going back to players’ various charities. Guy said the Vegas shooting still haunts him. “It hit home. I had family at the concert. I had family that were staying at the hotel that week,” he said. “It just hurts. ... You think about the families that are there enjoying themselves that got hit with the horrible news that night or that morning. It’s gonna constantly affect me, and affect the families that were involved in that.” The centerpiece of Guy’s Las Vegas cleat is a reimagined representation of the city’s iconic red, white and blue “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign. In the depiction Guy will be wearing on his right foot, “Welcome” has been replaced by “Unity.” The rest of the sign reads: “Forever Vegas Strong.” At the bottom is “10-1-17,” the date of the shooting. The left cleat he will be wearing is just as meaningful. Guy and his wife, Andrea, had been married less than a year when she became pregnant. Guy was in the middle of offseason workouts when she had just passed the five-month mark. That’s when she suffered a miscarriage. “We didn’t know about the organization at that time — we kept it silent. We were dealing with it our own way at home,” he recalled. “It’s one of those stigmas that you want to keep to yourself. You don’t want to share.” Connecting with Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep helped them see that they weren’t alone and that there was an outlet to help them cope. Guy and his wife have since gotten matching wrist tattoos of angel wings and halo for the daughter they named Estelle. “There are resources out there to help you heal from that process,” Guy said. As he trudges forward off the field, Guy is also making the most of his latest opportunity on it. Since signing a four-year $13.4 million deal this offseason, Guy has been one of the most consistent players on New England’s battered defensive line. He’s started 10 of 11 games this season, making 21 tackles. Coach Bill Belichick praised Guy after the Patriots’ win over Miami. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said he’s improved throughout the season. “He’s got great energy about him,” Patricia said. “He’s smart, he learns, he studies the game, he’s got a lot of insight, too, from a player that’s been able to do this for a couple years.” It’s why Guy said he’s never allowed himself to be too discouraged despite his multiple stops around the league. “Never that. You can’t give up on your dream,” he said. “There’s ups and downs in this business. ... I’m not that person that’s gonna give up. I put my mind to it and said I’m gonna continue to fight for what I believe in.” It’s also why Guy said he wouldn’t change anything about his personal journey — both tragedies and triumphs. “The person I am today is because of what I went through. I’d have been a whole different person if I didn’t go through it,” he said. “That’s one of those questions ‘Can you change things in your life that made you who you are?’ You can’t. Because you don’t know who you are until certain things happen. Things happened that made me who I am today and I’m grateful that I am the person I am.” HADLEY — A project to convert the former Goodwin Memorial Library into new municipal office space through interior renovations will begin this fall...

Outfielder Jordan Nwogu was taken by the Cubs in the third round of the 2020 draft out of Michigan to add another power-hitting prospect to the farm. The trade deadline is less than a week away, and while we speculate what the Cubs could get back in their coming trades, these names could interest them. The Philadelphia Phillies are reportedly eyeing the bullpen of the Chicago Cubs as Friday's trade deadline approaches. During the end of June and the beginning of July, the Chicago Cubs hit rock bottom. The team suffered an 11-game losing streak and looked the worst they had all season. Chicago Cubs left-handed pitcher Brad Wieck underwent a cardiac ablation procedure in February 2020 and was placed on the injured list July 9 with an irregular heartbeat. Sogard, 35, signed a minor-league deal over the winter but has made his way into 78 games with the Cubs and tallied 180 plate appearances. For literal years, we’ve all wondered what these post-2016 Chicago Cubs teams might look like with a legitimate replacement for Dexter Fowler atop the order, setting the table for guys like Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez. When Ben Zobrist took a personal leave of absence from the Chicago Cubs in early May 2019 as details of marital trouble emerged, I don’t think anyone thought The Chicago Cubs are poised to sell at the trade deadline for the first time in years, and with a number of core pieces headed for free agency at the end of the season, a full-blown fire sale is not out of the question... For a team to be set up for success, it must have a strong farm system behind it. We saw what happened in 2016. Theo Epstein got the Chicago Cubs their first ring in 108 years. Yes, the Chicago Cubs are in action again Wednesday, but the only story on anyone’s mind is the upcoming trade deadline and the endless stream of Cubs rumors. Think of this skills challenge as the baseball version of ""American Ninja Warrior."" Man, Jim Bowden ponders trade deadline possibilities and hot stove wheeling and dealing the same way I run a franchise on MLB The Show. No holds barred, anything goes. We’re only nine days away from the trade deadline and the Chicago Cubs are firmly in the driver’s seat of the seller’s market. The team has two of the The time is coming for some serious decision making in the Chicago Cubs front office. By now we’ve all heard the rumors, we know the speculation. This team is going to be sellers at the end of the month. At this point, nothing we’re hearing on the Kris Bryant rumors front is necessarily surprising. The latest from Jeff Passan, though, still hurt, with him saying the Chicago Cubs All-Star is ‘as good as gone’ with 10 days till the trade deadline. The ever-widening gap between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs in the National League Central has grown to chasmic proportions, with David Ross’ club falling 9 1/2 games out following Monday’s disheartening loss to St. Here we are. July 20. 10 days before the annual MLB trade deadline. The Chicago Cubs find themselves in somewhat of a bind before the trade deadline regarding their star shortstop, Javier Baez. I wouldn’t wish a trade to the Mets on my worst enemy, so writing these pieces about their interest in Kris Bryant makes me physically ill. The good news is that the Mets team physician checked me out and said I’m actually fine. The Chicago Cubs organization has seen brighter times as we near the dreaded trade deadline here at the end of July. With Joc Pederson already in Atlanta, the writing seems to be on the wall for this team but there is still much uncertainty as to what will actually happen. The Mets have seen their lead in the NL East shrink and may look for some big upgrades for the stretch push. The Chicago Cubs will be sellers at the MLB trade deadline, and Kris Bryant will likely be playing elsewhere on July 31. Teams such as the Mets, Giants and Brewers could use him, and here are realistic scenarios for the bunch. The Cubs have come to terms with nearly all of their top picks, the club announced. Among their draftees in the top 10 rounds, only second-rounder James Triantos, a third baseman from a Virginia high school, has yet to put pen to paper. The Chicago Cubs are expected to be very busy in the month of July prior to the Major League Baseball trade deadline. On Thursday, before the MLB season Baez and Rizzo, both key contributors to the 2016 World Series-winning team, are set to become free agents after the 2021 campaign. The Chicago Cubs have been flirting with the idea of trading Kris Bryant since the offseason, and the New York Mets are said to have maintained interest in the star third baseman. The Braves are 44-45 this season but four games back of the Mets in the weak NL East. That likely explains why they tried to get someone who might be able to provide some pop. Arrieta has compiled an 8.55 ERA in his past 12 outings. On the season, he is 5-9 across 17 starts with a 6.30 ERA and 1.641 WHIP. The Cubs have lost 10 in a row. Sogard has pitched three times during the losing streak. The Chicago Cubs blanked the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-0 on Thursday, and in the process four Cubs pitchers combined for a no-hitter. This was a historic no-hitter as it was the seventh no-hitter of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, and ties the Major League Baseball modern-day record for most no-hitters in a season.

From inside a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, a male gunman fired below into the audience of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more before shooting himself dead. It marked the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Dion appeared in a video recorded in October at one of her concerts in Caesars Palace's Colosseum, saying, ""We dedicate tonight's show to all the victims and their families and to the first responders and to the doctors and nurses who are working around the clock to save lives. And to so many heroes who did whatever they could to help complete strangers at a time of desperate needs."" All proceeds from the concert are set to go to the Vegas Shooting Victims Fund. Dion had also donated the proceeds from her own show to the shooting survivors. The singer appears in a prerecorded videotaped message that paid tribute to the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. It was filmed at one of her concerts in the city that took place days after the tragedy. The group performed ""Motownphilly"" and an a capella version of ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday."" ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city. Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong,"" the frontman told the crowd. The band played songs such as ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Believer"" before initiating a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting. At the end of their set, the crowd stood to sing along with ""On Top of the World"" and ""Radioactive."" The veteran Vegas performer introduces a videotaped appearance by Elton John.

In November, Dion had appeared in person at a smaller Vegas Strong Benefit Concert at the OMNIA Nightclub in Caesars Palace, where she joined DJ Steve Aoki to perform a special version of her hit ballad ""My Heart Will Go On."" Jason Aldean also appeared at Friday's Vegas Strong Benefit Concert via videotaped message. He told the crowd, ""Be louder than the bad guys,"" according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He said he couldn't be there in person because his wife is due to give birth, the outlet reported. Brittany Aldean  welcomed their first child, a boy, that night. Aldean is one of the survivors of the shooting, which took place while the country star was performing onstage at the Route 91 Harvest music festival. Aldean was unhurt. At the Vegas Strong Benefit Concert on Friday, Imagine Dragons and The Killers performed onstage separately and also performed Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" together along with other acts, marking the first time the bands, who both formed in Las Vegas, have shared a stage. ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city,"" Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds said. ""Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong."" The Killers performed ""Be Still"" while the names of the people killed in the shooting were displayed on the screen. The band closed the show with hits such as ""When You Were Young"" and ""Somebody Told Me."" ""There's enough love in this room tonight to light up Las Vegas,"" singer Brandon Flowers said. There were also live performances from the likes of Penn & Teller, David Copperfield, Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil and Boyz II Men, who told the crowd, ""This show is a testament to how strong Las Vegas really is.""

By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store  or the Google Play store. It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams announced Monday that police arrested 69-year-old Bernardino Gawala Bolatete after he tried to buy a gun silencer from an undercover officer. Police began investigating Bolatete after receiving a tip from a confidential source that Bolatete was planning a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover officer contacted him and arranged the sale of the silencer. During taped conversations, Bolatete repeated his plans for the shooting. He was arrested Friday after the silencer was delivered. Williams said Bolatete already had the weaponry necessary to carry out the attack. Bolatete is being held by the FBI and more charges could be filed. It was not known if he has an attorney.

Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is challenging Republican incumbents with a six-figure ad buy. Financed by the advocate’s gun safety group, Giffords, the ads pressure representatives to vote against the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Slated to appear before the House this week, the bill requires states allowing concealed weapons to recognize concealed carry permits issued in other states.
“In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community. No background check? No training? No questions asked,” says a female narrator over images of police officers and firearms. “Will Jason Lewis side with law enforcement, or the gun lobby?”
Politico reports that the television ads target Congressmen Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and Jason Lewis (R-Minn.). Additional online ads focus on Representatives Steve Knight (R-Calif.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Miami Waters (R-Calif.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)
“The ads call on voters to speak up about this dangerous bill and call on their leaders put the safety of communities before the interests of the gun industry,” Giffords’ executive director Peter Ambler told Politico.
After surviving an assassination attempt while meeting with constituents in Tucson in 2011, Giffords became a leading advocate against gun violence. The former congresswoman consolidated her activism and gun reform movements into Giffords in 2016. “In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community.

154,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators,"As harmful material continues to appear on sites like YouTube and Facebook, companies rely on journalists and citizens to flag it – and the system is failing Last modified on Tue 5 Dec 2017 14.31 GMT The viral YouTube videos featured screaming children being tortured, conspiracy theorists taunting mass shooting victims and webcam footage of young girls in revealing clothing. The disturbing clips drew millions of views and, up until recently, were continuing to spread on the site. Then, hours after reporters highlighted them to YouTube, asking for comment, the videos disappeared.  The removal of the harmful footage illustrated a dark pattern in Silicon Valley and a common feature of some of the biggest tech scandals of 2017: journalists have become the de facto moderators for the most powerful social media corporations, exposing offensive content that the companies themselves have failed to detect. In the face of increasing recognition that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others have had detrimental impacts on society – whether enabling harassment and violence, spreading misinformation or threatening core functions of democracy – the companies have largely resisted fundamental changes that would reduce the damage. On the contrary, Silicon Valley has stuck to its foundational belief that tech firms are ultimately not accountable for the content on their platforms. They have outsourced social responsibility to journalists, watchdogs and other citizens, who have increasingly taken on the role of unpaid moderators – flagging abusive, dangerous and illegal material, which the sites then remove in the face of bad publicity. By many measures, it’s a system that is failing. “They’ve been quite content to let the general public or conventional news media do their work for them,” said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, who has criticized Facebook’s impact on journalism. The philosophy, she said, was: “‘Maximize our presence and our money, and if something goes wrong, we will ask for forgiveness.’” On a weekly basis, reporters discover glaring flaws and alarming content, launching a predictable cycle of takedowns, apologies and vague promises to re-evaluate. Often, the companies’ arbitrary enforcement efforts and inadequate algorithms have failed to reject the abusive material, even though it violated official policies and standards. YouTube, for example, had allowed a wide range of videos and “verified” channels featuring child exploitation to flourish, in some cases enabling violent content to slip past the site’s YouTube Kids safety filter. Dozens of channels and thousands of videos were recently removed from the Google-owned site only because of revelations reported in BuzzFeed, the New York Times and a viral essay on Medium. Some families of mass shooting victims have also spent countless hours trying to get YouTube to remove harassing videos from conspiracy theorists. They’ve described an emotionally taxing and often unsuccessful process of flagging the footage. But when the Guardian recently sent YouTube 10 such videos, the site removed half of them for violating “policy on harassment and bullying” within hours of an email inquiry. YouTube also changed its search algorithm to promote more reputable news sources after a day of negative news coverage surrounding offensive video content attacking victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. On Monday, YouTube said that it would hire thousands of new moderators next year in an effort to fight child abuse content in the same way the site has tackled violent extremist videos. With more than 10,000 moderators total across Google, the company said it would still continue to rely heavily on machine learning to identify problematic content. Facebook, too, has repeatedly been forced to reverse course and publicly apologize after embarrassing or unethical decisions by algorithms or internal moderators (who have said they are overburdened and underpaid). ProPublica reported this month that Facebook was allowing housing advertisements to illegally exclude users by race. That’s despite the fact that Facebook previously said it had instituted a “machine learning” system to spot and block discriminatory ads. The tech company said in a statement that this was a “failure in our enforcement” and that it was, once again, adopting new safeguards and undergoing a policy review. Facebook, Google and Twitter were all also forced to change policies this year after reporters revealed that users could buy ads targeted to offensive categories, such as people who consider themselves “Jew haters”. “They are concerned about getting as many eyeballs on to as many advertisements as is humanly possible,” said Don Heider, founder of the Center for Digital Ethics and Policy. “That doesn’t always bode well for what the results are going to be.” Facebook and Twitter have both faced intense backlash for allowing abuse and false news to flourish while simultaneously shutting down accounts and posts featuring legitimate news and exposing wrongdoing. For affected users, sometimes the best way to get action is to tell a journalist. Facebook reinstated a Chechen independence activist group this year after the Guardian inquired about its decision to shut down the page for “terrorist activity”. Reporters’ inquiries also forced the site to admit that it had erred when it censored posts from a Rohingya group opposing Myanmar’s military, which has been accused of ethnic cleansing. There are no easy solutions to moderation given the scale and complexity of the content, but experts said the companies should invest significantly more resources into staff with journalism and ethics backgrounds. Facebook’s fact-checking efforts – which have been unsuccessful, according to some insiders – should involve a large team of full-time journalists structured like a newsroom, said Kirtley: “They have to start acting like a news operation.” Reem Suleiman, campaigner with SumOfUs, a not-for-profit organization that has criticized Facebook for having a “racially biased” moderation system, argued that the companies should be more transparent, release internal data and explain how their algorithms work: “Without the work of journalists chasing down some of this information, we’re just completely left in the dark.” Claire Wardle, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, said the platforms were starting to develop more robust specialist teams doing moderation work. Still, she said, it was “shocking” that Twitter would not have detected propaganda accounts that a group of BuzzFeed reporters without access to internal data was able to uncover. “The cynical side of me thinks they are not looking, because they don’t want to find it,” she said. A Twitter representative touted its machine learning technology and said it detected and blocks 450,000 suspicious logins each day. The statement also praised the work of the media, saying: “We welcome reporting that identifies Twitter accounts that may violate our terms of service, and appreciate that many journalists themselves use Twitter to identify and expose such disinformation in real time.” A Facebook representative noted that the company was hiring thousands of people to review content and will have 7,500 total by the end of the year. That team works to evaluate whether content violates “community standards”, the representative noted, adding, “We aren’t the arbiters of truth.”",2017-12-05 03:01:10,Tech firms fail to stop abusive content – leaving the public to do the dirty work,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
155,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-glanton-concealed-carry-illinois-20171204-story.html,"We are accustomed to the crocodile tears shed in Washington every time there is a mass shooting. Politicians who actually have the power to bring about change like to talk about healing, the power of prayer and the need for Americans to come together after a violent rampage. But their solemn faces are merely masks. When memories of the tragedy begin to fade, too many politicians return to their perches in the palms of the National Rifle Association and wait for their next assignment. Then, like hired assassins, they set out on a mission to pass new laws that can only result in more bloodshed. This time, the NRA orders came barely two months after Stephen Paddock slaughtered 58 people and injured more than 500 on the Las Vegas Strip in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock owned more than 40 guns of varying sizes and calibers when he went on his deadly rampage in October. In Nevada, gun owners can carry their weapons openly. Paddock would have needed a permit to carry a concealed handgun in the state, but in Nevada it would have been easy for him to get one. It would, however, have been illegal for him to bring even a single handgun into Illinois. Now, the lawmakers’ mission, as directed by the NRA, is to make it easier for gunmen to carry their weapons all over the country. Lawmakers are expected to vote this week on federal legislation that would allow anyone who has a concealed carry permit from another state to walk into a restaurant on Michigan Avenue with a handgun tucked in his or her belt. Sounds pretty scary, doesn’t it? But that’s what could happen if the NRA gets its way — and there is no reason to think House Republicans won’t fall into line. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 would take precedence over laws in states such as Illinois, California and New York that allow only those who have obtained a concealed carry permit in that state to legally carry firearms within state lines. One thing we learned from the Las Vegas shooting is that state concealed carry laws are not equal. Nevada, for example, has some of the most lax concealed carry laws in the nation. In that state, almost anyone who is at least 21 and who does not have a felony record is eligible to obtain a concealed carry permit. While gun buyers nationwide must undergo a federal background check, it is much easier in some states for bad people to slip through the cracks. Illinois has gone to great lengths to make sure that only law-abiding citizens with no history of mental illness or substance abuse can legally carry a weapon. And anyone who wants to legally carry a concealed handgun must undergo 16 hours of training in how to use it. Gun carriers also must submit to fingerprinting and possess a firearm owner’s identification card, which offers a second level of background checks through the Illinois State Police. Illinois also bars anyone who has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic battery or is under an order of protection from obtaining a firearm. These are commonsense laws that every state should have in place. But the NRA has waged a yearslong campaign to get rid of as many regulations as possible. Most states have cowered to the pressure. Now Congress is stepping in to force the stragglers into line. Following the Las Vegas shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the carnage “an evil tragedy that horrifies us all.” He ordered flags over the U.S. Capitol to half-staff and issued a statement to the people of Las Vegas and families of the victims. He said, “ The whole country stands united in our shock, in our condolences, and in our prayers.” That sentiment was short-lived. At the end of the statement, he should have added, “Unless it interferes with the NRA’s agenda.” dglanton@chicagotribune.com Twitter @dahleeng RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-12-05 06:00:00,Federal legislation on concealed carry likely to show shock of Las Vegas shooting is short-lived,,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

159,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money.

ABC proved its network has a ""fake news"" problem, after false reports about a former Trump advisor led to a correspondent's suspension. The incident reflected on ABC as a whole because it took the network so long to acknowledge and correct the error, according to MRC Vice President of Business and Culture Dan Gainor. He said it should also leave people wondering “how can you trust anything” from ABC. ABC Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross incorrectly reported on Dec. 1, that former national security advisor Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Donald Trump asked him to contact Russians. If that were true, it would have been a bombshell revelation. But ABC got it wrong. So wrong, it suspended Ross for four weeks without pay beginning Dec. 2. In reality, Trump made that request after he had already won the election. It took ABC a full day to admit the claim needed “correction,” not just “clarification.” “It’s not just what he did that was wrong, it’s ABC’s editorial process that let it get through, it’s ABC’s reluctance to call it an error that needed correction,” Gainor said on the Dec. 4, Fox Business’ After the Bell, “At that point if you’re an investor, you’re wondering, ‘how can you can trust anything that ABC’s putting out?’”    Ross’ report was especially egregious given his personal history of false reporting, After the Bell co-host Melissa Francis suggested. She cited Ross’ 2012 report that falsely accused a Tea Party member of being the responsible for the movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Gainor had another example, citing ABC’s “pink slime” controversy which began in 2012. ABC’s reporting about Beef Products Inc resulted in a lawsuit and a huge settlement in the company’s favor. The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC, reportedly paid out at least $177 million in settlement fees to the beef company in August 2017. A lawyer representing the beef company told The New York Times the settlement was much larger, and that Disney’s insurers “are paying the rest.” The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

Michael Flynn's plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by claiming that Flynn is ""prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him, directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.""It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes, the stock market plunged 350 points.It quickly became clear that was flat-out wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what it disingenuously called a ""clarification"" — actually, it said, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election. Not only is that not scandalous but it is also completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, ABC finally found the reporting to be a ""serious error"" and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay.It's a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it's verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America — and even the world — any news that could lead to speculation about Trump's impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to overhype anything that could spell ""The End.""This suspension might have been an adequate punishment ... if Ross hadn't already made a long line of whoppers. Conservatives remember the 2012 movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, by James Holmes and how Ross came on in breaking-news mode to announce that there was a ""Jim Holmes"" on a Colorado Tea Party Patriots website ... as if that were a perfect starting point to identifying a mass shooter. It wasn't.But there are more.  In 2001, Ross claimed that the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington, D.C., and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Former President George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers the event. He tweeted: ""I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway — and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.""In the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported that Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (or ""Chemical Ali""), an Iraqi general, had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced that they had him in custody.In 2006, Ross claimed that Pakistani officials had arrested al-Qaida explosives expert Matiur Rehman, who had an ""official"" list of terrorist recruits and could lead to then-al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani official denounced the report as ""fictitious."" Then-ABC consultant Alexis Debat warned ABC that the report was not true a day after it was initially broadcast.In that same year, Ross breathlessly relayed that the FBI was investigating then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. ""Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation,"" he said. This prompted the Justice Department to deny that there was any federal probe of Hastert, and Hastert demanded a retraction of the statement and threatened to sue ABC.None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who's been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody awards and six George Polk awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors.It's a little bizarre that these days, alleged sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hourlong nightly show on MSNBC, and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against ""fake news"" make it look like fact mangling isn't really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired. L.

163,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/06/this-show-traffics-in-culture-wars-jordan-klepper-on-his-alex-jones-inspired-satire,"The former Daily Show correspondent, who now has his own show, The Opposition, talks about what he learned attending Trump rallies Last modified on Tue 24 Apr 2018 09.59 BST On a Thursday afternoon in late November, Jordan Klepper sits at his desk in midtown Manhattan sifting through the day’s news. Less than two months into his tenure as the host of Comedy Central’s The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, the comic, formerly a correspondent on Jon Stewart and then Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show, is still getting used to anchoring a show of his own. On The Opposition, with a perpetually cocked brow and a hairstyle that adds at least several inches to his 6ft4in frame, Klepper plays a creature very much of the moment: a logic-defying, conspiratorial dingbat ripped from the Breitbart comments section who goes by the name of “Jordan Klepper”.  To prepare for his almost-nightly hosting duties (the show airs Monday through Thursday), Klepper wakes up, checks the mainstream media, like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, and then alternative news sources such as Breitbart, the Daily Caller, and InfoWars, whose host, Alex Jones, the irascible poster-child for rightwing paranoia, is the most obvious inspiration for Klepper’s apoplectic schtick. On this day, like most days under the governance of Donald Trump, there are at least a dozen political stories circulating, each of which make for great, satirical fodder: Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls, has blamed the scandal on a conspiracy engineered by liberals, gay people and lesbians; rumors are swirling that the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is about to be fired; the president has retweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-right nationalist group called Britain First and, moments later, insinuated that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough may have been involved in the death of an aide. But since it’s only 1pm, some of these stories might be old news by the time Klepper steps into the studio in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania to begin filming. “Boy, every day right now is somewhat atypical, partially because of the news cycle and partially because we’re figuring how we want to best run this show,” he says, readying for the 20th episode. “I’m different than Alex Jones or Sean Hannity, so I take some of the attitudes that they attack stories with and then try to bring my body to that character.” The character Klepper plays is a raging mural of rightwing personalities: there’s the smugness of Tucker Carlson, the strained sub-logic of Hannity, the bombast of Jones, and the waspy arrogance of Fox News’ Jesse Watters, all topped off with the host’s charismatic, newsman cadence, which almost never breaks. While it will inevitably remind viewers of Stephen Colbert’s own rightwing parody, which he mastered on The Colbert Report before moving to tamer pastures at CBS, Klepper’s character is more patently derivative of the anti-establishment anger Trump so deftly weaponized on the campaign trail. Being a correspondent on The Daily Show, where Klepper was often sent to Trump rallies to survey the fans decked out in “Lock Her Up” memorabilia, taught him something about the tribalism of American politics and how it engenders a readiness to believe pretty much anything. In one field piece for The Opposition, Klepper goes to a post-election rally in Phoenix and asks attendees to sign a petition to “Impeach Hillary”, which many of them enthusiastically do. “Talking to people legitimized these sources and points of view. We call these ideas fringe, but I don’t think they are fringe,” Klepper says. “They are being validated by Donald Trump. They hear it on the radio, they see it in their news feeds, and then they go to a stadium with 10,000 people and the guy who’s leading in the polls says Hillary Clinton is having seizures. “This is how a new reality gets created,” he says. “So we can start playing with this paranoia, this weird, new Donald Trump post-party ideology.” Asked how he’d describe the ideology, Klepper believes it’s simply about accruing symbolic victories: “It’s not about Republicans and Democrats. Seeing religious right people not giving a shit about morality, and just wanting to win on abortion – it’s: ‘I want to win, but I want you to lose.’” At The Opposition headquarters, which might be how an Alex Jones type would describe the backrooms where George Soros supposedly funds anti-Trump protests, Klepper’s dedication to character and mockery is reflected everywhere, from a pillow with the words “It’s only news if you believe it” superimposed on his visage to a paper wristband that reads “DO NOT EAT: microchip embedded”. Lest the earnestness of his parody fall on deaf ears, he makes sure his true feelings can be discerned behind the character’s veneer of Deep State anxiety. Just six episodes into his new show, the mass shooting in Las Vegas took place. Klepper rose to the occasion, delivering an incisive yet funny segment about how fellow rightwingers could avoid talking about guns. “Not even 24 hours later, these heartless liberals deployed their most sinister, nefarious, despicable weapon: talking,” he says, peering into the camera as if delivering a prophecy. “There’s only one thing for us brave, patriotic Americans to do: stand our ground, turn, and run away from this debate.” Klepper, who is 38 and was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been bred for his Comedy Central gig since he first joined improv troupes, such as Chicago’s Second City and iO theater in 2003, where he did a show called Whirled News Tonight. The audience would cut out news stories of the day, tack them to a wall, and comics would pick one to read aloud and improvise a scene about it. Besides honing his John Kerry impression, iO made Klepper more curious about current affairs and illustrated, as Oscar Wilde would say, the importance of being earnest, especially when it comes to political satire. “I am this character, and this character is an asshole,” he says. “I want to show some of the fears and blind spots that people have, so you can see why they’re so frustrated. Like: ‘He’s being bigoted right now, but maybe he’s not a terrible person, he’s just missing something.’” “Earnestness has always been a virtue,” he adds. “In comedy, it’s something there’s a craven need for right now because we feel so lost.” Klepper doesn’t just draw inspiration for his character from newscasters, but also from the members of the administration whose job it is to present Trumpism as a coherent doctrine. “I find Kellyanne Conway fascinating,” he says. “She is totally adept at her job and they let her do it. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is also somebody we’re watching, through gritted teeth. Those folks are doing elements of what we do. Trump will tweet this hateful, Islamophobic video with no context. Why did he do that? We don’t know. But someone has to answer for it.” Mining the discord of those defenses – “how you have to bend over backwards” to support them – informs Klepper’s own show, where he tries to untie the twisted knot at the center of far-right disaffection and, in some dark corners of the web, lunacy. But Klepper, and the cadre of satirists who have flourished in the strange, new political climate – among them Colbert, John Oliver, Klepper’s former boss Noah and his friend Samantha Bee – know that comedy’s Trump-induced bull market won’t last forever. Exhaustion, or maybe even impeachment, could be imminent. But it won’t matter much, since Klepper’s show is less about Trump than it is the henchmen who must find a tiny kernel of reason in his behavior. “If that could end tomorrow, I’d be the happiest guy in the world,” he says of Trump’s omnipresence in late-night comedy. “This show traffics in culture wars. It might literally be the NFL, because that’s the fight the commander-in-chief’s decided we ought to have. So if we can take that fight, and make a mountain out of a molehill, it’s a way for us to show the tactics, as opposed to the story.”",2017-12-06 07:00:16,'This show traffics in culture wars': Jordan Klepper on his Alex Jones-inspired satire,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
164,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/congress-to-vote-on-trump--and-nra-backed-bill-to-remove-local-gun-restrictions,"Ex-congresswoman Gabby Giffords attacks the bill, which passed by 231 to 197 and removes states’ power to control who can carry concealed, loaded handguns First published on Wed 6 Dec 2017 14.10 GMT On the day of an annual vigil in Washington DC that honors the victims of American gun violence, congressional Republicans passed a Trump-endorsed bill that would eviscerate local gun restrictions, removing states’ power to control who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded handgun in their streets. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 231-197. Fourteen Republicans voted against while six Democrats voted for it.  Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting, called the vote “unthinkable”. “The House of Representatives passed a bill that would let almost anyone carry loaded, concealed firearms almost anywhere in the United States,” Giffords said in an email to gun control supporters. Officials in New York and Los Angeles warn that the legislation would allow an unknown numbers of tourists – perhaps hundreds of thousands each year – to carry concealed handguns into America’s densest urban areas, including Times Square and the New York City subway. Big city police chiefs across the county have spoken out against the bill, calling it a law enforcement nightmare. The bill, which is the National Rifle Association’s “number one legislative priority” has prompted a renewed battle over states’ rights, with Democrats for once arguing against the power of the federal government, and Republicans hoping to use that federal power to undermine local control. “It’s so transparently hypocritical. Republicans spend all day talking about states’ rights, except when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns, they want to take away states’ ability to make decisions for themselves,” Senator Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate who represents Newtown, Connecticut, said on Tuesday, in advance of the vote. The NRA called the vote a “watershed moment”, one more step in what the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, described as a “30-year movement” to ensure that Americans can carry their self-defense weapons across state lines. Despite an easy victory in the House, the bill faces a much more uphill battle in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass. “Right now, there’s no indication that the Senate Republicans want to take this legislation up. In fact, the opposite,” Murphy said. “My suspicion is there are not 60 votes for a national concealed weapons bill [in the Senate],” he said. Americans have a constitutional right to own guns in their home for self-defense. But America's 50 states have dramatically different laws when it comes to carrying guns in public, which all states allow in some form. Twelve conservative states now generally do not require any permit or training for an adult to carry a loaded handgun in public, a policy called ""constitutional carry."" In contrast, seven more liberal states issue permits sparingly and require citizens to demonstrate a justifiable need for carrying a concealed weapon. These tougher laws mean that few residents of cities Los Angeles or New York are given permits to carry concealed guns. There is also wide variation in training requirements – from states that require applicants to demonstrate actual proficiency in firing a gun, to Virginia, which requires only an online safety training course. Under current law, states do not have to recognize carry permits issued by other states, creating a confusing patchwork of regulations on whether gun owners from one state can carry their concealed weapon in another state. For years, the NRA has been trying to pass a federal law to require every state to recognize every other state's gun-carrying permits – which would make it as easy to carry a concealed gun across the country as it is to drive a car. Donald Trump has endorsed the legislation. Law enforcement officials from the nation's largest cities say this legislation would be a public safety disaster, gutting the tough restrictions in states like New York and California to and forcing them to recognize gun carry permits from all states, no matter how weak those state's laws. The NRA-backed legislation would force all states to recognize gun-carrying permits from any other state, including the dozen states that generally do not require any training or permit to carry a gun, a policy called “constitutional carry”. West Virginia’s choice to allow “constitutional carry” of concealed handguns “might be fine for West Virginia, but it’s not fine for New York City”, said Cy Vance, Manhattan’s district attorney. “I wouldn’t presume to tell West Virginia, as a New Yorker, what West Virginia’s laws should be with regard to gun possession. Can you imagine how mad they’d be?” Donald Trump endorsed the legislation during his campaign last year. Its passage came the same day that gun violence survivors, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, were visiting congressional offices to ask politicians, once again, to take some action on gun control. Nearly five years after the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which left 26 children and educators dead, Congress has yet to pass any gun control laws. It’s not (just) about the money. In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. But for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The NRA has plenty of cash to spend. It bet big on the 2016 US elections, pouring $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. But “the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA professor of constitutional law. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, that number is disputed, but whatever its actual size, membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect."" Read more “We have nothing but heartache and compassion for the victims of Sandy Hook, but concealed carry reciprocity has nothing to do with this tragedy,” said Tatum Gibson, a spokeswoman for Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican congressman who introduced the legislation, said in a statement when asked about the timing of the vote. “I don’t know that putting the NRA’s agenda on the floor of the House is the right way to mark five years since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told the Guardian. “It is heartbreaking to think as we come up to the fifth anniversary of Newtown, Republicans in the House are pushing through a bill to make our country less safe.” At the same time, Murphy argued, the political maneuvering over the bill could be seen as a sign of the growing strength of the gun control movement. Before the House vote, Republicans combined the controversial NRA-backed “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” with a modest measure to make sure the military and other federal agencies are reporting records to the nation’s gun background check system. The Sutherland Springs mass shooting last month revealed that the air force had failed to submit to the background checks system dozens of records that should have disqualified dangerous people from gun ownership, including the domestic violence conviction of the man who went on to murder 26 people at a small Baptist church in Texas. “It says something really interesting about the vulnerability that Republicans feel on guns today,” Murphy said. “Republicans are increasingly worried about the optics of pushing the NRA agenda, and that’s why they’re trying to add on some anti-gun violence legislation.” Republicans’ attempt to tear down local restrictions on gun carrying comes just weeks after two of America’s deadliest mass shootings, at a country music concert in Las Vegas and a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The move highlights the stark divide in Americans’ opinions on guns, with some conservatives seeing increased civilian gun carrying as a way to prevent or lessen the toll of mass shootings, even as many other Americans are trying to fight against America’s gun-carrying culture and get guns off the street. Under current law, states have dramatically different standards for who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded weapon. A handful of more liberal states give law enforcement officials discretion when granting a carry permit and some require that applicants demonstrate a specific need for self-defense. But the majority of states make it easy for citizens to get a carry license. While some states require that permit holders demonstrate proficiency with a gun at a firing range, others only require some kind of gun safety course. In Virginia, applicants don’t even need to leave the house: it’s possible to get a concealed carry license after taking a gun safety course online. Many states currently recognize each other’s carry permits, in the same way states recognize each other’s driver’s licenses, but some states pick and choose which licenses they will honor, and a few states, including New York, recognize no outside permits at all. Gun rights advocates say the current patchwork of state laws governing gun carrying is confusing for law-abiding gun owners, and that American states and cities with the toughest gun control laws are violating Americans’ constitutional right to carry firearms for self-defense. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, hailed the bill’s passage in a statement saying “the truth is that concealed carry laws save lives”. Opponents of the legislation say the right way to fix the confusion over differing regulations is to create a uniform national standard for training and eligibility, not simply force the states with the toughest gun control regulations to allow the most untrained, unvetted gun carriers to walk their streets. Adam Winkler, a gun law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, said the legislation the House is currently considering would also allow local residents in cites with tough restrictions to do an end run around local laws, and get their permit to carry a gun from another state with weaker laws. One of the proposed Democratic amendments to the bill would close that loophole. An estimated three million Americans report carrying a loaded handgun on a daily basis, and an estimated nine million report doing so on a monthly basis, according to a recent study based on a survey conducted by Harvard and Northeastern researchers.",2017-12-06 09:10:42,Congress to vote on Trump- and NRA-backed bill to remove local gun restrictions,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

169,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsblaze/AHOs/~3/WWPB2tFtq1g/,"Victims of the Las Vegas shooting have filed lawsuits over the attack. The mass shooting, which occurred in October 2017, left 58 dead and over 500 more people wounded. Five lawsuits were filed before Thanksgiving against MGM Resorts International. MGM owns Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the shooter was found. The lawsuits also name Live National Entertainment, the promoter of the Route 91 Harvest festival. Lawsuits allege that the businesses contributed to the attacks. Victims and those suffering post-traumatic stress, are included in the lawsuits. The lawsuits have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The lawsuits allege that the hotel, staff, venue and festival all engaged in negligent acts, which contributed to the suffering of victims. “Under the doctrine of premises liability, organizers and property owners are responsible for ensuring the safety and well-being of attendees. This includes events such as the tragic Route 91 Harvest Concert in Las Vegas. When negligent security, improper maintenance, inadequate staffing, etc. causes an injury or death, these individuals and entities can be held accountable for the medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other damages their actions create,” states LV Accident. The lawsuit claims that the hotel’s staff didn’t monitor the shooter, Mr. Paddock, properly. The lawsuit alleges that proper monitoring may have allowed for a faster response. Mr. Paddock’s room was filled with over two dozen weapons as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition. The lawsuit claims proper monitoring would have caught Mr. Paddock stocking his room with weapons. MGM Resorts claims that “these kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them.” Live Nation has failed to comment on the matter. The lawsuit claims that Live Nation, along with MGM, hired festival workers that were not properly prepared for the shooting. The lawsuit claims that exits were not clearly marked and that there should have been more exits on the premises. Mr. Paddock’s estate has been named in the lawsuit and the business that was responsible for the event’s security. Reports from mid-November note lawyers from Las Vegas, Texas and Illinois interviewing victims in an attempt to file hundreds of lawsuits. The large spectrum of victims has led to several large law firms seeking to represent victims and benefit from the massacre. One law firm has affirmed that they interviewed 50 victims with plans to interview hundreds more. The law firm claims that they have reached out to other law firms to deal with the massive amounts of claims. Victims claim that they’ve been haunted by the tragic events. Elisha Seng, a native of Illinois, attended the concert, but was not injured in the shooting. Seng is named in the lawsuit, claiming that the images of a young woman clutching her throat and covered in blood before falling to the ground continues to haunt her. Seng claims that recently, heavy rain was mistaken for gunshots. She claims that she has nightmares and difficulty sleeping following the attacks. Lawsuits question why Paddock was a VIP guest, given access to a service elevator and why there were no security cameras on the floor he stayed in. The lawsuit also questions why the hotel lacked gunshot detection devices. Melissa Thompson writes about a wide range of topics, revealing interesting things we didn’t know before.

Delgado, the 45-year old corporal, believes his PTSD related to the mass shooting led to his termination. Making the situation more dire, his last day falls six months before he could have received his full pension. Delgado was one of the first officers on the scene of the Pulse tragedy, when 49 people were killed and 58 more injured in June 2016. He was diagnosed with PTSD two months after the attack and wasn't able to work for six months, CNN reports. When he returned, he was only able to work desk duty. Delgado claims his PTSD played a part in his termination, and said he was told by the police department that a doctor found him ""unfit for duty"" and there was no other position he could take. Eatonville Deputy Chief Joseph Jenkins has confirmed that Delgado's last day will be Dec. 31, but the Eatonville PD has not commented on why he was let go. ""We have embraced Officer Delgado wholeheartedly from the start of this,"" Jenkins told CNN. ""We have surrounded him with love and support and continue to support him ... and have done everything within our power for him."" Bustle has reached out to the police department for comment. Angel Colon is one of the Pulse victims Delgado helped save. He was shot six times before Delgado pulled him out of the nightclub, and the two men had an emotional reunion in Colon's hospital room a few days later. When Colon heard about Delgado's termination, he said it was disrespectful to both Delgado and himself. ""He was my hero,"" Colon told the local WFTV. ""He saved my life and for them to just do what theyâre doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face, as well. ... He did his job that night on June 12 so they should have his back 100 percent, totally, and just be there for whatever he needs."" In six months, Delgado would have been on the police force for 10 years, when he would have become vested in his pension. He currently makes $38,500 a year, and he would have began receiving 64 percent of his salary and full benefits when he turned 55 had he reached that 10-year mark. Because it was cut short, he'll receive 42 percent of his salary, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Because he's only 45, though, he'll be without a paycheck in January. ""This Christmas is going to be a really sad one,"" he told USA Today. ""Thereâs simply not enough money to make it."" Delgado said he would have happily left the police department in six months, but the decision to keep him from getting his full pension shocked him. âJust let me get vested,"" he said, ""and I will be more than happy to pack up my troubles and leave."" The Eatonville Town Council voted to pay Delgado $1,200 before taxes in accrued sick time. A GoFundMe page was also started to support him financially, and has already surpassed its $25,000 goal. The page says the money will go toward helping the police officer ""get the counseling he so desperately wants and needs."" Delgado continues to have a recurring nightmare about the mass shooting in which he's trying to remove people from the nightclub as the gunman opens fire. He drops to the ground, unable to determine who or where the shooter is, he says, and his screams usually wake up him. ""I never thought I would have gotten to this point. I thought Iâd shake it off and everything would be fine,"" he told USA Today. ""But that hasnât happened. Nothing has been right since that day.""

172,http://observer.com/2017/12/concealed-carry-bill-gets-support-from-3-nj-house-members/,"Guns cannot be carried in New Jersey. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Reps. Tom MacArthur (R-3), Frank LoBiondo (R-2) and Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11) on Wednesday were the only members of New Jersey’s 12-member congressional delegation to vote in favor of a House bill that would make it legal for those granted concealed carry permits in their home states to carry weapons in other states, even if the laws of those states are contradictory.
New Jersey has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the state and concealed carry permits are rarely or never granted to ordinary citizens. If the bill –known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act– becomes federal law, it will contradict existing state laws and would increase the number of legally carried guns in the state. Opponents of the bill say that concealed carry reciprocity makes states like New Jersey less safe. But advocates for changing the law say that it eliminates criminal penalties for law-abiding citizens who travel out of state and are unaware that concealed carry permits do not transfer across state lines.
MacArthur said that the legislation will prevent wrongful convictions of people like Shaneen Allen, a Pennsylvania nurse who in 2013 was arrested in New Jersey for carrying her weapon, something that she did not think violated any laws since she had a permit issued from her state. Though she initially faced a prison term, Allen was required to participate in a pretrial intervention program and was later pardoned by Gov. Chris Christie.
“This legislation will ensure that what happened to Shaneen does not happen to any other law-abiding gun owners by requiring states to recognize each other’s gun carry permits, while recognizing states’ rights to create their own firearms laws,” MacArthur said in a statement. “Opponents of this bill will argue that this legislation will enable dangerous people to obtain firearms. This is completely false. This bill, will allow a law-abiding citizen to carry concealed gun only if they are not federally prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm.”
The bill was also paired with an initiative to better report legal and mental health records to the background check system, an effort to win over Democrats. However, the legislation only drew the support of six Democrats nationally, none of them from New Jersey. Two New Jersey Republican House members –Reps. Leonard Lance (R-7) and Chris Smith (R-4)– voted no on the legislation, the first gun-related bill to be put up for a House vote since the deadly October mass shooting in Las Vegas. They were among 14 national Republicans to vote no on the bill. The bill is a top priority of the National Rifle Association.
“The first concrete action this body has taken in response the numerous gun tragedies our nation has experienced is to make it easier for people to carry hidden, loaded guns in our communities,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), a New Jersey Democrat who has strongly opposed efforts to loosen gun restrictions. “The irony is not lost on me; this bill epitomizes federal overreach and undermines states’ rights to regulate firearms – especially in states like New Jersey who have made tremendous progress to limit the proliferation of guns,” she said.
Many New Jersey districts are a top priority for national Democrats looking to shift control of the House during the 2018 midterm elections. Mikie Sherrill, the most successful fundraiser currently facing Frelinghuysen, quickly issued a statement opposing his vote on the bill. Sherill is a Navy veteran and former federal prosecutor.
“Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen just voted in favor of a bill that puts the people of New Jersey at risk of more violence in their communities,” Sherrill said. “The Congressman voted to make the job of our law enforcement agencies more difficult and to allow untrained and potentially dangerous individuals to carry concealed weapons in New Jersey. It is shameful that in a year with two of the worst mass shootings on record, the only response from Congress is eroding sensible gun laws.”
Ahead of the vote, former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’s pro-gun control organization held a press conference in Morristown calling on Frelinghuysen to vote no on the bill. Giffords was the victim of a shooting in 2011. The group –Giffords– also ran tv ads this week informing voters that the bill would allow “nearly anyone with hidden, loaded guns would be allowed into communities.”

173,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/b6OPrICUQt0/,"In the five years since the deadly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, scientists have been studying how Americans respond to these high-profile tragedies. Their findings show patterns in the way we buy and think about guns. Researchers have noted jumps in gun purchases and gun company stocks after nearly every major mass shooting, including in San Bernardino, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando and in Las Vegas. According to a new study, the number of guns purchased during the first five months following the Sandy Hook school shooting spiked by 3 million. But what drives this trend? Some psychologists think it might have to do with a phenomenon known as availability bias. This way of thinking causes us to dwell on a situation, often due to recent, extensive media coverage and an increase in discussion. Related StorySome Physicians Want Gun Violence Labeled A Public Health Issue Availability bias might lead people to purchase firearms for their own protection, due to the fears of gun violence that mass shootings can induce. It can also drive people to acquire guns out of fear that the mass shooting will incite action for stricter gun control, making it harder for them to purchase a firearm. This might also explain why the spike in gun purchases was smaller following the Las Vegas shooting than after those in San Bernardino and Orlando — then-President Barack Obama was more vocal about gun control than President Donald Trump. But the increase in gun sales doesn't necessarily mean more Americans own firearms. According to a recent Gallup poll, about 42 percent of Americans own a gun, while 3 percent of Americans own a majority of the country's firearms. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

The Texas boy’s grandmother, Sandy Ward, is asking their community to send Christmas cards to Ryland to keep him in a joyful spirit after she saw her grandson’s face light up when he was recently surprised with a holiday delivery, according to multiple local news outlets. “They still haven’t told [Ryland] yet that his mom and sisters are dead, but I’m sure he’s kind of getting some kind of idea because he’s 5,” Sandy told ABC affiliate KSAT on Tuesday. Ryland’s stepmother, Joann, and her daughters, Brooke Ward, 5, and 7-year-old Emily Garza, were killed in the Nov. 5 attack, the state’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. Ryland continues to receive medical treatments after he was shot once in the elbow, twice in the stomach and twice in the leg by a gunman who opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where his family members were regular parishioners. RELATED GALLERY: High-School Sweethearts, Mothers and Young Kids: The Worshipers Killed in Texas Church Massacre On Tuesday, the child’s family shared a health update on the child’s GoFundMe page. “Ryland’s surgery today to put a stint in his kidney was a success. If it holds, it will remain in place 6 weeks. Please pray it holds and that he will not lose a kidney. This young warrior has many battles to overcome,” the statement read. However, his injuries remain in severe condition. “Ryland’s femur bone is still separated and he will be in a wheel chair or wagon for months for mobility,” a statement earlier this month described. “Tummy has not healed … His hip and leg will still need additional surgeries and require screws, pins, plates and rods.

William Atchison, a former student at small-town Aztec High School, had legally purchased a handgun at a local store a month ago and planned the attack, authorities said. He left a message on a thumb drive found on his body that detailed his plan to wait until the students got off buses and made their way to class. He mingled with students, then walked into school with them and went into a second-floor bathroom to ""gear up."" Atchison's plan was to shoot up a classroom and then kill himself. ""Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks. I just want out of this (expletive),"" he wrote. More lives could have been lost had Francisco I. Fernandez not walked into the bathroom, authorities said. The gunman shot Fernandez, then walked out into the hallway and encountered the second victim, Casey J. Marquez. He immediately killed her. Atchison then walked up and down the hall, firing randomly, before killing himself, authorities said. ""He was determined to create as much carnage as he possibly could,"" San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen said. The shooter did not have a criminal record, much less a traffic ticket, officials said. The only contact with law enforcement was what they described as a generic message on an online gaming forum in 2016 in which he talked about what weapons might be used in a mass shooting. The FBI said the posting was flagged and investigators talked with the gunman at his home in Aztec, where he lived with his parents. At the time, he did not own any weapons other than an airsoft pellet gun and said he had no plans for an attack and just liked to troll sites online. The shooting has rocked Aztec, a community of about 6,500 near the Colorado border. Hundreds gathered for prayer services and candlelight vigils and more gatherings are planned over the weekend as residents look for answers. In one bright spot, authorities said heroes at the school helped save lives. A substitute teacher heard the gunshots but didn't have a key to lock the door to the computer lab. So she took students into an office or storage area and barricaded the door with a couch. Atchison came to the room and yelled that he knew they were in there and fired multiple shots into the room, authorities said. A custodian also heard the gunshots and yelled for teachers to lock their doors. State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said the two victims were not specific targets. Marquez was a cheerleader and was planning to perform in the upcoming Orange Bowl. Her classmates said she came across as a student leader. Bryn Divine, a senior at Aztec High School, remembered the victim being a vibrant and friendly student who often won dance contests at school events. ""She lit up pretty much any room we were all in,"" Divine said. ""She was such a fun person to be around."" Fernandez was known for his interest in computers and his speed on the keyboard. His family has said he had a bright future ahead of him. Gov. Susana Martinez said she has met with the teens' families and they talked about what great kids they were. Both of them also had jobs. Martinez said the families are broken but are pulling together. ""I don't think anyone ever gets over this,"" she said. Investigators were still combing over evidence at the school Friday, trying to determine how many shots were fired. The gunman had several magazines and reloaded multiple times, Kassetas said. At Atchison's home, investigators found a torn note in a trash can in his room that listed what they believed to be the timeline for Thursday's shooting. The last words written on the note read ""die."" Authorities don't believe anyone else knew about Atchison's intentions but said they are still investigating.

185,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/09/newtown-sandy-hook-gun-control-washington,"Newtown shooting shocked the world – yet gun control seems further away than ever. But a band of loyal activists are convinced the fight is winnable First published on Sat 9 Dec 2017 12.00 GMT When concerned families from Newtown, Connecticut, first came to Washington five years ago, every door was open. This year, the room they had reserved for a press-conference on Capitol Hill was double-booked. They were shifted to a room half the size and only a single TV camera showed up to cover the emotional stories of dozens of gun violence survivors who had flown in from across the country.  Members of Congress only agreed to set up meetings with their direct constituents, and many simply offered a briefing with a staffer. The only lawmakers who spoke at the annual vigil to honor gun violence victims were from Connecticut. Sandy Hook has become synonymous with a cynicism about America’s escalating gun violence problem; if Americans could not pass stricter gun laws after 20 children were shot dead in their elementary school classrooms, then they would never act. But Newtown’s activists have not given up. On Wednesday, a week before the fifth anniversary of the shooting, a group of more than 40 local residents and their allies met in the early morning darkness behind the Newtown Municipal Center. They boarded a bus to Washington DC with snacks and pillows and stacks of pamphlets, some of them carrying the more formal clothes they would wear to the Capitol. In the darkness, one volunteer moved through the aisle, handing out homemade gingerbread muffins and slices of coffee cake baked by a neighbor who had not been able to come on the trip. The activists on the bus were not the parents of the 20 children and six educators killed. They were friends and neighbors and a few survivors, people who described how the horror of the shooting rippling outwards through the whole community, permanently changed them. There was Gina McDade, who had lived near the shooter and his mother. “I knew her as a mother and there were no signs that anything was wrong,” McDade said. “We can’t round up every angry kid. What we can control is guns.” The morning of the shooting in 2012, McDade had seen lines of Swat cars moving into her neighborhood. Six of the families who had lost their loved ones also lived in that same area, not far from where the shooter had lived. Each family was assigned a law enforcement detail. Even before the names of the victims had been publicly announced, “you saw the state trooper car in the driveway and you knew”. There was Kari Hulgaard, whose daughter, just before the massacre, had danced the Nutcracker with some of the kids from Sandy Hook, and Janice Bernard, who works in the children’s section of the local library, and seen the parents finally come in after the shooting, their faces still stunned and disbelieving. And there was Jackson Mittleman, 11 at the time, who had been in a school two miles away from Sandy Hook when the shooting happened. All he knew, at first, was that his school had gone into lockdown while he was in orchestra class. He put his violin aside and huddled with his classmates under and around the teacher’s desk. They stayed there for hours. Mittleman has vivid memories of the rest of that day: an early television report saying that at least 18 people were dead in a shooting at an elementary school just two miles from his school. Seeing two parents he knew, the Pozners, in the kitchen of a friend’s house. The Pozners had three kids who were students at Sandy Hook. They were just sitting there, saying nothing. Watching TV in the basement with his siblings that night as the president of the United States talked about what had happened in their town. The brutality of the attack shocked the world. In less than 11 minutes, a 20-year-old local man obsessed with mass shootings had burst into a Connecticut elementary school with an AR-15-style rifle and murdered 20 young children and six educators, including the school’s principal. Newtown was deluged with donations and calls and hand-drawn cards, as well as tens of thousands of teddy bears. When Mittleman went back to his school on Monday, there was a Swat team waiting outside. The streets of Newtown filled with news trucks, and on at least one day, news trucks and hearses. McDade opened her door to a single news reporter and in minutes found herself lit by the glare of television lights. “It still felt like it was happening for a while,” Mittleman said. Local residents said it took about year for Newtown for feel anything close to normal, and that it’s still not quite back yet. As the sun rose on the bus to Washington, Po Murray, the chairman of the Newtown Action Alliance, which organized the trip, rallied the women at the front of the bus. “Can I put you ladies to work?” she asked. “Here are the staplers.” The volunteers begin working through the stacks of form letters to legislators, to be stapled delivered in person over the next two days. Later, Murray talked through the four current gun bills the group supported and they two they opposed. “It’s like doing a high school project,” a volunteer quipped. “Lobbying for dummies,” someone said. Since Donald Trump, the National Rifle Association’s chosen candidate, won the White House, backed by more than $30m in support from the NRA, an already uphill battle for gun control laws has become even harder. After a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, a White House spokeswoman emphasize the importance of not passing gun control laws. As the gun control campaigners arrived in Washington, after years of preparation, House Republicans were poised to vote on the NRA’s “no 1 legislative priority.” The federal law would tear down local restrictions and requirements for carrying guns in public, and make it possible for tourists from other states to carry their guns in Los Angeles restaurants or on the New York City subway, and for residents of states with strict gun laws to simply shop around for an easier state to issue them a gun-carrying permit. Local police chiefs across the country lined up against the bill, saying it would be an enforcement nightmare for officers on the street. Republicans, in contrast, argued that the policy would only make America safer, by making it easier for armed citizens to confront violent threats. The vote on this NRA-backed “concealed carry reciprocity” bill had been scheduled for the same day the Newtown group arrived in Washington for their annual vigil, which Democratic lawmakers criticized as shameful and insulting. The Newtown bus pulled up at the Capitol, and advocates hurried up the steps towards a patch of grass in front of the House of Representatives. Those protesting the NRA’s attempt to eviscerate local gun control laws included gun violence survivors from Chicago, the sister of the school psychologist killed at Sandy Hook, family members of people who had used guns to kill themselves, and women who had escaped domestic violence. For survivors who had been shot themselves, the risk of the law was particularly immediate: domestic violence survivors in particular often move to states with tougher gun laws to protect themselves, said Maj Sabrina Tapp-Harper of the Baltimore city sheriff’s department. This law would undo their protections. That same day, thousands of protesters pushing to restore legal protections for young undocumented immigrants had massed on the steps of the Capitol, leading to almost 200 arrests. But most of America’s gun control groups have yet to embrace civil disobedience. The gun control protest against the NRA’s number one priority piece of legislation was small and decorous. There was a careful selection of more pro-gun advocates of gun control, including a rancher from New Mexico in a cowboy hat and a former rear admiral from the US Navy. Tiffany Starr, who had come to Washington from New Jersey for her first day of gun violence prevention advocacy, had tried to sway a vote on the NRA-backed bill. Her congressman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, was a vulnerable Republican facing re-election next year. He had been targeted by a gun control group with ads urging him to vote against the NRA bill. Starr and a fellow survivor met with one of Frelinghuysen’s staffers and shared their stories as gun violence survivors. Starr’s father had been killed in 1994 when her sister’s abusive ex-boyfriend shot his way into their house looking for her. Their father had pushed her sister out of the way, and then been shot himself, giving his wife and daughters just enough time to run and hide in a neighbor’s house. Frelinghuysen’s staffer listened politely. The meeting was “short and sweet” but the experience was “very depressing,” Starr said. Two survivors had explained why the law would make them feel unsafe, they had described their terrible, first-hand experiences of gun violence. But there still didn’t seem to be any opening for reconsidering the lawmaker’s position. Starr and a group of other survivors had gone through several Capitol metal detectors and into the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the vote on the NRA bill. The women looked down on the sea of blue and gray suits, the silver hair of the hundreds of white men of the House of Representatives, the scattered red suits and dresses of the female members. “I’m pretty sure” that Frelinghuysen’s voting yes to support the NRA’s bill, Starr said. The women were staring at the screens showing the vote count on the bill. “I think the vote’s done. I think it’s done. He did vote yes,” she said. The concealed carry bill had advanced to the Senate, where it was seen as unlikely to get very far, by a margin of 231-198. “What I want to know is why it’s so noisy,” Teresa Piliero said, as they got up to go. The chatter on the House floor, as members milled about, talking to each other, had gone on unabated as the NRA bill passed. Newtown residents were still pushing through the halls of Congress on Thursday, weary staffers listening to their pitch, as the news broke of another school shooting, this one in New Mexico. Three students, including the shooter, were dead. It was such a small school shooting, in a day of scandal and resignation in Washington and fires in California, that it barely registered on the news. Small shootings now were met with resignation. Trump had said, after the Las Vegas shooting, that “we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear,” but gun control advocates were tired of thoughts and prayers and losing votes. The NRA’s push for its guns-everywhere bill was winning in Washington, but it had started the fight three decades earlier in the states, where advocates had succeeded in liberalizing laws for gun carrying, one state at a time. Gun control advocates have more recently made the same strategic move to the states, and there they were seeing small victories. Chris Hurst, the boyfriend of Alison Parker, a journalist who had been shot to death on live television in 2015, had decided to quit his own job as a reporter and run for state office in Virginia against an NRA-backed opponent. He had won. In his speech to other gun violence prevention advocates at a vigil, Hurst praised another survivor who was now running for state office in Georgia: Lucia McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis, a black teenager who had been shot to death by a white man after the man told him he was playing his music too loudly at a gas station. All night, advocates kept coming up to Hurst, exclaiming “Wow!” and offering hugs. Asked what advice he had for fellow survivors who wanted to run for office, Hurst said: “Trust in your strength.”",2017-12-09 07:00:06,"Five years on, Sandy Hook campaigners refuse to give up despite Washington inertia",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

X OUR PICKS: BAGHDAD — After more than three years of combat operations, Iraq announced Saturday that the fight against the Islamic State group is over after the country’s security forces drove the extremists from all of the territory they once held. Iraqi and American officials warned, however, that key challenges remain despite the military victory. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally announced the victory in an address to the nation aired on Iraqi state television Saturday evening. “Honorable Iraqis, your land has been completely liberated,” he said. “The liberation dream has become a reality. We achieved victory in difficult circumstances and with God’s help, the steadfastness of our people and the bravery of our heroic forces we prevailed.” “The flag of Iraq is flying high today over all Iraqi territory and at the farthest point on the border,” he added, standing before the most senior members of Iraq’s security forces. Following al-Abadi’s remarks, his office declared a public holiday Sunday in celebration of the victory, according to an official statement from the prime minister’s office. Related Articles

			Pelosi says ‘deadly serious’ Jan. 6 probe to go without GOP Iraqi forces mopped up the last pockets of ISIS fighters from Iraq’s western deserts Saturday, securing the country’s border with Syria, a step that marked the end of combat operations against the extremists. “All Iraqi lands are liberated from terrorist Daesh gangs and our forces completely control the international Iraqi-Syrian border,” said Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah, a senior Iraqi military commander, in a statement Saturday afternoon.
The U.S. applauded the prime minister’s announcement. The U.S. offers “sincere congratulations to the Iraqi people and to the brave Iraqi Security Forces, many of whom lost their lives heroically fighting ISIS,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a written statement. “Our coalition will continue to stand with Iraq to support its security forces, economy and stabilization to help ensure that ISIS can never against threaten Iraq’s people or use its territory as a haven,” said Brett McGurk, U.S. special presidential envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, in a statement posted to his official Twitter account. “We mark today’s historic victory mindful of the work that remains,” he added. Iraq’s government remains faced with significant security threats, an economic crisis and the enormous task of rebuilding swaths of territory decimated by the ISIS fight. ISIS fighters overran nearly a third of Iraqi territory, including Mosul, the country’s second largest city and Tikrit, the capital of Iraq’s central Salahuddin province in the summer of 2014. The following year, IS fighters also overran Anbar’s provincial capital of Ramadi. Over the past 3½ half years, Iraqi ground forces closely backed by the U.S.-led coalition and mostly Shiite paramilitary forces backed by Iran have slowly retaken all of that territory. The pace of the anti-ISIS operation accelerated last year as coalition-backed Iraqi ground forces prepared for the assault on Mosul that was formally launched in October 2016. After more than nine months of mostly grueling urban combat, Al-Abadi declared victory over ISIS in Mosul in July. In the months that followed Iraqi forces retook a handful of other IS held towns including Tal Afar in August, Hawija in September and Qaim in October. In November, Iraqi forces retook the last Iraqi town held by IS — Rawah, near the border with Syria. However, ISIS fighters remain capable of carrying out insurgent attacks in Iraq, and the group has recovered from past setbacks.
IS insurgent networks continue to pose a threat to Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, a senior Iraqi security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official said intelligence gathering would become increasingly important in the post-military phase of the fight against ISIS. “The triumph of military operations alone is not enough without stability,” government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said, explaining that rebuilding in the wake of military victories against IS remained a “big challenge” for the Iraqi government. Additionally, some 3 million Iraqis remain displaced by the fight against ISIS, according to the United Nations. Al-Abadi also remains faced with a political and military stand-off with the country’s Kurdish region over a referendum held on independence. Federal government troops remain deployed throughout a string of disputed territories claimed by both Baghdad and Iraq’s Kurds — who were also backed by U.S.-led coalition forces in the fight against ISIS. While Baghdad and Irbil have both stated a willingness to talk, negotiations to end the dispute have not yet begun.

189,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/10/ask-amy-family-affected-by-las-vegas-shooting-not-receiving-support/,"Trending: Dear Amy: My son-in-law was shot in the thigh during the Las Vegas concert in October. Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation — I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? — Troubled Dear Troubled: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the “Music City Cares Fund,” established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in American history. You don’t say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of “shooting your mouth off”). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. Dear Amy: My wife is a very opinionated person. She has no social filters. On her son’s (my stepson’s) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in mid-morning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn’t believe that the bride really loved her son, but was only marrying him for his money. In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now, (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don’t want anything to do with my wife, and I’m left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? — Mending Dear Mending: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn’t unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. Dear Amy: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don’t think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. — Concerned Dear Concerned: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life. And cancer exacts a terrible toll, but I believe that this is fairly common knowledge.

190,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/police-officer-ptsd-pulse-massacre-loses-his-job-n827171?cid=public-rss_20171210," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Omar Delgado realized he wanted to become a police officer after moving from Chicago to Central Florida, where he met and tagged along with a Seminole County deputy who soon became a close friend. He graduated from the police academy and then, nine and a half years ago, took a job with the Eatonville Police Department, where he remained “because they were the first ones who gave [him] the opportunity.” But now, the 45-year-old corporal is saying he was dismissed from the force Monday — six months before he was due to be vested in its pension system — because he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after being one of the first to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen opened fire and took hostages at the LGBT-friendly nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Delgado returned to patrol duty for a few months after the shooting, but said he decided to stop. For the past eight months, he has been working a desk job answering phones, recording fingerprints and completing similar administrative tasks. And on Tuesday night, the Eatonville Town Council voted unanimously to pay Delgado $1,200 before taxes in accrued sick time, and designated Dec. 31 as his last day of work, The Orlando Sentinel reported. Related: Pulse massacre officer creates hope by adopting three foster kids Delgado, a married father of three, said the gravity of his dismissal hit him while watching a local news story about it with his 9-year-old daughter. “My mouth dropped, and she asked me why am I not going to be a police officer anymore,” he told NBC News. “I had to tell her it was because I’m sick. It’s a challenge to try and explain something like that to a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old.” Delgado said he will begin receiving 42 percent of his $38,500 annual salary a decade from now, when he’s 55 years old. The Eatonville Police Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NBC News. Angel Colon, who was rescued by Delgado after being shot six times during the massacre, denounced the department for terminating the man who saved him. Related: Pulse nightclub survivor takes the stage more than a year after shooting “He saved my life and for them to just do what they're doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well,” Colon told WFTV. “He did his job that night on June 12, so they should have his back 100 percent.” Ever since the massacre, Delgado has regularly woken up screaming after having the same nightmare about the carnage he witnessed that night in Orlando. He said he can only sleep between three and five hours each night — even on medication. “After that night, it was hell,” Delgado said. “Just trying to continue my life with visions of what I witnessed. No man should ever have to do that.” The officer said he has difficulty being in bars, restaurants or anywhere that’s noisy with crowds of people. He said he constantly fears that an event similar to the massacre will happen wherever he goes. “I just don’t live my life the way I did before what happened at Pulse,” Delgado said. “I feel bad, and I can see myself deteriorating away because I don’t do the things I enjoyed doing before. I’d rather be home — I’d rather stay in my room.” Related: First responders face PTSD risk after Vegas shooting According to Florida state law, workers who endure psychological trauma on the job are not entitled to paid days off or medical bill reimbursement by their employers. But a new bill that advanced in the Florida Senate Tuesday might lead to a policy change. Senate Bill 376 would require coverage for PTSD treatment in workers’ compensation insurance for first responders who witnessed or responded to the scene of a child death, murder, suicide, fatal injury or mass-casualty incident. On Wednesday, multiple Central Florida lawmakers responded to Delgado's termination by calling for workers’ compensation for first responders coping with work-related mental health issues. Shortly after learning of his dismissal, Delgado said he received an outpouring of support from friends, family and community members. A GoFundMe account that was created on his behalf had collected more than $35,000 as of Friday morning. Delgado said he is grateful for the support, but still wishes he had his job — especially now during the holiday season. “You expect your country to take care of you,” he said. “I thought my department would’ve taken care of me, and that’s not the case.” Dan Corey is an associate segment producer for MSNBC. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2017-12-10 15:48:24,Officer with PTSD from Pulse massacre loses his job,,34663,http://www.breakingnews.com#spider

On Apple TV+, Where A Couple Has Their Love Tested In A Strange Musical Town If you watched the most recent season of Netflix’s Bojack Horseman, then you would have seen Episode 5 titled “Thoughts and Prayers,” which centers around a mass shooting at a mall that creates a PR nightmare for Princess Carolyn. While the depressive SVOD original series seems to focus mainly on the central character’s woes, the show’s writers do a great job at peppering in current socio-political topics. Since mass shootings have unfortunately become a global issue, it makes sense to analyze what the episode got right (or wrong) about how we respond to these tragic events. The film that Princess Carolyn was preparing to market prior to the fictional mass shooting was titled Ms. Taken, which stars Courtney Portnoy and features an action scene that is essentially a mall shootout. The film’s producer is informed of the tragic event and calls for an emergency board meeting. One thing that the episode blatantly does is dehumanize the media and entertainment industry. While the room full of industry heads panic and try to brainstorm a way to market the film in light of the event, Portnoy makes sure to say “…of course my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.” The rest of the room quickly agrees and makes sure to repeat her “thoughts and prayers” comment, which they continue to do throughout the episode. One could say that this was a dig at our celebrities who are often quick to take to social media to offer their condolences. It is not our place to say whether their concerns are sincere, but from a PR standpoint, it’s certainly the appropriate action. While still in the boardroom, the group receives notifications about two more mass shootings that occur, which was a show of how unfortunately common these events have become. Princess Carolyn then comes up with the idea of having journalist Diane Nguyen take the pro-gun side to help bolster positive attention towards the upcoming film. The reluctant Diane spends some time with Courtney who is successful in piquing her interest in carrying a gun. In typical fashion, Diane embarks on a tirade about how women should carry guns to stay safe. Her stance attracts a ton of media attention, which goes as far as to infer that if a woman were to shoot an unarmed person, politicians would immediately work to ban the use of firearms by women. This was clearly a dig at how our society and media tends to profile a terrorist simply by their gender or looks. Is the episode right about how we’ve approached mass shootings around the world? Was the show insensitive in their approach or just realistic? Is it wrong for us to spread hate and push our own personal agendas after such tragic events? Well, of course. There are certainly better ways we can all respond to these tragic events, starting with how we respond to the media and position ourselves on social platforms. While more of a personal dramedy, at the very least Bojack Horseman did a great job at presenting a touchy subject and making us take a look at how we respond to them as a society.

192,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/508781780/0/phoenix/nation~What-does-Flynnaposs-indictment-mean-for-Vice-President-Pence/," Corrections and clarifications: A prior version of this story misstated the status of Mike Flynn's legal case. He pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the FBI. WASHINGTON – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a theory on why he was replaced by Mike Pence as head of Donald Trump’s presidential transition. Christie told reporters Wednesday he thinks his opposition to naming retired Army general Michael Flynn as Trump’s national security adviser was a “significant reason” for his ouster. Putting Flynn in that sensitive position was a “big mistake,” Christie says, one that the country is paying dearly for. Whether Pence himself also has to pay a legal or political price for his association with Flynn is not yet clear. Flynn, who plead guilty this month to lying to the FBI about prior contacts with Russia’s ambassador, could have evidence that Pence knew more than what he’s said. So far, Pence’s regular response to revelations about interactions between Flynn and other members of the Trump team with Russian operatives is that it’s news to him. “Don’t forget Flynn may well have highly incriminating evidence about VPOTUS Mike Pence, who claimed that Flynn misled him about (Russian Ambassador Sergey) Kislyak,” Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe tweeted after Flynn pleaded guilty. “Perhaps Pence wasn’t as clueless as he claims.” Don’t forget Flynn may well have highly incriminating evidence about VPOTUS Mike Pence, who claimed that Flynn misled him about Kislyak. Perhaps Pence wasn’t as clueless as he claims. And we know a sitting VP can be indicted and convicted. Recall Agnew. But Andy Wright, who was a lawyer for Vice President Al Gore and for President Barack Obama, said it’s too soon to tell what Flynn’s guilty plea, and other developments in the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, may mean for Pence. “I think they have raised questions that Pence will have to answer,” Wright said. “But, right now, I haven’t seen anything that suggests his legal liability, absent more information.” Pence’s office said he was not one of the top transition officials Flynn — who was the vice chairman of the transition — spoke with about his conversations with Kislyak. At the time of those conversations, which took place at the end of 2016, Pence was in Indiana with his family.  (Pence’s son got married in Indiana Dec. 28, the day Obama signed an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia and Kislyak reached out to Flynn. In his plea agreement, Flynn said he discussed, on Dec. 29, how to respond to Kislyak with a senior member of the transition team who was with other senior leaders at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. When Flynn called Kislyak back, he asked the Russians not to escalate the situation.) Pence, based on what he’s said were assurances from Flynn, asserted on CBS’s Face the Nation in January that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss the sanctions. Because the Justice Department knew about the call from surveillance of Kislyak, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House that Flynn lied about the nature of the calls so was vulnerable to blackmail.  Flynn wasn’t dismissed until mid-February, after media reports of Yates’ warning. In Flynn’s resignation, he said he had “inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information.” More: Full text: Here is what Michael Flynn is pleading guilty to More: Trump tweet suggests he knew Flynn lied to FBI when he fired him More: House conservatives ramp up accusations of bias against Trump in Russia probe Pence has not been interviewed by Mueller. He also hasn’t talked to any of the congressional committees investigating Russia’s election interference. But Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Pence should testify before that panel. “I want answers to some of the questions that logically flow from the Flynn guilty plea, such as what did he know about Flynn’s contacts with the Russians during the transition, when he was a very key figure,” Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday. Even before Flynn’s plea agreement, Blumenthal was seeking answers from Pence. He sent Pence a letter at the end of November asking for information on the role Flynn played within the transition team on issues affecting Flynn’s lobbying clients. “It is imperative that we learn the full extent of Mr. Flynn’s hidden lobbying for special interests or foreign interests while on the transition team and in the White House, as well as any undisclosed work he did for the Russian or Turkish governments, so that we may know his legal liability,” Blumenthal wrote. Flynn had not registered as lobbyist for Turkish clients while working for them. He told the transition team in early January that the FBI was investigating his lobbying work, The New York Times previously reported. Pence has maintained he only learned about Flynn’s work for Turkey from news reports. After taking over the transition team, however, Pence was sent a letter by Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, raising questions about Flynn’s lobbying for Russia and Turkey. Cummings asked for information Flynn had shared with the transition about his work, and a signed assertion from Flynn that he did not have conflicts of interest. Pence's office declined to say Friday why Pence did not respond to Cummings’ letter. Wright, however, said that while many people are pointing to Cummings’ letter to Pence as evidence he knew about Flynn's involvement with foreign governments, it’s not clear how the transition handled incoming mail from lawmakers, and whether Pence saw it. Pence’s attorney, Wright said, should be gathering all the documents that show a chain of knowledge — from the campaign, the transition and the White House — so he’s not blindsided by anything. That includes any documentation about Pence’s role in the drafting of the letter laying out Trump’s reasons for firing James Comey as FBI director, an issue that could potentially lead to charges of obstruction of justice if Trump was trying to prevent the FBI from going after Flynn. “I’d just want to know a lot more about the tick tock of what he knew and what he didn’t,” Wright said. Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson said Flynn’s plea agreement “means you’re getting closer to Pence and Trump.” “But it doesn’t mean you’ll ever get there,” she added. “I don’t know what Flynn knows. I don’t know what Vice President Pence knows.” And while Pence could potentially be impeached for any revelations that come out, even if he isn’t charged with a crime, Levinson suspects the impeachment bar in the GOP-controlled Senate would be pretty high. “I don’t see a world in which they would move forward on impeachment unless it’s something that is so bad that they feel like they can’t win elections,” Levinson said. “And if I’ve learned anything in the last year, it’s that that threshold of `so bad’ is so much worse than I thought it was going to be.” Aside from any legal liability Pence could face, there’s his reputation to consider. Every time one of Pence’s statements has come back to bite him — including his assertions that Flynn didn’t discuss sanctions with Kislyak, his explanation for why Comey was fired, his dismissing as “bizarre rumors” the suggestion that there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Trump associates — he faced the charge that if he was not lying, then he was an “out of the loop dupe.” “Is Mike Pence a fool or a knave?” Washington Post columnist Colbert I. King asked after Flynn’s plea agreement. Mark J. Rozell, an expert on the presidency at George Mason University, said Pence has been able to protect himself somewhat by projecting an image as a bit of an outsider in the White House. That’s a strange role for a vice president, Rozell said, “except that he’s working for Donald Trump.” While Rozell doesn’t think the investigations have seriously tainted Pence’s image, “suspicions are growing in some circles and it is not clear if he can long separate himself in the public mind from the president and the president's inner circle.” Republican operatives, however, say Pence still has a very high trustworthy quotient, despite the number of times some of his statements have been undermined. “Pence is a very careful person, and he is not someone who is going to say something and not mean it,” said Ron Bonjean, Republican partner at the public affairs shop Rokk Solutions. “So when he says that he was lied to, or his team has said that he was lied to, most Republicans, I say most people, take it as face value.” Longtime GOP strategist Danny Diaz likewise said Pence is still widely viewed as a straight shooter. “He’s someone who speaks with a high degree of credibility and consistency with regards to his views on matters,” Diaz said. “You have to measure an individual based on their record. And over many, many years, he is beyond reproach.” ",2017-12-10 13:53:08,What does Flynn&apos;s indictment mean for Vice President Pence?,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com
193,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/506844278/0/milwaukee/home~The-biggest-trends-in-music-in-amounted-to-one-thing-a-shift-in-power/,"In the world of music in 2017, there were many big moments: the dominance of ""Despacito;"" the latest albums from Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z; the death of Tom Petty. But the real milestones of the year went beyond any single song, album, superstar ascent or legendary artist's death. From hip-hop's dominance, to Latin music's mainstream breakthrough, to the ongoing ripple effect of the #MeToo movement, many of the biggest music trends seem to represent one thing: a seismic shift in power. Artists of color in 2017 received greater respect and success. The careers of powerful men who had abused their power through sexual harassment and assault were taken down over and over again. And an American president has perhaps never faced more scrutiny from musicians than what we're seeing right now. Looking back, here are the five major developments in music that will certainly have ongoing ramifications for the future. It's been a rhetorical question for eons: Can you separate the art from the artist? Is it right to consume or champion works of art by someone known or suspected to have committed despicable, even criminal, atrocities? In 2017, we've come closer to a definitive answer than ever before: No. Throughout the year, and especially this fall in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, we've seen seemingly unsinkable careers meet a swift demise, from Bill O' Reilly to Kevin Spacey. Musicians haven't been impervious. Wisconsin-born actor and singer Tom Wopat was fired from a musical and faces criminal charges, including indecent assault and battery. Rock band PWR BTTM was poised for a major year thanks to acclaimed album ""Pageant,"" but its ascent plummeted amid sexual abuse allegations against frontman Ben Hopkins. Marilyn Manson fired his friend and longtime bassist Twiggy Ramirez following a rape accusation. Once-powerful Nashville music publicist Kirt Webster is out of work, music mogul  Russell Simmons stepped away from business ventures, and acclaimed acts like Crystal Castles and Brand New have been rocked by the #MeToo movement. But consequences have been grossly inconsistent. R. Kelly, whose career has long endured controversy, was the subject of disturbing reports of running a ""cult"" where he's reportedly isolated women and subjected them to physical and verbal abuse. But he still toured after the report and released a song called ""Juicy Booty"" with another controversial figure, Chris Brown. Rising rapper XXXTentacion faced serious charges last fall — including aggravated battery of a pregnant woman — but his first full-length album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in August. But more stars are certain to fall amid new allegations yet to come forward, while listeners and labels are more likely to scrutinize new artists going forward. RELATED: Weinstein aftermath: All the men accused of sexual misconduct RELATED: Following indecent assault charges, Lodi native Tom Wopat's Wisconsin shows canceled RELATED: More sexual harassment accusations emerge against former Dolly Parton publicist RELATED: Chris Brown and R. Kelly's new collaboration shows how toxic men still rule music The inevitable finally happened this summer when hip-hop, combined with R&B, eclipsed rock as the most consumed genre of music in America, according to Nielsen SoundScan. You can thank the rise in streaming for this significant change; hip-hop is the most popular genre on Spotify and SoundCloud. Several rap tracks went No. 1 that wouldn't have seemed possible two years ago, from Cardi B's ""Bodak Yellow"" to Post Malone's ""Rockstar"" to Migos' ""Bad and Boujee,"" and a dozen hip-hop albums have hit No. 1 this year. LL Cool J even became the first rapper to receive a Kennedy Center honor, while the stodgy Recording Academy — criticized for awarding top prizes to white artists in recent years over acclaimed works from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Beyonce — has nominated three hip-hop albums for the Album of the Year Grammy in 2018, with Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar leading with the most nominations. RELATED: Cardi B makes music history at top of Billboard chart RELATED: Keeping up with the Migos, rap's breakout 'Bad' boys RELATED: The 2018 Grammy nominations deservedly celebrate artists of color Hip-hop also led the wave of protest music that swelled in response to the polarizing president. No musical response garnered more attention than Eminem's scathing freestyle on the BET Hip Hop Awards, where he gave fans an ultimatum: If you're a fan of Trump, you're not a fan of mine. Political protests made their way into blockbuster arena tours with Roger Waters and Janet Jackson, while Taylor Swift received some criticism for not being political enough. And while country artists serving a conservative fan base generally skirted around political issues, there were a couple headline-seizing songs inspired by the politics of our times — Keith Urban's ""Female,"" Maren Morris' ""Dear Hate."" Outspoken political stances from Sturgill Simpson and Rosanne Cash suggest that fear of the dreaded ""Dixie Chicks"" curse, where the country group took a huge hit for protesting President George W. Bush, may someday cease to exist. Meanwhile, political music as a whole isn't going away anytime soon. RELATED: Milwaukee musicians respond to Trump presidency with protest music RELATED: With Trump-trashing spectacle, Roger Waters divides in Milwaukee, and conquers RELATED: After Eminem's Trump-trashing freestyle, hip-hop becomes leading source of protest music ""Despacito,"" Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's flirty reggaeton pop number (with an assist by Justin Bieber on the remix) wasn't your average blockbuster hit. It's the most streamed song in history — a staggering 4.4 billion views on YouTube alone — and was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 16 consecutive weeks, tying as the longest-reigning chart-topper in history. This wasn't a quirky novelty moment like the ""Macarena."" Following ""Despacito,"" 10 other primarily Spanish-language songs have cracked the Hot 100, compared with two in 2016. Superstar Beyonce, like Bieber before her, sang in Spanish, for a remix of J. Balvin's mega-hit ""Mi Gente."" Six out of 10 of the most-watched YouTube music videos this year were from Latin artists.

In 2015, an Eagles of Death Metal concert was the centerpiece of the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II. An Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in May was the subject of the worst terror attack in England in 12 years. And the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas in October became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. It's horrifying and depressing to think that these shows, where people come together to celebrate music, could be subjected to such despicable carnage and cowardice. This year it's typically taken more time to get past security at Milwaukee concerts, and several festivals have reported an ongoing analysis of their security measures. It may seem like a nuisance, but it's necessary for these times. And come next year, and certainly further into the future, there'll almost certainly be even greater security measures to better ensure that shows stay safe.

195,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/20/sell-your-tesla-stock-marvell-gets-in-the-chips-with-cavium-deal/,"Trending: Sell Your Tesla?: That’s the opinion of JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who on Monday reiterated his underweight rating — the equivalent of “sell” — on the electric carmaker, on the grounds that Tesla could see more production and financial issues related to its much ballyhooed Model 3. The car’s widespread release has already been delayed for months due to production line matters. Unlike traditional automakers that can spread the costs of developing electric and hybrid cars across multiple vehicle models and traditional gasoline-powered cars, Brinkman said Tesla’s high-priced vehicles may take longer to provide the company with consistent profit margins to match the cars’ sticker prices. Brinkman also maintained his $185-a-share target price on Tesla’s stock — around 40 percent less than Tesla shares’ Monday closing price of $308.74 a share. No Turkey, Just Chips: While a lot of companies in the Bay Area are known for closing up shop, or at least taking it easy during Thanksgiving week, Marvell Technology decided to go on a little buying binge before the Black Friday deals kick in. Marvell said it would pay $6 billion to acquire fellow chipmaker Cavium, of San Jose, to boost up its presence in the market for semiconductors used in wireless communications, security and the automotive industry. Apple vs. FBI, Round 2?: Could Apple be about to get into it, again, with the FBI over an iPhone used in a mass shooting? The FBI has served Apple with a warrant to get information from the iPhone used by the shooter who killed 26 people and injured 20 more at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Nov. 5. Apple says it offered to help the FBI with any legal requests it had, but that the bureau didn’t take the company up on the offer to open the iPhone by using Touch ID without a passcode within 48 hours.

200,https://www.bustle.com/p/gun-background-checks-on-black-friday-broke-last-years-record-by-over-17000-requests-5552159,"News  Big screen televisions, video game consoles, and the latest craze in kids' toys are popular purchases for eager Black Friday shoppers. But the biggest day for holiday shopping is also reportedly a big day for rifle, shotgun, and handgun sales. In fact, Nov. 24, which fell just weeks after 26 people were killed in a shooting at a Texas church, saw the FBI receive more than 200,000 requests for gun background checks. That means Black Friday 2017 set a new record for the number of gun background checks demanded in a single day, USA Today reported. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) received 203,086 requests for background checks this past Friday alone, as Black Friday shoppers rushed to snap up firearms amid a flurry of deals. The number represents a significant jump from the previous single-day record of 185,713 requests for background checks. That record was reportedly set last year on Black Friday. And in 2015, the FBI received 185,345 background check requests, surpassing the previous single-day record of 117,170 set on Dec. 21, 2012, according to Fortune. But what's behind the boost in sales? While President Donald Trump's pro-gun stance earned him an early endorsement from the National Rifle Association, it's also reportedly caused a decline in firearms sales as potential buyers cease to fear a federal crackdown on gun sales or gun control efforts. According to CNN, firearms dealers were hoping that rebates and deep discounts would lure in customers on Black Friday and boost recently slagging sales. Two of the industry's biggest manufactures, Remington Arms Company and Browning Arms Company, offered cash rebates of up to $200 on shotguns and $100 on rifles this year, the cable news network reported. Cabela's, a specialty retailer for outdoor recreation sports such as hunting and shooting, rolled out 14 days of rifle, handgun, and ammunition deals in an effort to drum up sales. And if the new record for single-day gun background checks set Friday is any indication, those retailers' efforts appear to have worked. However, sales and slashed prices may not be the only thing drawing in firearms customers this year. According to a 2015 report by TIME magazine, recent mass shootings may also play a key role. ""Spikes in gun sales regularly occur following mass shootings, often over concerns of increased gun regulation or because people are looking for increased protection,"" TIME reported. A total of 26 people were killed Nov. 5 when a gunman opened fire on people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. State officials have said it was the largest mass shooting in Texas' history. Reports that the shooter, a court-martialed Air Force veteran, cleared a background check enabling him to buy his weapon have spurred renewed debate about gun control. In fact, just days before Black Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he'd ordered a complete review of the database used by the FBI to conduct background checks on gun buyers. The purpose of the review is to determine why necessary information was not being properly reported to the NICS database. A background check on the Texas church shooter, for instance, should have prevented him from being able to purchase a firearm due to his court martial. While background checks are a requirement for any gun purchase made through a federally-licensed firearm dealer, they can't necessarily estimate the number of firearms actually sold. That's because a buyer looking to purchase multiple firearms in a single purchase only has to submit to one background check. In other words, the number of firearms sold on Black Friday this year could be significantly higher than the 203,086 requests for gun background checks.

201,http://www.ibtimes.com/alex-jones-suggests-las-vegas-mass-shooting-was-fake-2620411,"American Radio show host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, in the Nov. 27 edition of “The Alex Jones Show” has claimed that the Las Vegas shooting was as phony as former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Jones was speaking to a caller on the show when he described the Las Vegas massacre to be fake. Read the transcript of the call here which was obtained from Media Matters for America. ALEX JONES (HOST): Well I know the FBI went and picked up the caller you heard earlier when he talked about it being an Islamic attack and there were shootings all over town and helicopters being used. And the FBI showed up and drugged the guy and then declared national security. He’s had to leave the country just over that, so do you think they’d be having the FBI at his house in two hours after he called in about that if it was just a rumor? No, they don’t want that discussed. So Vegas is as phony as a three dollar bill or as Obama’s birth certificate. CALLER: Wow. JONES: Isn’t that crazy? CALLER: That is so crazy, so many people died -- JONES: They had the Saudi military was having a convention there that week. CALLER: Yeah, because I remember the most I’ve heard is what you’ve gone over and the other guy that had some so much research into all the planes that had changed where they were -- JONES: Sure, well the FBI showed up and they told him, they said, “You talk about that again, we’re going to put you in prison because that’s classified information.” Even though he’d figured it out himself. The fact is the government, the military all know. They’ve been ordered not talk about it because it’s all part of this deal that Trump’s got with the Saudis. We’ll see if that’s really the case, but that was an Islamic terror attack from all the evidence we have. Jones also tweeted on his official page on Nov. 28 asking people to cast their votes for ""Fake News Awards"". In the list of options that the listeners could choose from, Las Vegas mass shooting was also included. Jones also ensured his listeners that he would announce the results on the Nov. 28 edition of the show. Check out his tweet here.  Jones, from Dallas, Texas, over the years has been at the center of a lot of controversies. Whether it is promoting Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories or his opposing views towards gun control. Jones has gone as far as to blame the U.S. government for being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11 attacks and the filming of fake moon landings in order to hide NASA’s technology. Jones describes himself as a libertarian and paleoconservative while others describe him as conservative, right-wing, alt-right and far right. New York magazine has also described Jones as ""America's leading conspiracy theorist"", while the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as ""the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America"".",2017-11-27 23:35:09,Alex Jones Suggests The Las Vegas Mass Shooting Was Fake,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

Michael Wolfe, 37, pleaded guilty to vandalism and hate crime charges on Tuesday and received his sentence the next day. After the 15-year prison sentence, Wolfe will also serve 15 years probation.
Advertisement Wolfe was facing a potential life sentence before the plea deal. The spokesman for the State Attorney's Office of Brevard and Seminole County said in a statement that Wolfe was sentenced as a Habitual Felony Offender and also received a hate crime enhancement. Imam Muhammad Musri, the senior imam and president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, said the sentence sends a message that hate crimes will not be tolerated. ""The intent is to really deter similar kinds of hate crime. After what we've seen in Texas at the church, this is needed,"" Musri told Florida Today, referring to the mass shooting at a Christian church that killed 26 people. ""Our schools, our churches, our theaters, it's a red line. It's heartbreaking. The hate must stop.""
Advertisement In January 2016, surveillance video at the Masjid al-Mumin mosque in Titusville, Fla. caught Wolfe using a machete to break windows, lights and surveillance cameras. He then left a slab of raw bacon at the front door of the mosque. Pork is prohibited under Islamic law. Police said the total cost of damage Wolfe inflicted on the mosque totaled about $800, according to the Orlando Sentinel.",2017-12-06 23:47:55,"Florida man gets 15 years for vandalizing mosque with machete, bacon",,1706,http://www.upi.com/

(Click here if you’re having trouble viewing this photo gallery or videos on a mobile device.) By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store  or the Google Play store. It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots.

207,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/27/australian-police-allege-man-planned-new-years-eve-attack/,"Trending: By ROD McGUIRK CANBERRA, Australia — Australian police have arrested a man accused of planning a mass shooting for New Year’s Eve in a crowded Melbourne square, officials said on Tuesday. The 20-year-old Australian-born citizen with Somali parents was trying to obtain an automatic rifle to attack the downtown Federation Square in Australia’s second largest city, Victoria State Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. Thousands of revelers pack the square each year on New Year’s Eve. The man, who was not named, downloaded instructions from an al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula website on how to launch a terrorist attack and how to use guns, Patton said. Patton described the suspect as “a person who’s expressed an intention to try and kill as many people as he could through shooting them.” He said authorities have eliminated the threat of the attack, saying “the risk that was posed by this person has been removed.” Justice Minister Michael Keenan said police arrested four extremist last December over a similar plot to attack Federal Square and other public places in Melbourne over the Christmas-New Year period. Keenan urged the public to continue with their usual routines over the period and expect to see a heavy police presence. “The aim of these terrorists is to foster fear and intimidation, but Australians should be able to go about their business secure in the understanding that the government has worked very closely with law enforcement and other security agencies to keep them safe,” Keenan told reporters. Counter-terrorism police had been monitoring the latest suspect, a known extremist and a sympathizer of the Islamic State group, this year and detained him as he met with people in an attempt to acquire a gun, Patton said. Australia has strict gun laws and automatic weapons are banned from private ownership. The man is the 74th suspect arrested in Australia in 31 counter-terrorism investigations since Australia’s terrorism threat level was elevated to “probable” in September 2014. The plot was the 14th that police say they had disrupted since the terrorist threat level was raised. Five plots have been executed. Police expect he will appear in a Melbourne court late on Tuesday or Wednesday on charges of preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist act. People convicted of those crimes in Australia face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Search warrants were issued on Monday at a home in a suburb where the suspect lived with his parents and siblings, at a relative’s address in another suburb and at a computer business where he once had a part-time job.

211,http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-sympathizer-planning-new-years-eve-mass-shooting-charged-australian-police-2620543,"A man who was reportedly planning a mass shooting in the Federation Square, Melbourne on New Year's Eve, was arrested by Australian police Monday. Ali Khalif Shire Ali, 20, from Werribee, Victoria, was arrested on Synnot Street on Melbourne's outskirts by officials of Victoria police, the Australian Federal police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) around 3 p.m. local time Monday (11 p.m. EST Sunday). Ali appeared before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, where he was charged with preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist act. According to 9News, given the seriousness of the charges filed against Ali, he could be facing life imprisonment. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said that Ali, an Australian citizen with Somalian parents,  made their list of “persons of high interest” after they discovered he was trying get an automatic rifle to ""shoot and kill as many people as he could"" around Federation Square, one of the most popular spots in Melbourne to bring in the New year. The police had kept a close eye on Ali’s actions between the months of March and June and found that the college student downloaded instructions from an al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula website on how to launch a terrorist attack and how to use guns. Patton said Ali, a known extremist and a sympathizer of the Islamic State group, had been having face-to-face meetings about getting a gun. ""We were monitoring this person. He has been subject to our active investigation and at no stage did he access a firearm — albeit that was his intention,"" Patton said. ""This is a person who would become particularly energized, for a lack of a better word, when overseas events occurred and would express a great deal of interest in committing an attack himself,” Patton added, ABC News reported. The suspect was placed under the federal custody after a search warrant was issued Monday for his home, where he lived with his parents and siblings. Additional search warrants were issued for the suspect’s relative's home and at a computer business where he once had a part-time job. Patton described the suspect as ""a person who's expressed an intention to try and kill as many people as he could through shooting them."" He added that arrest made by the authorities was to remove “the risk that was posed by this person.” As the end of the year celebrations near, Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan has told the public to expect increased police presence. Nevertheless, he said that people can go about their daily business uninterrupted. ""The aim of these terrorists is to foster fear and intimidation, but Australians should be able to go about their business secure in the understanding that the government has worked very closely with law enforcement and other security agencies to keep them safe,"" Keenan told reporters, New York Daily News reported. This is not the first time that the counter-terrorism unit of Australian police has arrested a suspect over terror threats around the Christmas-New Year’s time. Keenan added that in December 2016, the police had taken four extremist in custody over a similar plot to attack Federal Square and other public places in Melbourne. Ali is the 74th suspect arrested in Australia since the country’s terrorism threat level was elevated to ""probable"" in September 2014. Since then, 31 counter-terrorism investigations have been conducted and 14 terrorism plots have been thwarted successfully by the anti-terrorism unit.",2017-11-28 05:55:17,ISIS Sympathizer Planning New Year's Eve Mass Shooting Charged By Australian Police,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/
212,http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/corrine-brown-asks-for-mercy,"Hoping to avoid prison, former Florida Rep. Corrine Brownasked for mercy during her sentencing hearing Thursday. Brown also asked that U.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan consider her years of public service, the Florida Times-Union reported. “I am 71 years old. I just had a birthday,” she said. “I humbly ask for your mercy and compassion.” Brown was found guilty of conspiracy involving a bogus charity used as a personal slush fund, concealing income on financial filings and filing false tax returns in May. The disgraced former Democratic congresswoman previously tried delaying her sentencing hearing, citing health reasons and being displaced because of Hurricane Irma. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas provided testimony via telephone for Brown, calling her “a loving person,” First Coast News reported. Jackson Lee also said Brown was loved by the military veterans community and had assisted after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. “That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,” Jackson Lee said of Brown. [Murkowski Tax Vote Contingent on Stabilizing the Individual Market] Brown’s attorney James Smith said she helped remove racial barriers and recalled a conversation with a woman who compared Brown to Martin Luther King Jr. “She truly is a legend,” he said. But because Brown refused to admit guilt, prosecutors said that she should face between five and nine years in prison. “She ran for office to be a leader of American democracy while she stole money in a multitude of ways,” Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Tysen Duva said. Duva also cited Brown saying the government targeted her as a black woman and her suggestion that the Justice Department could have used the energy it spent prosecuting her to stop the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub last year in Orlando. “I wonder if any of her character witnesses will address this. Why will you support someone who says this nonsense,” Duva said. Smith responded by saying Brown regretted her comments about the shooting and while there is no evidence Brown was targeted for her race, women her age remember a time when black women were targeted. Corrigan is set to sentence Brown on Dec. 4. During the hearing, Corrigan said he would try to give Brown a fair sentence. “Ironically, when judges impose sentence, our job is not to be judgmental. Our job is to be an instrument of the law and reflect the mores and values … that we agree to,” he said. “And that is a very complicated stew.”",2017-11-17 07:49:26,Corrine Brown Asks for Mercy at Sentencing Hearing,,19854,http://www.rollcall.com

CLEVELAND – Authorities say an Ohio man has been arrested for threatening to carry out mass shootings at a megachurch and the Las Vegas casino where his estranged wife works. The FBI says 28-year-old Wei Li was transferred from police custody to federal authorities Thursday after being charged in a criminal complaint with interstate communications of a threat and destruction of evidence. The Cuyahoga Falls resident is accused of sending his estranged wife text messages threatening to kill her and commit mass shootings at a casino and a church with more than 1,000 members. The FBI says Li acknowledged sending the texts to his wife but didn't intend to carry out the shootings. No firearms were found in his home. Records don't indicate whether Li has an attorney.

So goes “American Horror Story: Cult,” the ambitious seventh season of Ryan Murphy’s acclaimed horror franchise. After spending an entire season examining a Trump stand-in’s reign of terror, the ending ominously hinted at a new king — well, a new queen. Ally (Sarah Paulson) took down Kai (Evan Peters), stole his senate seat, and began her own quest for greater power — with the help of “some very special, very powerful friends who are going to bring about the better world we were talking about.” Made clear when she dons her green hood, Ally is referring to the radical feminist cult inspired by Valerie Solanas’ (Lena Dunham) “SCUM Manifesto.” It appears the newly elected senator is ready to unleash the female rage first cultivated by Solanas, later resurrected by Bebe Babbit (Frances Conroy) in the present day, and eventually abandoned by her puppet-gone-rogue, Kai. As the acronym implies — SCUM stands for “Society for Cutting Up Men” — Ally is ready to claim her vengeance on the world that wronged her and all other women. Kai was first, but his cult of fear has been replaced by one that’s ready to kill all men in order to install a female-led society.  Speaking as a white man, well, that actually sounds about right. Go for it. But aside from the radical vision for the future, the actual ending left a lot to be desired. For one, the twist ending — that Kai’s plan to kill Ally was actually part of Ally’s plan to kill Kai — was as predictable and problematic as the rest of “American Horror Story.” Never once did it seem like Ally wasn’t one step ahead, leading to an overall lack of suspense, and the idea that she convinced a prison guard to have sex with Kai for God knows how long in order to dupe him into escaping is the kind of soapy trademark lunacy that powers much of the series’ conceits. A lot of the episode clearly sounds good on paper, from the flash-forward intro that pretends to promise a safe ending for Kai, to the actual ending where Ally ushers in an era where the future is exclusively female. It’s in the obvious, flare-less execution and muddled overall message that leads to a shrugging agreement instead of a fist-pumping, wide-eyed agreement.  Let’s see how we got there: The finale begins with Kai in prison. As manipulative and lethal as ever, Kai has quickly amassed a small army in Mississippi’s maximum security prison, but it’s unclear how he got there. So we flash back to 11 months earlier as Kai plans for The Night of 100 Tates, his slightly adjusted master plan (1000 Tates proved too ambitious) to murder over eight dozen pregnant women in the name of Sharon Tate and the Manson family members who murdered her.  Before the fateful onslaught begins, Ally tells Kai a harsh truth regarding his horrific murder of sister Winter (Billie Lourd) in the previous episode. Ally tells Kai he killed the wrong person: Winter didn’t betray him. Some random member of Kai’s posse did (R.I.P. Speedwagon). This sends Kai into a mournful turmoil, but he rallies at Ally’s urging… …until the FBI shows up. Ally, it turns out, has been working as an informant since she joined Kai’s cult. Agents came to see her after she was institutionalized (following the shooting in Episode 6) and gave her immunity for whatever she had to do in order to expose Kai’s criminal organization. That’s a much-needed legal excuse for how she escaped jail time for all those murders, especially when the raid ends. Ally is elevated to hero status as “the woman who escaped a cult but lost her wife,” and she makes a bid for the vacant Michigan Senate seat. Seeing this on TV spurs Kai to escape, and thus Ally’s master plan to come together. As Kai waves a gun in her face, interrupting a debate with the other candidate in order to scream “get me a sandwich” at Ally, he pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. The gun given to him by the duplicitous security guard doesn’t go off, but Beverly’s (Adina Porter) does.  “There is something more dangerous in this world than a humiliated man — a nasty woman,” Ally says, right before Beverly pulls the trigger and kills Kai. From there, Ally wins the election and unveils her membership in the aforementioned cult of SCUM. That idea is one of many intriguing concepts tossed around during Season 7, and “AHS: Cult” did a decent job juggling its many themes centered around women being manipulated, used, and trampled on by men. Its historical references, often weirdly altered to fit the series’ narrative, were a bit rushed and thus ineffectively melodramatic, but Solanas’ rage very nearly fueled the cascade of killings that came after her one-episode appearance. The finale’s closing message may not be as incendiary as intended — whether it’s meant to be daunting or satirical, the latter being the historically accepted intention of Solanas’ manifesto — but “Cult” managed to engage in a topical conversation throughout the season. Often dulled by a convoluted plot and violence that was either too tame or unimaginatively blunt, this is far from the razor’s edge of socio-political commentary. “The cult continues, and we’re all in one or another” is hardly a revolutionary message, but the show still managed to remind us of what’s been happening to women for so, so long. Whether it’s what’s been going on in the real world or the show, a vengeful misandrist takeover feels as justifiable as ever right now. Let them reign. “American Horror Story” has been renewed for Season 8 and Season 9 at FX.  Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news! Sign up for our Email Newsletters here.

Palo Alto When our country was founded, life for many was nasty, brutish and short. Women died in childbirth and many children didn’t reach adulthood. Life expectancy was less than 50. Due to the efforts of scientists, money from governments and foundations and countless individuals, our lives are much improved. But, costs have grown and many people have become rich exploiting these health care developments. Health care may have been a limited concern when our Constitution was written, but it now contributes immensely to our lives and our pursuit of happiness. Most of us will need significant health care interventions at some point in our lives. If the Constitution were written today, the Second Amendment would likely read: “A well regulated Health Care System, being necessary to the well-being of a free State, the right of the people to obtain health care, shall not be infringed.” Robert Downs
Saratoga For years, the middle class in California had no problem voting for tax increases on the top 1 percent on their fellow Californian brethren.  Because these same middle class Californians are actually upper middle class when compared to the rest of the nation, the Senate tax proposal to eliminate state and local property tax deductions has them lobbying our Congressmen to fight these eliminations. What happened to “paying their fair share?”  Does not feel so good when the shoe is on the other foot. Peter Lee
San Jose If the Republican tax plan proposed in the Senate becomes law, my family will have to pay higher taxes.  I would pay without complaining too much if our money went to support programs such as improved health care, K-12 education, scientific research, national parks, infrastructure (not border walls),  and many other programs.  I am appalled that our money would go instead to allowing corporations to pay less taxes and giving the ultra rich significant tax cuts. Those cuts would be permanent. The cuts that would help some members of the middle class would be temporary. The final insult is removing the individual mandate: a move that would lead to fewer people having health insurance and to more expensive insurance. As the deficit would rise, our economy would probably falter.  What a terrible plan. Sarah Krajewski
Mountain View  It seems that there is no place in the Mid-Peninsula for RV residents to stay anymore, and this is a sad state of affairs. These are real people trying to do there best. Let’s show some empathy. Instead of officials simply stating “you can’t stay here, move along,” a more humane policy would be to tell the RV residents where they can stay. The Mercury News reports that many are local blue collar workers, and/or have school age children attending local schools, so it seems mean and selfish for the well-to-do to not allow them to simply live. I can think of several locations that could be potential living sites, that would not involve setting up in front of someone’s house or a busy commercial establishment. I understand that there are probably regulations requiring that running water, toilets and other amenities be provided, but let’s get real rather than hiding behind such expectations: these people are just trying to eek out a living. Lighten up on RV residents. Let’s provide guidance and minimal services, rather than rigid enforcement. Joe Urbassik

One Goh, who was sentenced to life in prison for the killings, is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose delusions led him to believe that the administration and staff at Oikos University were conspiring against him, alienating him from his fellow classmates and covertly having him bugged and followed. Goh told police he went to the Oikos campus in East Oakland that day to confront a specific administrator and, if she didn’t refund him the $6,000 he believed he was due, he was going to kill her and himself. When Goh discovered the administrator wasn’t on campus, he kidnapped university receptionist Katleen Ping, 24, at gunpoint and brought her to the classroom occupied by his former teacher and classmates, where he started shooting. Where: Cal State Fullerton When: July 12, 1976 What: Custodian Edward Charles Allaway used a semi-automatic rifle to kill seven people and injure two others in the school library’s first-floor lobby and at the building’s Instructional Media Center (IMC) in the basement. Fleeing to a nearby hotel where his former wife worked, he called police to say: “I went berserk at Cal State Fullerton, and I committed some terrible act. I’d appreciate it if you people would come down and pick me up. I’m unarmed, and I’m giving myself up to you.” Allaway was later diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and found insane by a judge after being convicted by a jury. He is imprisoned at Patton State Hospital under medical treatment. Where: L.A. Jewish Community Center When: Aug. 10, 1999 What: At around 10:50 a.m., white supremacist Buford O. Furrow, Jr., walked into the lobby of the center in Granada Hills and started shooting with a semi-automatic weapon, firing 70 shots into the crowd. The gunfire wounded five people: three children, a teenage counselor, and an office worker. Shortly thereafter, Furrow murdered a mail carrier, fled the state, and finally surrendered to authorities. Where: Santa Monica When: June 7, 2013 What: John Zawahri, an unemployed 23-year-old, killed five people in an attack that started at his dad’s house and ended at Santa Monica College. Zawahri was fatally shot by police inside the school’s library. Where: 101 California Street, San Francisco When: July 1, 1993 What: Gian Luigi Ferri, a 55-year-old failed entrepreneur, entered an office building on California Street and made his way to the offices of the law firm Pettit & Martin on the 34th floor. Ferri’s reason for targeting the firm remains unknown.  After coming off the elevator, Ferri put on a pair of ear protectors and opened fire with a pair of TEC-9 handguns and a Norinco NP44. After roaming the 34th floor, he moved down one floor through an internal staircase where he kept on shooting. The attack played out on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others were injured. Where: East Oakland When: Dec. 8, 1986 What: David Esco “Moochie” Welch burst into a home and shot six people, including his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend and two toddlers, in their heads as they slept. Two others, including a 3-month-old boy, were wounded in the shooting. Welch was upset over a breakup with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Dellane Mabrey, when he killed her and five of her relatives and friends, then ran and hid in a house on nearby 103rd Avenue with a female accomplice. … Welch (who was 28 at the time of the shooting) wanted the teen back and bitterly resented the girl’s mother, Barbara Mabrey, 37, because she did not want him near her daughter, according to relatives at the time. Welch was sentenced to death for the killings. Where: Santos Linguisa Factory in San Leandro When: June 21, 2000 What: Stuart Alexander, the owner of Santos Linguisa Factory, killed federal inspectors Jean Hillery, 56, of Alameda, Thomas Quadros, 52, of Hayward, and state inspector William Shaline, 57, of Sacramento, inside the Santos Linguisa Factory. Alexander got in a dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which contended that he was not heating his sausages properly. When meat inspectors arrived at his factory to shut him down, he attacked them, armed with three handguns. The slayings were captured on security camera video. Alexander turned himself in to police at the scene. … In 2004, Alexander was found guilty on three counts of murder. He was sentenced to death the next year. On Dec. 27, 2005, he died at age 44 while on death row in San Quentin State Prison.

221,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/15/14-lawsuits-filed-on-behalf-of-vegas-shooting-victims/,"Trending: By Michael Tarm | Associated Press CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Get This Day in History delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries.” The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can’t dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. “I don’t sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,” said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. “I thought it was gunshots.” Seng, who wasn’t physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with dead and injured. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings sat. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock’s bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn’t yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold “the entire supply chain” responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren’t returned. A Wednesday statement from MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting “a meticulously planned, evil … act,” adding it would respond to any allegations only through “the appropriate legal channels.” Live Nation, a concert organizer named, said in a statement it can’t comment on pending litigation, adding the company remains “heartbroken for the victims.” Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Florida. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general’s office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: “Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.” Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can’t fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn’t notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. “They can catch a person counting cards,” she said. “But they can’t catch someone carrying bags of guns.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-11-15 18:52:15,14 lawsuits filed on behalf of Vegas shooting victims,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

        Scaachi Koul Posted on November 28, 2017, at 10:36 a.m. ET Like almost everything Amy Sedaris is involved in, the Greenwich Village studio space where she wrote material for her new truTV show At Home With Amy Sedaris is pleasantly deranged. There’s a side table shaped like a big red mushroom and a “room divider” constructed from green pantyhose hanging from the top of the kitchen window. On the fireplace mantle, which has fake, pink rose bunting draped over it, is a small ashtray filled with knitted cigarette butts. It’s precisely the setting you might expect for a home entertaining show that begins its holiday special episode with Sedaris in an elegant updo and red lipstick — very Suzy Homemaker — and ends with her being attacked by a cursed nutcracker doll named Colonel Nutley. (The nutcracker then goes on to supposedly kill actor Neil Patrick Harris, who is never seen or heard from, in a six-minute scene that ends with Sedaris covered in blood, missing a tooth, and drinking bitterly in her trashed — but still very adorable and twee! — living room.) Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy, 2005. When I arrived to interview her in early November, Sedaris was striding around the studio in red stilettos, a polka-dot skirt, and a white sweater covered in pearls. She offered me a homemade stuffed mushroom before settling into one of the two plush, floral armchairs in the living room. “Good vibes over here,” she said, her head propped up on her little fist while an ambulance siren wailed outside her window. In person (and out of costume) Sedaris is all sparkling green eyes, bouncy blond hair, and intense eye contact, hardly the walking overbite she portrayed in Strangers with Candy. But at 56, Sedaris has made a long, successful (though under-the-radar) career out of playing unhinged lunatics. Maybe you’ve seen her as the über-rich, divorced, and desperate Mimi Kanasis in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, or heard her voice in the animated series BoJack Horseman as the uptight, high-achieving Hollywood agent and anthropomorphic cat Princess Carolyn. She’s appeared as a nightmare apartment broker on Broad City and once did cartwheels in a glittering green onesie on The Colbert Report. Her biggest, weirdest, and, until now, only starring TV role was in Strangers with Candy, a satire of after-school specials that ran on Comedy Central for three seasons (and produced one movie), in which Sedaris played an adult woman who returns to high school after dropping out and becoming a drug addict. The common denominator throughout these disparate roles is Sedaris’s manic energy and her total disregard for reality. At Home With Amy Sedaris, Sedaris's latest project, is an expansion of an oeuvre that mixes discomfort and queasiness with Sedaris’s signature charm and unceasing positivity. The show, which premiered at the end of October on truTV, is a cross between sketch comedy and how-to guide for hosting. Tonally, it’s like if Twin Peaks were on TLC. Each 24-minute episode features three or four segments loosely based around the ideas of hosting, crafting, and cooking. (They also include discussions of death, depression, poverty, and shellfish-based cocktails.) It’s derangement under the guise of wholesome entertainment. A still from At Home With Amy Sedaris. “I like going back to that kind of entertaining rather than trying to talk about prescription drugs or alcoholism or incest. We did that with Strangers,” Sedaris said. “It’s still messed up a little bit, but I wanted that wholesome feel to it. That’s challenging.” It’s also the kind of show that could have only come from Sedaris’s brain, where everything is saturated in candy colors and seemingly unmoored from any particular era or moment in time. This is arguably true of Sedaris as well. She isn’t on Twitter; her studio doesn’t have a phone or a television or a visible laptop; she only recently got a cell phone, or a “cellular,” as she calls it. “I was best man at Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s wedding,” she said. (Theroux, who makes an appearance in one episode of At Home, is a close friend.) “I went to LA and I had to get Uber because I don’t drive, and I was forced to get a phone. I don’t even know my number. Even when the phone rings, I panic.” In a world where politics has now fully dominated the social discourse, and in which so many celebrities have been consistently and personally disappointing, Sedaris’s work offers a surrealist reprieve from all things “topical” and plunges the viewer into a world where, delightfully and briefly, nothing really matters. It’s the kind of comedy that isn’t guided by pop culture or current events. Instead, she creates a space that’s highly detailed and specific, where everything is about organized chaos. If you want to disengage from the world right now, a visit to her universe might be just what you need. Sedaris and brother David Sedaris at his apartment in 1997. Amy Sedaris grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, the fourth of six children: Lisa, David, Gretchen, Amy, Tiffany, and Paul. In interviews, Sedaris seldom opens up about her upbringing or personal life, opting to share minor and often bizarre blips of information instead, such as the fact that her outfits are made by her friend and seamstress Mary Adams, who has nine and a half fingers. Or she veers into fiction, mentioning how upset she is that her imaginary boyfriend Ricky was murdered on their way to the hospital for “a cyst on one of his obliques.” Her online presence is limited to an Instagram account largely populated by retro ads, reposts from other people, and decor suggestions. As a result, most of what we know about Sedaris as a person is from her brother, the writer David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Energetic, goofy, endearing Amy shows up in almost all of his childhood stories. In a 1998 episode of This American Life, David recounted how Amy wore a fat suit home as a response to her father’s insistence that his daughters be thin. “She is by far the most attractive member of my family, yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump,” David remembered. “‘It’s not fair that I can’t grow a beard,’ she’ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wart to the size of her nose … She can’t see any benefit to being herself.” She and David were frequent collaborators, first as children when they played together (Amy told me they hosted a fake cooking show called The Rex and Germalina Show), and later in the ‘90s when they published plays together under the moniker the Talent Family. Those included Stitches, about a disfigured teen who becomes a television star, and Incident at Cobbler’s Knob, about witches and warlocks and a gay beaver. “He’s the best,” Amy said of her brother. “No one works as hard as he does.” David now lives in London, while Amy has been in New York since 1993. Before she came to New York, Sedaris joined Chicago’s Second City in 1992, alongside Paul Dinello (who would later work with her on Strangers and At Home), Stephen Colbert (a Strangers costar), and Chris Farley. “We both went to the training center at Second City. I went to go see her show, and even though it was 12 people, it was essentially a one-woman show,” Dinello told me. “She was just a force in that show. Her character work was already so mature. I couldn’t believe it.” In 1999, she got her big break in Strangers with Candy. The Comedy Central show was developed by Dinello, Colbert, and Mitch Rouse, also a friend of Sedaris’s from Second City. It was inspired by the 1970 documentary short The Trip Back, about a former drug addict and sex worker who tries to warn a group of high school students away from the life she led. Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, a woman who dropped out of school and ran away from home to become “a boozer, a user, and a loser.” After she gets out of prison, she decides to clean up her act and return to the exact place where she left her previous life: high school. Every episode was A Very Special one, but no lessons were ever really learned. Nothing about the show anchored it in the existing universe; no one dressed in a way that indicated what decade it was; no action was ever really followed by consequences. Every episode ended with dancing. Sedaris described the creative process of making Strangers as comfortably isolated. “Nobody was around. We were in the woods making each other laugh,” she told me. In 2015, she told Esquire, “The funny thing is Comedy Central never really got behind it, but that’s what made the show work.” (Never exactly a ratings hit, the show was canceled in 2000.) “You really had to look hard to find it, you know? People felt like they discovered it and I think that’s important. That’s what makes it such a cult show.” Sedaris with Stephen Colbert (left) and Paul Dinello (right) on Strangers with Candy. The same may be true of Sedaris herself. She is a low-profile but influential figure in comedy, an inspiration for writers and actors like Julie Klausner and Billy Eichner who has always been on the periphery of mainstream success. Strangers was canceled in 2000, but in 2005, Dinello, Colbert, and Sedaris wrote and starred in a prequel film, produced in part by Worldwide Pants, David Letterman’s production company. (Sedaris was a beloved guest on Letterman’s Late Night, often appearing with nothing to promote.) The show had always featured some famous guest stars (Winona Ryder, Paul Rudd, Janeane Garofalo), but the movie — with cameos from people like Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Allison Janney — marked a noticeable shift in access to high-profile collaborators. It was the first clear evidence of Sedaris’s industry cache: What other weirdo character actor could get Chris Pratt to spend $3,000 in travel and accommodations just for the chance to play her love interest? On Sedaris’s birthday last year, Sarah Jessica Parker posted nine Instagram photos celebrating her existence. Strangers solidified Sedaris as a voice for unrooted absurdist comedy that doesn’t require context or known pop culture references to work. She is frequently compared to Maria Bamford, whose Netflix show Lady Dynamite is a fictionalized, surreal rendering of Bamford’s return to LA after a mental health breakdown. But the key difference between the two women and their work is that while Bamford takes direct inspiration from her own life, Sedaris is always looking to hide or morph herself into someone else. Even when she’s technically playing herself as Your Host, Amy, it’s still not really about her. Talking to her in her studio, she’s more present and slightly more serious; on TV, she’s talking about how the best gifts are edible and then biting into a vanilla candle as if it’s a carrot. At Home With Amy Sedaris At Home has been a decade in the making, a project Sedaris always wanted to work on. It was inspired by a childhood favorite TV series: At Home With Peggy Mann. “Growing up in North Carolina, this woman here had a local hospitality show,” Sedaris told me, holding a framed photo of Mann in her studio. “She would do cooking and crafting, and she would have local people on to talk about their businesses. It was very boring and I was obsessed with Peggy Mann. I liked the idea of pretending you had a show happening in your home.” She shrugs slightly, saying of her Peggy Mann approach to television, “It’s probably not for everybody. But it’s kind of mindless, isn't it? All the inspiration from it, from growing up, from Galloping Gourmet and Frugal Gourmet and Lawrence Welk and Ernie Kovacs and Julia Child and Two Fat Ladies and Mister Rogers. All of that is what this show is.” You might assume that At Home is just a comedy series masquerading as a show about home decor or cooking; after all, it includes advice on how to hide that you’ve sliced off the tips of your fingers by covering them with empty peanut shells. (Cheap!) But Sedaris insists that it’s more than satire. “All those crafts I do, I’m really trying to do those crafts,” she said. “I’m in the moment and I’m sincere.” Dinello confirmed that Sedaris takes an interest in real-life entertaining. “She’s a really good cook and she’s good at putting interesting people together,” he said. But, almost predictably, there’s a hidden catch. “It’s not a free ticket. A lot of times you’re asked to do something like fix a shelf or get her DVR working or paint a wall.” When we met, Sedaris told me she had someone coming over for dinner that night, actually; she needed some light bulbs changed. Even with all this inspiration, however, Sedaris couldn’t get the show off the ground. Dinello has been working with Sedaris for decades — they’ve been talking about At Home for 15 years at least. Every time they got close to selling the show, Sedaris would pull back. She ended up going to a therapist to get help with two things she was struggling with: First, the 2013 death of her sister Tiffany, and second, why she was stalling on the show. (She also went to a woman who talks to the dead to get closure on her sister’s death. “I think I was so vulnerable and so open to the information that next day, I got shingles,” she said. “First thing I thought was, Ugh, get me a shingles commercial.”) It was only in the last few years that Sedaris felt ready to move forward with the project. “It wasn’t entirely clear what [the show] was at that time, but it was clear that it was a passion project for her — she and Paul had a strong point of view of what they wanted to do,” said Marissa Ronca, executive vice president and head of programming at truTV. The network, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, originally launched as Court TV and specialized in documentaries and legal drama series. Later, it was revamped to focus on reality television, and two years ago pivoted again — to comedy. (A promotional spot from last year features an actor getting crushed to death by the truTV logo.) Sedaris and Paul Dinello in 2005. Ronca says At Home fits in with what the network is trying to do with its comedy slate at large: Provide a platform for creator-driven shows that only a specific writer or actor could pull off, like Billy on the Street or The Chris Gethard Show, which are both very much shaped by the personalities and sensibilities of their creators. It’s clear that no one other than Sedaris (and Dinello) could create something like At Home, which was developed as an offshoot of Sedaris’s very specific and visually stimulating world. Sedaris said visual details are so crucial to her in part because of a former neighbor of hers in Chicago who was deaf. “My whole life changed because the way she saw things was so interesting,” she said. “I used to go home and watch Strangers with Candy with the volume down to see if a deaf person could still laugh at this show.” The set is based off Sedaris's real Manhattan apartment. “I was obsessed with it,” she said of designing the set. “Fringe and tassel and rickrack.” According to truTV, the show has been a success. Since its Oct. 23 premiere, its audience has grown 52% among people aged 18 to 49. Nearly a quarter of those are new viewers to the network. “There’s a lot of people out there doing really timely political comedy right now that I love and I appreciate,” Ronca said. But, she added, “Sometimes at night, you just want to be wildly entertained and watch something that’s clever and funny and isn’t screaming back at you from the TV. What [Sedaris] offers comedically is an oasis from all the other madness going on in the world.” Sedaris and Paul Giamatti in At Home With Amy Sedaris. At Home is apolitical, but not in a way that feels willfully ignorant or withholding — see Jimmy Fallon playfully neglecting to talk to Donald Trump about his racist comments, or Taylor Swift refusing to make a clear statement of who exactly she voted for last year. Instead, the show lets viewers temporarily live in a completely different dimension. “She’s not shepherded by popular culture,” Dinello said. “You’ll seldom see a cell phone or computer on our shows, or specific references to modern or to current events.” But even though At Home transpires mainly within an alternate universe, there are occasional moments that resonate here on Planet Earth. In the first episode of the show, Paul Giamatti plays an important businessman who sexually harasses Sedaris over the course of a nautically themed dinner party. “That was written and shot long before the Weinstein scandal broke, and I had concerns about it and even thought about maybe cutting it,” Dinello said. “I didn’t want us to come across as flip. Amy’s [character] is usually in control, which sort of protects us.” When At Home does descend into the truly dark and disturbing, Sedaris somehow makes it okay to laugh, by cheerfully persevering through uncomfortable scenarios. In “Gift Giving,” Randy Fingerling (Nick Kroll, in an awful long wig and black turtleneck) comes over to help Sedaris bake a cake. While she tries to fill an angel food bundt cake with ice cream, Kroll lights candles, plays romantic music, sits directly behind her (Sedaris reminds Kroll, and us, “I do have a knife,” her eyes flicking back up to the camera), and fingers the cake while moaning. The segment ends when he mutters, “I’m gonna fucking come.” The segment is uncomfortable, a commentary on how unsafe it can feel to be a woman, but it doesn’t feel heavy or anxiety-laden the way a lot of satire often can be. Sedaris is so at ease, so ready to laugh instead of cry, and so happy living in an alternate reality. It’s infectious, this darkness cloaked in cooking segments and crafting suggestions, and a successful integration of a real-world problem into a segment about how to improve an angel food cake. Sedaris and Nick Kroll in At Home With Amy Sedaris. “It’s funny to create a show during this time,” Sedaris said. “So many bad things were happening, and we’re over here trying to write something funny.” Being funny right now (in this economy?!) is hard to pull off: Play too ignorant and you end up seeming glib and unfeeling; play too world-weary and you might come off as a huge drag. Sedaris is one of the few performers who can strike the right balance. Her entire public persona has been rooted in ignoring the whims of the world in a way that feels comforting, rather than condescending and privileged. I watched the first episode of At Home the afternoon the first New York Times story about the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations broke. This was a few days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which was two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, which came on the heels of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, which happened around one of the times that President Trump raised the possibility of nuclear war with North Korea. In a segment called “Crafting Corner,” Sedaris told viewers she was going to make “Potato Ships,” a baked potato with a wooden skewer mast, a cheese slice sail, a construction paper flag, and a mushroom cap as a crow’s nest. She assembled them with fake fingernails taped to her fingers, slathering glue on the stick to adhere the flag and trying to poke the cheese gently enough so it wouldn’t rip. The end result was a crushed potato slathered in sour cream and pierced with a sail made from a crumpled cheese slice, a flap of pink construction paper, and a wet mushroom cap. Covered in glue, it was wholly inedible and didn’t remotely resemble the Potato Ship she had shown at the top of the segment. And on that day, it was also maybe the only thing that helped me stop — just for a few, blissfully confused moments — thinking about the state of the world. ● Scaachi Koul is a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

225,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-reveals-how-trump-creates-his-own-reality,"SEARCH The ‘Last Week Tonight’ host returned after a two-month hiatus to rail against President Trump’s reliance on the alt-right site Breitbart and the conspiracy-theory outlet Infowars. Senior Entertainment Editor Donald Trump, the 45th president of these United States, has a tenuous relationship with the truth. Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking site, calculated that Trump tells the truth approximately 4 percent of the time, while 17 percent of his statements constitute egregious lies. Critics of Trump have labeled his modus operandi “gaslighting”—a form of psychological warfare wherein you manipulate a person into questioning their own sanity. The term comes from the 1944 film Gaslight, starring screen siren Ingrid Bergman as a wife whose husband (Charles Boyer) convinces her that she’s lost her faculties in order to obscure his true motive: Stealing the jewels of her late aunt, whom he murdered years earlier. In Trump’s case, he has a troubling tendency to launch attacks at targets that are actually veiled criticisms of himself. It’s a genius strategy, really: a preemptive strike that not only removes the card from his opponent’s deck, but also accuses them of the very thing that he is guilty of. A few examples: After a photo emerged of Hillary Clinton being escorted up some steps, Trump spent weeks on the campaign trail taking shots at the Democrat’s perceived health woes, even though he himself is said to suffer from bathmophobia, or a crippling fear of steps and slopes. His childish nicknames for his political foes—“Little” Marco Rubio, “Lyin’” Ted Cruz,’ “Crooked” Hillary”—are words that have been used to describe Trump for decades, while his narrative of a corrupt Clinton Foundation more closely resembled his own. Even his continued assault on CNN, which President Trump has labeled “fake news,” appears remarkably disingenuous when you consider that CNN chief Jeff Zucker and Trump are longtime friends (Zucker hired him for The Apprentice, and he reportedly keeps a framed Trump tweet in his office), and the cable news network played a substantial role in helping Trump get elected POTUS—from round-the-clock coverage of his rallies, at times airing just an empty podium, to its army of pro-Trump campaign propagandists, including: Kellyanne Conway, Scottie Nell Hughes, Kayleigh McEnany, Jeffrey Lord, and Corey Lewandowski, who remained on Trump’s payroll for the lion’s share of his CNN tenure. Furthermore, nobody is more reliant on “fake news” than President Trump. On Sunday, John Oliver returned to his perch as the shouty host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight following a two-month hiatus, where he focused much of his attention on four questions pertaining to President Trump: “How did we get a pathological liar in the White House? Where are his lies coming from? Why do so many people believe him? And what can we possibly do about it?” Trump is, of course, widely known to regurgitate talking points that he hears on the right-wing morning-show programs, from Morning Joe to Fox & Friends. For instance, two weeks ago he tweeted: “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Manning, however, never called Obama a “weak leader,” and Trump’s tweet was sent a mere 15 minutes after Fox News aired a critical segment on Manning, calling her an “ungrateful traitor.” More troubling, though, is the president’s dependence on Breitbart, which former honcho Steve Bannon once called “a platform for the alt-right,” and former Breitbart writer Ben Shapiro labeled “Trump’s personal Pravda,” as well as Infowars, a site run by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. “He also takes information in from frighteningly unreliable sources such as Breitbart, the organization which gave us Steve Bannon—now Trump’s chief strategist,” said Oliver. “Bretibart has published such Pulitzer-eligible stories as ‘Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,’ ‘Racist, Pro-Nazi Roots of Planned Parenthood Revealed,’ and ‘Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage.’ You know, the kind of headlines you see your old high-school friends share on Facebook and think, Oh, that’s a shame! I guess Greg sucks now.”“But Trump’s trust in Breitbart actually goes way back,” the satirist continued. “A few years ago, Trump was challenged by Bill O’Reilly, who correctly pointed out that [Trump’s] claim that ‘thousands of Muslims’ were seen celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11 was based on no evidence whatsoever.” Trump, as is his wont, responded to Fox News’s O’Reilly by holding up a printout of a terribly misleading and unsubstantiated Breitbart story that appeared to validate his claims, saying, “Well, I don’t know that I’m wrong, Bill. This just came out from Breitbart—I mean, literally, it just came out: ‘Trump 100% Vindicated.’” This prompted O’Reilly to fire back, “Believe me: If there were thousands, that would have been reported.” “This article says they were swarming all over the place!” exclaimed Trump, waving the piece of paper around. “So, I don’t know what that means, but it means a lot of people!” Oliver was incredulous. “Wait: Holding up a Breitbart article does not make you seem more credible,” he said, before picking up a banana, holding it to his ear, and joking that the “sources” on the other end of the imaginary banana phone line were about as credible as a Breitbart story. Then there’s Infowars, which also attempted to back up Trump’s bogus claim that “thousands of Muslims” were celebrating in New Jersey on after the 9/11 attacks—while providing zero supporting evidence. Infowars’ unhinged host, Alex Jones, has claimed that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing were inside jobs, the Boston Marathon bombing was a “false flag” operation, and that the U.S. government has the ability to control the weather, and are poisoning the water to “turn the friggin’ frogs gay.” One of Jones’s most disgustingly offensive claims is that the Newtown mass shooting, which left 20 young children and six adults dead at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, was “a synthetic, completely fake” and “manufactured” massacre “with actors.” Jones has not only boasted about advising Trump, but even confessed, “It is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.” For example, back in September, Jones claimed to have been the guiding force behind candidate Trump’s baseless claims that the election would be “rigged” against him. Trump also appeared on Infowars during the campaign, telling Jones, “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down, and you’ll be very, very impressed—I hope.” Mark Barden, a Sandy Hook father who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel, in the shooting, told me some months back that he was sickened by Trump’s affiliation with Jones. “The Republican presidential nominee of the United States is being advised by a delusional sociopath. It speaks for itself,” Barden said, adding, “What else can you say about that? It’s disgusting.” Oliver pointed out how problematic this call-and-repeat with dubious news sites is: “This is really dangerous, though, because there is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jibes with his worldview, doesn’t check it, half-remembers it, and then passes it on, at which point it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself.” Jones’s constant claim of election “rigging” prior to the general later mutated into unsubstantiated allegations that “millions” of people voted illegally against Trump in the election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton—a claim voiced by Trump, and parroted by Trump’s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday’ news talk shows. “Trump’s constant claim that ‘millions of people voted illegally’ originated, as far as anyone can tell, from some dude on Twitter who claimed in November—while providing no evidence: ‘We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens,’” said Oliver. “The next day, Infowars picked that up and it spread like jet fuel among right-wing sites. Now, it was quickly debunked by multiple outlets, but despite that, days later, President-elect Trump started tweeting about ‘millions’ of illegal votes, and ‘serious voter fraud’ in places like California. And by early December, people were on TV expressing similar concerns.” The comedian threw to a CNN clip of correspondent Alisyn Camerota interviewing a panel of Trump supporters. “Voting is a privilege in this country, and you need to be legal, not illegal like in California where three million illegals voted,” said Paula Johnson, a Trump supporter. “Where are you getting your information?” asked Camerota. “From the media!” Johnson replied. Cue Oliver, who broke it down as follows: “If you get your news from similar sources to [Trump], as many, many people do, he doesn’t look like a crank—he looks like the first president to ever tell you the ‘real’ truth. But rumors can be really tenacious, and I’ll prove it,” he said. “What rumor do you think of when you hear the name Richard Gere?” asked Oliver, referring to the infamous (fake) rumor that Gere had to have a gerbil removed from his rectum. “Well, here’s the thing: There is no proof that he did that. If you think about it, it’s ridiculous. Have you ever held one of those things? There’s no way it was possible,” he continued. “But, if the president went on TV and told you it was true, you’d go, ‘I knew it! Thank you! I knew it! Finally someone said it!’ But that loop gets much more dangerous when you’re not talking about something as silly as gerbils. Trump validated his supporters’ beliefs about voter fraud, and in turn, they validated his.” He closed the segment with a call to action: “We all need to commit to defending the reality of facts, but it’s going to take work.” That includes making sure stories are properly sourced, questioning stories that merely validate your own worldview, not taking the White House at its word, and, last but not least, avoiding sketchy sites like Breitbart and Infowars.",2017-11-20 06:12:33,John Oliver Reveals How Trump Creates His Own Reality,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

ABC “senior investigative correspondent” Brian Ross greeted Gen. Michael Flynn’s plea deal with Robert Mueller by claiming Flynn is “prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him — directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.” It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes the stock market plunged 350 points. It quickly became clear that it was flat wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what they disingenuously called a “clarification” – actually, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election, which not only isn’t scandalous, it’s completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, they finally found it to be a “serious error” and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay. It’s a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it’s verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America – even the world -- any news that could lead to speculation about Trump’s impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to over-hype anything that could spell “The End.” This suspension might be an adequate punishment….if Ross hasn’t made a long line of whopper mistakes. Conservatives remember the movie-theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado in 2012 and how Ross came on in “breaking news” mode to announce there was a “Jim Holmes” on a list of Colorado Tea Party Patriots…as if that was a perfect starting point to find mass shooters. It wasn’t. But there are more. -- In 2001, Ross claimed the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by Saddam Hussein’s henchmen in Iraq. Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers “I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway -- and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.” -- In the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported Saddam’s cousin Ali Hassan Al Majid (or “Chemical Ali”) had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced they had him in custody. -- In 2006, Ross claimed Pakistani officials had arrested Matiur Rehman, an al-Qaeda explosives expert who kept an “official” list of terrorist recruits, and could lead to Osama bin Laden. Pakistanis denounced the report as ‘fictitious.” ABC consultant Alexis Debat had warned ABC it was not true a day after the report had initially been broadcast. -- Also in 2006, Ross breathlessly relayed that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was under FBI investigation for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. “Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation.” This prompted the Justice Department to deny there was any federal probe of Hastert, who demanded a retraction and threatened to sue ABC. None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who’s been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody Awards and six George Polk investigative reporting awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors. It’s a little bizarre these days that sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hour-long nightly show on MSNBC and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against “fake news” look like fact-mangling isn’t really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired.

228,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/support-for-universal-background-checks-for-gun-purchases-hits-all-time-high/,"A collection of hand guns on display at the NOVA Armory, a gun shop in Arlington, Virginia. Rex Features/AP A new Quinniapac University opinion poll shows that support for universal background checks has reached an all-time high. The study, released Wednesday, found that 95 percent of American voters favor uniform background checks for gun purchases, including 94 percent of those who live in households with guns, marking the highest levels of support since the university started asking the question in 2013. The poll was conducted from November 7 to 13, just a few days after the Sutherland church massacre in Texas and a little more than a month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which the shooter used a “bump stock” modification that enabled his semi-automatic rifles to fire as if they were fully automatic machine guns. “With each American gun massacre, there is stronger voter support for tighter gun control measures,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement Wednesday. The poll also found broad support for other gun control measures. Ninety-one percent of voters support banning the sale of guns to people who have been convicted of a violent crime, 62 percent favor stricter regulation of ammunition sales, and 74 percent support banning modifications that can make semi-automatic firearms function more like a fully automatic weapon. On the whole, 59 percent of voters say that it is currently too easy to buy a gun in the United States. “You rarely if ever see near-unanimity like this,” Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, wrote on Twitter. “Broad support for other gun reforms too.

231,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/VvSVUScnWFY/ct-met-northern-california-shooting-huppke-20171115-story.html,"I’m not going to bring up gun control. We’re still under the “too soon” rule from last week’s massacre during Sunday service at a Texas church, so it’s certainly too soon to talk about guns in connection to Tuesday’s shooting spree. Maybe you didn’t hear about that one — such things tend to come and go with little fanfare these days. It happened in Northern California. A man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns started randomly shooting people all over a small town, including at an elementary school. Five people were killed and at least two children were wounded, one of them at the school. There’s no motive yet, just reports of a neighborhood dispute. Phil Johnston, assistant sheriff of Tehama County, told reporters: “This is an individual that armed himself with the motive of getting even with his neighbor and just went on a rampage. I don’t know how to describe it to you any different.” Maybe that’s because these tragedies all start to sound the same: some random guy; an inexplicable outburst of violence; lives shattered. Remember, I’m keeping quiet about the firearms. One has to be respectful. Instead, I’m going to talk about mental health. The wise folks, the ones who tell us guns aren’t the problem when it comes to a Texan shooting 26 people to death in a church or a Nevadan opening fire from a hotel window in Las Vegas and killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, say mass shootings are a mental health issue. Period. I’m inclined to agree with that, except for the “period” part. There’s more than that to blame, but it involves something I’m not talking about right now because it’s too soon. So let’s just say mental health is a factor when it comes to murderous rampages. Law enforcement officials say the Northern California shooter tried to get into the elementary school to shoot more kids but was stopped because the school was on lockdown. Nobody’s going to convince me a person capable of such a thing is sane. So we have a mental health problem in this country. We’re reminded of that after every mass shooting. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle extend their thoughts and prayers, those who line their pockets with cash from the National Rifle Association say guns aren’t the problem and everyone brings up mental health and says it must be addressed. But it doesn’t get addressed, at least not in any significant way. Nothing changes with that other thing — the one that it’s too soon to speak about — either, but since there seems to be agreement on the mental health issue, let me ask this: Why no action? It feels like we’re being played. A New York Times story from September 2013, in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, read: “Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.” Yeah, that didn’t really go anywhere. Republicans worried it might be a back door to tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and Democrats worried Republicans might use it as an excuse to not pass tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and everyone just gave up and started waiting for the next mass shooting to roll around. Tragedy. Outrage. Too soon. Mental health reform. Nothing. Repeat. It has been only a month and a half since the Las Vegas massacre, which was followed by the Texas church shooting and now this shooting spree in California. That’s 89 people dead and hundreds injured. If we’re going to declare mental health the real problem behind these shootings, it seems fair to say America is facing a mental health crisis. What has happened this year, as bodies continue to hit the ground at concerts and in churches and elementary schools, is this: Republican lawmakers tried to repeal Obamacare, proposing a phaseout of the law’s Medicaid expansion that provides mental health care for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The law also makes employer health care plans cover mental health services on the same level as medical services. Obamacare repeal failed, but now Republicans are trying to push through a tax cut package that would sabotage the health care law by eliminating the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office says would cause millions of Americans to lose their health care. I thought mental health was the big problem. I thought that was the thing we were supposed to be talking about in the wake of a tragedy like the one Tuesday in California. After the Texas church shooting, President Donald Trump said: “I think that mental health is your problem here. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation.” It’s good it’s not a guns situation, because we’re not allowed to talk about those things. We can only talk about mental health. What I don’t understand, then, is why the people talking about mental health in the wake of a mass shooting never seem to do anything to make our mental health care system better. I almost think they’re trying to distract us, hoping thoughts and prayers will be good enough. But people keep dying. And those thoughts and prayers aren’t solving anything. rhuppke@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-11-15 10:00:00,"After latest shooting, let's talk about mental health instead of you-know-what",,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/
232,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/trump-tweets-about-sutherland-springs-shooting-on-night-of-rancho-tehama-shooting-so-thats-dark-5476942," Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, President Donald Trump gave his condolences to the wrong mass shooting. On the evening of Nov. 14, Trump tweeted about the Sutherland Springs shooting instead of the Rancho Tehama shooting, which happened that day. Early Tuesday morning, a shooter killed four people and wounded at least two children outside an elementary school in Rancho Tehama Reserve in Northern California. Trump seemed to have mixed up the two recent mass shootings, with both tweets appearing to be ""copy and pasted."" Maybe his two-week long Asia trip has him all turned around, but either way, it did not go unnoticed by the public. The tweet that is under fire reads, ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & Law Enforcement has arrived,"" which Trump tweeted on Nov. 14. However, on Nov. 5, Trump wrote an almost identical tweet saying, ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The shooting, which seems to be a bit overshadowed by Trump's tweet, is still under investigation for motive. However, the shooter was reportedly killed by authorities after leaving the school and going on a random shooting spree around Rancho Tehama Reserve. The Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston of Rancho Tehema Reserve said, according to KCRA, ""This is a very tragic event for all of us. There are children involved, it is an emotional thing.â Brown issued a statement saying, ""Anne and I are saddened to hear about today's violence in Tehama County, which shockingly involved schoolchildren. We offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones and unite with all Californians in grief."" One of the most important parts of being president is to address and console a grieving nation in times of distress, and Trump's little misstep is not helping his already-criticized lack of empathy in response to events such as Hurricane Harvey. Trump was criticized for focusing on crowd size and how catastrophic the storm before consoling and comforting people. In this instance, it was not a problem of empathy, but an actual mix-up of facts. While this is comical to some, other people on Twitter are using this as an opportunity to bring up the conversation of the deeper root of mass shootings, something that some users feel Trump has not adequately addressed. Regardless of if Trump or his staffers are directly to blame for the tweet, it still looks equally as bad for the administration and their awareness of domestic issues happening on the home front. While the tweet has since been deleted, you can always count on Twitter to (literally) have its finger on the pulse for Trump's every move and misstep.",2017-11-15 11:20:48,"Trump Tweets About Sutherland Springs Shooting On Night Of Rancho Tehama Shooting, So That's Dark",,70102,http://elitedaily.com/#spider
233,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/offtopic/~3/MzE8SpThjKo/ct-republicans-gun-background-checks-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — Rare bipartisan consensus around legislation to improve the national background check system for gun purchases is in jeopardy after House Republicans linked the measure to a bill allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines. The House is expected to vote and pass the combination bill Wednesday over the objections of House Democrats, who accused Republicans of ""trickery"" and ""sabotage"" in tying the background-checks bill to a concealed-carry measure that the National Rifle Association called its ""highest legislative priority."" In the Senate, Democrats have labeled the concealed-carry legislation a nonstarter, while key Senate Republicans cautioned that pairing the bills is a recipe for the demise of both. ""When you put them together it makes it harder for us to do what we can do, and can do now,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a co-author of the background checks legislation. ""I want to separate those two out, get the Fix NICS bill passed and hopefully save some lives."" The background-checks legislation, which forces federal agencies and incentivizes states to better report offenses that prohibit individuals from buying firearms, is the first gun bill in years to secure the support of Democrats, Republicans, gun-control advocates and the NRA. Bill authors credit its narrow focus - shoring up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS - for keeping together an otherwise unwieldy coalition of support. They caution against upsetting the balance by loading up the bill with other measures. ""When we were negotiating in a very bipartisan, good-faith way, the understanding was the NICS-fix bill would be considered on its own,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., an original co-sponsor of the bill. ""Combining them would be completely unwise and unacceptable, and everyone knows it."" But supporters of the House GOP effort say that the concealed-carry legislation is a logical complement to the background checks bill. ""Taken together, these two bills preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. ""I believe that both bills complement each other in keeping people safe."" Lawmakers began drafting legislation last month to improve reporting to the background check system after it emerged that the shooter in a deadly attack on a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, could have been prevented from buying guns if the military had reported a domestic violence charge to the NICS database. The background- checks effort has been more successful than a Democratic-led push to respond to the October mass shooting in Las Vegas with a ban on ""bump stocks"" - an add-on device that turns a semiautomatic weapon into an illegal, automatic one. The bump-stocks matter is largely on hold in Congress, as GOP lawmakers, under NRA pressure, defer to a new Justice Department effort launched Tuesday to ""clarify whether certain bump stock devices fall within that definition"" of ""machine gun,"" a prohibited category of firearm. The Senate Judiciary Committee is nonetheless expected to discuss bump stocks at a hearing Wednesday that is also slated as the official start to the Senate's debate about improving NICS reporting. Gun-control advocates urging along the Senate process are excoriating House Republicans for what they see as complicating the debate. ""Instead of doing what's right, Congress is attempting to do what the gun lobby wants them to do, which is to pass this concealed-carry reciprocity law,"" said Mark Kelly, who co-founded the gun-control group Giffords with his wife, former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who left the House after becoming a victim of gun violence in her home state of Arizona. Kelly said that he and Giffords are ""both offended and outraged that Republicans are trying to tie this bad piece of legislation to something that's trying to do something positive."" Giffords and the liberal-leaning litigation and policy organization Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit Monday against the Justice Department, alleging that the agency has failed to turn over documents showing how the gun lobby is attempting to influence federal firearms policy, including by pushing concealed-carry reciprocity after the Las Vegas shooting. The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit. Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the decision about how to package these bills has always been up to lawmakers. ""We support both bills, and if they get combined we'll support the combined bill - and if they're not combined we'll support both bills separately,"" Keane said. ""They're both good bills and they both should pass, and Americans should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right."" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker applauded the House for being ""on the eve of voting for the biggest expansion of self-defense rights in modern American history."" But some Democrats in the Senate are shrugging off the House's maneuver as an empty threat - both because of Cornyn's resistance and because by their count, only a handful of Senate Democrats might possibly vote for concealed-carry legislation. It would take the support of eight Democrats, in addition to every Senate Republican, to clear the 60-vote procedural hurdles a gun bill would face. ""I don't think it changes anybody's vote,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a lead author of the background-checks bill. ""I don't think the votes are there in the Senate to pass concealed carry.""

The cause of the incidents differed. Authorities immediately concluded the attack in New York City was terrorism, while the motives of the Las Vegas shooter are still unknown. The death toll in Las Vegas was also significantly higher. But both of these incidents, which came so close to each other, sparked discussions about policy, the first about gun control and the second about terrorism and immigration, since the suspect was identified as an immigrant from Uzbekistan. President Trump and the White House reacted very differently to both of these incidents, however, declining to weigh in on policy after Las Vegas, and then immediately doing so following the New York City attack. The following is an overview of these separate reactions in the 24 hours after each incident unfolded. Las Vegas: Trump tweeted approximately five hours after the overnight attack: “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!” The White House also told reporters that Trump had been briefed on the attack and the Administration was monitoring the situation closely and offered support to Las Vegas officials and keeping those affected “in our thoughts and prayers.” New York: The White House told reporters Kelly had briefed Trump and that thoughts and prayers are with those affected. Four hours after the attack, the White House sent out an official statement from the President offering support to law enforcement in their investigation and thanking the first responders. But during this time frame, Trump also sends out a series of tweets, in which he called the suspect “a very sick and deranged person,” railed against ISIS being allowed to enter the United States and offered condolences to the victims. At approximately 9:30 p.m., Trump tweeted for a fourth time: “I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!” Las Vegas: President Trump addressed the nation from the White House the morning after the mass shooting. In a brief speech, he thanked First Responders, called for national unity and directed flags to fly at half-staff in honor of the victims. “Our unity cannot be shattered by evil. Our bonds cannot be broken by violence,” Trump told Americans. “And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today and always will – forever.” The White House planned a moment of silence for the victims, and Trump subsequently said during his meeting with Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha that he would visit Las Vegas. The White House also said Trump had spoken with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. New York: Trump linked the attack to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, arguing that he was the driving force behind the diversity lottery program, which the Department of Homeland Security said was the program under which the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the United States in 2010. (While Schumer did support the measure creating this program nearly 30 years ago, he also sought to end it in recent years as part of a bipartisan immigration reform.) Trump tweeted two more times, apparently citing the Fox News morning show “Fox and Friends,” and describing how he wants to replace the lottery system with merit based immigration. “We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter),” he wrote on Twitter. Trump then gave remarks before a Cabinet meeting, where he reiterated these sentiments after offering condolences to the victims of the attacks. “We’re going to as quickly as possible get rid of chain migration and go to a merit-based system,” Trump says. “We have to get much tougher. We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct.” Trump also says he would consider sending the suspect to Guantanamo Bay. Las Vegas: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders choked up during the White House briefing when she recalled stories from Las Vegas. At that point, several Democratic lawmakers had begun issuing calls for more stringent gun control regulations. When asked about the White House’s position on this issue, Sanders said it was not the time to discuss policy and that any suggestions are premature.  “Today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost,” she tells reporters. There’s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country.” New York: As she did with Las Vegas, Sanders opened her daily briefing by offering thoughts and prayers for the victims, highlighting the resilience of New Yorkers and praising the heroic actions of Ryan Nash, the police officer who shot the suspect. But she also quickly dove into policy implications, arguing that this incident showcases the need to heighten security measures for people seeking to enter the United States. “We must vet those seeking entry to the United States thoroughly,” she said. The first question for Sanders was about the discrepancy between the White House’s reluctance to discuss policy after Las Vegas, when gun control was on the table, and its willingness to discuss it after New York City, when immigration is the issue at hand. Sanders denied any change. “This wasn’t about going the political route,” she said. “This is something that, frankly, the President has been talking about for a long time. This isn’t a new policy, this isn’t a new position, this isn’t a new conversation. The President has been talking about extreme vetting and the need for that, for the purpose of protecting this country since he was a candidate.” She also disputed that Trump had blamed Schumer. “The President has not blamed Senator Schumer and doesn’t believe he is responsible for the attack,” she said.

The welcome mat for refugees trying to reach Europe. El Universal, Aug. 13, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico There are no speech balloons or furrowed brows. In fact, you can barely make out the facial expressions of anyone in his cartoons. It’s their action (or lack of it) that he wants you to ponder. “For all the topics I like to draw, for me the most important thing is to be honest,"" says Boligán. ""All my cartoons come from my heart and my soul. I want them to be authentic.” Boligán doesn’t need to worry about authenticity. When you see a Boligán cartoon, you know it’s a Boligán cartoon.  The Barcelona terrorist van attack on Las Ramblas, the city's most famous pedestrian street. El Universal, Aug. 19, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán says his style is a fusion of different influences. ""When you're young and you're starting out as a cartoonist, you want to have your own style. But it's almost impossible. Along the way, though, as you grow and meet other cartoonists around the world, without thinking about it, you start to absorb and capture their styles and influences. And then one day, people start to talk about your style.” Boligán grew up in Cuba but has lived in Mexico since 1992. His tools of the trade are ink on cardboard. These days he gets his color from Photoshop but occasionally he still uses watercolor and pencil. Boligán cites Americans Saul Steinberg and David Levine as important influences on his work, but his singular surreal and wordless approach has a lot to do with the artistic trends and cold, hard politics of his homeland: Cuba.  President Trump at work. El Universal, Sept. 30, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán literally grew up amid cartoons and satire. His hometown of San Antonio de los Baños, outside of Havana, is known as Cuba’s humor capital. “In 1917, my hometown held the first exhibition about cartoons and about drawing ever in Cuba.” Over the years San Antonio de los Baños has become a center for visual arts. It hosts Cuba's Museum of Humor, the first of its kind in Latin America, and since 1979 has hosted a biennial Festival of Humor. Cuba also has a long tradition of cartoons and satire. ""Cartoons are considered art, not just as drawing. It’s part of the arts in Cuba,"" says Boligán. ""It's one of the reasons that me and my colleagues don't see ourselves as journalists. We see ourselves as artists, graphic artists. We give something more to journalism. It’s complementary, drawing as an art, and journalism.”  Never again. Drawn after the Las Vegas slaughter by a gunman, the worst mass shooting in modern American history. El Universal, Oct. 8, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán soaked up all that his hometown had to offer. And by the time he entered art school in Havana in the mid-1980s, Cuba was smack in the middle of what some have dubbed a Cuban renaissance, a 20-year period of experimentation among artists now considered a movement, the New Cuban Art. Rachel Weiss has written a book on the New Cuban Art, and says the artists on the vanguard during this period were literal products of the Cuban Revolution. They were all born around 1959. ""These were not counter-revolutionaries. These were not people who wanted Fidel [Castro] to go away. They considered themselves to be authentically revolutionary and they saw themselves as artists, an important part of that process."" Some of them were satirists, cartoonists, and multimedia artists who worked for a revolution-approved Cuban humor magazine called Dedeté, a play on the banned pesticide, DDT, that had been used in the US. And they pushed satire into areas it hadn't gone before by creating art that reflected Cuban reality instead of the Cuban dream. Their work touched on issues like scarcities, corruption and nepotism, and they dared to question whether the US embargo was really to blame for everything.  Politicians deceive us over and over again. El Universal, May 6, 2017 Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico ""It's inherently Cuban to talk back to power,"" Weiss says. “It’s important to understand that in the Cuban context, humor is not considered to be a lower form of expression. It’s a really important cultural form.”  Courtesy of Angel Boligán ""I think that maybe we wanted to remove the headaches of the head with humor,"" he says. And raising questions about the world is Boligán in a nutshell. In that way, his approach is different from most political cartoonists, who typically focus on the news of the day. ""I think style comes not just in the way you draw, but also in the topics you choose, and the metaphors you use. I always try to make my cartoons universal assuming that the whole world will see them.""  Selfie with an extraterrestrial. El Universal, Mexico. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán was in his early 20s and just getting his career going when Cuba’s economy collapsed after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Energy supplies dried up and some of the publications that Boligán worked for stopped printing. A lot of Cubans were growing their own food. During the early 1990s, many Cubans, including many artists, left the island. What’s interesting about Boligán, however, is that he wasn’t looking to leave. It was almost an accident that he did.  Metaphorical influences are already at play in this cartoon by Angel Boligán, drawn in 1991. He left Cuba for Mexico in 1992. Angel Boligán ""I traveled to Mexico in 1992. I was invited to take part in an exhibition at the Museum of Cartoon Art in Mexico. I never intended to stay and live in Mexico. But on the same day that I arrived in Mexico, I got an offer from El Universal — one of Mexico's biggest daily newspapers, and it was where, in my opinion, the best Mexican cartoonists work."" Boligán took the job and the move to Mexico changed everything for him. He went from publishing one cartoon a month in Cuba to having a whole range of outlets for his work in Mexico, including a major daily newspaper. He also found himself part of a larger cartoonist community and started exploring new ideas like love, consumerism and our obsession with technology.  Love and the generations. El Universal, Mexico. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico ""In Mexico, I did find the space and the freedom to tackle subjects that were a lot harder to talk about in Cuba,"" including a no-go zone for anyone in Cuba: Fidel Castro. In 1998, when John Paul II became the first pope to visit communist Cuba, Boligán, now in Mexico, did what he knew his cartoonist colleagues back home couldn’t. He drew about it. His cartoon showed Castro cleaning out the cobwebs of churches in advance of the pope’s visit. ""My friends in Cuba could draw about it but their cartoons wouldn’t be published. I’m not a religious person but I respect those who are,"" he says.  Drawn during Pope Benedict's visit to Cuba in 2012. He was the second pope to visit communist Cuba. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico These days Boligán is in high demand. Besides his day job with El Universal in Mexico, he exhibits his work internationally and has won countless awards. And he feels slightly uncomfortable that his being based in Mexico and having more freedom to distribute his work means he gets more attention than his cartoonist friends back in Cuba.  Angel Boligán, center, flanked by two fellow cartoonist friends from Cuba: Osmani Simanca, left, who now lives in Brazil and Ares, right, who lives in Havana.

238,http://www.chron.com/news/article/Survivors-of-1991-Texas-restaurant-massacre-still-12347624.php,"Feb. 20, 2016Richland Township apartmentsKalamazoo County, Mich.Killed: 6Injured: 2Shooter: Jason Dalton, 45 PICTURED: Uyesugi was a high school sharpshooter DALLAS (AP) — Close your eyes, she says. Now, tell me. Where are the exits? The Dallas Morning News reports this is a drill Suzanna Hupp has done with her two sons. She realizes it may seem paranoid, sitting in a restaurant thinking about things like that. But her sons, both grown now, get it. Bad things happen. Evil exists. Better to be prepared. Hupp knows. In 1991, she was eating lunch in a Luby's cafeteria when a gunman drove a blue Ford pickup through the restaurant's front window, got out and started shooting. He killed 23 people, including Hupp's mother and father, before finally shooting himself. In its time, the massacre in Killeen, Texas, was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Now it ranks sixth, just behind Sunday's murder of more than two dozen people at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church outside of San Antonio. What happened inside Luby's is never far from the minds of Hupp and other survivors. And with each mass shooting that follows, they relive their own experiences. ""It brings everything back,"" said 71-year-old Kelley Fitzwater, who saw two women shot in the head that day. She can hardly watch the news this week. ""I watch maybe five or ten minutes, and then I just have to change the channel,"" Fitzwater said. ""Because it brings all those feelings back. It brings back all of the very bad memories for the families that lost loved ones, as well as the survivors."" She and her husband were in the Luby's serving line when George Hennard, 35, of Belton, smashed his truck through the restaurant's façade. When he started shooting, Fitzwater's husband told her to get on the floor. ""Is he here to rob us?"" she recalls asking. ""No,"" she says her husband replied. ""He's here to kill us."" Fitzwater and her husband managed to escape. She and other survivors say talking about what they went through was a key to dealing with it. ""We had group sessions that we went to, where the survivors and those that had lost loved ones, we all came together,"" Fitzwater said. ""Really I found for myself, right after this happened, that the more I talked about it, the better off I was."" Fitzwater said it took her about a year to decide she could move on. ""It was very hard to do,"" she said. ""At first you deal with guilt, as to why you were a survivor and they weren't."" You never forget, she said. ""But you learn to move on. Or it would just drive you crazy."" Hupp, 58, agrees. ""You've got a couple of different ways to handle stuff like this,"" she said. ""You can go crazy, or you believe that things happen for a reason. Believe me, I'm going to be one of the first in line when I die with a list of questions for God."" Those questions boil down to: why do you let terrible things happen? Hupp says she worked through her grief with help from a supportive family. She also wrote a book about her experience, and she became a state legislator who advocated the right to carry concealed weapons. (Just before the Luby's massacre, Hupp had left her own gun in the car.) ""That gave me some outlet for anger, anger both at myself and at the legislature, that I felt had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family,"" she said. Hupp says people have asked her if it isn't a bit paranoid to still be checking restaurant exits after all these years. She asks them if they have smoke alarms at home. ""Sometimes houses do burn down, and we know that a smoke alarm can give you a little early warning that might mean the difference between life and death,"" she says. Bobbie Crawford, now 85, was eating with a friend inside Luby's that day. A teacher's aide, she knew several other school district employees who'd come for lunch. Several of them were shot to death. Crawford says her own mental recovery was long and difficult. Like Hupp and Fitzwater, she said talking about how she felt — especially at the group counseling sessions — was essential. ""It really helped to be able to talk to people that understood, and to get it out,"" she said. It was months before she could go into a restaurant again. Then she was eating at a Red Lobster, and a busboy accidently dropped the handle of a carpet sweeper. The sound of it hitting the floor rang out. ""I came unglued,"" Crawford said. ""I just screamed out, it frightened me so bad."" Twenty-six years later, loud noises still get to her. Even thunderstorms. And like Hupp, Fitzwater and others, Crawford said she doesn't sit in a restaurant without checking her surroundings and noticing who's coming in the front door. ""I don't sit by a front window,"" she said. ""And I know where the exits are."" ___ This story has been corrected to show more than two dozen people killed in Sutherland Springs, not more than dozen ___ Information from: The Dallas Morning News, http://www.dallasnews.com This is an AP Member Exchange shared by The Dallas Morning News",2017-11-10 11:41:36,Survivors of 1991 Texas restaurant massacre still face grief,murders and attempted murders,10,http://www.chron.com/

240,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/hxCsgHChGn4/ct-las-vegas-shooting-lawsuits-20171115-story.html,"CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both ""physical and mental injuries."" The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can't dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. ""I don't sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,"" said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Ill., just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. ""I thought it was gunshots."" Seng, who wasn't physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday's filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock's bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn't yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold ""the entire supply chain"" responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren't returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting ""a meticulously planned, evil ... act"" in a statement Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through ""the appropriate legal channels."" Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains ""heartbroken for the victims."" Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Fla. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general's office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: ""Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy."" Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can't fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn't notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. ""They can catch a person counting cards,"" she said. ""But they can't catch someone carrying bags of guns.""

          / CBS/AP PLANO, Texas -- Meredith Hight had gathered friends at her suburban Dallas home for a day of grilling and watching football when her estranged husband showed up and opened fire, killing her and seven others before a police officer killed him. Plano police have said that an officer responding to calls about shots fired Sunday evening saw bodies in the backyard and heard shots. The officer went inside, confronted 32-year-old Spencer Hight and fatally shot him. Police say he shot nine people in the home and that seven died there. One of the two wounded victims died at a hospital. Among those killed was 31-year-old Rion Morgan, who was a groomsman in the couple's wedding, The Dallas Morning News reported . Also killed were Anthony ""Tony"" Cross, 33; Olivia Deffner, 24; James Dunlop, 29; Darryl Hawkins, 22; Myah Bass, 28; and Caleb Edwards, 25. Meredith Hight, who was 27, filed for divorce in July after six years of marriage. The divorce hadn't been finalized yet. Her mother, Debbie Lane, said her daughter's gathering on Sunday was the first party she was hosting on her own. Records show the couple got married in Collin County in September 2011. They exchanged ceremonial vows during a Caribbean cruise the following year. Lane said Spencer Hight started out as a loving husband to her daughter, but she and her husband noticed something was off with their son-in-law. When they visited the couple, he would retreat to his room and his computer. She said they later learned he had a drinking problem. Spencer Hight lost his job doing contract work for Texas Instruments around the time that he and her daughter bought the Plano house in 2015, Lane said. She said her daughter, who worked for Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages in Fort Worth, was shouldering the mortgage by herself. Lane said it wasn't until Meredith filed for divorce that she told her parents that Spencer had been violent at least twice, including a time last fall when he slammed her face against a wall. But she said her daughter hadn't reported the incidents to police. ‪Lane told CBS DFW that her daughter did not take the decision to file for divorce lightly. ""After two years of trying to get him in treatment, trying to get him to stop, trying to help him… she said, enough is enough. She made every effort she could… and could leave that relationship with no regrets."" When Meredith filed for the divorce, she didn't request a restraining order against Spencer. She wasn't afraid of him, her mother said. Spencer Hight's father, Chester Hight, told the newspaper Wednesday that that the family is living a ""nightmare."" He said his son called to tell him that he and Meredith were splitting, but he couldn't speculate about their relationship. ""They didn't confide in me, let's put it that way,"" he said. ""And Meredith, I really liked Meredith, for what it's worth,"" he said. ""We all had a very good relationship with Meredith."" Chester Hight said his family is grieving over the deaths of the others who were killed at the party. ""I'm so sorry. We knew some of those kids,"" he said. On good days, the elder Hight said, Spencer was creative and clever. But he said his son also struggled with drinking. First published on September 14, 2017 / 6:41 AM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

242,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/horoscopes/~3/PpBt759sBZY/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money. A photo on social media at the time showed his son in a Cadillac with a bottle of French champagne, according to an MLive.com article. The story's headline: ""The fabulous online life of John Conyers III, or why his family needs to do damage control immediately."" He's an opinionated writer. In a HuffPost op-ed, under the headline ""Orange Watergate: The Inevitable Impeachment of the 45th President,"" Conyers wrote that the ""reactionary and cavalier nature of the president will ultimately be his down fall. ""As his approval ratings tumble and confidence wanes, expect the weight of possible impeachment to make his already poor decision making worse. Self-preservation is ultimately the downfall of the narcissist."" In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Conyers wrote that the national debate should be about gun control, not mental illness, explaining: ""I have dealt with Major Depressive Disorder since I was 15 years-old. I've not once thought about murder. I know right from wrong. ""My friends with bi-polar and depression and multiple personality disorder don't think about hurting others, if anything we think about hurting ourselves."" ""So if you grapple with mental illness do not let the medias stigmatization of our ailments make you self-conscious,"" he wrote in his October op-ed. ""As much as they love to make us their scapegoats, It's not our fault. You, as well as I, know we know right from wrong. When they need someone to blame they look to us first, when it's time to lend their hand to help us they're nowhere to be found."" He's a rapper. In a 2013 song, ""Rich Glorious,"" Conyers talked about his battles with the media amid his mother's 2012 bribery conviction, as well as the Cadillac mishap, according to Roll Call. ""Hey f - making a living, boy, I'm trying to make history. So picture me letting the news nitpick at me,"" Conyers said in the rap video, which showed an image from a news story about the incident. He's up against his cousin for the congressional seat State Sen. Ian Conyers, John Conyers Jr.'s great-nephew, told the New York Times that he intends to run as well in the special election.

Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show, Aldean, who was on stage when a gunman opened fire on the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, said that he initially thought a speaker had blown when he heard a sound like a crackling over his in-ear monitors. After the shooting continued, he looked over to the side of the stage to figure out what was going on. ""When I turned to look, my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, like 'Let's go,'"" Aldean said. ""And my security guy was running on stage telling me to run."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino. SWAT teams with explosives then stormed his room and found he had killed himself. ""Everyone was scrambling, just didn't know what was going on,"" Aldean said. ""It was panic. That's probably the best way to describe it."" The country star cancelled some of his tour dates, but resumed touring about two weeks after the shooting. ""Honestly being back on stage probably helped us more than anything,"" he said. Aldean did not address gun control in the interview. ""At the end of the day, we're all in this together,"" Aldean said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time like working on the issue that is really the problem."" Aldean was joined in the interview by fellow country stars Dierks Bentley and Lady Antbellum, who were all gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday to raise money for hurricane and Las Vegas victims. The Country Rising concert, which also featured performances by George Strait and Chris Stapleton, raised more than $4 million for relief efforts. ""I just hope everybody can start to heal,"" Aldean said. ""Some of this stuff you can never get over. I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.

Back row -left to right, John Holcombe and Crystal Holcombe. Five members of the Holcombe family were killed Sunday in the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church shooting that killed at least 26 people.

Victims' deaths in the Sutherland Springs church shooting have left the town — and the world outside it — reeling. Here are numerous tributes left on GoFundMe pages and around social media to remember those lost in Texas' deadliest mass shooting.  Crystal Holcombe, wife of injured John Holcombe, was killed with three of her five children from an earlier marriage: Emily, Megan and Greg. Her unborn child also did not survive. Crystal was a ""loving mother and wonderful-hearted woman,"" her first father-in-law John Hill said. Bryan Holcombe, who filled in for Pastor Frank Pomeroy, died with his wife Karla.

He and his wife Karla had been married for more than two decades. The Air Force failed numerous times to take steps that would have prevented Sutherland Springs shooter Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the firearm he used to kill 26 people and wound 20 others, according to a claim filed by the Holcombe family, which lost 9 members in the massacre. The claim, filed against the U.S. government Tuesday specifically in the death of Bryan Holcombe, could be the first step to an eventual lawsuit if the Air Force denies responsibility. The family is seeking monetary damages but said they are also hoping to prevent the type of error that allowed Kelley to purchase the tools he needed to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. READ MORE: Air Force admits it failed to send Sutherland Springs gunman's records to feds ""Although the shooter undoubtedly 'pulled the trigger' that resulted in the injuries and death of JB Holcombe and others, failures of the US Air Force, and others, allowed the shooter to purchase, own and/or possess the semiautomatic rifle, ammunition and body armor he used, and it is these failures that were a proximate cause, in whole or in part, of the injuries and death of the decedent,"" reads the claim. Remembering Nov. 5 Joe “Papa Joe” Holcombe joined Houston-based attorney Rob Ammons in downtown San Antonio Tuesday afternoon to discuss his claim and tell the story of his nine family members who lost their lives on Nov. 5. He said he returned home from teaching Sunday School at the First Baptist Church in Floresville to do what he and his wife always did those days — each lunch and watch church services streamed from San Antonio. The 86-year-old said he noticed his pastor walking up to the house and thought, ""What in the world is he doing here?"" It was about an hour after the shooting and the pastor arrived to deliver the terrible news. ""I said, 'How about my family?'"" Holcombe recalled. ""'Bryan?'"" He's gone, the pastor said. John? He was wounded. Karla? She's gone. ""How many are gone?"" Holcombe finally asked. And then the pastor named them all. ""That's what hit me the hardest,"" Holcombe said.  RELATED: Handwritten lawsuit on behalf of Devin Kelley's family appears to be work of Ohio inmate The family's patriarch lost his son Bryan, daughter-in-law Karla, grandson Marc, granddaughter-in-law Crystal, and great-grandchildren Noah, Emily, Gregory, Megan and an unborn child who was to be named Carlin Brite ""Billy Bob"" Holcombe. Kelley's history The Air Force found through an internal investigation that it failed to report Kelley's 2012 conviction for spousal and child abuse to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. If the agency had followed through on its reporting requirement, that conviction would have followed him and prevented him from purchasing firearms. Instead, he bought four in Colorado and Texas between 2014 and 2017, including the rifle used in Sutherland Springs. Because of his abuse convictions, Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. The claim also cites threats Kelley made against his superior officers and his attempts to smuggle guns onto base, which landed him in a mental health facility in New Mexico. He escaped that facility and was later apprehended by law enforcement. Ammons said Kelley's case and the Air Force's error is not uncommon, citing a February 2015 Air Force which report found 30 percent of servicemen convicted of crimes were not reported to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. RELATED: Apple served with search warrant in Sutherland Springs shooting “By failing to report, the Air Force is basically shredding gigantic holes in the safety net that is there to protect all of us in society,” Ammons said. “It’s time that this ends and it’s time that this problem is corrected.” The Air Force admits failures Coincidentally, the Air Force on Tuesday released the results of a review into Kelley's case it launched immediately after the shooting. They found similar reporting lapses at other locations. In a statement the Air Force also said it was implementing a number of corrective measures to ensure reporting compliance. Air Force officials have not yet responded to Holcombe's claim. Holcombe, a devout Christian, said he believes his lost loved ones are in a better place. And someday soon, he’ll get to join them.  “They’re just in a much better place now because it’s never going to happen to ‘em again,” he said.

249,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-lawsuit/hundreds-of-las-vegas-shooting-victims-file-lawsuits-in-california-court-idUSKBN1DK2OX,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Tina Bellon 3 Min Read (Reuters) - Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted and the killer’s estate. The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who were either injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc, the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp, which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock’s activities, train staff members and employ adequate security measures. The festival goers also alleged Live Nation was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed on Monday was brought by college student Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter’s estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock’s estate is set for Dec. 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting, but not in any of the suits filed on Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. “We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun rights case,” he said.

250,http://theconversation.com/most-mass-killers-are-men-who-have-also-attacked-family-87230,"Senior Lecturer, University Without Walls, University of Massachusetts Amherst Lisa Aronson Fontes does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  University of Massachusetts Amherst provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list What do most mass killers have in common? As a researcher who studies coercive control in intimate relationships, I can point out a few key characteristics. First, they are men. Additionally, they have a history of controlling and abusing their wives and girlfriends – and sometimes other family members – before “graduating” to mass killings. Considering a few recent examples makes the pattern clearer. Devin P. Kelley, 26, who shot to death 26 people and injured 20 more at a Texas church on Nov. 5, had kicked, beaten and choked his first wife and infant stepson, fracturing the baby’s skull. In the following years, he was investigated for other charges of violence against women including sexual assault and rape. Since 1996, those convicted of domestic violence – even misdemeanor offenses – are supposed to be entered into the National Criminal Information Database and permanently barred from legally purchasing guns. However, Air Force officials neglected to register Kelley’s conviction, leaving him free to walk into a sporting goods store and purchase the rifle used to murder Texas churchgoers. A congressional report determined such registration failures happen at least 30 percent of the time. Esteban Santiago, charged with killing five travelers in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in January 2017, was previously accused of assaulting and strangling his girlfriend. Spencer Hight shot and killed his estranged wife and seven of her friends who had gathered to watch football on TV in Plano, Texas. These family-based mass shootings rarely gain the same kind of publicity as those conducted in public, perhaps because the average person mistakenly thinks they can avoid being victimized if the shooting occurs “in the family.” From Jan. 1 to Nov. 5, 2017, the U.S. experienced 307 mass shootings, which the government defines as a shooting that kills or injures four or more people. However, not all domestic violence perpetrators who become mass killers use guns. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing along with his younger brother, had been arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who plowed a truck through a crowd in Nice, France in 2016, killing 82, and Khalid Masood, who killed five and injured 50 driving through a crowd in Westminster, London, both controlled and abused the women in their lives. An obvious question arises. If domestic violence laws were more effective, could perpetrators be caught earlier? Could they be deprived of their access to weapons, jailed when necessary and given the kinds of intensive intervention and supervision that would curb their behavior? In other words, could stronger domestic violence laws prevent some mass shootings? The laws in the U.S. that are currently used to address domestic violence were developed for attacks by unrelated people. They don’t work so well for what happens in families. A bar fight is over when the violence ends, but abusive violence in couples does not end. In as many as 40 percent of cases, the abuser assaults his partner several times a week and sometimes daily, often over many years. Most domestic violence incidents involve pushes, slaps, kicks, pulling hair and the like. If police wait for broken bones, they miss more than 95 percent of domestic violence incidents. As Evan Stark of Rutgers University points out, the seriousness of partner violence derives from the cumulative weight of all previous abuse, rather than the severity of a particular assault. U.S. law does not adequately address these “minor” violent incidents, nor the constant intimidation, harassment, monitoring and the limiting of a partner’s freedom that is so typical of violent control in couples. In 2015, England and Wales made controlling a current or former partner a serious crime. This new offense recognizes the harm that can result from an ongoing pattern of controlling behavior. A relative of Westminster car attacker Masood’s ex-wife is quoted in The Guardian describing their relationship: “He was very violent towards her, controlling in every aspect of her life – what she wore, where she went, everything.” Masood’s behavior is an example of coercive control. Coercive control combines tactics designed to instill fear, like violence and threats, with tactics that isolate a partner, degrade her and deprive her of basic rights. Eighty percent of abused women are being coercively controlled and not simply hit. In the U.K., police and prosecutors have undergone intensive training related to the criminalization of coercive control. Police have learned to use an incident of reported domestic violence as a window through which to examine the entire relationship. One of the earliest convictions for coercive control concerns a 30-year-old named Nigel Wolitter, who was arrested for vandalizing machinery belonging to his partner’s family to punish her for refusing to give him money for marijuana. As a result of their new training, police traced Wolitter’s vandalism to a 13-year pattern of dominating his girlfriend. The prosecution linked photos of injuries from his partner’s cellphone with her compelling testimony that he had “controlled every aspect of my life from where I went to what I wore, to what possessions he allowed me to own.” Wolitter received a 
4.5-year sentence. It’s the pattern of enforced subordination that is the problem here, not one or two incidents. Changing the domestic violence laws to include coercive control will draw attention to serious cases of controlling behavior and obligate law enforcement to examine them more closely. According to the American nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of 50 women in the U.S. are shot to death each month by a current or former intimate partner. While most domestic abusers will not become mass murderers, early, consistent and effective domestic violence intervention might keep us all safer. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

The Las Vegas strip shooting was the worst such incident in United States history.  Here's the top 11 worst shooting incidents in recent Amercian history.
58 people have died at a country music festival when an assailant opened fire from a hotel room overlooking the venue. 
More than 530 people were injured in the attack and the ensuing chaos.

Las Vegas police reported that a single gunman opened fire on concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Country Music 
Festival from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

The gunman was identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada. They said he acted alone. Investigators said they 
found 47 firearms in three locations, including Paddock's room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and his home.

Only last year, a similar such incident occurred at a night club in 
Orlando, Florida, 
where 49 people lost their lives in a mass shooting. The Las Vegas strip shooting was the worst such incident in United States history.

252,http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/11/12/brett-talley-has-never-tried-case-but-trump-wants-make-him-judge-for-life/SK0z2oHZU3rbBQGiq6RwZO/story.html,"WASHINGTON —Brett Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer whom President Trump nominated for a lifetime federal judgeship, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case. Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views. ‘‘Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet,’’ says a tweet from his account, which has since been made private. ‘‘A Call to Arms: It’s Time to Join the National Rifle Association’’ was the title of a blog post he wrote in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, killed 27 people before taking his own life. Advertisement Talley, who also writes horror novels on the side, moved a step closer to becoming a federal district judge in his home state of Alabama on Thursday. Voting along party lines, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley’s nomination, which now goes to the Senate for a full vote. Talley is the latest federal judicial nominee to draw scrutiny for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown on social media, on his political blog, and on several opinion pieces he had written for CNN. He has also received a ‘‘not qualified’’ rating from the American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees. The vote on Talley’s nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists, some of whom are young, on the federal bench. As he stood next to McConnell during a news conference in October, Trump said the judicial nominations are the ‘‘untold’’ success stories of his presidency. ‘‘Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out,’’ Trump said. ‘‘So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary.’’ Advertisement In a statement defending Talley’s nomination, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he does not believe ‘‘extensive trial experience’’ is the only factor in deciding on a nominee’s qualifications. ‘‘Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,’’ Grassley said. Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years at a federal district court and another two at the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, from 2013 to 2015. In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January. Talley’s lack of experience in the courtroom and his partisan commentaries, however, were repeatedly questioned by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. ‘‘Your overall qualifications and preparation for becoming a lifetime-appointed federal judge are a concern to me,’’ Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said, according to her written questions to Talley. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, did not mince words, asking questions like: ‘‘How can you claim to be qualified for a lifetime appointment to supervise federal trials on a daily basis when you have never yourself tried a single case?’’ and ‘‘Do you think it is advisable to put people with literally no trial experience on the federal district court bench?’’ Advertisement In response, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit appeals court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. Talley said it would be ‘‘inappropriate’’ for him to comment on the decision to recommend him for the federal bench — a decision made by two US senators from Alabama, Richard C. Shelby and Luther Strange. ‘‘Federal judges come to the bench from a variety of legal backgrounds, each with something to learn and something to contribute,’’ Talley wrote. ‘‘I have worked in all three branches of the federal government, in state government, and in private practice.’’ In his previous job in Alabama, he said, he was ‘‘one of the highest-ranking lawyers in the state, handling the most sensitive and most important legal matters Alabama faced.’’ Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, also spent a good portion of her 14-page questionnaire asking Talley about partisan statements he’d made in the past, including tweets such as: ‘‘The press cares when you lie to the American people. Unless you are @HillaryClinton #LochteGate’’ Advertisement ‘‘The worst part of #NeverTrump is that they are helping Hillary win the election. Their self-righteousness while doing it is a close second.’’ Talley had written political commentaries for CNN, including a 2016 article in which he said Clinton ‘‘has committed acts that would have resulted in the prosecution of ordinary citizens.’’ In the blog post in which he called on his readers to join the NRA, he criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, ‘‘have exploited’’ the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. ‘‘These politicians either do not know or do not care that an armed, responsible citizenry is the last and greatest bulwark against tyranny that a nation can have,’’ Talley wrote in his blog, Government in Exile. ‘‘They certainly do not care about our right to bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution and reaffirmed by recent Supreme Court rulings.’’ Talley said the post was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion. He also said that he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues ‘‘will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case.’’ ‘‘Rather, I would be duty-bound to apply relevant Supreme Court and circuit precedent to the facts before me,’’ he wrote. Talley is one of five judicial nominees whom the Judiciary Committee approved Thursday. Advertisement The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights questioned his ability to be fair, particularly in presiding over cases with political overtones. ‘‘Brett Talley is entirely unqualified for a federal judgeship because he lacks the breadth and depth of experience necessary for the job, and he has demonstrated ideologically extreme views that call into question his temperament and judgment,’’ Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. In a Nov. 7 letter to Grassley and Feinstein, the American Bar Association did not raise questions about Talley’s temperament but said his lack of trial experience was a concern. Carrie Severino, counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, criticized the American Bar Association, saying the group is not a nonpartisan organization. ‘‘The ABA is a liberal interest group. They have a long history of giving lower ratings to Republican nominees,’’ she told the Los Angeles Times. The bar association gave a ‘‘not qualified’’ rating to four Trump judicial picks. Two, Talley and Leonard Grasz, an Omaha lawyer nominated to fill a vacancy on the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, were unanimously deemed to be unqualified. Two others, Charles Goodwin and Holly Teeter, nominees for federal district judgeship in Oklahoma and Kansas, respectively, were rated as ‘‘not qualified’’ in a split decision. Previously, the association, which has been vetting judicial candidates since 1989, unanimously rated only two other judicial candidates as unqualified, both of whom were nominated by then-President George W. Bush. Another Trump judicial nominee, Jeff Mateer, attracted controversy over earlier speeches in which he said transgender children are proof that ‘‘Satan’s plan is working,’’ described same-sex marriage as a harbinger for ‘‘disgusting’’ practices such as polygamy and bestiality, and advocated for conversion therapy. He also had previously admitted discriminating based on sexual orientation.

By 11/14/2017 10:00 AM EST Presented by Ericsson With help from Steven Overly, John Hendel and Margaret Harding McGill TODAY: SESSIONS IN THE HOT SEAT — Attorney General Jeff Sessions faces a new grilling before the
House Judiciary Committee today, and here’s what we’re tracking. Expect questions from Democrats on the independence of the Justice Department, amid questions over whether DOJ’s antitrust division asked AT&T and Time Warner to offload CNN as a condition of their $85 billion merger. (CNN, of course, is a frequent target of President Donald Trump, who calls the network “fake news.”) Encryption may also come up. Remember, the FBI is having problems cracking the iPhone used by the gunman in the recent mass shooting in Texas. FEDERAL IT BILL ON THE MOVE — The Modernizing Government Technology Act (
H.R. 2227 (115)), a bill that would authorize a funding boost for federal IT upgrades, is getting a vote today as part of the House’s National Defense Authorization Act (
H.R. 2810 (115)). The tech measure, from Rep.
Will Hurd (R-Texas), would establish a revolving fund for federal agencies to improve their IT systems, and allow agencies to use the savings they generate through modernization for further upgrades. The bill was also included in the Senate’s version of the NDAA, which passed in September. NEW SOCIAL MEDIA HEARING — The Senate Commerce Committee is eyeing a hearing on social media and extremist content that could take place on Dec. 6, according to a committee aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are not yet finalized. The panel has not formally invited tech companies yet, the aide added. Facebook, Google and Twitter sent their general counsels to a series of Capitol Hill hearings on Russian election meddling a couple weeks ago. NOTES FROM SAN FRANCISCO — Day one of the Internet Association’s Virtuous Circle Summit produced a steady stream of news about the Trump administration’s promised
infrastructure plan and its tenuous
relationship with the tech industry, as well as one media mogul’s
prediction for the AT&T-Time Warner merger. Here are a few more nuggets from Steven’s notebook: —
Barry Diller had the analogy of the day: The Expedia and InterActiveCorp chairman
 said big media mergers like the pending marriage of AT&T and Time Warner are “irrelevant” because media companies must now compete, from a weakened position, with internet powerhouses like Amazon, Google and Netflix. “They, like everyone else, are going to be serfs on the land of the large tech companies,"" Diller said. He wasn’t done there. “Historically, serfs can do OK. They can eat and have a roof over their heads,"" he said. But, they can also revolt. ""As I’ve said to the leaders of Google, you should treat your serfs well because historically speaking, if you don’t really treat them well, they will then kind of attack you in vicious ways.” —
The U.S. CTO is still MIA: Michael Kratsios, the Trump administration’s deputy chief technology officer, dodged a question about when the federal government will have a full CTO. “We’re very excited to hopefully have someone on soon,” he said. Kratsios added that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy counts about 45 employees — the same number that
POLITICO reported back in April — but that the “sweet spot” is likely between 60 and 70 employees. Under Obama, OSTP counted as many as 120 on its payroll. Kratsios said the smaller office, however, doesn’t mean the administration devalues technology issues. “We’re all out there trying to do more with less across all of our agencies,” he said. —
The net neutrality divide is alive and well: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told the crowd that most Americans support net neutrality principles and that existing FCC rules guarantee that internet service providers will treat all web content equally. Later in the day, Cox Communications President Pat Esser, like his peers in the telecom industry, expressed support for the FCC’s plan to roll back the Open Internet rules — and said Cox plans to invest more in broadband infrastructure if it does. Diller, for his part, said the debate no longer matters, arguing the principles of the internet are already sacrosanct and it’s unlikely anyone would mess with them. —
Esser’s take on CNN’s fate in the AT&T-Time Warner review: “I don’t buy into the belief that this is all the president steering the Department of Justice,” the Cox president said. “I think there are legitimate things that need to be worked out there.” That includes concerns about the exclusive content that could be distributed through DirecTV if parent company AT&T comes to own TBS, TNT, Warner Bros. and many other Time Warner media properties, he said. — Tomorrow’s agenda brings another run of tech industry speakers: The lineup includes Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, Quicken Loans CEO Dan Gilbert, Goldman Sachs Co-Head of Internet Investment Banking Kim-Thu Posnett, Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta and SV Angel founder and investor Ron Conway.

— Rep.
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Small Business Committee, is siding with a group of credit unions that
pressed the FCC in September to clarify its robocalling rules. “While there may be more than one way to address the concerns raised by credit unions, it is important that the FCC provide further clarity, guidance, or some form of exemption,” Chabot wrote to fellow lawmakers asking for support for a letter he plans to send to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. “Otherwise, an increasing number of credit unions will continue to be impeded from sending important financial information to their members because of both the lack of clarity in how to comply and out of fear of excessively costly litigation, due to the uncertainty.” He gives a deadline of Nov. 16 to sign onto his letter. CTIA CALLS DIBS ON DRONE NETWORK — The wireless industry trade group called on the Federal Aviation Administration to endorse commercial wireless networks — like those operated by AT&T and Verizon — for drone communications. Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, said the wireless industry offers “the best, most widely available and safest platform for future drone communications.” The trade group released a
white paper on the topic Monday, noting that the FAA is expected to open a rulemaking process next year to look at which spectrum platform drones should use.

Jackie Speier (D-CA) testifies before the House Administration Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill November 14, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Speier says she was grabbed and kissed years ago as a Capitol Hill aide. And shes urging staffers to share their stories of sexual harassment on a new hashtag, #MeTooCongress. She has posted a video on Twitter and YouTube describing the incident and asking others to share their stories. Speier says, Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  Jackie Speier was a 23-year-old congressional staffer excited about her new job on Capitol Hill when her chief of staff got her alone in a room. The 50-year-old grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat. Now, four and a half decades later, the Peninsula congresswoman is leading the charge in Congress to clean up what she calls a culture of sexual harassment in the Capitol. Since she went public with her story in late October, she’s been thrust into the national spotlight, introduced legislation to streamline harassment reporting procedures, testified at hearings on the topic and shed light on the big settlements paid out with taxpayers’ money to silence harassment complaints. “I’m embarrassed to say it, but I think Congress has been an enabler of sexual harassers for a long time,” Speier, a Democrat who represents San Mateo County, said in an interview this week. Speier has worked on sexual harassment policies for decades, beginning in California’s state Capitol. But when she was accosted in 1973, there weren’t any official channels to report what had happened — and even the term “sexual harassment” hadn’t entered the vernacular. “There was nowhere I could go,” she said. As wave after wave of sexual harassment revelations hit Hollywood and the media this fall, Speier shared her story in a YouTube video. She looked directly into the camera, urging other congressional staffers to come forward with their experiences with harassment and blasting the “breeding ground for a hostile work environment” that she says Congress has become. Speier is now the lead sponsor of a bill that would reform the Office of Compliance, the obscure congressional office that investigates — and, activists say, often covers up — sexual harassment. Victims of harassment in Congress who want to report their experiences have to go through a byzantine process, submitting to mandatory counseling, signing a nondisclosure agreement and waiting months before an investigation into their claims even begins. And interns and fellows still have no official channels to report sexual harassment. Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. Sign Up From 1997 to 2016, the office paid out $15 million to settle sexual harassment complaints and other discrimination cases, without any real transparency or accounting of the claims. The office “was really created to protect the harassers,” Speier said. Her legislation would shake that up, prohibiting nondisclosure agreements as a requirement to start an investigation, speeding the process and including interns and fellows. It would also require members of Congress reimburse the federal Treasury for any sexual harassment settlements paid out because of their actions going forward. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has received bipartisan support. While Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, hasn’t publicly commented on the effort to reform the office, he has supported another Speier bill to mandate sexual harassment training for members of Congress and their staff. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat who is co-sponsoring the reform bill, said she had never known about Speier’s experience with harassment as a young staffer, even though the two were both working on Capitol Hill at the time. She praised her Bay Area colleague for speaking up. “It empowered people, and she just opened a floodgate,” Lofgren said. “I think we probably will have momentum on her bill.” As a California state assemblywoman and senator from 1986 to 2006, Speier wrote legislation mandating sexual harassment training. She said the recent allegations of sexual harassment in Sacramento — where almost 150 women recently wrote a letter decrying a culture of harassment — were disturbing. “I’m dismayed that (the training) didn’t have the effect we wanted,” she said. “It does seem like it’s an Animal House up there right now — it’s disgusting.” She urged California’s legislative leaders to take swift action. “It starts at the top,” she said. “To the extent that the leadership tolerates it, the conduct exists.” Since being elected to Congress in 2008, Speier has worked on issues like sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. In 2014, she tried to pass an amendment to the legislative budget mandating sexual harassment prevention training, but the chairman of the rules committee didn’t allow the measure to be debated. She also tried to add in more funding in the legislative budget for the compliance office to do more outreach, only to have that money removed in later revisions. “There was no willingness to look at this issue at all,” she said, unlike in recent weeks. “To see the change this dramatic is reassuring that if you take full advantage of timing, you can accomplish a lot.” But Speier said that she knows that national attention can be fickle, and thinks that she and other advocates may have a limited window to pass reforms while the focus is on sexual harassment. She pointed to the long-running debate over gun control, noting how congressional resolve to pass more firearm regulations gains steam after a mass shooting, only to dissolve within weeks or even days. “This has captured the interest of every American,” she said of the harassment issue. “I do think that we are in a defining moment culturally — which, at my age, I’m just reassured is happening.” That moment definitely hadn’t happened 44 years ago when Speier was forcibly kissed by her chief of staff, Joe Holsinger, who died in 2004. The two worked in the office of Rep. Leo Ryan, whose old district Speier now represents. Speier was shocked when Holsinger grabbed and kissed her, not understanding how he could think it was acceptable. “I recoiled, and I made sure I was never alone with him in a room ever again,” she said. Going public in the YouTube video wasn’t the first time that Speier used her own experiences as powerful arguments in policy debates. She made headlines in 2011 when she gave an impromptu speech on the House floor about having an abortion in the early 1990s after doctors told her she was losing a baby that she desperately wanted. In 1988, Speier became the first California legislator to give birth while in office. And she’s also known for surviving five gunshot wounds in November 1978 while investigating the People’s Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, with Congressman Ryan, who was killed in the attack. Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University, said that Speier’s decision to share her experience of harassment was a smart way to prod Congress to act. “Lawmakers make better policy when they have a variety of experiences,” Levinson said. “It’s vitally important that this isn’t just something where we get outside testimony of how sexual harassment can affect people, but it’s someone on the inside who can say, ‘Let me talk to you about my personal experience.”’ Since she released the video, Speier said she’s talked in person to four House staffers who have experienced harassment or assault, and on the phone to “many others.” Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles newscaster, said she decided to publicly accuse Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, of harassing and groping her after interviewing Speier and hearing her story. Tweeden wrote in an article that she came forward because she wanted to have the same effect on other victims of harassment “that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me.” Speier has said she knows of two current members of Congress, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, who have been accused of sexual harassment. Neither of those is Franken or Rep. John Conyers, who was also the subject of public allegations this week, Speier said. And she’s not naming names. “Women and men who are inspired by public service come to Congress,” she said, “and we have to create an environment that’s not hostile.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-11-22 16:17:23,How Jackie Speier used her own experience to shine the spotlight on sexual harassment,"politics and government,law and legislation,crime and criminals,sex crimes,sexual harassment",35,http://www.mercurynews.com/
257,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-ballot-questions-20171117-story.html,"Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s City Council allies are trying to get three questions on Chicago ballots in the March primary election in an annual bid to prevent questions with potentially embarrassing results for the mayor from making it before voters. Ald. Pat O’Connor, the mayor’s council floor leader, hopes to ask voters if they support a comprehensive strategy to address opioid and heroin deaths, including more state money for addiction treatment. Ald. Margaret Laurino, who runs council meetings when the mayor leaves the dais, has submitted a question asking whether Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner should support legislation to amend the state insurance code to preserve various health care benefits for people who signed up for the Affordable Care Act. And Ald. Ariel Reboyras, who Emanuel tapped to chair the key Public Safety Committee, wants to know whether Chicagoans support state legislation to ban firearm bump stocks of the kind used in the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and if they would like stronger penalties for illegal gun traffickers. All three aldermen said Friday that they introduced the questions because they believe it’s worthwhile to take city voters’ pulse on the topics. “I just thought it was the right time to find out where people stand on this,” said Reboyras, 30th. RELATED: Who's running for Chicago mayor in 2019? Possible candidates emerge as Emanuel seeks term 3 Under state law, no more than three advisory questions can appear on the ballot each election. So if the City Council votes to include the recently proposed questions, it would effectively block anyone else from getting one on there. Such questions carry no legislative weight, but City Hall over the years generally has tried to avoid referendum topics that could show strong citywide support for positions the mayor opposes. In summer 2016, the council’s Progressive Caucus pushed a question for the fall ballot asking whether Emanuel should be stripped of his control of the city's two major airports in favor of an independent authority. The council instead opted to include questions about gun trafficking, school funding and city services for people who don’t have IDs. Aldermen previously have tried unsuccessfully to get on the citywide ballot a question about whether the Chicago Board of Education should be elected instead of selected by the mayor. RELATED: Weighing third term, Emanuel relies on campaign donors who get City Hall benefits O’Connor, 40th, said there was no intent to block other referendums from the ballot, and that the three proposals were put forward in a timely fashion by senior council members because they understand the process and have issues they want to address. “There is nothing that I’m aware of that (the mayor) is looking to not have on the ballot,” he said. And Laurino, 39th, pointed out “anybody has the option to introduce one if they wanted to, and I didn’t see anybody else doing that.” The three questions will head to the council Rules Committee, and the full City Council could vote next month to include them on the March 20 ballot that includes primary contests for governor and attorney general, and various other state and Cook County races. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com hdardick@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-11-17 21:52:58,Emanuel allies trying to fill March ballot with advisory questions,"politics and government,law and legislation,finances,elections,medicine and health,drug abuse and traffic,gun control",9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

Putin dispatched Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to Washington for a July 17 meeting with Under Secretary Tom Shannon, the No. 3 official at the State Department. … [T]hree U.S. administration officials, including one inside the meeting, said Ryabkov handed over a document containing a bold proposal: A sweeping noninterference agreement between Moscow and Washington that would prohibit both governments from meddling in the other’s domestic politics. “After examining the proposal, which has not previously been reported, U.S. officials told Moscow there would be no deal. ‘We said “thank you very much but now is not the time for this,”’ said a senior State Department official. … The decision to walk away from the offer could prove fateful. Signs of Russian meddling in foreign elections continue to flourish ... The US official described the Russian proposal in historic terms, likening it to the 1933 accord between President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov that ended 16 years of American nonrecognition of the Soviet Union in exchange for a pledge not to interfere in US politics.” http://bzfd.it/2B13LzX BOMBSHELLS -- AP’s JULIET LINDERMAN: “Ex-aide: Rep.

Franks, in his statement announcing his resignation, said he and his wife, who have struggled with infertility, have twins who were carried through surrogacy. “The former aide said the conversations took place in private, sometimes in the congressman’s car, and that she repeatedly told him she wasn’t interested. She said she never filed a formal complaint because until recently she didn’t know where to go, but that his behavior had made her feel uncomfortable. “The Associated Press verified the identity of the staffer and confirmed that she worked in Franks’ office. She asked that her name be withheld out of concern for her privacy. ‘During my time there, I was asked a few times to look over a ‘contract’ to carry his child, and if I would conceive his child, I would be given $5 million,’ she said, adding that she refused to look over the contract and has never seen a copy.” http://bit.ly/2BPnLlB -- FRANKS IS WORTH between $11.1 million and $55.25 million with most of his money in Trinity Petroleum stock, according to his most recent financial disclosure. -- RACHAEL BADE and JAKE SHERMAN: “Female aides fretted Franks wanted to have sex to impregnate them”: “Arizona Rep.

SCARBOROUGH COUNTRY -- TRUMP GOES TO PENSACOLA AND GOES ALL IN FOR MOORE -- “Trump says country ‘can’t afford’ to let Roy Moore lose,” by Alex Isenstadt in Pensacola, Florida and Henry C. Jackson: “It took him a while, but President Donald Trump eventually used a Friday-night rally to forcefully endorse Roy Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican running for the Senate. Trump framed the election of Moore — who has been accused of numerous episodes of inappropriate sexual behavior, including child molestation — as vital to the country’s interest, imploring Alabamians to ‘get out and vote for Roy Moore.’ ‘Do it,’ he added. ‘Do it.’ ... “As the race draws to a close, the White House is considering taking other steps to boost Moore, including flooding the state with robocalls, text messages and emails. While the president’s popularity has ebbed elsewhere, he remains overwhelmingly popular in conservative Alabama. The administration has reviewed polling that shows Moore with a narrow but steady lead — and is confident that he will win.” http://politi.co/2kO21DK THE HOUSE GUYS who traveled with Trump: Rep.

TRUMP’S SATURDAY -- Trump is headed to Jackson, Mississippi, to visit the Civil Rights Museum which he will get a tour of and also give remarks.

It arrived at Air Force One at 9:09 in a Florida deluge whipped by wind. The tarmac covered in water. Pool is soaked. … The president is scheduled to be wheels up at 11:55, while the outdoor phase of the ceremony [at the Civil Rights Museum] is underway.” IN CALIFORNIA -- “Firefighters had to step aside as winds powered infernos,” by AP’s Julie Watson and Krysta Fauria in Fallbrook, California: “Firefighters in Southern California were on high alert for dangerous fire potential even before the first blazes broke out. But once flames met ferocious winds, fire crews were mostly powerless to stop infernos that destroyed more than 500 buildings, killed dozens of horses and forced hundreds of thousands of people to run from six out-of-control fires that have burned over 260 square miles since Monday. ... “Firefighters gained ground Friday, and some of the earliest evacuees who fled from flames Monday were being allowed to return home. Yet new fires were popping up, and danger persisted. Vegetation is bone dry, there’s been hardly any rainfall and winds were expected to gusts up to 40 mph Saturday and up to 50 mph Sunday in the Los Angeles and Ventura areas, the National Weather Service said.” http://bit.ly/2iJK2df GREAT LEDE -- “Trump calls Romney ‘a great man,’ but works to undermine him and block Senate run,” by WaPo’s Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey: “Before Ronna Romney McDaniel took over as Republican National Committee chairwoman earlier this year, President Trump had a request: Would she be willing to stop using her middle name publicly? Trump followed up by saying in a lighthearted way that McDaniel, the niece of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, could do what she wanted, according to two people familiar with the comments. But the change was soon plain for all to see. Though she had used her maiden name for years in Michigan, where her grandfather George W. Romney had been governor, McDaniel dropped ‘Romney’ from most official party communications and has rarely used it since.”  http://wapo.st/2kGzU9d NYT SCOOP -- “F.B.I. Warned Hope Hicks About Emails From Russian Operatives,” by Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo: “F.B.I. officials warned one of President Trump’s top advisers, Hope Hicks, earlier this year about repeated attempts by Russian operatives to make contact with her during the presidential transition, according to people familiar with the events. The Russian outreach efforts show that, even after American intelligence agencies publicly accused Moscow of trying to influence the outcome of last year’s presidential election, Russian operatives were undaunted in their efforts to establish contacts with Mr. Trump’s advisers. There is no evidence that Ms. Hicks did anything improper. According to former officials, American intelligence and law enforcement agencies became alarmed by introductory emails that Ms. Hicks received from Russian government addresses in the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election. “After he took office, senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agents met with Ms. Hicks in the White House Situation Room at least twice, gave her the names of the Russians who had contacted her, and said that they were not who they claimed to be. The F.B.I. was concerned that the emails to Ms. Hicks may have been part of a Russian intelligence operation, and they urged Ms. Hicks to be cautious.” http://nyti.ms/2AoIf8G -- “Trump’s Allies Urge Harder Line as Mueller Probe Heats Up,” by WSJ’sPeter Nicholas, Aruna Viswanatha and Erica Orden: “Republicans ... point to Andrew Weissmann — a Mueller deputy who had applauded the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the initial White House travel ban on people from majority Muslim nations—as evidence of bias on the special counsel team. ‘I am so proud,’ Mr. Weissmann wrote in the subject line of an email, which was released by the conservative group Judicial Watch. Mr. Weissmann also attended Hillary Clinton’s election-night party at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York, according to people familiar with his attendance. At the time, Mr. Weissmann was running the Justice Department’s fraud section, which is a senior career post within the agency.”  http://on.wsj.com/2keZQoJ ""HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON"" -- “Democratic senators delay K.T. McFarland ambassador nomination,” by Cristiano Lima: “Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on Friday placed a hold on K.T. McFarland’s nomination to become U.S. ambassador to Singapore, urging congressional leaders to re-examine her ‘knowledge and involvement’ in contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. “In a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the two members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced their intent to delay the nomination process until McFarland ‘publicly clarifies’ potential discrepancies in her statements regarding communications between Michael Flynn, her former superior at the National Security Council, and a Russian diplomat.” http://politi.co/2A8syyf THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT FILES -- “Taxpayers Paid $220K to Settle Case Involving Rep. Alcee Hastings,” by Roll Call’s Stephanie Akin: “The Treasury Department paid $220,000 in a previously undisclosed agreement to settle a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment that involved Florida Democrat Alcee L. Hastings, according to documents obtained by Roll Call. Winsome Packer, a former staff member of a congressional commission that promotes international human rights, said in documents that the congressman touched her, made unwanted sexual advances, and threatened her job. At the time, Hastings was the chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Packer worked. Hastings has called Packer’s charges ‘ludicrous’ and in documents said he never sexually harassed her.”  http://bit.ly/2BPd1nh FLASHBACK -- “House ethics panel scolds several lawmakers,” by Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan on Dec. 11, 2014: “Both the Ethics Committee and OCE looked into Packer’s allegations. OCE recommended a full-scale investigation by Ethics even though it was not able to determine if there was ‘substantial reason to believe’ Packer’s claim, but Ethics decided not to take that step. In its report on the Hastings’ matter, Ethics said that ‘while the most serious allegations were not supported by the evidence, Representative Hastings has admitted to certain conduct that is less than professional.’ ... “The Ethics Committee stated: ‘Despite the fact that the conduct in this case does not rise to the level of actionable violations of the rules, the Committee does not want to leave the impression that Representative Hastings’ behavior was at all times appropriate. He admitted to some conduct that, while not wrongful per se, certainly could be misunderstood… Nevertheless, hugging is not the most professional way to greet coworkers, and different individuals have different comfort levels for touching others.’” http://politi.co/2A5J8yB BEYOND CONGRESS -- “For Female Lobbyists, Harassment Often Accompanies Access,” by NYT’s Trip Gabriel and Julie Bosman: “Vanessa Alarid was a lobbyist in New Mexico when she asked a lawmaker over drinks one night if she could count on his support for a bill that appeared to be coming down to a single vote. ‘You can have my vote if you have sex with me,’ Ms. Alarid recalled the lawmaker saying, although he used cruder language for sexual intercourse. He told Ms. Alarid she had the same first name as his wife, so he would not get confused if he called out in bed. “Then he kissed Ms. Alarid on the lips, she said. Shocked, Ms. Alarid, who was 32 at the time, pushed him away. Only after he was gone did she let the tears flow. When her bill came up on the floor of the New Mexico House of Representatives the next day, March 20, 2009, it failed by a single vote, including a ‘No’ by the lawmaker, Representative Thomas A. Garcia. As Ms. Alarid watched from the House gallery, she said, Mr. Garcia blew her a kiss and shrugged his shoulders with arms spread.”  http://nyti.ms/2iGY8fc -- “Prominent appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski accused of sexual misconduct,” by WaPo’s Matt Zapotosky: “A former clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski said the powerful and well-known jurist, who for many years served as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, called her into his office several times and pulled up pornography on his computer, asking if she thought it was photoshopped or if it aroused her sexually. Heidi Bond, who clerked for Kozinski from 2006 to 2007, said the porn was not related to any case. “One set of images she remembered was of college-age students at a party where ‘some people were inexplicably naked while everyone else was clothed.’ Another was a sort of digital flip book that allowed users to mix and match heads, torsos and legs to create an image of a naked woman. Bond is one of six women — all former clerks or more junior staffers known as externs in the 9th Circuit — who alleged to The Washington Post in recent weeks that Kozinski, now 67 and still serving as a judge on the court, subjected them to a range of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments. She is one of two former clerks who said Kozinski asked them to view porn in his chambers.”  http://wapo.st/2jBfvPv -- “Ex-Fox News anchor claims Trump tried to kiss her,” by Page Six’s Emily Smith: “Former Fox News anchor Juliet Huddy said President Donald Trump tried to kiss her in an elevator around the time he married First Lady Melania. Huddy, who allegedly received a settlement after she made a complaint against disgraced anchor Bill O’Reilly, described how the mogul leaned in to kiss her after he took her to lunch at Trump Tower in 2005. The TV newswoman, who now hosts a radio show on WABC Radio, revealed on ‘Mornin!!! with Bill Schulz’ on compoundmedia.com, that she had rebuffed the now-president in the Trump Tower elevator. And Trump later appeared on her Fox News chat show, and joked to the audience, ‘I hit on her but she blew me off.’” http://pge.sx/2kesOVw AROUND THE TAX HORN -- “Trump’s casual tax comments scald his Hill allies, again,” by Nancy Cook: “Oops, President Donald Trump did it again. His casual mention of a 22 percent corporate rate on his way to New York last Saturday kicked off a week of unexpected haggling on a topline tax issue many considered already settled, just as congressional negotiators are rushing to get a final bill to the president in time for Christmas -- a date he himself has insisted on. “It’s the latest example of the president getting in the way of his party’s major legislative goal, even if unintentionally, and once again shows the perils for policymakers and legislators in the Trump era, when an unexpected, off-the-cuff comment or tweet can undo weeks of work. On Friday, more than 20 conservative groups — including Americans for Tax Reform, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the National Taxpayers Union — sent a letter to congressional conferees reminding them that the groups’ original support for any tax overhaul was tied to that magic 20 percent figure.” http://politi.co/2iG1nUq HEY, KEVIN MCCARTHY! -- WSJ’S NOUR MALAS and KRISTINA PETERSON, with an Irvine, California, dateline: “California House Republican Hears It at Home Over Tax Bill: Rep. Mimi Walters’s constituents worry about mortgage-interest cap, end to local deductions”: “In her district’s biggest city and across its conservative bastions, Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters is facing criticism over the GOP tax overhaul bill that she voted for last month. The bill might increase taxes for many of her constituents, rather than lower them. “Under pressure from frustrated supporters, she is now working to modify the bill to ease the blow as lawmakers try to hash out a compromise with a measure passed by the Senate. Three of California’s 14 House Republicans voted against the bill last month, citing measures that would curb or even eliminate some key deductions used widely by Californians. Mrs. Walters’s support for the bill, by contrast, has drawn scrutiny from some at a tense moment for the state’s Republicans, ahead of competitive midterm elections next year. “‘I’m not going to vote for a Democrat, but am I going to vote for a Republican that is going to raise my taxes?

260,http://time.com/5011644/donald-trump-texas-shooting-asia/?iid=sr-link3,"Just one day after arriving in Japan for a 12-day trip across Asia, President Trump was briefed on yet another mass shooting that had happened on U.S. soil: the rampage in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in which 26 people were killed after a gunman opened fire on a church. This is the third time within five weeks that Trump had to comfort a nation in the midst of a national tragedy. The shooting occurred just days after a terrorist attack in New York City killed eight people and injured a dozen more, and a little over a month after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas, killed over 58 people and injured over 500. The President’s response to the tragedy in Texas echoed his reaction to the shooting in Las Vegas, where he offered condolences to the victims and stressed the importance of national unity, rather than his response to the New York City attack, where he immediately began calling for immigration policy changes after the suspect was identified. News of the shooting began to break Sunday afternoon, at approximately 2 p.m. Eastern. At 3:06 P.M., Trump tweeted: “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.” At 5:54 P.M. Eastern — which was Monday morning in Japan — Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Trump had been continuously briefed on the shooting and had spoken with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends and families affected. May God comfort them all in this time of tragedy,” Sanders says in a statement. Approximately three hours later, the White House issues an official statement from Trump thanking first responders, calling for national unity, and pledging assistance for the investigation. “We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved. Our hearts are broken. But in dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms. And through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong,” Trump says in the statement. The White House also issues a presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the shooting. Trump subsequently addresses the shooting in remarks to U.S. and Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, reiterating the sentiments expressed in the White House statement. “Our hearts are broken, but in dark times — and these are dark times — such as these, Americans do what they do best: “We pull together. We join hands, we lock arms, and through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong — oh, so strong,” he says. By this point after the New York City attack just days earlier, Trump had already said on Twitter that he had implemented policy changes, asking the Department of Homeland Security to intensify extreme vetting procedures after the suspect was identified as an immigrant from Uzbekistan. When a reporter tried to ask Trump about gun control policy after this event, according to a pool report, White House aides asked the media to leave. But Trump held a joint news conference Monday morning with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, less than 24 hours after the attack, where a question about the shooting and possible gun control measures inevitably came up. He told reporters that mental health is the issue at hand, and that the gunman, who authorities have identified as 26-year-old Devin Kelley, was a “very deranged individual.” “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it’s a little bit soon to go into it,” Trump continued. “But, fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it would have been — as bad it was, it would have been much worse.” Write to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com.",2017-11-15 00:00:00,How President Trump's Response to the Texas Church Shooting Compares to Past Attacks,terrorism,4419,http://time.com
261,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/Qwo-LZ_E1zI/ct-athletes-call-on-nfl-to-sign-colin-kaepernick-20171116-story.html,"Michael Bennett and other athletes, including the WNBA's Brittney Griner and Breanna Stewart, as well as Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, are calling on the NFL to sign Colin Kaepernick. In a statement issued Wednesday by a Bennett-led group called Athletes in Action, they said, ""No one should be denied employment for having the courage to follow their convictions and take action for equality and social justice."" ""Join me and many others to get Colin Kaepernick signed!"" Bennett, a Seahawks defensive end, said on Twitter. Kaepernick has been a free agent since parting ways with the 49ers in March, and many believe that he is being deliberately shunned by the NFL for being the first in the league last season to stage protests during the national anthem. The 30-year-old Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment, and attorneys for the quarterback are seeking to obtain depositions from several team owners, as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""Every day that goes by and he doesn't get signed is another nail in the NFL's defense,"" one of the attorneys, Mark Geragos, told The Post's Mark Maske earlier this month. Bennett's group, which also includes former Olympian John Carlos, famous for raising a black-gloved fist on the medal podium during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, is seeking to harness people power on behalf of Kaepernick. Other Athletes for Impact campaigns include initiatives on gun safety, mass incarceration, police violence, LGBTQ rights, immigration and climate change. In its statement Wednesday, the group traced a tradition of athletes protesting social injustices back to the 1960s, then through the 1996 anthem protests of former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and demonstrations last year by WNBA players, before Kaepernick began sitting, then kneeling, during renditions of ""Star-Spangled Banner"" ahead of preseason games. ""Kaepernick was clear in live interviews and in writing about the intentions of his protest,"" the group said, ""stating time and time again the specific reasons for his demonstration, and that it was not intended to disrespect the military but start a national conversation and action around issues of injustice."" ""It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,"" the statement claimed. ""As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, 'if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can't name one better than him . . .' ""Legendary athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos were disparaged by many in their day for using their platform to speak out against racism and injustice. Today their statues stand proudly in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and they are widely celebrated as truth tellers ahead of their time. It is time we start celebrating our truth tellers from the start."" Bennett was among the first NFL players to stage anthem demonstrations this season. Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle's sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their ""Salute to Service"" night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. After Goodell said last month that his league believes ""everyone should stand"" for the anthem, but would not force players to do so, Bennett said, ""I plan on sitting down."" With talks occurring between the NFL and its players about how to negotiate an end to the protests, the two-time Pro Bowler said at the time, ""I think the first step to even being able to even have a conversation is to make sure that Colin Kaepernick gets an opportunity to play in the NFL. ""I think all of us are having opportunities to be able to speak to our employers, but to think about the guy who started everything not to be able to have a voice at this moment, it just doesn't seem very right to me,"" Bennett added. Last week, Geragos disputed a claim by an NFL spokesman that Kaepernick's camp had not responded to an offer from the league for the quarterback to have a one-on-one meeting with Goodell. The attorney said that Kaepernick ""would be happy to attend"" a meeting with the commissioner, but that the presence of a mediator would be required because of the grievance the quarterback has filed. In its statement, Athletes for Impact said, ""We call on all NFL owners, general managers and coaches with a positional need to summon the courage to sign Colin Kaepernick and to stand with us on the right side of history.""

262,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/magazine/what-makes-luke-bryan-country.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Feature Luke Bryan has been testing the sonic limits of country music for a decade. Just how much novelty can the genre take? Luke Bryan outside his tour bus in Concord, Calif., in November.Credit...Devin Yalkin for The New York Times Supported by By Will Stephenson Mitchell Willoughby swallowed 25 live crickets to win his backstage passes to the Luke Bryan concert in Fort Wayne, Ind. He bragged about the feat — a challenge from a local radio station — to Bryan’s face while the country star was making the rounds at his standard meet-and-greet before the show. Bryan looked taken aback. “You just, like, swallowed ’em whole?” he asked, visibly disgusted. “Alive?” Mitchell nodded proudly. Bryan shook his head and moved on to the next fan, a preteen girl who was already shivering and in tears. It was a Thursday night in October, and Bryan was midway through his ninth annual Farm Tour. More than 10,000 people had trekked from all over Indiana and the rest of the Midwest to see him perform on this geographically remote patch of earth. The tour, Bryan’s lead guitarist and longtime friend, Michael Carter, told me, was an attempt to recreate the shows they played while in community college in southern Georgia, when they would enlist a friend with some land and “set up on a flatbed trailer or on a porch or in a barn.” The scale of the operation has changed drastically in the intervening years. Bryan has been in the spotlight for a decade — a career that has included having three albums top the Billboard 200, singing the national anthem at this year’s Super Bowl and co-starring in ABC’s coming reboot of “American Idol.” The Farm Tour now employs well over a hundred crew members (including cooks and a full-time massage therapist), who construct a high-capacity concert arena from scratch every morning and then break it down each night after Bryan’s encore with a kind of supernatural efficiency, leaving the fields empty and clear as the circuslike convoy of more than 60 buses and tractor-trailers heads on to the next farming community. They go to sleep on their respective buses and wake up in a new town they’ve often never heard of. “I don’t even know where I am right now,” one roadie told me that day in Fort Wayne. “What state or nothing. It’s a blur.” The farms change, but Bryan’s preshow ritual does not vary. Before taking the stage each night, he spends an hour riding a propped-up bicycle. Then he mixes himself a salty dog — grapefruit juice and vodka, with a generous pinch of salt. His stylist, Cheryl, presents him with the evening’s outfit, almost always some variation on a solid-color V-neck, baseball cap and jeans. She rubs his arms with moisturizer until they glisten. Finally, he throws on his cowboy boots, which he secures tightly to his ankles with tape. He needs the extra protection when, in his words, he’s “in the heat of the battle up there.” If you haven’t seen a mainstream country concert in recent years, you might not know what he means by this, but a Luke Bryan show is a deeply athletic affair. As his band begins its opening licks, he emerges from the darkness to raucous screams from the crowd. He jogs down the catwalk, grabbing hands and beaming. Onstage, he is more Freddie Mercury than George Strait — he leaps into the air and growls sensually and is known for his unique brand of hip-shaking, which seems both earnest and self-effacingly ridiculous. He lines up tequila shots on the lid of a piano and lobs cans of Miller Lite (a sponsor) out to the audience from a cooler wheeled out for this express purpose. Bryan’s 2015 album, “Kill the Lights,” was the first in history to have six singles reach No.1 on the Billboard Country Airplay charts, and his crowds know every word to all of them. He also makes a point to mine his earlier records for fan favorites like “Country Man” (“I can grow my own groceries and salt-cure a ham/Hey, baby, I’m a country man”) and the self-explanatory “Rain Is a Good Thing,” both of which resonate powerfully with the farm-town audiences. Generally unburdened by a guitar, Bryan caps off every song he performs in a kind of triumphant superhero pose, pumping his fists or pointing up at the sky. For years now, Bryan and his generation of pop-country artists have been testing the sonic integrity of country music — a genre with a reputation for being highly inelastic — bending it to the larger demands of the marketplace by incorporating influences from the worlds of rap, R&B, EDM and arena rock. Bryan grew up listening to 2 Live Crew and Eazy-E alongside Ronnie Milsap and Reba McEntire, and his catalog bears their imprint. His new album, “What Makes You Country,” which will be released this week, acts as a statement of purpose from its opening track: “You do your kind of country,” he sings. “They doing their kind of country/I do my kind of country.” The term most often used for the music made by artists like Bryan is “bro-country,” coined by the critic Jody Rosen in 2013. “Music by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude,” Rosen wrote, calling Bryan the “king of the genre.” Bryan has indeed made it clear that he’s not interested in baring his soul, or in emulating earlier country aesthetics. His guiding principle is that his music should please as many people as possible — ideally stadiums full of them — and to that end, he’s willing to use whatever tools (from whatever genres) he deems helpful. If that means making what is essentially a rap song about clubbing in a cornfield (“Kick the Dust Up”) or an R&B sex jam with lyrics like “Feel my belt turn loose from these old bluejeans” (“Strip It Down”), then so be it. But like all great country catalogs, Bryan’s music at its core evinces a careful balance of the hedonistic and the reverent — at ease in the space between the dive bar and the church, between spring break and the farm. It still came as a surprise, though, in Fort Wayne when he was able to bring the wild proceedings to a sudden halt to address the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which had occurred over the weekend. “It’s been a rough week for me personally,” he said to the crowd, wiping the sweat from his brow, “and probably the worst week in the history of country music.” The audience knew exactly what he meant, and the volume fell to a hush. Like a preacher at a tent revival, he asked us to put our arms around one another and bow our heads, to keep praying about the problems our country faced. “Let’s get to working on this, y’all,” he said. “Let’s try to learn from it and make a change.” In the moment of silence that followed — 15 seconds that seemed much longer — it became suddenly apparent again that we were in the middle of the Indiana woods. Then the moment passed, and the crowd was chanting: “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” Bryan gave a shout-out to police officers and firefighters, soldiers and schoolteachers. And just like that, his swagger was restored. “Let’s do some party crashing on a Thursday night,” he shouted. The crowd roared its approval, and the band came back to life. One afternoon several years ago, my uncle and his family took their new boat out for a test run off their dock on the Flint River in southwestern Georgia. Around the point where the Muckalee and Kinchafoonee Creeks flow into the river proper, the boat’s engine sputtered and died, and they found themselves stranded. Before long, however, an older, well-tanned woman in a bass boat called out to them and volunteered to help. My cousin insisted they were fine. “I wouldn’t be turning down help,” she replied, before pulling up alongside and asking if they’d like a beer. “I’m Luke Bryan’s mom,” she said, as if by way of explanation, before offering to tow them home. I heard stories like this for years, as Bryan evolved from a local phenomenon — he grew up in Leesburg, just upriver from my hometown, Albany — to arguably the biggest star in Nashville. His songs are largely about trying to carve out a good time in dull, desolate places; the images you get from his lyrics are of vast, rural stretches of eerie nothingness. It’s a landscape I recognize from our corner of Georgia — the pecan trees and cotton fields punctuated by boiled-peanut stands, the occasional collection of cows and every conceivable variety of grain elevator. Bryan is an enthusiastic ambassador for the area, and in his capricious approach to country, he is channeling the diverse mix of sounds that kids in his town, and others like it, were listening to. In many respects, country and hip-hop are sister genres, the pop styles that most reliably make room for God and work, black-market economies and regional pride. In the media, and particularly in the South, they have often found themselves pitted against each other, an opposition born of the culture wars and of the region’s catastrophic racial history. But my own experience was that most teenagers who listened to country (or jam bands or nu-metal) were just as likely to be familiar with the songs in regular rotation on rap radio. Rap was ubiquitous — it was the soundtrack at football pep rallies and, as Bryan has pointed out, at the same dive bars that hosted artists like him. He has a visceral understanding of places like this, whether Leesburg, Ga., or Fort Wayne, Ind. So why, I asked Bryan the next afternoon aboard his tour bus, did he leave southern Georgia for the big city? I know why I left, I said — I never especially liked it there to begin with. What was his excuse? He hesitated. We were now in Springfield, Ill., and the ground outside was unmanageably muddy. Taking pity on my tennis shoes, he had lent me a pair of his boots. He seemed oblivious to the mud himself, stretching out his own grimy pair on the black leather couch lining the wood-paneled interior of the bus. He kept running a hand through his disheveled hair, where a backward ball cap should have been, as if he were feeling for a phantom limb. “I’m interesting in that, at any point, I could have taken the slightest deviation and never moved to Nashville,” he said. “And I think I would have still been smiling through every day. I would have been fine working at my dad’s peanut mill.” His father ran not only a peanut mill but also a fertilizer-chemical company and, along with a partner, was responsible for 3,000 acres of farmland. His mother — who had joined him for the tour, posting up in a lawn chair outside his bus and chain-smoking Salems — worked for the county utilities department. The youngest of three siblings, Bryan sang in his church choir as a teenager and led a praise band on Wednesday nights. On Fridays, he would be down the street playing at bars, often to the same crowd. “I would play a David Allan Coe song, and then I’d do a gospel medley of ‘I Saw the Light’ and ‘Amazing Grace,’ ” he said. “And people would be like, ‘Don’t you feel weird playing those songs in a honky-tonk?’ And I’d say: ‘Well, I don’t know. Would Jesus feel weird walking into a honky-tonk?’ ” Bryan had long planned on moving to Nashville, but a year after graduating from Georgia Southern University with a business degree, he was still in his hometown, pulling peanut wagons for a living. “My dad felt like he needed to nudge me a little out of the nest,” he said, and so the elder Bryan threatened to fire his son, who finally moved to Nashville in late 2001. After a few months of waiting on tables, he was put on contract by a publishing company to write tracks for other artists. In 2005, he met the songwriter Jeff Stevens, who had written hits for George Strait and Tim McGraw and immediately recognized Bryan’s potential as a performer. He produced Bryan’s 2007 debut, “I’ll Stay Me,” which reached No.2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and scored a modest hit with “All My Friends Say,” sung from the perspective of a man piecing together a drunken blackout — presaging the college-bro image that would come to define his sound. But otherwise, his first release was relatively traditional, with lots of fiddle and mandolin; Bryan now calls it “country as cornbread” and says it’s slightly embarrassing for him to listen to. What you might not guess from his music is that Bryan’s life has been marked by tragedy. His older brother, Chris, was killed in a car accident in 1996, and his older sister, Kelly, died of uncertain causes in 2007 while doing the laundry. (Her husband, Ben Lee Cheshire, died in 2014; Bryan and his wife, Caroline, took in their three children.) It occurred to me to wonder, given the contours of his life, why Bryan’s music wasn’t sadder, and so I asked him. “I’ve written some sad songs,” he said. “There are 10 or 15 songs I’ve got that will break you down, like gut-punch you.” But these more personal songs, he said, have never felt right for his albums. “I don’t know if they — if they ever show up, they show up,” he said. He has claimed that his 2013 hit “Drink a Beer” is a sort of tribute to his siblings. But Bryan didn’t write the song himself, and there’s something vaguely disheartening about his linking these very real calamities of life to such a trite premise: Faced with the loss of a loved one, a man shrugs it off and cracks open a cold one. Sitting in the front seat of Jeff Stevens’s pickup truck one evening on the tour, I asked him what he thought of the criticism Bryan has taken over the course of his career: that he mostly sings about his truck and bluejeans and boots, that he’s shallow or opportunistic. Stevens, who has worked with Bryan on all his albums, sat back and laughed. “I love it,” he said. Whenever he sees Bryan perform, he went on, “I look over a sea of people who are forgetting everything. And that is the biggest gift that we can give to somebody — an hour and a half where they haven’t thought about their job, they haven’t thought about their troubles. They’re just here for pure fun. I personally feel that purely fun music is cathartic. It’s like being a goddamn doctor. And it’s important. I’m not saying that it’s not important to have a message — a message is great. But people love to not think in today’s world. They got enough to think about. When they go back to their cars, they’ll start thinking again.” One afternoon, angling his head out of his tour-bus bathroom while urinating, Bryan asked me about my political beliefs. I admitted that they were somewhat to the left of his own, and had been even back in Albany. He expressed surprise but said: “That’s the beauty of getting out of where we’re from. I lean conservative, but when you truly see the world and the country in its entirety, I think if you stay so conservative, it’s almost a little ignorant.” His musical trajectory is closely tied to his personal one. “When I was a 12-year-old kid,” he said, “I was so country, I would’ve probably had to have an interpreter for this interview.” But seeing the world had changed his perspective on things. He had evolved as a person, and his views — both artistic and political — had developed accordingly. Country singers aren’t often thought of as having the ability to change. They’re supposed to be reactionary and creatively static, to play the role that was written for them decades ago. Their continued cultural relevance can baffle observers unfamiliar with the form. In the early 1990s, when Billboard started using Nielsen SoundScan to more accurately calculate music’s commercial performance, one of the biggest surprises to industry insiders was the extraordinary popularity and reach of artists like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Tim McGraw. Disdain for country music is as old as the genre itself, and appropriately, mainstream critics have disliked Bryan from the beginning and have tended to treat him with some combination of amusement and animosity. But Bryan — with his references to Drake and T-Pain and to the size of his rims, his occasional tendency to break out into rapping onstage, the smooth R&B production of his ballads — has also become an avatar of a deep fissure within country music and the object of the undying enmity of traditionalists. The commercial dominance of Bryan and his peers — artists like Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Florida Georgia Line — has often led Nashville’s more critically acclaimed Americana wing, which includes artists like Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, to distance themselves from identifying with country altogether. (Musgraves has said, “My favorite compliment ever is when someone says, ‘I hate country music, but I love your music.’ ”) Bryan defends his own approach as a fundamentally generous and populist one. “Listen, at the end of the day,” he told me, “I write, record and sing about what I see my fans reacting to. If I roll into a concert and I tell everyone I have written the world’s greatest song, and I walk out there and play it and nobody really gives a [expletive] about it, it ain’t the world’s greatest song anymore. That’s how I go about it. I am not stubborn enough.” I asked Bryan about Sturgill Simpson, who won this year’s Grammy for best country album (Bryan has never been nominated) and has been an outspoken opponent of the Nashville establishment. Did it frustrate him that critics often focused their attentions on artists whose fans actively dislike most contemporary country? Bryan shrugged. “I’ve wanted to go have coffee with Sturgill,” he said. “I am utterly amazed at what he does.” (I asked Simpson to comment for this article, and he responded quickly by email: “I don’t know Luke, I don’t think about Luke, and I’ve honestly never heard a single note of his music.”) Simpson’s retro purity and projection of artistic integrity may win him awards and make him palatable to country outsiders, but Bryan’s omnivorous approach to country production is arguably more ambitious and musically progressive; it’s certainly more in tune with the genre’s younger listeners. Bryan’s own epiphany in this respect arrived in his early years on the road, when he noticed D.J.s playing hip-hop immediately after his sets and noticed too that his fans were happy to hear it. That taught him, he told me, that “it’s not always all about the twangiest of the twang” and that a hybrid like “Country Girl (Shake It for Me)” could be accepted. Others picked up on this as well, from Florida Georgia Line to Sam Hunt — from the lowbrow, in other words, to the ostensibly cosmopolitan — and this kind of stylistic flexibility has become one of the dominant narratives of pop-country in recent years. These days, Bryan said with a laugh, “all my nieces and nephews are listening to Future.” Kids no longer make the same hard-and-fast genre distinctions as their parents. So why should he? (Up to a point; he told me tries to keep his albums “80 percent country.”) But Bryan remains well aware of his responsibilities to his base; country has always been primarily a white, blue-collar music. Which is why the fascinating quandary of his career has been the question of how much he can tweak the country sound — how much sonic and thematic borrowing the genre can sustain — while still remaining identifiably country. Paradoxically, in a deep-historical sense, to do so is to be more faithful to country’s roots than the nostalgists. “From its inception,” Nick Tosches wrote in “Country: The Biggest Music in America,” his classic history of the genre, “country and western was as mongrelized a style as any of earth,” describing its origins as an amalgamation of blues and jazz, minstrel comedy, yodeling, Tin Pan Alley and Hawaiian slide guitar. Bryan, along with the artists who have emerged in his wake, are proof that this is still the case, that country is still mutable, still in flux. If you’re wondering whether the results are cynical or forward-thinking, the answer is that they’re both — they’re also pretty fun. Bryan’s form of genre fluidity doesn’t, however, seem to be actually diversifying the country audience: His crowds, like the genre’s fans over all, are overwhelmingly white. Bryan’s relationship to the rural working class is at this point more imaginative than direct. What grounds him in the country ethos is largely a set of signifiers, those almost algorithmically predictable references to the trappings of heartland American life — to the right kinds of beer and trucks, to the primacy of, as one Bryan hit has it, “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day.” When I asked Stevens what kept Bryan tethered to country music rather than to the broader pop arena, his answer was comical in its minimalism. “Have you heard him sing?” he asked, with a confused expression. “He’s a [expletive] hillbilly.” He went on: “We feel like we can do anything, and as long as you put that hillbilly voice on top of it, it’s going to sound country.” As a barometer of country identity, Bryan’s vision is a testament to its adaptability but also to its deep-rooted insularity. Say the right things in the right accent, and Stevens is right: Country can be anything.

We can spend hours debating the root causes, historical circumstances that compel people to commit crime. … But we do not have the luxury of time to stop the killers.” Rosenstein didn't go as far as President Trump, who has called the city a ""total disaster"" because of its violence.  And he didn't blame the violence on Chicago's status as a sanctuary city, as Attorney General Jeff Session has, linking policies on undocumented immigrants to soaring crime rates. But he did note that the more than 4,300 shooting victims and 760 homicides in the city last year translated into a person shot every two hours and two people killed each day. Rosenstein took issue with some recent decisions by the Chicago Police Department, including a requirement that officers fill out forms for routine investigative stops.  They were ordered after the American Civil Liberties Union released a study showing minorities have been predominately targeted for stops here. The information was intended to help a retired federal magistrate judge evaluate whether officers were following the constitution when they make street stops.  But the police union has claimed traffic stops declined 80 percent because officers found the forms burdensome.  They have since been streamlined twice. Rosenstein said the requirement contributed to a  “dramatic disruption in policing” that has contributed to the spike in violence crime.  “Deterrence is about fear,” he said. “If dangerous criminals are not afraid, then law-abiding citizens are not safe. “So when we see a surge in violent crime that follows a dramatic disruption in policing, as happened in Baltimore and Chicago, it’s obvious there is a lapse in the deterrent effect of law enforcement,"" he continued. ""The debate about what caused the lapse will endure, as will efforts to remedy the root causes and improve relationships between police officers and residents of high crime neighborhoods.” Rosenstein implored the law enforcement officials at the dinner to “rededicate themselves to nonpartisan principles of law enforcement” and their commitment to serving high-crime neighborhoods. “We must never give up on the people who live in those neighborhoods,” he said. ""The majority of the residents are not violent people. They struggle every day to survive violence that surrounds them. They are our people and it is our duty to protect them. Every city should be a sanctuary where people live in peace, not afraid.” Earlier in the day, Rosenstein met with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for two hours at a strategic decision support center in the Englewood police district, according to chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  The department says the level of violence in Englewood has dropped to its lowest point since 1999, and it credits the decline to the expansion of gunshot detection technology and analytic tools. Rosenstein said he found the decrease “very encouraging” and praised the department proactive policing, including raids on people on a “strategic subject list,” a compilation of people most likely to commit or be targeted by violence. “Targeting dangerous repeat offenders is not a zero tolerance strategy. It does not involve arresting random people for minor offenses,"" Rosenstein said. Much of Chicago’s top brass, including Johnson, were not at Rosenstein’s speech because it coincided with a Chicago Police Board meeting. Many suburban police chiefs, including those from Maywood and Robbins, were among  several hundred law enforcement officials in attendance. Rosenstein’s appearance came after months of blistering criticism of the city from the Trump administration. After the mass shooting at a Texas church, Trump downplayed the need for gun control, incorrectly asserting Chicago has “the strongest gun laws in our nation.” He described the city as a “total disaster.” Rosenstein’s immediate boss, Sessions, has feuded with Chicago and other “sanctuary cities,” threatening to withhold grant money if local law enforcement doesn't cooperate with immigration agents. Rosenstein has been embroiled in controversy over much of Trump's tenure. Trump initially pointed to a memo from Rosenstein as a basis to fire FBI director James Comey, who had been overseeing the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. Sessions later recused himself from the matter and Rosenstein, the department’s second-in-command, appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Rosenstein joked about the audience he drew in Chicago, fielding questions from law students at John Marshall Law School in Chicago.  “I have not answered so many questions since my last congressional hearing,” he said.

FBI data indicate military rarely reports domestic violence By St. John Barned-Smith and Sig Christenson The U.S. Department of Defense -- now under scrutiny for failing to report a domestic violence conviction that could have stopped Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing several guns used in the Texas church shooting -- reported just one domestic violence conviction to a national FBI database in all of 2016. Violence mounts around homeless camp as man shot to death By Alyson Ward and Margaret Kadifa In the latest in a series of violent acts near a Midtown homeless encampment, a man was found shot to death late Tuesday night after area residents heard gunfire. The encampment, which sprawls beneath the Interstate 69 bridge near the intersection of Caroline and Wheeler, has become a serious trouble spot for the city, with multiple reports of violence since late August. Texas colleges feeling effects of decline in international students By Lindsay EllisUniversity of Houston Clear Lake is among several universities around Texas that this year have seen a sharp drop in international enrollment, as the number of international student applications to four-year public universities has plummeted by more than 10,000 after three years of growth, according to recently compiled data.Experts and college administrators blame a number of factors, including President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and in office, as well as the global economy. Church shooting again puts spotlight on domestic violenceBy St. John Barned-Smith, John D. Harden, and Keri Blakinger The mass shooting in Sutherland Springs last week left America shocked, searching for a cause, something to explain the brazen slaughter of 26 people as they prayed. They wondered what could have possessed Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old disgraced airman identified as the shooter, to act with such cruelty. One factor that surfaced early in the investigation - a chaotic past of domestic abuse and violence - has proved all too common in Texas in recent years. Domestic violence cases have risen sharply across the state, with more than 210,000 wives, girlfriends, husbands and others suffering death or injury at the hands of a family member in the past two years.GOP turnover gives Texas Democrats hope for opportunities in congressional racesBy Kevin Diaz and Mike Ward A wave of retirement announcements from Texas Republicans in both Congress and the Legislature already had sparked a lot of speculation that the pendulum of power might swing against the GOP, even possibly to some degree in a deep red state like Texas.

Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation -- I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? -- Troubled Dear Troubled: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the Music City Cares Fund, established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in modern American history. You don't say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of ""shooting your mouth off""). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. Dear Amy: My wife is a very opinionated person. She has no social filters. On her son's (my stepson's) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in mid-morning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn't believe that the bride really loved her son, but was only marrying him for his money. In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now, (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don't want anything to do with my wife, and I'm left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? -- Mending Dear Mending: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn't unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. Dear Amy: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don't think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. -- Concerned Dear Concerned: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life. And cancer exacts a terrible toll, but I believe that this is fairly common knowledge.

267,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/30/alexander-hamilton-founding-father-musical-lin-manuel-miranda,"Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the founding father is set to storm London. Often mistaken for a president, its hero engineered America and Britain’s special relationship, was rocked by a harassment scandal and got his face on the $10 bill Last modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 12.32 GMT It’s the end of the first act of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s runaway musical smash about the US founding father. The Americans have just won a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette meet at centre-stage and say: “We’re immigrants. We get the job done.”  Miranda’s parents migrated from the Caribbean to New York; Hamilton himself made that journey two centuries earlier. Born on Nevis in the British West Indies, he arrived on the American mainland aged 15. Aaron Burr, his future nemesis, begins the musical by asking how a “bastard orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman”, could rise in life to help found a new nation. The answer is that, along the way, Hamilton, like so many immigrants, worked harder than most, becoming a soldier, lawyer, finance minister and then duelist. He excelled at all of these – except the last. The British historian Paul Johnson called Hamilton “a genius – the only one of the founding fathers fully entitled to that accolade”. But what does that mean? As a teenage pamphleteer, Hamilton agitated for American independence and then fought for it as a soldier for more than six years. His skills and performance as an artillery captain meant he was quickly promoted to principal aide de camp to General George Washington, and it’s fair to call theirs one of the most significant partnerships in all of American history. As an infantry commander, Hamilton led several hundred troops in a bayonet charge to capture the British position at Yorktown, which effectively marked the end of the war. During lulls in the fighting, Hamilton studied financial history, developing a deep admiration for the Bank of England and how Britain managed its huge national debt. He argued that, if America was to prevail, reforming its finances was more important than winning the occasional battle. He also contended that only a strong, national government could stabilise the finances of the fledgling nation. At this point in Miranda’s musical, George III trots out in robes and crown and trills to us rebellious Continentals that: “You’ll be back.” He’s wrong of course, but he almost steals the show. Hamilton began his career as one of Britain’s worst enemies and then ironically turned into one of the UK’s best friends. He became a lawyer in near record time – after just 10 months of study – and in some of his first cases he did the unthinkable: he defended Tories. American supporters of the British cause were facing persecution, and vengeful state laws were taking aim at their properties. But those state persecutions violated the Treaty of Paris, which the federal government had signed to end the war. As a knock-on effect, those new state laws were driving away some of America’s most accomplished citizens. While Hamilton was defending the Tories, he was rallying tirelessly for a constitutional convention. After the convention formed and drafted the constitution, he promoted its ratification by explaining and defending it in the now famous and foundational Federalist essays. Washington became the first president under the constitution in 1789 and appointed Hamilton the first secretary of the Treasury. For his financial innovations Hamilton is dubbed in the show “the ten-dollar founding father”. His face has graced the $10 banknote since the 1920s, leading some to assume erroneously that he must have been an early president. As finance minister, Hamilton engineered his own revolution, much like Britain’s a century earlier. He restructured America’s war debts to establish public credit; he founded the Bank of the United States as the country’s first central bank; and he set the dollar as the nation’s currency. His measures prompted state governments to charter more banks and other corporations and led traders to establish securities markets and stock exchanges, such as that in New York, founded in 1792. Central to Hamilton’s plan was peaceful trade with Britain. Import taxes supplied almost all of the federal government’s revenues, and most of America’s imports still came from the UK. But Britain was discriminating against American trade. Thomas Jefferson wanted to play hardball, but Hamilton prevailed by persuading Washington that getting tough would cause a trade war and another military engagement. January 2015 Hamilton, a new musical written by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, has its first performances off-Broadway at the Public theater in New York. Its subject is the US founding father who was the first secretary of the Treasury. February 2015 As the show opens officially, it wins praise from critics, particularly for its innovative blend of musical styles, from rap to operetta. In her four-star review, the Guardian’s Alexis Soloski calls the show ""brash, nimble, historically engaged and startlingly contemporary"". August 2015 After selling out its run at the Public, the show opens on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers theatre and there is huge demand for tickets. February 2016 The original Broadway cast recording wins a Grammy award for best musical theatre album. March 2016 Miranda visits the White House to perform songs from the musical and a video of him freestyling in the Rose Garden with President Barack Obama goes viral. First lady Michelle Obama calls the show “the best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life”. April 2016 Hamilton wins the Pulitzer prize for drama. June 2016 The musical breaks records, winning 11 Tony awards – at a ceremony that takes place after news breaks of a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. Miranda performs a sonnet in praise of his wife and son, ending with the words: “Now fill the world with music, love and pride.” July 2016 Miranda stops performing in the show to pursue other opportunities, including starring in a sequel to Mary Poppins. A spoof version of the musical, Spamilton, opens in New York. October 2016 A production of Hamilton opens in Chicago and runs concurrently with the Broadway version. November 2016 Vice-president-elect Mike Pence sees the show in New York. From the stage, actor Brandon Victor Dixon addresses him directly, saying: “We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us.” On Twitter, Donald Trump condemns their “terrible behaviour” and says he hears the show is “highly overrated”. January 2017 The first cast members are revealed for a West End production of Hamilton. December 2017 The show opens to five-star reviews at the newly renovated Victoria Palace theatre in London. March 2018 The London production of Hamilton gets 13 Olivier nominations, making it the most nominated show in the history of the awards. July 2020 A filmed version of the Broadway production debuts on the Disney+ streaming service, warmly welcomed while the world is still in lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. So Hamilton laid the foundations of the special relationship between America and Britain. It has proved rocky from time to time, but it flowered beautifully during the two world wars and their aftermaths. Following Hamilton’s directives for maintaining strong markets, the Marshall plan after World War II, in its way, helped repay Britain for the revenues that had allowed Hamilton to revolutionise America’s finances. Not that he was without flaws. While treasury secretary, he had an affair with a woman named Maria Reynolds. In cahoots with her husband, she accused Hamilton of sexual harassment. He paid them off to keep quiet, but the affair came to light a few years later. Rather than bury it again, Hamilton wrote a lengthy pamphlet explaining everything. Admitting to adultery protected his public reputation, and his wife, Eliza, forgave him, but the musical reveals her inner sorrows. A year after coming clean, Hamilton became a major general and inspector general of the US army. Then came the presidential election of 1800. The two candidates were Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. One, a former secretary of state seen by many as a dangerous leftwing radical who would stop at nothing to gain the presidency. The other, a self-absorbed narcissist and womaniser convinced that he couldn’t lose unless his opponent stooped to rigging the election. Sound familiar? Hamilton knew both men well. One was his enemy, the other his nemesis. “His politics are tinctured with fanaticism,” he said of Jefferson. “He is a contemptible hypocrite.” Burr didn’t fare any better: “This man has no principle, public or private.” Hamilton condemned him as “the most unfit man in the US for the office of president”. The election culminated in a tie. According to the rules of the time, the runner up became vice-president, but a tie triggered a runoff election decided by the House of Representatives. Hamilton supported Jefferson because he preferred a candidate with disagreeable principles rather than one without any at all. He executed a frenetic letter-writing campaign that ultimately put Jefferson in the White House. Four years later, upset by rumours that Hamilton had badmouthed him, vice-president Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. They met on a duelling ground in New Jersey. Hamilton threw away his shot by firing into the air. Burr didn’t return the favour. Hamilton didn’t live to see Jefferson and Madison get tough with Britain, which, just as he had predicted, led to a trade war and then the War of 1812. But from humble beginnings, Hamilton had had a shot to help write history – and he didn’t throw that one away.  This article contains affiliate links to products.

268,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/24/san-jose-sharks-in-vegas-a-close-call-with-tragedy/,"Trending: ​LAS VEGAS — The Sharks didn’t need any reminders about what they were thankful for Thursday. 
The last time they had looked upon the lights of the Strip, they were on a flight headed for San Jose after an Oct. 1 exhibition game against the Vegas Golden Knights. Less than an hour later, a gunman opened fire on thousands of concert-goers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 people in the largest mass shooting in modern American history. 
						
There but for the grace… 
​”I have no doubt if that had been an off night, we would have been at the concert,” Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said Thursday. DeBoer is a country-music fan, as are several of his players. It was a country-music concert. 	


“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​”I have no doubt if that had been an off night, we would have been at the concert,” Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said Thursday. DeBoer is a country-music fan, as are several of his players. It was a country-music concert. 	


“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion. 

Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. 

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion. 

Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. 

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion. 

Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. 

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

How I got this way I will continue to explore. One doesn't simply become cruel and abusive by accident. Can I repair myself, reclaim much of myself, and become a reasonable, civil human being? We will see, but I think that I can. I do wish to believe, and hope, that one's history does not imply one's destiny. ""My issues go much further than legal concerns — my transgressions, of course, have legal dimensions, but much more important, they have ethical, moral and humanitarian dimensions. I may never be able to undo and make right what I have done, but I vow to do everything I know how (legal and moral) to become a reasonable human being. And I will do all I can, and am permitted to do, to make recompense to those I've wronged and harmed. ""Thank you for permitting me to learn to do the right thing."" — Leon J. Hoffman, Chicago I am 15 years old, and I just started driver's education. For a class assignment, I had to observe an intersection and look for drivers' errors. I saw lots of people talking on their cellphones or texting while they were driving. I am shocked by how many people do this, because it is so dangerous. I wish people would get a hands-free answering device or just pull over. That way we could all be safer. — Michael Roth, Chicago The Republicans in Congress are completely and morally bankrupt. They do not have the guts to deal with long overdue serious gun control after the horrific massacres in Las Vegas, Newtown, Conn., and so many other assaults on innocents. And with the recent Texas church slaughter, their response has been sluggish, inert. In matters of science, they can't seem to process the fact that climate change is real and creating cataclysmic events in our country and worldwide. What will it take? When is the time right to do the responsible and right thing for them to meet these challenges? Our very lives depend on action with the greatest possible urgency. God help us — because our Republican legislators will not. — Dorothy Dumelle, Oak Park The processes of enacting meaningful legislation in the wake of gun violence or attempting to effectively replan cities to reduce the inevitable devastation caused by natural disasters have one thing in common: They're attempts to solve a problem in hindsight. This prompts the obvious question: Why don't we change our behavior to solve these knowable problems before tragedy comes knocking? This can be said for a variety of societal concerns, both foreign and domestic. It seems that our inherent altruistic sensors only go off when crises are happening on American soil, but why? Just because something doesn't appear to affect you doesn't mean you shouldn't care about it. As then-state Sen. Barack Obama once said, ""If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child."" Therefore, if there's a child who isn't allowed to go to school because she's a girl, that should matter to you, even if it's not your child. If there's a family of five struggling to live on less than 50 cents a day, that should matter to you, even if it's not your family. If there are a billion people across the world without access to clean drinking water, that should matter to you, even if your water is safe to drink. If a child is starving and has no choice but to turn to a terrorist organization for food, clean water and a living wage, that should matter to you too. And yes, there are problems in our own country, but it is also true that the livelihood of people living in developing nations has a direct impact on our economy and national security. The right kind of aid can increase standards of living for the world's poorest; it can provide stability to struggling families; it can help families climb out of the cycle of poverty and help reduce the political instability in some of the more vulnerable nations in the world. — Tim Sonnefeldt, Chicago Every time there is a mass shooting, politicians (and others) say that ""this is not the right time to discuss gun control."" What is the correct time? Police and the FBI spend days and weeks trying to determine what was behind a shooting. Let's assume that after their investigations, they have a 100 percent-correct profile of the shooter. What do they do with that information? Who gets it? Whom do they target based on this profile? How does this prevent the next shooting? It's a very safe bet that there will be another mass shooting. Only the time and place are not known. What if the next 10, 20 or 30 victims were U.S. senators or U.S. representatives? Would it then be the correct time? Or would it depend upon which victims received donations from the National Rifle Assocation? — John Fink, Huntley CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-11-26 19:49:00,How to apologize,"crime and criminals,ethics",9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

On her son’s (my stepson’s) wedding day, she began drinking, etc., in midmorning, along with some of the others in the bridal party. Without going into explicit detail, I learned after the fact that my wife took the bride aside just before she was due to walk down the aisle, and said she didn’t believe that the bride really loved her son but was only marrying him for his money.

In the days following the wedding my wife confirmed those feelings to me, yet, now (weeks later) she denies ever saying those words to the bride. Apparently, though, at least one other person overheard and confirmed what was said, and shared this with the groom. Understandably, the newlyweds don’t want anything to do with my wife, and I’m left trying to mend fences. Thoughts? Mending DEAR MENDING: In the unlikely event of the couple coming to you and asking for reconciliation, you should dive in and try to bring all parties together, in person, to talk this out. Otherwise, you should continue to tell your wife that she owes her daughter-in-law (and son) an apology, preferably in writing. What she did was unconscionable. I hope it wasn’t unforgivable. Your wife has a big problem. No filter plus alcohol plus denial equals unhappy ending. (Click here if you are having trouble viewing the video on your mobile device.)

DEAR AMY: My son-in-law was shot in the thigh during the Las Vegas concert in October. Fortunately, he is now OK. I belong to a religious congregation of around 35 families. One of the women in my congregation and I are also part of another (affiliated) group. At a meeting of the group, I mentioned the shooting to this woman. She said I should contact the president of the organization. I received much warmth and support from members of this group. The president sent a memo to the entire religious congregation — I know this because I am on the email list. What happened next? Nothing! Not one person contacted me to see if he was OK, if I was OK, etc. I am very hurt. Part of me wants to just silently quit the congregation. Part of me wants to tell them how hurt I was (even though shooting off my mouth has gotten me trouble all during my life), and then quit the congregation, and part of me wants to carry on like nothing happened. Your advice? Troubled DEAR TROUBLED: You should reach out to your clergy member regarding your concern. Say that your family has been through a frightening, dramatic and traumatic event, and that you would appreciate support during this challenging time. Be frank and respectful with clergy when you describe your disappointment, even after this email went out. This is very much a pastoral matter, and your clergy should explain why your needs have been neglected, thus far. This monstrous gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others, many of whom are still trying to recover. You might take this opportunity to inspire the congregation not only to care more fully about you, but to extend their compassion to the scores of other family members affected by this senseless tragedy. After you talk with clergy, you might inspire the congregation by sharing the opportunity to donate to the “Music City Cares Fund,” established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee (cfmt.org). This highly rated foundation has pledged that 100 percent of donations made to the Music City Cares Fund will go directly to families impacted by the worst mass shooting in American history. You don’t say what your faith practice is, but you should consider the possibility that many of them have lifted up private thoughts to you. The test for you is to see if you can get what you need by asking for it (instead of “shooting your mouth off”). I hope your faith community rises to this simple challenge with compassion. DEAR AMY: Recently you have included letters from people who have cancer and parts of your responses were along the lines that it looked like they would beat it. As you know, everybody does not survive cancer and I don’t think this is appropriate coming from you, rather than their medical team. Concerned DEAR CONCERNED: I am applauding those who write to share that their treatment seems to be working. For many, cancer is becoming a chronic disease. None of us survives this life.

271,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/04/why-the-workers-comp-system-has-failed-survivors-of-san-bernardino-terror-attack/,"Trending: Struggles endured by survivors of the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack throw an unflattering spotlight on California’s workers’ compensation system and San Bernardino County. Changes in workers’ comp laws led to big savings for insurance companies, but made it difficult for injured workers to get the help they need. And the county “put dollars ahead of people” and showed “ignorance and a complete lack of empathy” by denying or delaying some treatment, said state Sens. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula, and Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara. The worker’s comp system just wasn’t designed to treat people injured in such attacks or other workplace violence. The survivors’ plight, which came to light a year ago, inspired newly elected Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes to introduce a bill to help them when she was sworn in Dec. 5, 2016.  “If we fail those employees and we can’t fix it, then we really have something wrong with the system,” said Reyes, D-Grand Terrace, who represents the 47th Assembly District. San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood declined to respond to those and other statements involving the handling of survivors’ workers’ comp claims. Under state workers’ compensation laws, when an employee is injured, the employer is required to immediately open a workers’ comp claim and send the employee for medical treatment. All California workers hurt on the job have a legal right to benefits including medical care, wage-loss compensation or temporary disability payments during recovery, vocational rehabilitation, death benefits and lost future earnings compensation or permanent disability payments, according to a state Legislative Analyst’s Office report. RELATED: How San Bernardino terror attack survivors are struggling with PTSD’s ‘invisible wounds’ 2 years later A crisis has evolved following legislative changes made in the past 10 to 15 years after the state’s insurance market deregulation in the 1990s led to insurance rate spikes. Employers pushed for legislative help, which included Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger introducing SB899 in 2004. Since that era, it’s been harder for employees to prove claims, medical treatments have been denied or delayed, and permanent disability compensation has dwindled. But it wasn’t until Dec. 2 survivors were shortchanged that the public and legislators took notice, said Santa Ana attorney Geraldine Ly, a workers’ comp law specialist for nearly 20 years who represents nine San Bernardino terror attack survivors. “It has gotten the legislators’ attention. Nothing like that has ever happened,” she said.  “While most would like to return to work, their permanent injuries prevent their return and have forced some, like Ray Britain, to medically retire from the county,” Geraldine Ly, workers’ comp attorney, says of her Dec. 2 survivor client at her Santa Ana office Thurs., Nov. 9.

At left, survivor Julie Swann-Paez. (Photo courtesy of the Assembly Democratic Caucus)  Most employers buy workers’ comp insurance. San Bernardino County and others self-insure, setting aside reserves to cover costs. RELATED: Surgeries, therapy and pain: San Bernardino terror attack survivor details horrific journey to recovery Doctors treating workers must fill out forms to make written treatment requests for everything from surgery to physical therapy, medication or a special bed. The request for treatment is sent to a claims adjustor or “handler” — working for the insurer or employer’s risk management department — for approval. The adjuster can OK treatment or send the request to an outside company for utilization review when another physician weighs in. If the request is denied or modified, a worker can appeal to independent medical review. Many Dec. 2 survivors who weren’t shot in the attack by a Muslim co-worker and his wife didn’t learn they were entitled to trauma counseling, medication and other care under workers’ comp until Ly held an informational meeting in late January 2016. Some returned to work that month without counseling. That April, survivors began experiencing denials, delays and “modifications” or limits for surgeries, physical therapy, counseling, equipment and prescriptions, including painkillers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. The state Workers’ Compensation division reported the county routinely approved nearly all requests until mid-April 2016. Survivors asked for assistance in private meetings with the county and from elected officials when that failed. As the attack’s one-year anniversary neared, survivors sought help publicly at San Bernardino County board of supervisors’ meetings. The county accepted workers’ comp claims from 59 people, including 57 survivors who were at the Inland Regional Center during the attack and a probation department employee who later helped survivors at the IRC. RELATED: After two years, San Bernardino County selects consultant for memorial to honor victims of terrorist attack The county reports 2,484 of 2,763 treatment requests, or 90 percent, were approved, which includes 137 modified, usually to reduce treatment. Two hundred were denied, 94 denials were appealed and 22 denials were overturned.  The county also denied psychological injury claims from 24 employees, who weren’t there for the attack. Ly said her clients’ approvals were far less than 90 percent. The county initially denied then later accepted the claim from the probation department employee. Delays and denials were still happening in July, when survivors Julie Swann-Paez and Sally Cardinale testified about their struggle to the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee during a hearing on Reyes’ bill, AB44, and shared that one survivor waited nine months for a bone graft. Another waited 19 months for trauma counseling. Some denials continue. Physical therapy to desensitize scars on a young male survivor shot in the abdomen, flank and knee, plus referrals to an orthopedist to evaluate the knee, were recently denied, said the worker’s Ontario attorney, Christel Schoenfelder.  Legislators and survivors’ attorneys say county officials didn’t recognize the need to quickly get their workers treatment for trauma and other wounds that Reyes and Stone said were akin to battlefield injuries. Jackson, who sits with Stone on the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee overseeing industrial safety and workers’ comp, was astonished the county didn’t do everything in its power to help. “Why in the world would the county of San Bernardino resist caring for its workers, who are the victims of an attack by a co-worker?” Jackson said by phone recently. “I’m still dumbfounded that that would be the attitude taken by any employer, let alone a government employer.” After 14 people (13 county workers) were killed, 22 wounded and at least 57 left with post-traumatic stress, county officials were legally required to inform survivors this was now a workers’ comp case but didn’t — the first time the county denied or delayed treatment, Ly said. RELATED: ‘We will never forget’ San Bernardino terror attack victims, mourners say on second anniversary County spokesman David Wert said the county provided information about workers’ comp benefits by Dec. 7 and 8, 2015. Survivor Ray Britain, the county Environmental Health Services division’s interim chief on Dec. 2, said that’s not true. At a Dec. 10, 2015, meeting the FBI set up to help survivors, county Risk Management staff who were asked about services neglected to tell survivors or relatives of those who were then “walking zombies” that they were entitled to workers’ comp benefits, Ly said. Risk management told survivors who knew to ask for claim forms they didn’t appear to need them and didn’t need to fill them out then because the county would send information packets with forms later – but no packets ever came, Britain said. When survivors’ doctors submitted requests for treatment authorization — basically, medical recommendations — to county risk management for approval, claims adjuster Christina Hurtado sent the requests to outside utilization review doctors who denied, delayed or modified requests. County officials later said they were required to send all treatment requests to outside utilization review. That’s not true, according to the state industrial relations department and Reyes, the assemblywoman. She’s an attorney who’s handled workers’ comp cases for 35 years. Irvine attorney Keith More, a three-time Workers’ Compensation Trial Lawyer of the Year who represents a survivor, said the county used utilization review to deny survivors “well-deserved” medical treatment when it could have approved “every ounce of treatment.”  The California Supreme Court ruled employers and insurers can approve treatment under internal utilization review. They can even OK treatment denied by outside review, said Jason Marcus, president of Sacramento-based California Applicants’ Attorneys Association, a group of injured workers’ lawyers. Utilization review was set up as a process for an employer or insurer who wants to deny or modify a doctor’s treatment request. While employers and insurers can OK treatment, only another physician can deny or change the primary doctor’s recommendation, Marcus said. County officials said many problems came from survivors’ doctors not submitting the right paperwork. Schoenfelder agrees. But More and Ly said the county adjuster often didn’t send utilization review all medical reports needed to support treatment, which led to denials, delays or modifications. Utilization review doctors can ask for more records but usually just deny, Schoenfelder said. In December 2016, county supervisors expanded the use of outside case managers to expedite claims. Survivors’ attorneys say some helped and some didn’t. Britain disagrees with former county CEO Greg Devereaux’s May 2016 statement the terrorists “win” unless the county comes out “stronger economically” afterward. Britain said county officials had a misguided focus on economics and disregarded their injured employees’ well-being to save money. “I think the terrorists win when you lose track of humanity,” Britain said. Legislators and Marcus say Dec. 2 survivors were treated like any other employees hurt on the job – highlighting a larger problem that injured workers statewide are having in obtaining medical treatment. Insurers and employers concentrate on disproving the need for care, yet 95 percent of claims are legitimate, Jackson said. “The system we have sadly assumes the worker did not get injured on the job,” she said. “Therefore, the whole focus is on denying care and claims, rather than addressing them immediately and trying to get them treatment.” Utilization review and other changes were designed to reduce treatment, she added. Survivors’ attorneys say utilization review doctors deny or modify 65 to 95 percent of treatment requests, and denials are usually upheld by independent medical review, then kept in place for a year. Many employers never send workers for treatment, Ly said. RELATED: Survivors of Sept. 11, Oklahoma City terror attacks share their stories, recovery Treatment requests are often handled mechanically without determining what’s needed to cure workers or considering the judgment of treating doctors who actually see patients, said Marcus. Adjustors also send treatment requests to out-of-state outside review physicians with the wrong specialty for a particular injury — a practice the insurance industry has fought to continue, More said. “It’s the abuse of the utilization review process,” he added. Survivors believe this happened because the county doesn’t want to “deal with a lifetime of having to accommodate them,” Ly said. As of Nov. 30, 29 out of 57 survivors had returned to work for the county at some point. Twelve now work full-time and 10 with doctor-required work restrictions work part-time, while five are out on medical leaves and two left the county, said Wert. Britain said when someone returns full-time without restrictions, they may relapse and be put on leave after a few months. Wert wouldn’t give details on how long the county would accommodate restrictions or allow survivors to work part-time. But Ly said state law allows employers to fire employees after accommodating their restrictions for one year – even Dec. 2 terrorist attack survivors.  The system was set up to get injured workers back to work, not for profit. Yet a Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau analysis shows SB863 saved insurance companies $1.3 billion from 2012 through 2016 – mostly from decreased medical treatment through independent medical review’s introduction, said Diane Worley, California Applicants’ Attorneys Association’s policy director. Reyes introduced AB44 to allow attack survivors’ workers’ comp claims to skip utilization review and extend their benefits from two years to four and a half. The bill was gutted by the Assembly Insurance Committee. On July 12, an amended AB44 requiring employers to immediately provide attack survivors with case managers and treatment options passed out of the Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee and later passed both houses and became law. Jackson and Stone, the committee vice chairman, are now fired up to look closely at workers’ comp. Costs largely arise from workers not getting treatment soon enough, said Jackson. “The supervisor doesn’t have any comment at this time,” said county Policy Advisor Don Holland. Employers and insurers should once again face stiff fines for delaying benefits, Marcus said. Another key reform would require all necessary medical records be sent to outside utilization review and for utilization review doctors to be qualified in the specialty they review, More said by phone. At the AB44 hearing, Stone, a former Riverside County supervisor who lost friend Damian Meins in the Dec. 2 massacre, vowed to make “retooling” the worker’s comp system a “high priority” in 2018 after hearing survivors’ testimony, including that survivors were treated like they were suspected of fraud and a utilization review nurse denied survivors’ medication when only a doctor can. In a recent interview, Stone committed to ensuring there are no gaps in service for injured workers, especially survivors of workplace violence, and said problems are likely happening in other counties, too. “We pay the highest rates in the country. The least we deserve is for employees to get the care they need,” he said. Trauma experts and lawyers say Dec. 2 survivors were further harmed by secondary trauma from their struggles to get help. Acknowledging that, Stone described the delays and denials as “completely inappropriate.” “I don’t want to see a recurrence of the debacle that we witnessed in San Bernardino happen again,” he said.

273,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/4QObSKO0ZhQ/,"In the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Sutherland Springs Baptist Church by former Air Force serviceman Devin Patrick Kelley, the Air Force revealed that Kelley’s court-martial that resulted from a domestic violence conviction was never reported to the national background check database. If done properly, it would have been a move that may have prevented Kelley from acquiring the gun he used in the shooting. Following an internal review, the Air Force has found “several dozen” instances of service members’ charges or convictions for serious crimes going unreported to the national background check database. The Air Force says they aren’t finished with their review, so more unreported service members could be added to the database: Although officials have examined only a portion of the cases across the Air Force that should have been reported, several dozen cases have already surfaced that were not reported as required. In the weeks since the review began, those cases have been corrected and reported, Air Force officials said. “The error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” the Air Force said in a statement. “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” According to the Air Force, they are reviewing around 60,000 cases to determine if they should have been reported by law. Newly discovered incidents will be reported on a rolling basis, the Air Force said. After the shooting, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate that would have compelled the Air Force and other agencies to conduct similar reviews, but that bill quickly stalled in Congress.

On Friday, Underwood suffered multiple injuries, including a broken wrist, after falling outside of her home in Nashville. On Saturday, she gave fans an update regarding her condition and thanked her husband for looking after her. ""Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I'll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me,"" Underwood wrote on Twitter.  ""On Friday night, Carrie Underwood took a hard fall on some steps outside her home,"" Underwood's rep said in statement to Us Weekly. ""While there were no life-threatening injuries, she was taken to the hospital to be treated. She sustained multiple injuries including a broken wrist and some cuts and abrasions from the fall."" The rep added that Underwood's husband made it back in town the same night that the ""American Idol"" winner was released from the hospital. The statement also said that Underwood's recovery will take time, but she is thankful for the prayers and well-wishes. Due to her injuries, Underwood failed to perform at the Country Rising concert for the victims of the Las Vegas shooting in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean on Sunday in Nashville. The accident came just two days after Underwood hosted the Country Music Awards with Brad Paisley. During the event, the ""Before He Cheats"" singer cried when she performed a moving tribute for over 50 men and women who were killed after a gunman opened fire during the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1. Underwood gave the most powerful performance of the night when she sang the song ""Softly and Tenderly"" for the mass shooting victims. In related news, Underwood's husband announced his retirement from NHL in August. The ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" singer expressed her support for the athlete on Instagram after he wrapped up his career in hockey. ""Captain @mfisher1212 I sure am going to miss watching you play and cheering you on with the rest of Smashville, but I so look forward to seeing what God has in store for you in this next chapter of your life,"" Underwood wrote.

276,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/11/addressing-mass-shootings-every-idea-on-the-table/,"Trending: For some children of the ’60s, the decade’s most traumatic crimes weren’t the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy or the martyrdom of Martin Luther King — or even the appalling 1963 Klan church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham. It wasn’t even the rape, torture and strangulation of eight student nurses by a psycho named Richard Speck in Chicago in mid-July of 1966. The most terrifying violence came two weeks later when a former U.S. Marine named Charles Whitman killed his wife and mother before taking an arsenal to the University of Texas tower and shooting everyone he saw. By the time an Austin cop took him out, Whitman had killed 16 people and wounded 31. As a kid growing up the Bay Area, I viewed Stanford’s Hoover Tower and the Campanile at UC Berkeley differently after that. One day, while walking by Saints Peter and Paul Church in North Beach, my dad said that Joe DiMaggio had gotten married there. My kid brother asked if a madman had ever used the cathedral as a perch to shoot people below in Washington Square. Parents assured their children with the only logic they could muster: Such crimes are rare, they said. This was true then. It’s not true anymore — and hasn’t been for a while. As a cub police reporter in San Diego in 1979, I was on the scene for the first mass shooting at an American elementary school. The anomaly wasn’t only the choice of target, Cleveland Elementary School, but also that the shooter was a girl, 16-year-old Brenda Spencer. The first mass shooting in a church took place the following year when a 46-year-old atheist walked into the First Baptist Church in Daingerfield, Texas, yelling “This is war!” It wasn’t war, but it seemed like hell to the parishioners cowering in the pews. Daingerfield and the Cleveland Elementary School revealed that no place was a sanctuary. Since then, America has suffered through at least eight other such attacks on places of worship, one of them a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. Three of these killers have professed racist, homophobic or white supremacist views; another hated Baptists. One was a Muslim angry about the killings at Temple Emanuel in Charleston, S.C. The litany of colleges devastated by such crimes grows yearly. Everyone remembers the carnage at Virginia Tech, but have we forgotten the mass shootings at Northern Illinois University, Arizona, San Diego State, Umpqua Community College and Santa Monica College? Yes, Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary were shocks to the national psyche, but killers have slaughtered innocents at a host of other schools, including another Cleveland Elementary in California, this one in Stockton. In 2012, after 12 movie-goers were gunned down in Aurora, Colorado, I wrote a four-part series examining the issue. Since then, four of the five deadliest shootings in U.S. history have taken place. Twenty-six dead in Newtown, Connecticut, including 20 kids ages 6 and 7. Forty-nine at the Pulse club in Orlando; 58 killed and more than 500 wounded in Las Vegas last month; 26 killed a week ago at a small Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Speaking for millions of Americans, the time for business-as-usual is over. We need a national dialogue on this plague, followed by concrete action. It’s time to put everything on the table, and I do mean everything. Mass shootings are not a new phenomenon. But the death toll has become staggering, and the ripple effects to the society potentially debilitating. The entrenched battle lines between Democrats and Republican are killing this country. Resuscitating it will require liberals and conservatives to put their fellow Americans ahead of stale ideologies and mindless talking points. In 1903 the streets of Winfield, Kansas were turned red by Spanish-American War veteran Gilbert Twigg. Twigg killed nine people and wounded many more at an outdoor concert before turning a revolver on himself. “The boys around town had referred to him as ‘Crazy’ Twigg,” the local paper reported later, “but no one thought he was dangerous.” Today, we all know that mentally ill men with a proficiency with firearms, no job and a seething anger toward society are quite dangerous. So why such easy access to firearms? One reason is that our laws are too deferential to the rights of the mentally ill. Charles Whitman suspected, correctly, that he had brain damage. He told his shrink he fantasized about shooting people from a tower. His therapist told no one. Aurora multiplex killer James Holmes told his psychiatrist that he had “homicidal thoughts” three or four times a day and that it was getting worse. She told no one. Jared Loughner, the Tucson shooter who wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford and 13 others while killing six, acted so oddly that some students and teachers refused to be in the same class with him. But he could buy guns. Let’s change that. Here are other steps to consider: • You don’t like how Donald Trump speaks about Muslim immigrants? I don’t, either. But let’s not pretend we don’t know who attacked the Pulse nightclub, Fort Hood, two Chattanooga military bases, the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, or who drove the deadly truck in New York City. The answer is Muslim immigrants or first-generation Muslims radicalized by Islamic extremist groups. The Trump administration wants stricter vetting of such people? Isn’t that an obvious need? • You like the Second Amendment? I once did, too. But the arsenal Stephen Paddock took to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas included weapons for a battlefield. If the National Rifle Association keeps defending the unlimited right of Americans to hoard such weapons, millennial generation voters already flocking to liberal candidates and causes will eventually repeal it. Take heed, NRA. • What about existing gun laws — why aren’t they enforced? How was a dangerous convict like Devin Patrick Kelley able to purchase his guns after being cashiered from the U.S. Air Force and serving time for beating his wife and stepson? Slipped through the cracks, did he? We should have laws making such negligence a criminal offense. • The Second Amendment isn’t the only constitutional hurdle we must confront. I’m a journalist who relies on the First Amendment for my livelihood. But is it time to set limits? Social scientists have known for 50 years that Americans’ unfettered access to violent programming contributes to aggressive behavior and copy-cat crimes. The Aurora shooter attended a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” with dyed hair and guns, having left chemical booby traps back in his apartment adorned with Batman posters. He told cops he was the Joker. So far, lawsuits targeting studios — and video game manufacturers — have not dented the production of such nihilistic fare. Plaintiff lawyers must keep trying. Remember, it took a while to bag Big Tobacco, too. • Finally, what about the wall-to-wall news coverage of such events? It’s become clear to criminal justice experts that some sort of grim competition exists with these killers. Covering their crimes — covering the news — is not the same thing as producing mindlessly violent video games and is certainly protected by the First Amendment. Yet not everything that the news media can do is something it should do. Food for thought, colleagues. Carl M. Cannon is executive editor and Washington Bureau chief of RealClearPolitics.

277,http://uproxx.com/news/what-was-stephen-paddock-motive-las-vegas-shooter/,"Following the senseless Las Vegas massacre — which killed at least 59 people and left another 525 injured — carried out by Stephen Paddock, authorities are left with the insurmountable task of making sense of it all. Initial details in the hours after the shooting touched upon Paddock’s background and home life. More information is now trickling forth and paints a confusing picture of what could have motivated the 64-year-old Paddock (one of the oldest mass shooters in modern history) to commit such an atrocity. In other words, these new details yield clues and prompt more questions than answers. A Vast Arsenal: Within Paddock’s hotel room and Mesquite retirement-community home, investigators discovered 42 firearms along with explosives and thousands of ammo rounds. Since Paddock didn’t have a criminal record, Nevada’s gun laws would allow him to amass such a collection, which included automatic rifles that may have been converted from semiautomatic weapons. His stash included “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles.” A Recent Retiree Who Gambled Big: According to brother Eric Paddock, Stephen — a recently retired accountant — spent much of his time in Vegas, where he regularly dropped tens of thousands of dollars in a day. Eric told reporters that “he was a gambler, that was his job,” and their family wasn’t concerned about how Stephen “lived in a hotel room” for months at a time. In the days leading up to the massacre, Paddock conducted a number of large transactions, although it’s not known whether these were wins or losses. Investigators noted, however, that Paddock could have lost a million dollars in Vegas, and it wouldn’t have impacted his lifestyle, which rules out a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion after losing big at a casino. A Quiet Multimillionaire Who Didn’t Flaunt His Wealth: Neighbors in Mesquite knew Paddock as a quiet man who referred to himself as a pro gambler. Although he was worth at least $2 million at the time of his death, Paddock’s unassuming presence — polos, khakis, and a simple car — didn’t attract attention, and he didn’t spend much time at home. That impression was aided by the fact that Paddock also owned properties in California, Florida, and Texas. In fact, the only detail of note for one Mesquite neighbor was that Paddock’s garage held an enormous safe, which may have been where he stored much of his arsenal. A “Normal, Average” Guy, According To A Gun Shop Owner: Chris Mitchel of Dixie GunWorx awoke to news of the mass shooting and felt completely gutted upon remembering that he had sold a shotgun (which was not used in the Vegas massacre, since Paddock’s targets were hundreds of yards from his Mandalay Bay window) to Paddock. Yet as Mitchel recalled, Paddock seemed like “a normal customer” — sort of a “Joe Blow” type of guy — who shopped with them a few times but never set off alarm bells. A Baffling Mystery Of Intent: While Paddock’s father sat atop the FBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted list for nearly a decade (in connection with bank robberies), Stephen never ran afoul of the law until Sunday night in Vegas. Eric Paddock still can’t wrap his head around why his brother — who publicly held no political or religious affiliation — would commit mass murder. “There’s absolutely no sense, no reason he did this,” said Eric. “He’s just a guy who played video poker and took cruises and ate burritos at Taco Bell.” Investigators will continue to dig into Stephen Paddock’s homes and affairs for some time to come, but all clues from Paddock’s hotel room indicate a meticulously planned act of mass murder. His long-time companion, Marilou Danney, was also out of the country this weekend, which may prevent her from providing additional insight into why her partner plotted such a horrific crime. So for now, the mystery deepens, but questions shall continue.

278,http://uproxx.com/life/gun-control-las-vegas-texas/,"On October 1, a gunman opened fire from a hotel room in Las Vegas — leaving 58 dead and 546 wounded. It was the worst mass shooting in American history, though you’d be forgiven for forgetting that. After all, the distance between mass shootings seems perfectly calibrated to fit our nation’s collective short-term memory: Day 1: “Thoughts and prayers.”
Days 2-7: “TOO SOON TO POLITICIZE!”
Days 8-14: “We have a lot to focus on as a nation; yes, this is an issue, but something something mental health and… Look over there! Is that a celebrity?!”
Days 15-34: “What shooting? Oh, that old thing? I can’t believe you even remember –”
Day 35: Rinse. Repeat. There were 35 days between Las Vegas and Sutherland, Texas. That seems particularly short, but not enough to shock me. Since I started at Uproxx on June 1, 2015, there have been eight mass shootings in the United States — including the #1 and #2 deadliest in history — so I’ve had plenty of chances to ponder the subject: Each of these pieces stimulated conversation about guns, their place in America, and the nation’s futile quest to have less violence while also refusing to enact meaningful legislative change. And in all of these conversations, I was taken to task over the terms with which I wrote about guns. Commenters chewed me to pieces over my wobbly usage of the phrases “semi-automatic weapon,” “high capacity clip,” and “assault rifle.” For what it’s worth, they were right. The layperson’s vision of a semi-automatic is a rapid-repeating rifle — something akin to an AR-15 — but most handguns today also fulfill the definition of semi-automatic, in that the user is not chambering cartridges manually. High capacity magazines are even more murky. AR (which stands for Armalite rifle, not “Assault Rifle”) magazines come standard at 30 rounds. So a “high capacity” AR magazine would be greater than 30 rounds, far exceeding the typical legislative definition of “high capacity magazines” in states where such laws have passed (which is usually set at 10 or 15 rounds). Even the term “assault rifle” is embedded with shades of gray. Though it seems like an easy catch-all term for non-gun types, the military definition of an assault rifle would actually exclude weapons like the AR-15 — since that gun doesn’t have a “selective fire” feature, which would allow it to be shot automatically or in burst mode. Even if you know guns, even if you’re cleared for CCW (carrying a concealed weapon) with a FFL (Federal Firearms License), you can see how the jargon of America’s most beloved toys can get disorienting. The terms are tricky and the scale for how they apply to different sized weapons is a sliding one — so it’s hard for lawmakers to create bills that don’t get quagmired in semantics. (Which explains why the NRA wisely pushes small laws that conspire together to achieve something bigger, rather than trying to enact sweeping change all at once.) The question then is this: Do you have to “get guns” to be a part of substantive conversations about weapons in this country? Can a confusion of terms or a jumbling of specs identify someone as not deserving a seat at the table when it comes time to talk gun control? Answer: Hell no. And yet, that’s the common retort, over and over. “Don’t know your Glock from your Desert Eagle? Go sit with the other hippies, while the adults talk.” The implication when you watch Tucker Carlson heckle a pro-gun reform writer  about his experience handling an AR-15 is simple: “People who don’t know about things from experience should not speak about them with any level of authority.” What a nice thought, especially from a man who talks about politics for a living without ever having held a public office. If only we could use Carlson’s idea as a gold standard for issues of abortion, the constitution, and religion. Alas, this is never going to happen. Because as Americans, there’s only one thing we value more than our beloved gun rights: Talking without having a complete handle on what in the world we’re talking about. Only a quarter of Americans know all three branches of government, but god knows that doesn’t stop us from holding (and sharing) strong convictions about them; our president has literally no idea where Puerto Rico is, but he’s still managing our disaster relief effort; and Idaho State Representative Vito Barbieri fights abortion tooth and nail without the ability to fathom that a woman’s digestive and reproductive tracts aren’t connected. Is it tragic that people with a knowledge gap still get to pop off on those issues of which they know little? That depends on how much power the uneducated parties have and how much knowledge is lacking. Discussing things is one of the ways that people learn about them. Debate, at its best, can be instructive. And inviting only experts to speak on issues that affect all of us is how those in power consolidate and horde it — remember that literacy tests were the ultimate voter suppression technique in the Jim Crow south. Besides, how much do you have to know about magazine sizes to declare with confidence that the website StackingBodies.com shouldn’t be allowed to sell a Surefire 100-round magazine via the internet? How versed in ballistics do you need to be to recognize that the AR-556 — used by Devin Patrick Kelley in Sutherland Springs — is a weapon for people who are trying to kill living things very efficiently in a non-sporting manner? Do you have to know the mechanics of trigger tension and bump stocks before you can feel confident stating that people should only own guns after applying for a license, passing a safety test, and filing for the legal title to their weapons (like we do with cars)?

At some point, asking people to parrot statistics to engage in the gun violence discussion is the ultimate straw man gambit: “Let’s pretend this conversation is about guns, and debate your authority to speak about them; rather than concede that this conversation is actually about human lives lost to guns.” When Tucker Carlson mocks gun-control activists because they don’t regularly handle the rifles they despise, he’s missing the point by light-years (while seeming absolutely assured of his moral high ground): You don’t have to know about something in order to not want to be killed by it. I know very little about how venom affects the body, but if someone wanted to let their pet cobra roam my yard, I feel like I could make a strong argument to the neighborhood association about why they shouldn’t be allowed to do so. Perhaps the metric for who should get to talk about certain subjects and what level of baseline knowledge is required should be linked to how much the topic in question affects us and the power being wielded by those doing the talking. Should I have had all my terms buttoned up before jumping into the gun-discussion on a platform this size? Probably. Should lawmakers be able to cite their facts about guns and talk about them with confidence on the Senate floor or to smug TV hosts? Yep. But do lay people need to understand the difference between a clip and a magazine in order to advocate, march, and call their representatives about gun control? That’s ridiculous. This is an issue that touches human lives, and humans have every right to respond to it. Sure, the conversation needs more active, involved, knowledgeable participants, but that knowledge might be about guns or it might be about utilitarian ethics (which often comes to bear on this topic). Besides, anyone who’s ever read up on the thousands of accidental shootings we have per year in this country knows that not even gun owners know much about their beloved weapons (like, for instance, how to make them inaccessible to toddlers). It’s been said that doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the very definition of insanity. Through this prism, it’d be hard to call our response to mass shootings anything less than insane. Our actions haven’t changed significantly in years and probably won’t this time around — but the suggestion that you have to know about guns in order to be repulsed by the destruction they wreak is yet another absurd roadblock thrown up by those interested in stalling the conversation. Will our nation change course after yet another mass shooting? Doubtful. But letting 2nd amendment loyalists twist the issue to make it about gun knowledge rather than a desire by gun safety advocates to have less people die pushes us into the theater of the bizarre and ought not be tolerated for a second. After all, it doesn’t take a working knowledge of hollow-tipped versus full metal jacket bullets to know that this Texas family didn’t deserve to have three generations decimated by them.",2017-12-04 16:00:43,You Don’t Have To Know About Guns To Fight For Stricter Gun Laws,"medicine and health,firearms,murders and attempted murders",68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

280,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/JARhVIUQFsw/,"We know that the horrific Las Vegas mass shooting that took place in October was carried out by Stephen Paddock, but some people feel that the gunman isn’t the only party at fault. “Bump stock” manufacturers are being sued, and now, so are Live Nation Entertainment — which hosted the Route 91 Harvest Festival where the shooting happened — and MGM Resorts International — the parent company of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the shooter was located. The Los Angeles Times reports that lawyers representing more than 450 victims filed multiple lawsuits in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, with the contention that concert officials and hotel staff did not do enough to prevent this tragedy from happening. Houston-based lawyer Chad Pinkerton summarized his view of the situation bluntly (via the Associated Press): “We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that. This was the largest venue security failure in US history.” The victims’ attorneys said on Monday that “the festival did not have adequate exits or properly trained employees for when the crowd began trying to evacuate, resulting in additional injuries and exposure to the gunman’s fire.” Pinkerton further detailed what he saw as shortcomings in how the situation was handled: “There was a decision made not to make that phone call to 911 immediately. My instinct tells me that’s going to be because they wanted to control the environment and control the message before the public and the media was involved. Certainly they didn’t know they were going to have an evil act such as this, but they could have anticipated it, they could have foreseen it.” MGM has responded to these legal actions, saying in a statement, “The incident that took place on Oct. 1 was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. These kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them. That said, out of respect for the victims, we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.” Live Nation declined to comment about the lawsuit, but said they’re cooperating with an active FBI investigation and expressed sorrow for the “countless people forever impacted by this senseless act of violence.” Read more about the shooting here, and find Jason Aldean’s first-person account of the event here.",2017-11-21 11:40:52,Live Nation And MGM Resorts Are Facing Lawsuits From Hundreds Of Las Vegas Mass Shooting Victims,"suits and litigation,crime and criminals",68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

In a statement, Chelsea Handler said it was her decision to end the show so that she could focus on political activism in the future. pic.twitter.com/fCrsdKBwkS Handler said that she will continue her partnership with Netflix by creating a documentary in which she will engage with people she does not speak to enough. Handler said this includes people of different ethnicities, religions, and political philosophies. Chelsea has made a name for herself as a prominent critic of the Trump administration and her newest comments against Sanders are just the latest in a long line of jabs at the White House. Chelsea's comments against Sanders come about 28 minutes into the latest episode of Chelsea, titled ""Dinner Party: Scandalous.""Chelsea Handler Blames Republicans For Texas Church ShootingChelsea Handler previously came under fire when she looked to Republicans as the cause for the horrific Texas shooting massacre. Handler blamed Republicans for the south Texas church shooting which left more than 20 people dead, according to Fox News. Many details about the massacre and the gunman's identity were still unclear after the deadly mass shooting. Following her comments, Handler received some major backlash.Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) November 5, 2017The liberal comedian, who hosts a talk show on Netflix, was assumed to be referring to Republican support for the Second Amendment and opposition to gun control legislation, per a Washington Times report. Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans. The former Chelsea host has gone after the GOP before on issues surrounding gun control.""Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.""At about noon on Sunday, a gunman opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, killing more than 20 people and leaving at least 10 people wounded, according to initial estimates from state and county officials. The numbers have yet to be confirmed by law enforcement. Chelsea Handler's comments received criticism throughout social media. Many chastised the star for politicizing the event while it was ongoing. One Twitter user wrote, ""Does your career depend on you being a vile, callous person, or is that a personal choice?"" While another commented, ""You are a terrible human being,"" and another added, ""Are you really that ignorant?"" Handler also posted a photo on Instagram demanding gun reform and discussing various mass shootings around the country including Virginia Tech, Tuscon, San Bernardino, Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, and more currently Sutherland Springs. Chelsea also went after President Donald Trump after he tweeted, ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The comedian responded in a negative manner to Trump by saying, ""You have no capacity to monitor anything that doesn't involve lining your pockets.""",2017-12-05 05:41:31,Chelsea Handler Fires Off Lewd Insults At Sarah Huckabee Sanders,"women,crime and criminals",26924,http://www.inquisitr.com
282,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2017/11/11/reactions-mass-shooting-texas,"By Letters to the Editor 1:30 PM on Nov 11, 2017 CST Re: ""'Horrific tragedy' — Gunman kills 26 congregants at Sunday service,"" Monday news story. Once again, I turn on the morning news. Once again, I hear of yet another horrific mass shooting, this time at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Once again, I am saddened by the anguish and grief on the faces of those who survived and of those who have lost loved ones. Once again, I hear the worn-out platitude, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with you."" Once again, I see a disgusting photo of the person who committed this hideous act. Once again, I hear the president say, ""It's too soon ... "" in regard to a possible ban on assault rifles. Once again. I see this. I am weary. My heart breaks. When, Mr. President? For God's sake, we have to do something! Polly J. Shaw, Denton What a sad day for the small town of Sutherland Springs. And what a sad day for this country that yet again we find ourselves offering prayers and condolences to those affected by gun violence. Earlier today, I read a piece in The Washington Post full of ideas to help heal our country. One of the suggestions was to require gun insurance — an idea I'd not heard before, but one I believe deserves attention. Apparently, Australia has instituted this. Just imagine if insurance companies were financially responsible for the violence inflicted by weapons they had insured. I imagine that criminal background checks and other forms of due diligence would be well-enforced, if profit-making enterprises had to put money on the table. I will be contacting my congressional representatives about this idea, but would love to see some information about this in The Dallas Morning News.  Eleanor Goodwin, Coppell Mass killings are now a fact of life in America. Stop sending condolences to the victims' families and friends. Stop thanking the heroic first-responders. It's sadly getting old. Just get used to it. John Nesbitt, Calgary, Canada Those who are criticizing President Trump's sending thoughts and prayers when those who were in the church in Sutherland Springs were probably in prayer miss the point. Trump was probably referring to prayers for the survivors and the families of the victims, that God give them strength to either recover or cope with their losses. Years ago, my son was shot, and on the way to the hospital in the ambulance silently prayed and asked God to let him live. He heard a voice say, ""You will live, my son."" And he did. The doctor told me afterward even with all the medical science, my son had had only a 20 percent chance of surviving. As people gave their prayers for my son and for me, I felt the strength of prayer as if hands were under my arms, lifting me up. My son did survive, and we both know the power of prayer. Kathy Smith, Northwest Dallas CORRECTION: This letter incorrectly said Kathy Smith had silently prayed to God to allow her son to live. It was her son who said that silent prayer. There was a time when a church was a place of safety or refuge, either by law or by convention, and at times people could ""hide"" in a church building. They considered themselves safe because no one would commit violence in a holy place. This idea of a safe haven has come under attack both literally in Texas and metaphorically around the world. It's not just a matter of who can have guns and certainly not the horrifying suggestion of bringing more guns for more safety. It's a worldwide issue of many people needing a place of safety and a right to be safe. We have a long way to go till we really feel safe. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia Well, here we are again. Twenty-six dead and a dozen seriously wounded just weeks after over 50 were killed and hundreds wounded in Las Vegas. I'm pleading for the women of our country to demand sensible gun legislation banning assault weapons, bump stocks and extend clips. We men will not do it; our testosterone-driven love of guns won't allow us to be sensible. I realize that people kill people, but assault weapons allow them to do it in mass and very efficiently. Often, this gun violence is done by a man and perpetrated against women and children as was this last case — a man apparently mad at his mother-in-law. Most of the dead were women and children. Our last hope to end this type of gun violence is for mothers, wives and sisters to say enough. Tell your men, tell your representatives and senators, that enough is enough. Guns were designed to kill, period. If you have one in your home, there is a higher probability that it will end up harming your child, a friend or you. How many more mass shootings will it take? How many innocent lives will it take? I hope if my mother, sister or nieces read this that they will call their representatives, NOW. Enough! Keith Jones, Dallas/Knox-Henderson So long as we love our guns more than we love our children, these massacres will continue. Michael Rosenthal, Plano These issues have seemingly become even more politicized than before, as Congress has struggled to pass a ban on bump stocks, like the one Stephen Paddock used during the incident in Las Vegas. The massacre in Sutherland Springs sparked even greater pressure from those in favor of gun control for politicians to do something about it. Personally, I am most upset that as a nation, we have become desensitized and complacent in watching these tragedies unfold. Even worse is the divisive nature that hovers above any conversation about gun control here. I do not believe that gun control should be a partisan issue. However, I do believe it is important that we thoroughly evaluate how we can prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future, whether or not that means banning certain weapons, or strengthening the vetting process for those attempting to purchase weapons. Oftentimes, as now, there are no clear answers, but as a country we must be willing to listen to one another, and collectively understand that gun violence is an issue that needs to be resolved in one way or another. Marissa Mosley, Arlington Seems every tragic event is simply another opportunity for majority of people to reinforce their existing beliefs. James C. Francis, Carrollton Re: ""We must plan how to stop the next killer — States shouldn't limit people's ability to protect against evil, says Ken Paxton,"" Wednesday Viewpoints. To my amazement, I find myself in complete agreement with Ken Paxton. If you start with the premise that there's no way of keeping even the most sophisticated and deadly firearms out of the hands of bad guys, then the only real solution is for the rest of us to arm ourselves to the teeth. We need to insist on our right to carry firearms in churches, schools, grocery stores, mass gatherings, nightclubs, courtrooms, police stations, even on private property. And we need to be vigilant in consistently carrying our arms everywhere we go, even to the bathroom. It only takes one time when we're not prepared. Obviously the police understand and agree completely, as they've adopted military preparation, tactics and firepower over the last several years. They want to be sure they are never surprised or outgunned by the bad guys. Merle Walker, Athens Believe it or not, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's nemesis, President Barack Obama, was spot-on in his assessment of small-town Midwesterners (well, Southwesterners; read: Texans), when he said ""they cling to guns."" Indeed, Paxton recommends Texas parishioners ought ""cling to their guns and their Bibles"" simultaneously, i.e., pack heat at the church house. So, let us pray. ""God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our bullets"" or ""Give us this day our daily lead."" Amen. Kelly Akins, Dallas/Preston Hollow Like all Texans, I am deeply saddened by the events that took place in Sutherland Springs on Sunday. As of this writing, 26 people are confirmed dead. I called all three of my representatives Monday morning and asked one simple question: Can you give me the bill numbers for legislation my representative has either authored or sponsored since the Las Vegas shooting that relate gun violence? Rep. Michael McCaul: Nothing 
Sen. John Cornyn: Nothing 
Sen. Ted Cruz: Nothing   Nothing. Nothing has been done, or even attempted by these men. Over the years, I have petitioned my representatives, I have donated money, I have written articles and I have voted to enact common-sense gun regulation. That's a hell of a lot more than my elected officials have done. They have done nothing. Absolutely nothing. So here we are, once again. Senseless, horrific violence facing us, and once again, we will do nothing. I can only hope that Cruz, Cornyn and McCaul have deep difficultly sleeping at night, wrestling with the guilt that their continued inaction has contributed to the slaughter of 26 Texans, while they sit idly by, doing nothing.

Hundreds of victims of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted, and the killer’s estate. The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who either were injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc., the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on October 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp., which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock's activities, train staff members, and employ adequate security measures. The festivalgoers also accused Live Nation of being negligent, saying it failed to provide adequate exits and properly train staff members for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed Monday was brought by a college student named Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter's estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real-estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock's estate is set for December 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump-stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting but not in any of the suits filed Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. ""We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun-rights case,"" he said.

286,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/nj_moves_closer_to_banning_this_gun_accessory_used.html,"A ""bump stock"" is shown attached to a semi-automatic rifle.(Rick Bowmer | The Associated Press) New Jersey on Thursday got one step closer to banning a firearms accessory allegedly used by the gunman in the Las Vegas mass shooting. The state Assembly's law and public safety committee voted 8-0, with one abstention, to advance a Democrat-sponsored bill that would prohibit the sale and possession of ""bump stocks"" in the state. Bump stocks can be affixed to semiautomatic riffles to allow them to fire bullets more rapidly, mimicking automatic weapons, which are mostly illegal in the U.S. A fierce national debate over the accessory emerged in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre. The gunman had 12 of the devices in his hotel room, allegedly helping him to kill 58 people and injure 500 more in a matter of minutes. WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO: The legislation (S3477/A5200) would prohibit the sale and possession of bump stocks in New Jersey and set up criminal penalties for those who violate the ban. Violators could face three to five years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. WHAT PROPONENTS SAY: Sponsors of the bill say there's no need for anyone in New Jersey to be able to mimic automatic fire. ""Our law enforcement officials and residents will be in greater danger if they are allowed in New Jersey,"" Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, D-Union -- a sponsor -- said Thursday. Dolores Phillips, legislative director for gun-control group Ceasefire New Jersey, added: ""We are not under any illusion this bill will solve mass shootings. But it's a step forward."" WHAT OPPONENTS SAY: The biggest argument is that bump stocks are already technically illegal to use in New Jersey. While you're permitted to sell, buy, and own them, state law prohibits people from possessing them if they are used on a firearm or in the vicinity of a firearm. ""There really isn't a whole lot for this bill to do,"" Rob Nixon of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs said Thursday. ""This isn't really a New Jersey-related issue."" This measure would create an outright ban on the accessories and make it a third-degree crime with specific punishments. Alexander Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, added that people can still use 3D printers to create their own bump stocks. ""It's grandstanding on the issue,"" Roubian said of the bill. THE VOTE: All six Democrats on the panel voted in favor Thursday. Two of the three Republicans voted yes: Michael Patrick Carroll of Morris County and Edward Thomson of Monmouth County. Republican Erik Peterson of Hunterdon County abstained. WHAT'S NEXT: For the bill to become law, the full Assembly and state Senate -- both of which are controlled by Democrats -- must pass it and the governor must sign it. Republican Chris Christie will be governor until Jan. 16. He has often opposed new gun laws in the state, but he said last month he'd be open to ""further regulations"" on bump stocks, noting that ""it's an accessory ... not a gun. It's not an infringement on anybody's Second Amendment rights."" Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @johnsb01. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.

287,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/14/how-to-fight-extremist-hate-and-violence-start-by-pulling-out-politics-experts-say/,"Trending: LOS ANGELES — Removing polarization and politics from the conversation might be the key to stopping homegrown violent extremism, experts said Tuesday, Nov. 14, as they attempted to deconstruct a problem that has flummoxed cities and nations around the world. “The extremist mindset is all about positing superiority over another,” said Sasha Havlicek, director of the London-based Institute of Strategic Dialogue, speaking at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Global Summit on Homegrown Violent Extremism. “The ‘othering’ of people, the dehumanizing of groups of people, is the precursor to mass murder and turns mentally able people into killers.” While governments and non-governmental organizations have tried programs to counter violent extremism, experts view such efforts as a narrow approach to a much larger problem. “People don’t start out as lone wolves, they start out angry and bitter,” said Tony McAleer, co-founder of Life After Hate, a support group for former extremists. Before he started working to pull people away from violence, McAleer was a skinhead recruiter and manager of a white supremacist rock band, Odin’s Law. McAleer compared himself to Dylann Roof, the self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who in 2015 gunned down nine people at the Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., ostensibly to start a race war. “He had rage, which is a big part of the radicalization process,” McAleer said. “He found an ideology that gave him justification, which is what I did.” Dehumanizing others is also one of the first baby steps extremists take, McAleer said. “But it’s important to understand that we dehumanize others because we feel dehumanized ourselves,” he said. “In the neo-Nazi movement, I found power where I was powerless and found acceptance where there was none.” What’s even more frightening in today’s world is the mainstreaming of extremism, said Havlicek, whose organization partners with the Newport Beach Gen Next Foundation, a group of entrepreneurs who help connect grass-roots organizations with resources that provide alternative ideas for people who might be susceptible to radicalization. “Different variants of these extremist ideologies are on the rise and playing a symbiotic role with each other,” Havlicek said. “For example, the Islamist and far-right extremists are wonderfully mobilizing each other’s fan bases.” She noted that the far right has started to use terms such as “white jihad,” which mirrors the terminology favored by people in Islamist jihad or “holy war.” Experts at USC also spent time discussing the differences between a “terrorist attack” and a “mass shooting.” “If there is no clear ideology at work, I’m not counting those as homegrown terrorism,” said Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent and director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at USC’s Safe Communities Institute. But Southers noted that the nearly three out of four deadly extremist attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, have been perpetrated by white supremacists. The Trump administration’s version of the Countering Violent Extremism program, which has been widely criticized for its focus on Islamist extremism, won’t help address the issue of radicalization, some experts said. “If you use the words ‘radical Islamic extremism,’ you’ve lost me and you’ve lost my community,” said Mohamed Amin Ahmed, a Somali refugee who founded Average Mohamed, an organization that promotes counterterrorism through cartoons and by speaking directly to Muslim youths. Ahmed says when he speaks to young people, he uses the word “intolerance” instead of “terrorism.” “Our children are fatigued by that word,” Ahmed said. “As soon as I say it they think ‘he’s going to tell us we’re bad people.’ ” But Ahmed also emphasized that government has an important role to play in countering extremism, especially when it comes to providing resources to grass-roots organizations such as his and to help them “scale up” their message. Southers suggested there is no single solution to homegrown extremism and the violence it often inflicts. “We cannot arrest our way out of this problem,” he said. “The successful programs, in countries like Germany and the United Kingdom, involve a range of approaches, from prosecution to counseling and everything in between. It depends on where the individual is on the radicalization pathway. Can we involve that person’s family members, friends or co-workers? Can we counsel them out of this mindset?” Get the latest news delivered daily! We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

289,https://www.inquisitr.com/4627865/the-punisher-showrunner-talks-mass-shootings-effects-on-his-marvel-netflix-series/,"Initially, the Marvel Netflix series, The Punisher, had a planned surprise release in October, as well as a special screening of the first episode at the New York City Comic-Con event. Marvel and Netflix chose to postpone the debut and cancel the screening after the tragic shootings in Las Vegas. Now, one day before the official release of The Punisher Marvel Netflix series, Wired reported that showrunner Steve Lightfoot spoke out about the shootings taking place across the United States and the effects they have on his new comic book series.Mass Shootings Effects On The PunisherWhen Marvel Comics and Netflix announced that they canceled the New York City Comic-Con screening of The Punisher and postponed the release on Netflix, showrunner Steve Lightfoot said he agreed with the decision. Newsday reported at the time that a statement indicated that it wasn't appropriate to release the series in the wake of the senseless tragedy in Las Vegas. Now, one month later, The Punisher hits Netflix as the seventh season of Marvel entertainment on the streaming service. This series follows The Defenders, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones and two seasons of Daredevil. The Punisher made his first appearance in the second season of Daredevil. However, The Punisher also comes out just two weeks after another senseless mass shooting where a man killed 26 people and wounded 20 more in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Fifty-eight people died with over 500 injured in the Las Vegas shooting last month. When asked if the shootings made it the wrong time to make a show like The Punisher, Steve Lightfoot said that these shootings never factored into the creation of the series. They began working on making the Marvel Netflix series last year, before the U.S. presidential election. In 2017, there is an average of one mass shooting every day in the United States; making it hard to find a time that is suitable to release a television show about the Marvel Comics character that has an arsenal of guns and kills his enemies. [Image by Netflix] What Is The Punisher Really About?When talking about The Punisher, both Steve Lightfoot and actor Jon Bernthal have their own ideas, and it isn't about gun violence in America. Lightfoot, who also worked on another series about a damaged individual in Hannibal, said that mass shootings and gun control have nothing to do with the story he is telling. Jon Bernthal was a little more to the point in an interview with the L.A. Times, Bernthal said that the series is not about the exploitation of gun violence in America. Instead, it is about Frank Castle, the man who is The Punisher, and how he deals with the ""unbelievable pain and... unbelievable cost to the violence that he's gone through in life."" Instead of a Marvel Netflix series about gun violence in America, Bernthal said that The Punisher is about how a person deals with personal pain. He also noted that The Punisher is not a hero, and if anyone looks at him as a hero, he has ""failed miserably"" in his job as an actor.

Lesser says in the suit, which was filed in L.A. Superior Court, that adequate and safe exits were not set up for the Emmys at the Microsoft Theater. Her fall caused her to miss the HBO after-party and take an eight month leave to recover, according to the filing. The suit names the Television Academy, the City of Los Angeles and Anshutz Entertainment as defendants in the case, stating the organizations should have known from past experience leaving the show would be ""throng-like"" for guests, ""which would create extreme congestion and severely diminish any forward visibility and certainly diminish and preclude visibility of conditions that may exist on the walkway itself."" Also Read: HBO Hacker Charged Over $6 Million Extortion Attempt, 'Game of Thrones' Script Leak Also Read: HBO Hacker Charged Over $6 Million Extortion Attempt, 'Game of Thrones' Script Leak The HBO exec said in the suit that because of ""the fashion of the day"" and women wearing high heels, the ""entire walkway area should be properly illuminated to give the best visibility to all of the attendees and other persons using the walkway to which they were directed to go to the Governor's Ball or the celebrity and limousine parking."" Lesser described not being able to see a dirt cut-out in concrete when she tried to leave via a side exit to avoid the ""throng"" of people leaving by the red carpet. ""These concrete cut-outs were with dirt and trees, the poor lighting of the area and the creation of a throng of people overloading the walkway that attendees were directed to were each a dangerous condition created by defendants and each by themselves, and together, caused the plaintiff's accident to occur,"" the lawsuit reads. She ended up falling backwards and injuring her right hip, causing her to miss HBO's large after-party, which she coordinated, according to the lawsuit. Lesser spent two weeks at Cedars-Sinai hospital and needed 24 hour care preventing her from her work at HBO, it went on to say. Lesser is suing for negligence and is seeking upward of $1 million in damages to cover her medical costs. 14 Shows Delayed or Changed Because of Real-World Violence, From 'Mr Robot' to 'Heathers' (Photos)






It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10. Will the network make changes around the episode? Here TheWrap recalls 12 other shows that have altered programming in the face of real-world violence.






40th Annual Academy Awards  
The awards show was originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, but was postponed two days out of respect for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  who was assassinated four days earlier.

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Joss Whedon supernatural drama was affected not once but twice by real world events, specifically the Columbine massacre. The show's third season had two episodes that featured school violence. One, called ""Earshot,"" featured a plot concerning a student who goes to the top of a tower with a rifle. It was set to run a week after Columbine, but was pulled and postponed.

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Season 3 finale ""Graduation Day, Part Two"" also featured violence on school grounds. Specifically (and spoilers for a nearly 20-year-old episode), the school is destroyed. Two hours before it was set to air, the WB postponed the episode, fearing fallout from Columbine. The finale's airing was delayed for two months, but fans were furious about the decision and the network ended up posting it online.

53rd Annual Emmy Awards  
That year's Primetime Emmys were set to air on Sept. 16, 2001, but the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 caused it to be postponed. The awards were postponed a second time after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. The ceremony was eventually held in November, with Ellen Degeneres hosting, but it still marks the first and only time a major awards show had to be postponed twice.

""Alternatino with Arturo Castro"" is the latest show impacted by stories on the news.

It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10. Will the network make changes around the episode? Here TheWrap recalls 12 other shows that have altered programming in the face of real-world violence.

292,http://uproxx.com/news/las-vegas-shooter-home-explosives-ammo/,"Following the Las Vegas mass shooting that left 59 people dead and over 525 injured, countless details began to pour forth on Stephen Paddock. The 64-year-old gunman, a white male who carried out the attack alone, reportedly used the credit card of his “companion,” Marilou Danley, to book his 32nd-floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay Resort. And at Paddock’s home — situated within a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada — authorities uncovered a sobering amount of weaponry to add to what he toted to Vegas. When Paddock was located by authorities (after one confusing timeline), police found over 23 firearms, including some that were fully automatic, according to the Wall Street Journal. Police reported that the room contained “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles” and a wealth of ammunition. In Paddock’s home and car, investigators found more guns and some explosives: Investigators searching Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev., retrieved 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition, Las Vegas police officials said Monday. The sheriff said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets and is used in target practice. In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosive, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. CNN confirms the number of total firearms (42) within Paddock’s known arsenal. In addition, investigators are digging into whether the automatic rifles used in the massacre were “converted from semiautomatic guns or purchased that way.” Beyond that, it’s difficult to imagine how someone acquired so many firearms without setting off alarm bells, but Paddock didn’t have a criminal record to deter his pursuit. While his hunting license in Alaska still wouldn’t explain the cache, Nevada’s gun laws don’t make it difficult to build a collection.

The second tweet said it was great to be back in the USA — like the famous Chuck Berry tune — and was a positive way to end his Asian adventure. But it was unfortunately undermined by the preceding tweet sent from the president’s account that sent condolences about the wrong mass shooting. While sending well wishes to the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas is a good thing for the president to do, the shooting did happen close to a week ago. Not mentioned is Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California that left five dead and ten injured after a domestic dispute, though most hope that the president just make a slight mistake. The tweet was still live as of publication, staying live for at least two hours that led to plenty of speculation for people online who had dreams of covfefe dancing through their heads. While the response to this gaffe doesn’t seem to be as large, you could also chalk it up to the general exhaustion with the Trump parade at this point.

The accident took place on November 17 on Homestead and Highway 160, and has left Denise McClellan, Roy's widow, heartbroken and angry. According to the widow McClellan, she doesn't understand why her husband's life was spared during the October 1 mass shooting, only to be taken so tragically just weeks later.'This isn't what I wanted for him. I don't understand why he wasn't taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he's safe now.""Roy McClellan was reportedly walking along the highway when he was hit by an as-yet-unknown person driving a Camaro. As News 3 LV reported at the time of the accident, police were initially seeking a 2010-2013 Chevrolet Camaro, based on car parts found at the scene, and investigators informed the public to be on the lookout for a vehicle with left front-end damage. They stated that the victim (later identified as McClellan) was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, which took place at roughly 1:30 a.m on November 17. Police also made it known that Roy McClellan had been illegally walking, likely hitchhiking, on the roadway at the time of the hit-and-run.The driver of the Camaro was later tracked down, and according to Roy McClellan's widow, she believes that they deliberately left her husband to die alone on the side of the Nevada highway because they were either ""under the influence of something or drunk,"" reports KATU 2. Nevada authorities have not confirmed that drugs or alcohol had anything to do with the deadly crash that ended McClellan's life just weeks after the Las Vegas mass shooting.""I'm angry. I'm angry. I feel that he was under the influence of something or drunk and didn't want to get caught, so he bailed and left my husband laying there in the street. He doesn't deserve that.""Charges are reportedly pending against the driver in the fatal hit-and-run. It is unclear what led Roy McClellan to be hitchhiking just weeks after the deadly Las Vegas mass shooting. What is more clear is the devastating toll the mass shooting had on the 52-year-old. Roy and Denise McClellan reportedly attended the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival together and were both in the 20,000-strong crowd when bullets began to ring out on October 1. As hundreds of rounds were unleashed, allegedly by ""lone wolf"" gunman Stephen Paddock from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay, the couple ran for their lives. According to Denise, her husband stopped to help others in the crowd as the pair fled gunfire. Denise McClellan added that the aftermath of the shooting had been difficult for her husband psychologically. She claimed that being a Las Vegas shooting survivor had begun ""messing with his head,"" going on to say that Roy had been attending therapy as a result of the trauma he endured.A Las Vegas man survives the Route 91 shooting massacre, only to die in hit-and-run crash.

The impact caused the car to burst into flames, killing both Las Vegas mass shooting survivors less than a month after the concert attack.

295,https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-charleston-loophole-the-us-tried-taking-guns-from-over-4000-people-who-werent-supposed-to-have-them-6776177,"News  One of the strongest gun control measures in the United States is the FBIâs National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Though the process seems relatively simple â federally licensed gun dealers run a potential gun buyer's name through the FBI's database before selling them a firearm â it isn't foolproof. A problem becoming known as the ""Charleston loophole"" is putting guns in the hands of Americans who aren't allowed to have them. In fact, it's the very same loophole that allowed a white supremacist to buy a gun in 2015, which he later used to murder nine churchgoers in Charleston. ""There are so many things in federal gun law that are absurd, and this is definitely one at the top of the list,"" Laura Cutilletta, an attorney at the Giffords Law Center To Prevent Gun Violence, tells Bustle of the ""Charleston loophole."" NICS was established in 1993 under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, and it's meant to identify people who are legally prohibited from purchasing guns. This includes convicted felons, people who've been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, undocumented immigrants, people with domestic violence convictions, and more. When a name is fed into NICS, the FBI conducts a background check and reports back to the gun dealer on whether or not the sale is legal. Here's the loophole: If a gun dealer doesn't hear back from the FBI within three days of requesting a background check, they're allowed to sell the gun to the buyer anyway. Unlike some loopholes, this isn't some accidental consequence of carelessly written legislation; rather, it's explicitly detailed both in federal law and on the FBI's website. Gun sales like this, which are made even though the buyer hasn't passed a background check, are known as ""default proceeds."" Usually, this doesn't happen. FBI data says that in 2015, over 90 percent of background checks produced an immediate response. Only around 3.02 percent of background checks that year resulted in default proceeds, which sounds like a relatively small number â but on an absolute scale, it means that 371,000 Americans were allowed to buy guns that year without having passed a background check. More to the point, 2,892 of those gun buyers were later found to have been legally prohibited from owning guns. It's unclear what these people did that should have disqualified them from buying guns, as the FBI doesn't release such detailed data. In total, though, 43 percent of people who failed background checks in 2015 â and that includes folks who were successfully blocked from buying a gun â failed because they'd been ""convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year or a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years."" Another 19 percent couldn't pass a background check because they were a ""fugitive from justice,"" while about 10 percent had either a conviction or restraining order stemming from a domestic violence accusation. More details on this are available in the FBI's 2015 report on gun sales. When someone falls through the cracks in this manner and buys a gun they're not allowed to own, the FBI orders the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to retrieve the weapon. USA Today reported on Monday that in 2016, the FBI issued over 4,000 orders to seize weapons from buyers who fell through the Charleston loophole that year. That's the most seizure orders the agency has issued in a decade, according to FBI data. In 2015, someone who failed a background check but was allowed to buy a gun went on to commit a mass shooting. The white supremacist convicted of carrying out the 2015 Charleston church massacre had previously been convicted of possessing a controlled substance, which legally prohibited him from buying a gun. When he tried to buy a handgun, his name was fed into the NICS; thanks to a bureaucratic mix-up, however, the system didn't detect his conviction within the three-day window. ""The investigator had called the wrong county to look into this person's background,"" Cutilletta explains to Bustle. ""They never got a response, and meanwhile, the three days elapsed, and the gun was [sold] by default."" The buyer then used that gun to murder nine people. He later said said that he did this in hopes of igniting a race war, and has since been sentenced to death. In 2017, Democrats in the House and Senate introduced legislation to close the Charleston loophole. However, Republicans control both chambers, and GOP leadership hasn't put either bill up for a vote. In general, Congress has been incredibly reluctant to pass any form of gun control, largely due to opposition from Republican officials. Luckily for gun control advocates, though, state lawmakers also have a say in how background checks are conducted. As of 2015, at least 15 states plus Washington D.C. have enacted legislation that gives law enforcement more time to conduct background checks before gun dealers are allowed to proceed with a sale, according to Everytown Research. Delaware enacted a similar law the next year. ""It's easier to get things done at the state level, and unfortunately, that's what's had to happen,"" Cutilletta tells Bustle. As long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress, it's unlikely that background check laws will be strengthened any time soon on the federal level. But there's much more room for progress at the state level, which means your advocacy can make a difference. If you want to close the loophole and promote a stricter background check process, vote pro-reform canidates into state office at every possible election.

The drawing showed a schoolhouse on fire as a man shoots with his gun. The 33-year-old, Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, allegedly drew the horrifying scene in the student's notebook. Edwards in his drawing also illustrated two people shot on the ground lying in a pool of blood. The words, ""Pew, Pew, Pew,"" were written next to the person with the gun who was shown shooting at people standing in a queue. There was another person depicted in the picture who was on fire next to the words ""AHHH! It burns!"" Sheriff Mike Harrison, from Gulf County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of Edwards who has been charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 — written threat to kill or do bodily injury. According to the press release by Sheriff Harrison, the investigation sparked after a staff at the Port St. Joe Elementary School saw the illustration and contacted the School Resource Deputy about the alarming picture drawn on a student’s homework assignment. It is said that the drawing clearly showed a school building on fire, a person running from the school on fire, and several others who are shown standing in a queue were being shot by a gunman.  Sheriff Harrison said: ""Our country has been affected one too many times with horrific school tragedies. We take matters like this very seriously."" The case has been investigated jointly by the Sheriff and officials with Gulf District Schools. Investigators thoroughly interviewed Edwards. According to the release the department also explained that although the actions illustrated in the drawing were taken seriously, there was no indication that he would carry out the threat as depicted. Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, was arrested and charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 - Written threat to kill or do bodily injury — as he drew a disturbing image on an elementary school student’s homework. However, it is not known if Edwards had any connection with the student or how he got the student’s homework assignment notebook. In another incident in 2012, a teenage student was student arrested as his drawing demonstrated concerning behavior. A 16-year-old boy from Cedar Creek High School in Galloway Township, New Jersey, made illustrations in his notebook that appeared to be weapons. After a teacher noticed the drawing in the student’s notebook, the school authority contacted the police. The student was taken to the Galloway Township Police Department. Later, during the investigation, police searched the boy’s home on the 300 block of East Spencer Lane where they found several electronic parts and chemicals which if mixed together, could cause an explosion. The teenager whose name was not disclosed was charged with possession of a weapon and an explosive device. He was placed in Haborfields Juvenile Detention Center. According to a report in CBS Philly, speaking about the incident, the Superintendent of the Greater Egg Harbor Regional High School District, Steven Ciccariello said, ""This is a perfect example of a teacher implementing her training. She saw drawings that appeared disturbing to her and alerted school officials.""",2017-12-04 05:18:17,Mass Shooting Drawing Scene On Florida Student's Homework Lands Man In Jail,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

Aldean was the headlining performer when a gunman opened fire at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday, Oct. 1. (Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File) (Amy Harris/Invision/AP) Jason Aldean is speaking out in his first interview since the mass shooting in Las Vegas that occurred during one of his shows. Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show, Aldean, who was on stage when a gunman opened fire on the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, said that he initially thought a speaker had blown when he heard a sound like a crackling over his in-ear monitors. After the shooting continued, he looked over to the side of the stage to figure out what was going on. ""When I turned to look, my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, like 'Let's go,'"" Aldean said. ""And my security guy was running on stage telling me to run."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino. SWAT teams with explosives then stormed his room and found he had killed himself. ""Everyone was scrambling, just didn't know what was going on,"" Aldean said. ""It was panic. That's probably the best way to describe it."" The country star cancelled some of his tour dates, but resumed touring about two weeks after the shooting. ""Honestly being back on stage probably helped us more than anything,"" he said. Aldean did not address gun control in the interview. ""At the end of the day, we're all in this together,"" Aldean said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time like working on the issue that is really the problem."" Aldean was joined in the interview by fellow country stars Dierks Bentley and Lady Antbellum, who were all gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday to raise money for hurricane and Las Vegas victims. The Country Rising concert, which also featured performances by George Strait and Chris Stapleton, raised more than $4 million for relief efforts. ""I just hope everybody can start to heal,"" Aldean said. ""Some of this stuff you can never get over. I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.

298,http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/nra-pro-gun-lawmaker-exchange-fire-new-bill,"Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie butted heads with the National Rifle Association Thursday over a new bill in Congress that addresses deficiencies in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database of people who are not allowed to buy firearms in America. The NRA, which has given more than $4,500 to Massie’s campaigns, said on its website the congressman was spreading misinformation about the bipartisan bill. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas has sponsored the legislation alongside Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York. The bill creates financial incentives for law enforcement to prevent guns from being sold to people with disqualifying criminal or mental histories. It also re re-emphasizes the need for federal and state agencies to upload these histories to the NICS so that Federal Firearms Licensees can check instantly whether a prospective buyer is qualified to purchase a gun. Congress renewed interest in strengthening NICS and its feeder requirements after it was discovered that the gunman in the mass shooting at a church in Southerland Springs, Texas, obtained guns after a 2014 domestic violence conviction because the Air Force did not properly report  the case. The conviction should have barred him from gun ownership. Massie, a staunch pro-gun advocate, said in a Dec. 2 Facebook post that the legislation is an extension of former President Barack Obama’s anti-gun agenda because it “[pressures] every branch of the administration (such as the Veteran’s Administration) to submit thousands of more names to the NICS background check database to deny gun purchases.” The NRA said on its website that Massie’s post contains misleading information. Watch: 10 Years of Congressional Efforts on Gun Control The bill does not expand disqualifications for gun ownership, the powerful gun lobbying group said. Rather, it simply requires that federal agencies submit the names of criminal offenders or people with mental health circumstances that disqualify them from owning a firearm. “This differs from former President Obama’s efforts, in which he attempted to administratively create new categories of individuals who were prohibited from possessing a firearm,” the NRA web page says. Massie is the only member of Congress the NRA has called out for withholding support from the bill. “It’s an odd day in Washington, D.C., when the NRA supports legislation backed by Sens. (Diane) Feinstein and Schumer,” Massie told the Louisville Courier-Journal.",2017-12-08 10:37:40,"NRA, Pro-Gun Lawmaker Exchange Fire Over New Bill",,19854,http://www.rollcall.com
299,http://www.mlive.com/tv/index.ssf/2017/11/does_the_punisher_promote_gun.html,"""The Punisher"" premiered on Netflix, and the series holds 67 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans are excited about the action-packed series, but critics argue ""The Punisher"" glorifies gun violence. Others add that the character is the epitome of white male privilege and speaks to the issue of white male terrorists in America. The Punisher is a vigilante who takes violent revenge on criminals. No one else would be able to get away with that. What do you think? Below is the synopsis of ""The Punisher,"" per IMDB. Check out the trailer below, and tell us by voting if you think the series promotes gun violence. Some critics complained the series is too long, but there's no denying Jon Bernthal's charisma as the Punisher. The Wrap's Phil Owen writes: Some critics have been calling out the Punisher's exact depiction of white male privilege. Only a white dude can become a vigilante who shoots up bad guys in the name of justice. Regardless if his victims are criminals, many would agree the Punisher shouldn't be taking such violent ""justice"" into his own hands. And more importantly, some argue the Punisher speaks to the mental illness narrative that American society uses to justify white male shooters. ""The Punisher"" is just bad timing, and the series may never be appropriate in an America that struggles with gun reform. The Wired's Gaeme McMillan writes: The Tylt is focused on debates and conversations around news, current events and pop culture.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)  By DON THOMPSON and PAUL ELIAS The Associated Press RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE — A Northern California man killed two neighbors with whom he had been feuding before he went on a shooting rampage Tuesday at apparent random sites — including an elementary school that successfully locked him out — in a series of attacks where he killed two more people and injured 10 before police fatally shot him, officials said. Police said surveillance video shows the shooter unsuccessfully trying to enter a nearby elementary school after quick-thinking staff members locked the outside doors and barricaded themselves inside when they heard gunshots. The shooter Tuesday morning in Rancho Tehama was being prosecuted for assault stemming from an attack on neighbors in January and possession of an assault weapon. Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said the gunman spent about six minutes shooting into Rancho Tehama Elementary School before driving off to continue shooting elsewhere. Johnston said one student was shot and injured and is expected to survive. “It was a bizarre and murderous rampage,” Johnston said. He said the 45-minute spree ended when a patrol car rammed the stolen vehicle the shooter was driving and killed him in a shootout. Johnston said the shooter was facing charges of assaulting one of the feuding neighbors in January and that she had a restraining order against him. “I think the motive of getting even with his neighbors and when it went that far — he just went on a rampage,” Johnston said. He said there was a “domestic violence” report Monday involving the gunman, but didn’t provide any further details. At least one of the victims has life-threatening injuries, he said. Johnston declined to identify the shooter until his relatives were notified, but he confirmed the gunman was charged with assault in January and had a restraining order placed against him. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee he is prosecuting a man named Kevin Neal in that case. Kevin Janson Neal was arrested Jan. 31 and booked into Tehama County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Red Bluff Daily News. Neal was due to stand trial on charges of second-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment by violence, discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, possession of an assault weapon and misdemeanor battery, records show. Court documents list Neal as owning an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, but it is not known whether it was used in Tuesday’s shootings. Tehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen said Neal had a long-running dispute with his neighbors and during the January incident allegedly shot through a wooden fence at two female neighbors as they walked along the fence. Neal then jumped the fence, confronted the women, stabbed one and took a cellphone from the other, Cohen said. Neal’s mother, in Raleigh, N.C., told The Associated Press he called her Monday and told her “it’s all over now.” The woman, who would only be identified as Anne, said her son was frustrated by constant feuding with his neighbors and told her “I’m on a cliff and there’s nowhere to go.” She said he told her he believed the neighbors were cooking methamphetamine.

The latest details come from his ex-wife, Tessa Brennaman, as she gave her first interview to Inside Edition. The details are grim, as it shows an angry and aggressive past for the Texas gunman. According to CBS News, Brennaman, who was the first wife of Devin Kelley, said that she lived in constant fear of him. During the interview, she said that Kelley ""had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him."" In 2013, Kelley pleaded guilty to hitting, choking, kicking, and pulling her hair. At the time, when Kelley was a 23-year-old Air Force airman, he admitted to fracturing the skull of Brennaman's young son. During the interview, Tessa described the marriage as being filled with abuse. She said she was once threatened over a speeding ticket.""And he had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out, and he put it to my template and he told me, 'Do you want to die? Do you want to die?'""Because of the guilty plea, Kelley was sentenced to one year in a military prison. This was followed up by a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force. Brennaman also went on to say that Kelley threatened to not only kill her, but to kill her whole family.  Earlier this week, the Air Force did acknowledge that they did not properly notify the FBI regarding Devin Kelley's conviction. If the FBI would have been notified, it would have barred Devin Kelley from purchasing the firearms he used in the attack on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Of course, this has been a topic of interest on both sides of the aisle. [Image by David J. Phillip/AP Images] As hard as it may be to do, the community is trying to rally together and move past this terrible tragedy. This Sunday, there will be a service of healing one block from the First Baptist Church. Also, funerals have begun for the 26 victims of the mass shooting. On Thursday, there was a private service at a San Antonio-area Air Force base for Scott and Karen Marshall, a husband and wife who both served in the military. A spokesman for the 12th Flying Training Wing said that more than 500 people attended the service. As of Friday, 11 people remained hospitalized with wounds from the shooting.

302,https://www.thewrap.com/heres-how-greys-anatomy-addresses-social-issues-that-matter/,"The Shondaland show featured same-sex marriage long before it was legal in the U.S. Grey's Anatomy ""Grey's Anatomy"" has a way of pulling at our heartstrings, but it also has a way of keeping its pulse on hot-button issues like gay marriage and gun control, not mention the way feminism and civil rights are engrained in nearly every story. The show uses its specific brand of tear-jerking to address these issues without putting itself of a soap box. Who didn't cry along with Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) when hospital shooter Gary shot intern Charles Percy (Robert Baker)? And who didn't shed a few happy tears at the site of Callie and Arizona, both in white wedding dresses, tying the knot years before same-sex marriage was legalized across the United States? Now, I've been known to wax poetic on the glories of ""Grey's"" and its heroine, but after a week when we saw yet another shooting at an elementary school, and when Australia legalized same-sex marriage, it seems the perfect time to explore how the show tackles them. Also Read: ABC's 'TGIT' Lineup Gets Midseason Premiere Date Also Read: ABC's 'TGIT' Lineup Gets Midseason Premiere Date Feminism Let's start with how ""Grey's"" empowers women. The center of the show and titular character Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) has several famous relationships throughout the 14 seasons, most specifically her relationship and marriage with Derek ""McDreamy"" Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). But as the show currently stands -- and has for several seasons now -- Meredith is on her own. She had a cautious relationship with Dr. Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson), but encouraged him to return to love-of-his-life Megan Hunt (Abigail Spencer) once she was found to still be alive. This selflessness shows that Mer doesn't need a man to be happy. She's surrounded by people who love her -- Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Maggie (Kelly McCreary) and Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) -- is a dedicated mother and a talented surgeon. She knew true love, and that's enough for her. She doesn't need to keep chasing it. One great example of Meredith standing up for herself -- and being a great role model in the process -- is when she learns she's not earning equal pay back in Season 12. The incident is treated as it might present itself in real life: Meredith finds out offhand, and spends much of the episode nervous about approaching her boss, asking around to see what salary she should ask for. It's empowering to watch Meredith eventually steam past the anxiety and get what she deserves: a raise. Also Read: Ratings: NBC Tops Primetime With 'Thursday Night Football' Kickoff Game Also Read: Ratings: NBC Tops Primetime With 'Thursday Night Football' Kickoff Game Same Sex Marriage ""Grey's Anatomy"" has featured LGBTQ relationships since the beginning that are just as complicated and heart-wrenching as their straight counterparts. Doctors Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) were married back in Season 7, in 2010 -- five years before it was legal across the United States. Callie's story arc in particular is emblematic of the way the show embraces the whole rainbow of sexuality. She's attracted to Mark Sloan and Arizona at the same time, blowing away stereotypes about what it means to be bisexual. Callie ends up getting pregnant by Mark, and the baby, Sofia, is raised in a family with two moms and a dad; giving representation to family dynamics beyond what you'd find in ""Leave it to Beaver."" Mass Shootings Perhaps one of the issues ""Grey's"" is most known for addressing is mass shootings in the United States, which it first did back in 2010 with the iconic two-episode Season 6 finale, long before the mass shootings last year in Orlando or this year in Las Vegas that would become the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Also Read: 31 Highest and Lowest-Rated Shows of the Fall TV Season So Far (Photos) Also Read: 31 Highest and Lowest-Rated Shows of the Fall TV Season So Far (Photos) In the 23rd and 24th episodes of Season 6 (""Sanctuary"" and ""Death and All His Friends""), a vengeful man comes to Seattle Grace to avenge his wife, who died in surgery. He's out to kill Derek, who was the surgeon on the case, but ends up injuring several along the way. The aftermath doesn't include a lot of ""thoughts and prayers,"" but offers a stark look at the pain caused by a shooting. The show also covers a wide range of hot-button topics that aren't wedge issues -- in the midseason finale this week, the hospital was attacked by ransomware, and earlier this season, a storyline was dedicated to Visa issues for Megan's adoptive son from the Middle East. Some might wonder how a show can remain successful for 14 seasons, but when each episode can be related to things we all deal with, it's easy to see why ""Grey's"" is a beloved hour in our week. ""Grey's Anatomy"" will return to ABC Thursday, Jan. 18. 'Grey's Anatomy:' 30 Facts You Probably Didn't Know in Honor of Its 300th Episode (Photos)






Alright, ""Grey's"" fans, we've made it to 300 episodes! We can't believe it either, but we've been picking ""Grey's,"" choosing ""Grey's"" and loving ""Grey's"" for 14 seasons now and we aren't showing any signs of stopping. To celebrate this milestone, we've rounded up 30 fun facts about the show that you might not know (we were going to do 300, but that's a lot). Test your ""Grey's"" trivia ahead. 
ABC





1. Other cities were in the running as the show's backdrop
Shonda Rhimes wanted the show to take place in a big city where surgeons would come for big opportunities. ""This is not a small town life. Big city, big medical center, big surgical opportunities,"" Rhimes said in a recent Master Class.
She thought about placing the medical drama in Chicago, her hometown, but didn't want to place it in the same city as ""ER."" 
""Seattle felt fresh to me,"" Rhimes said. ""Seattle felt like a city I hadn't seen in television a lot.""
ABC





2. Rhimes has a casting rule to keep her shows diverse
""Take half the characters that you made men, and make them women. Take one character you were gonna cast one color, cast them differently,"" Rhimes said in the same Master Class. ""I think it's important for people to rethink because what people see on television changes what people think about themselves."" 
A perfect example of this is Miranda Bailey's (Chandra Wilson) character, who was originally described as a ""tiny blonde with curls.""

3. Rhimes stopped writing physical descriptions of her characters
Jumping off her casting rules, after casting Wilson for Miranda Bailey, Rhimes stopped describing specific physical traits for her characters. Instead, she describes feelings characters give off. For example, when writing Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the Season 2 character that Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) falls for, Rhimes described him like this: ""he has a quality that makes you want to lick him."" 
ABC





4. Bailey's character is based on Rhimes' mother
Speaking of Bailey, Rhimes said in an interview with Oprah for ""O"" magazine that the character is ""a little bit"" based off her mother. 
""She's very no-nonsense. Dr. Bailey says stuff like 'These people are nasty—all they think about is sex while we're trying to save lives here.' My mother is definitely that kind of realist.""
ABC





5. Strong women were the center from the beginning 
""I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women,"" Rhimes said in an interview with Oprah. ""Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the b----? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?""
ABC





6. Derek ""McDreamy"" Shepherd's nickname was inspired by Patrick Dempsey's real-life charm
""When we were shooting the pilot, Patrick was seriously the most adorable man we'd ever seen on camera,"" Rhimes said in the same interview. ""We'd watch the monitor and think, 'Look at his dreamy eyes!' So we started calling him Patrick McDreamy, and it stuck.""
ABC





7. Alex Karev was added after the pilot was already shot
""The character wasn't even created yet,"" actor Justin Chambers said at a Paley Convention in 2008. ""They sent the pilot to New York, where I live, and I saw it and I loved it and I went out to LA to try to win the part and auditioned and got the role, so that's how Alex came about.""
ABC





8. Meredith Grey's childhood home is a real house in Queen Anne, Seattle
Queen Anne is one of the most expensive areas of Seattle, but the house where Mer and an ever-rotating cast of friends and fellow doctors live is located on the top of the affluent hill. The house on the show is located at the fictional 613 Harper Lane, and in real life at 303 Comstock Street. It's affordable because Meredith inherited the house from her mother. 
ABC





9. Jesse Williams was a teacher before being cast as Jackson Avery 
Can you imagine having Jesse Williams as your teacher in high school? Yeah... we can't either. The heartthrob plastic surgeon (and recent billionaire) on the show told Ellen back in 2010 that he's taught a lot of grades, from high schoolers to kindergartners. 
ABC





10. Cow organs are used for surgery scenes
Sarah Drew, who plays April Kepner on the show, described to the Miami Herald what they use in the OR to recreate surgery.
""We work with Bovine organs, which is cow's organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag,"" Drew said in 2010. ""And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There's also a lot of silicone and blood matter - red jello [jelly] mixed with blood and chicken fat. It's pretty gross.""
ABC





11. Bailey’s classic euphemism “vajayjay” came from an assistant on set
Similar to Derek’s “McDreamy” nickname being inspired onset, so was Miranda Bailey’s iconic term “vajayjay” instead of “vagina.” In that same Oprah interview, Rhimes explained that she heard an assistant use the term and loved it so much she put it in the script. She also said that the network didn’t like how often they were using the word “vagina.”
Rhimes explained: “I kept saying, ‘It's a medical show! We can't say ‘vagina,’ but we can say ‘penis’ a million times in an episode?’ In one of our first shows, we used the word ‘penis’ about 32 times—but when we said ‘vagina’ twice, the broadcast-standards people blinked. We fought that and won—but ‘va-jay-jay’ is our favorite alternate term.”
ABC





12. A real plastic surgeon made one of Jackson Avery’s props
You might remember back to Season 8, Episode 20, when Jackson (Jesse Williams) carves some pretty impressive ear models… out of hand soap. Well, those were actually crafted by real-life plastic surgeon Dr. Gregory Lakin.
“This plastic surgeon had pioneered this as a teaching tool for other plastic surgeons,” one of “Grey’s” propmasters Angela Whiting told Buzzfeed back in 2013. “He's really, really good at sculpting ears, and he found that the material in soap was easy to use — because ears are complicated little things.”
ABC





13. ABC didn’t expect the show to survive after Patrick Dempsey left
In a recent interview with Seth Meyers, Ellen Pompeo said that it no one wanted to see the show evolve.
“The journey of it has been interesting because obviously we’ve had our ups and downs behind the scenes,” Pompeo said. “Right now where we are is such a different place from where we started.”
“No one’s open to letting it evolve,” she said to Meyers’ question about whether or not production was open to letting the show change. “I think that, you know, everybody was devastated when Patrick Dempsey left, and I think that the network especially thought the show was never gonna make it. And they rushed in a new love interest like 30 seconds later. Because I could never carry the show,” she joked.

14. Ellen Pompeo turns from star to director
“I really think every actor should direct, because it really is a completely different viewpoint,” Pompeo said in her sit-down with Meyers. “But again, I’m super blessed because Shonda Rhimes has allowed me to evolve with the show and direct and help produce the show. So now I have more ownership of the show and much more say.”
Pompeo’s directing credits include Season 13 Episode 18, “Be Still, My Soul,” in which Meredith’s half sister Maggie’s adoptive mother passes away.
ABC





15. There are two “So You Think You Can Dance” alums on the show
Yes, SYTYCD fans, there are not one, but two members of the reality show on “Grey’s.” First, Debbie Allen, who plays powerhouse Dr. Catherine Avery--wife to Richard Webber and mother to Jackson Avery--has been a guest judge on SYTYCD several times. She founded the Debbie Allen Dance Academy and has won several awards for her dancing career.
The second SYTYCD alum is Jeanine Mason, who was just introduced in last week’s episode as one of the new interns. Since winning Season 5 of SYTYCD, Mason has dipped her toes in acting, most notably in “Bunheads” as recurring character Cozette, and in guest appearances on “You’re the Worst” and “NCIS: Los Angeles,” as well as other shows.
ABC





16. The Megan Hunt backstory episode is based on a vet’s true-life experiences
In Season 14, we finally get to meet Megan Hunt (Abigail Spencer), Dr. Owen Hunt’s little sister and Dr. Nathan Riggs’ love interest long thought to be dead. In Episode 5 of this season, “Danger Zone,” we got some more backstory on those three characters, who all served in Iraq together before Megan went missing.
Jalysa Conway, a vet and the writer of the episode, said she drew on her own experiences in the Air Force to write that part of Megan’s story.
“I did draw a lot from my own personal experience,” Conway told People. “They’re both young officers at the time dealing with all types of pressure. I thought back to the time when I was a first lieutenant, as Megan is in this episode, and thought about what I was worried about at the time and how I could articulate that through the story.”
ABC





17. Sandra Oh said “thank you” to everyone on set the day she left
When Sandra Oh left the show, she went around on her last day of work and “gave out 250 gifts,” she told The Hollywood Reporter back in 2014.
“To give these gifts out personally and to look people in the face and say ""Thank you"" to everyone — my stand-in, the grips, post, production, the writers — that helped me process a lot,” Oh said. “That is why I think the day was joyous. With each person I was able to have a personal moment and tell them what I thought about them.”
The gift she gave? “It was this beautiful champagne in a box, and on it is an anatomical heart and a ‘10.’ It's was like, ‘Here's my heart in a box for a celebration. Please take it. This is my gift of thanks.’ It was inscribed on the back with a card, too.”
ABC





18. Sandra Oh is also a bit of a gay icon
In 2006, Out magazine named Oh “Hottest Gay Icon in the Making.” Oh has played several lesbian characters in movies like “Under the Tuscan Sun” and in theater.
Oh told Out at the time that she thinks the gay community latched on to her character Cristina on “Grey’s” because “she’s someone who is their own person who is bucking a lot of things.”
“But the wittiness, her sense of humor, comes from a beautifully arrogant and insecure place,” she said. “I like that about her. I find it fascinating. I think you have to be a fairly aware person to play someone who is deeply unaware.”
ABC





19. The stars of “Grey’s” have co-starred in movies
Kate Walsh (Addison Shepherd) and Sandra Oh (Cristina Yang) played a lesbian couple in “Under the Tuscan Sun,” and Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd) and Kevin McKidd (Owen Hunt) both appeared in “Made of Honor.”
Buena Vista Pictures





20. Camilla Luddington actually missed her audition for the role of Jo Wilson
In an interview with AOL in 2016, Luddington explained that she missed the auditions for Alex Karev’s new love interest because she was too busy promoting “Tomb Raider,” in San Diego--she voices Lara Croft for the 2013 and 2015 games.
“I heard by Friday evening that they could not find the girl, and Shonda obviously knew me from a previous TV show, so she called me and on Monday, and I think I knew by Wednesday, and I started Friday,” Luddington said.
ABC





21. Sara Ramirez is a Tony-winning actress, and her singing shops are part of the reason we got a musical episode
To convince the execs at ABC to greenlight a musical episode, Shonda Rhimes enlisted the skills of Sara Ramirez (Callie Torres), Chandra Wilson (Miranda Bailey) and Kevin McKidd (Owen Hunt), to perform, according to EW.
Ramirez told Oprah in a 2008 interview that she was cast in the first place after ABC Touchstone saw her Tony-winning performance in “Spamalot” as “Lady of the Lake.”
“They said be on our network, pick a show. They sent me every show they had, and ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ was my favorite, and I said that’s the one I want to be on,” she said.
ABC





22. Chandra Wilson is also a Broadway star
Fun fact: Wilson is also a Broadway alum. She acted in “Chicago” as Matron “Mama” Morton, “Caroline, Or Change,” “On the Town” and “Avenue Q.” She’s also presented at the Tony Awards.
ABC





23. The helipad scenes are filmed at a news station in Seattle
There are plenty of times the team at Seattle Grace needs to life-flight in a patient in dire circumstances and the surgeons meet the helicopter on the landing pad on top of the hospital. Those scenes are filmed at local Seattle ABC affiliate station KOMO-TV.
ABC





24. Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have also directed episodes of the show
Pompeo isn’t the only one who has pulled the star-turned-director move. Chandra Wilson has directed 17 episodes (her first was back in 2009), according to IMDB. She’s also directed one episode for another Shondaland staple, “Scandal.” Kevin McKidd has directed 18 episodes, including two so far from Season 14.
ABC





25. Many of the show’s storylines are based on real medical cases
The researchers on the writer’s team spends hours pouring over medical journals to find interesting cases to use in “Grey’s” storylines. They also receive tips from fans about medical stories they think are interesting, executive producer Zoanne Clack said in an ABC bonus interview video in 2014.
ABC





26. Isaiah Washington learned how to perform the surgeries written for his character
Washington’s cool, calculated portrayal of Dr. Burke makes you feel like you’re watching a real doctor work on screen. And that’s not solely because of his acting chops--Washington actually learned how to perform the surgeries before it was time to shoot. And according to Rhimes, he was even known to pull 48-hour shifts shadowing real surgeons at hospitals.
ABC





27. All the episodes are named after a song, and Shonda Rhimes helps pick the score
One of our favorite things about “Grey’s” is the perfect soundtrack that always helps pull at our heartstrings. Rhimes told Oprah that helping with the score of the show is “the highlight of my job.”
“I get a rush when I find exactly the right music for a scene,” she said. “We do current stuff, older stuff, even stuff we've never heard before.”

28. Rhimes used comparisons to “Sex in the City” for her initial pitch for the show
Rhimes wanted Meredith’s point of view to be “a more grounded version of Carrie's articles in ‘Sex and the City,’” even though it wasn’t her “favorite” way to pitch the show. She’s given “Grey’s” a nickname spun off the HBO hit, though: “Sex and the Surgery.”
ABC





29. Denny was originally going to have a very different love interest
The fan-favorite storyline of Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Izzie (Katherine Heigl)’s ill-fated super-rich patient-turned-husband, was initially going to go pretty differently. We love Cristina’s relationship with Burke (and later Owen), but can you picture her falling for heart patient Denny? We guess it could make sense, given her obsession with becoming the best heart surgeon ever. Rhimes revealed in a Master Class that Cristina’s original plotline involved falling in love with a dying patient.
ABC





30. There have been plenty of guest stars on the show over the years, but this one’s our favorite…
Darby Camp, who played future DJ Chloe Mackenzie in the Emmy-winning HBO drama “Big Little Lies” earlier this year, was a major character in the exit story of Dr. Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) last season. She played Erin Miller, a young girl who ends up in the wrong area of the hospital at the wrong time, to say the least.

Only Shondaland obsessives will know all this trivia

Alright, ""Grey's"" fans, we've made it to 300 episodes! We can't believe it either, but we've been picking ""Grey's,"" choosing ""Grey's"" and loving ""Grey's"" for 14 seasons now and we aren't showing any signs of stopping. To celebrate this milestone, we've rounded up 30 fun facts about the show that you might not know (we were going to do 300, but that's a lot). Test your ""Grey's"" trivia ahead. 



View In Gallery Alright, ""Grey's"" fans, we've made it to 300 episodes! We can't believe it either, but we've been picking ""Grey's,"" choosing ""Grey's"" and loving ""Grey's"" for 14 seasons now and we aren't showing any signs of stopping. To celebrate this milestone, we've rounded up 30 fun facts about the show that you might not know (we were going to do 300, but that's a lot). Test your ""Grey's"" trivia ahead. 1. Other cities were in the running as the show's backdrop Shonda Rhimes wanted the show to take place in a big city where surgeons would come for big opportunities. ""This is not a small town life. Big city, big medical center, big surgical opportunities,"" Rhimes said in a recent Master Class. She thought about placing the medical drama in Chicago, her hometown, but didn't want to place it in the same city as ""ER."" ""Seattle felt fresh to me,"" Rhimes said. ""Seattle felt like a city I hadn't seen in television a lot."" 2. Rhimes has a casting rule to keep her shows diverse ""Take half the characters that you made men, and make them women. Take one character you were gonna cast one color, cast them differently,"" Rhimes said in the same Master Class. ""I think it's important for people to rethink because what people see on television changes what people think about themselves."" A perfect example of this is Miranda Bailey's (Chandra Wilson) character, who was originally described as a ""tiny blonde with curls."" 3. Rhimes stopped writing physical descriptions of her characters Jumping off her casting rules, after casting Wilson for Miranda Bailey, Rhimes stopped describing specific physical traits for her characters. Instead, she describes feelings characters give off. For example, when writing Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the Season 2 character that Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) falls for, Rhimes described him like this: ""he has a quality that makes you want to lick him."" 4. Bailey's character is based on Rhimes' mother Speaking of Bailey, Rhimes said in an interview with Oprah for ""O"" magazine that the character is ""a little bit"" based off her mother. ""She's very no-nonsense. Dr. Bailey says stuff like 'These people are nasty—all they think about is sex while we're trying to save lives here.' My mother is definitely that kind of realist."" 5. Strong women were the center from the beginning ""I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women,"" Rhimes said in an interview with Oprah. ""Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the b----? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?"" 6. Derek ""McDreamy"" Shepherd's nickname was inspired by Patrick Dempsey's real-life charm ""When we were shooting the pilot, Patrick was seriously the most adorable man we'd ever seen on camera,"" Rhimes said in the same interview. ""We'd watch the monitor and think, 'Look at his dreamy eyes!' So we started calling him Patrick McDreamy, and it stuck."" 7. Alex Karev was added after the pilot was already shot ""The character wasn't even created yet,"" actor Justin Chambers said at a Paley Convention in 2008. ""They sent the pilot to New York, where I live, and I saw it and I loved it and I went out to LA to try to win the part and auditioned and got the role, so that's how Alex came about."" 8. Meredith Grey's childhood home is a real house in Queen Anne, Seattle Queen Anne is one of the most expensive areas of Seattle, but the house where Mer and an ever-rotating cast of friends and fellow doctors live is located on the top of the affluent hill. The house on the show is located at the fictional 613 Harper Lane, and in real life at 303 Comstock Street. It's affordable because Meredith inherited the house from her mother. 9. Jesse Williams was a teacher before being cast as Jackson Avery Can you imagine having Jesse Williams as your teacher in high school? Yeah... we can't either. The heartthrob plastic surgeon (and recent billionaire) on the show told Ellen back in 2010 that he's taught a lot of grades, from high schoolers to kindergartners. 10. Cow organs are used for surgery scenes Sarah Drew, who plays April Kepner on the show, described to the Miami Herald what they use in the OR to recreate surgery. ""We work with Bovine organs, which is cow's organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag,"" Drew said in 2010. ""And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There's also a lot of silicone and blood matter - red jello [jelly] mixed with blood and chicken fat. It's pretty gross."" 11. Bailey’s classic euphemism “vajayjay” came from an assistant on set Similar to Derek’s “McDreamy” nickname being inspired onset, so was Miranda Bailey’s iconic term “vajayjay” instead of “vagina.” In that same Oprah interview, Rhimes explained that she heard an assistant use the term and loved it so much she put it in the script. She also said that the network didn’t like how often they were using the word “vagina.” Rhimes explained: “I kept saying, ‘It's a medical show! We can't say ‘vagina,’ but we can say ‘penis’ a million times in an episode?’ In one of our first shows, we used the word ‘penis’ about 32 times—but when we said ‘vagina’ twice, the broadcast-standards people blinked. We fought that and won—but ‘va-jay-jay’ is our favorite alternate term.” 12. A real plastic surgeon made one of Jackson Avery’s props You might remember back to Season 8, Episode 20, when Jackson (Jesse Williams) carves some pretty impressive ear models… out of hand soap. Well, those were actually crafted by real-life plastic surgeon Dr. Gregory Lakin. “This plastic surgeon had pioneered this as a teaching tool for other plastic surgeons,” one of “Grey’s” propmasters Angela Whiting told Buzzfeed back in 2013. “He's really, really good at sculpting ears, and he found that the material in soap was easy to use — because ears are complicated little things.” 13. ABC didn’t expect the show to survive after Patrick Dempsey left In a recent interview with Seth Meyers, Ellen Pompeo said that it no one wanted to see the show evolve. “The journey of it has been interesting because obviously we’ve had our ups and downs behind the scenes,” Pompeo said. “Right now where we are is such a different place from where we started.” “No one’s open to letting it evolve,” she said to Meyers’ question about whether or not production was open to letting the show change. “I think that, you know, everybody was devastated when Patrick Dempsey left, and I think that the network especially thought the show was never gonna make it. And they rushed in a new love interest like 30 seconds later. Because I could never carry the show,” she joked. 14. Ellen Pompeo turns from star to director “I really think every actor should direct, because it really is a completely different viewpoint,” Pompeo said in her sit-down with Meyers. “But again, I’m super blessed because Shonda Rhimes has allowed me to evolve with the show and direct and help produce the show. So now I have more ownership of the show and much more say.” Pompeo’s directing credits include Season 13 Episode 18, “Be Still, My Soul,” in which Meredith’s half sister Maggie’s adoptive mother passes away. 15. There are two “So You Think You Can Dance” alums on the show Yes, SYTYCD fans, there are not one, but two members of the reality show on “Grey’s.” First, Debbie Allen, who plays powerhouse Dr. Catherine Avery--wife to Richard Webber and mother to Jackson Avery--has been a guest judge on SYTYCD several times.

303,http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/11/bible-and-a-gun-massacres-force-churches-temples-mosques-to-question-security/,"Trending: Pastor Mark Whitlock heard the news when he was in his office, surrounded by a security team, as he prepared to deliver his Sunday service. There was another mass shooting, he heard. And it happened at a church — again. “We began to weep,” said Whitlock, pastor of Christ Our Redeemer African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Irvine. “It shook us to our very core.” The shooting Whitlock referenced was at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. On Nov. 5, a man with a gun walked into the church, methodically scanned the pews for victims, and opened fire. He killed 26 people, including eight children.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  “This was beyond shocking,” Whitlock said. Except, statistically at least, it wasn’t. Mass shootings have become routine in the United States, with 358 such attacks since mid-2006, depending on how you define “mass” and “shooting,” according to statistics from USA Today. And mass shootings at places of worship are hardly outliers. Two months before the church shooting in Texas another man with a gun went to the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee, near Nashville, killing one woman and wounding six others.

(Andrew Nelles/The Tennessean via AP)  That wasn’t particularly unusual, either. At Catholic churches and Mormon temples, at synagogues and mosques, at Unitarian churches and spiritual retreats, at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin — over the past decade or so, places of worship routinely have been active crime scenes for mass murderers. The horror in Texas last week even prompted a telling moniker: It was described on CNN and other news outlets as the “deadliest shooting at a house of worship” in American history. For spiritual leaders, the trend offers a dilemma. Welcoming strangers is a key tenet of many religions. But that ideal also makes houses of worship, in the parlance of the modern world, “soft targets.” “The truth is, this is a different day,” Whitlock said. Whitlock knows this well. On June 15, 2015, a self-proclaimed white supremacist walked into the Bible study group at the AME Church in Charleston, S.C., and murdered nine people. Since then, Whitlock’s AME church in Irvine has been protected by professional security.

In this June 19, 2015, photo, police tape surrounds the parking lot behind the AME Emanuel Church in Charleston, S.C., as FBI forensic experts work the crime scene. (AP file photo/Stephen B. Morton)  “We are a welcoming church,” Whitlock said. “But we need a security plan, a team of professionals and volunteers who will keep congregants safe.” The shootings can change congregations and, in some ways, how they practice their faith. A Sikh tradition is that a temple should keep open doors that face north, south, east and west. It’s a symbol of how the religion is open to people from all places and all walks of life. That tradition is no longer followed at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, in Oak Creek, Wis. That’s where, on Aug. 5, 2012, an admitted neo-Nazi entered through one of those open doors and opened fire, killing six and severely injuring four others. Since then, when people gather to worship, the doors have been locked.  A woman reacts with others as they await word on a shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., Sunday, Aug. 5, 2012, where police and witnesses describe a chaotic situation with an unknown number of victims, suspects and possible hostages.  Police stand guard as bystanders watch at the scene of a shooting inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., Sunday, Aug. 5, 2012. Police and witnesses describe a chaotic situation with an unknown number of victims, suspects and possible hostages.  Police storm a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., Sunday, Aug. 5, 2012, after reports of a shooting, where police and witnesses describe a chaotic situation with an unknown number of victims, suspects and possible hostages.  “The need to protect human lives overrides everything else,” said Pardeep Singh Kaleka, whose father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was among the victims in 2012. “This is the new reality.” Now, at the temple, a security guard watches the parking lot as members pray. Surveillance cameras grace every corner of the campus; the windows are fitted with shatter-proof glass. But such measures don’t necessarily make people feel safe. When an entire community comes under attack, as Kaleka’s did, the healing process can be complex. Kaleka said it took about a year after the shootings for congregants at his temple to even begin to feel some sense of security. “As people of faith, the first question you tend to ask is: ‘Where was God that day?’ ” Kaleka said. “You also realize that you can either be defined by what happened to you or by what you did about it.” After the shooting, Kaleka’s family started Serve2Unite, a nonprofit that trains student leaders to build compassionate, inclusive and nonviolent communities. Kaleka sees a number of similarities between Sutherland Springs and the shooting at his temple. In both cases, the shooter was someone who slipped through legal and social networks prior to taking innocent lives. “Both were individuals who shouldn’t have had guns,” he said. “Both cased the perimeter before they started shooting … Both took their own lives.” Violence has erupted at houses of worship often enough that at least one security agency, LionHeart International, in Florida, specializes in protecting such venues. Tim Miller, a former Secret Service agent and security expert, advocates arming and training members of congregations. Miller points out that in the two most recent church massacres — in Sutherland Springs and Antioch, Tenn. — the shooters were stopped by armed defenders, albeit after more than 50 people total had been killed or wounded. “I’m not for randomly putting guns in people’s hands,” Miller said. “That would be counterproductive. We need to arm the right people who have the right kind of training.” Miller believes religious leaders need to reevaluate some ideals, and to value safety over unconditional access. “They need to have armed law enforcement officials as part of events,” Miller said. “They need to provide training for staff members and volunteers. They need to have a plan for how to act in a crisis situation.” Sutherland Springs didn’t come as a shock to Miller. “What took me by surprise? In that church, in rural Texas, not one person had a gun.” Miller says he has been deluged with calls for help from churches after the Texas massacre.  He hopes the incident motivates churches around the country to put security measures in place. For many houses of worship — particularly synagogues and mosques — the goals of modern security have outpaced ancient ideals for some time. Rabbi Susan Goldberg said synagogues in Southern California became acutely aware of the need for security after a white supremacist walked into the lobby of North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills on Aug. 10, 1999, and opened fire, injuring five and killing a mail carrier outside the building.  Parents wait for information about their children who were in a daycare facility where shots were fired in the lobby. Five victims, three male children and two female adults, were shot at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, California Tuesday morning, August 10, 1999.  Los Angeles police officers lead children to safety after Buford O. Furrow Jr. walked into the North valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills and opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon. He wounded three children, a teenage counselor, and an office worker.  Left to right, unidentified LAPD officer, LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, and LAPD Commander David Kalish survey the scene around the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, California, Tuesday, August 10, 1999, where five victims, three male children and two female adults, were shot.  “That incident was a game changer for us,” said Goldberg, who leads the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, a Los Angeles landmark and the city’s oldest synagogue. “We’ve had robust security for many years … We need to.” The temple has received several bomb threats, including one over the summer. Goldberg said there are two schools on campus as well, boosting the need for security. “We check people’s IDs when they come on campus,” she said. “We have security personnel and cameras.” Last year, the Islamic Center of Los Angeles received phone threats from a man who said he planned to kill Muslims. Police later arrested Mark Lucian Feigin, 40, in connection with the threats. They found nine guns, modified high-capacity magazines and 250 rounds of ammunition in his home. After that threat at the Islamic Center, Goldberg’s synagogue placed a call to their Muslim friends. The rabbi said her synagogue’s security director did a walk-through at the mosque and offered suggestions to the organization’s leaders. Mosques around the country, which have been the target of threats and hate crimes nationwide, have learned from the Jewish community how to protect themselves, said Corey Saylor, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Saylor recently worked with a security consultant to write a booklet aimed at helping mosques improve security. After the shooting in Texas, CAIR has offered this booklet to churches and other houses of worship. Several Southern California police departments work with mosques and other houses of worship to offer extra protection, particularly during big events such as Ramadan prayers and festivities. The Islamic Society of Orange County in Garden Grove, the largest mosque on the West Coast, gets regular police patrols. The mosque also houses a school on campus. For congregations struggling financially, the Department of Homeland Security offers grants to secure places of worship, Saylor said. “It might be time-consuming, but it’s worth the effort,” he said. Still, when asked about guns in religious sanctuaries, Saylor expressed mixed feelings. “I’d leave it to local communities based on the law and their own ethical leanings,” he said. “Congregations may have strong feelings about having firearms in a place that is supposed to be a sanctuary for peace.” Council Nedd, the bishop and rector at St. Alban’s Anglican Church in Pine Grove Mills, Pennsylvania, says he is considering taking his gun to church Sundays. Nedd’s position is unique because he’s both a clergyman and a law enforcement officer. “My fundamental view is church is a sacred space and you don’t define it with weapons,” he said. “But the fact is, we live in a world where people don’t value this sacred space any more.” Other types of security measures, Nedd added, are cost-prohibitive for a small church such as his 50-member congregation. Chineta Goodjoin, who heads New Hope Presbyterian Church in Orange, struggles with the idea of arming her congregants or volunteers, let alone bringing a gun to church. “I’m not prepared to go there yet,” she said. “Where are we going as a community when we start guarding ourselves with weapons in church?” That said, Goodjoin believes a security team is indispensable for her church. Her best friend, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, was one of the nine parishioners who died two years ago during the AME church shooting in Charleston, S.C. “Situations like Charleston and Texas give us pause,” she said. “We do watch who is coming in and out of our church … We have security during choir practice and Bible studies.” In Irvine, AME Pastor Whitlock said he’s heard from congregants who expressed fear about attending church since the Charleston massacre and other incidents. He told them to come anyway. “We cannot let fear hold us hostage at home on Sunday morning,” he said. The church’s primary objective should be to protect its congregants, Whitlock said. “We believe God will protect us,” he said. “But God also gives us the tools we need to protect ourselves. And we need to start using them.” Get the latest news delivered daily! We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

304,http://www.nj.com/camden/index.ssf/2017/12/church_puts_faith_in_god_cops_during_active_shoote.html,"Bethel Church in Gloucester Township recently held a meeting on what to do if a gunman attacks the church.(Google Street View) Pastor Kurt Kinney of Bethel Church in Gloucester Township. Pastor Kurt Kinney freely admitted there was a time when his congregation would fully put their faith in God to protect them, especially in the sanctuary of their church. That time has passed. ""We just think it's very critical in this hour to partner with the police and really with anyone who can help us as a faith community to become more aware of the threats that are out there and minimize the risk,"" said Kinney, pastor of Bethel Church, a congregation of about 800 members in Gloucester Township, Camden County. ""Even though we believe that ultimately deliverance comes from God, we should not be naive that God would use the authorities he has called to bring that deliverance through."" Kinney put his words into action this week when his church hosted a workshop on what to do if an active shooter invades the church. The training came less than a month after a gunman in Texas fatally shot 26 people during a Sunday morning service at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland on Nov. 5, and more than two years after a church shooting in South Carolina claimed eight lives. Details of both shootings were incorporated in a slideshow and lecture presentation in front of several hundred people who attended the event Monday evening. ""The devil has a plan, also,"" said Lisa James, 53, a local resident who said her church pastor encouraged her congregation to attend. ""We didn't have to worry about this 10 years ago. Some people may not think about it, but you have to be aware of what to do in that kind of situation. You may not want to think about it but you have to."" Lt. Chris Crabtree led the slideshow and lecture presentation. ""Nobody believes it could happen in my town,"" he said. ""But it can."" Crabtree shared a story about he and his wife visiting Las Vegas two weeks before the mass shooting outside of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in which 58 people were fatally shot by a gunman. ""It was too close for comfort,"" Crabtree said. He and four other officers led the nearly two-hour session by emphasizing three key actions to take if anyone finds themselves in the crosshairs of an active shooter. ""Run, hide, fight,"" he and the others said. The program included details about characteristics of gunmen who have committed mass shootings, including often being angry, withdrawn and with a history of domestic violence, and predominantly men. They encouraged the audience to ""think like a cop"" and survey a room for exits and to ""arm yourself with a survival mindset."" They also spoke about what to do when police arrive, including to not be alarmed if an officer points a gun in your direction when determining where to find the gunman. Kinney observed the training from the back of the large, main room of his church. He already practices many of the precautions police recommend for keeping a sanctuary safe. ""We have a security team,"" Kinney said. ""They aren't armed but we have congregation members watching doors and hallways during our services. We also now have an on-duty a township police officer here when we have church service and have some off-duty members of our congregation. And sometimes, they're packing."" Kinney said small children are supervised in a separate wing of the sprawling church on Blackwood Clementon Road during church service. He said he has also taken a precaution of having a separate security member follow him from a distance to watch behind him when he is in the pulpit. ""I think it's very critical in this hour to partner with the police and anyone who can help us as a faith community to become aware of threats that are out there and to minimize the risk.""

I do not believe there is much police brutality -- which has been a target of NFL players' protests of the national anthem -- to speak of. This is all hysteria incited by the media and Democratic Party politicians. What there is, is a lot of violence in African-American neighborhoods. This is why the police have their guard up in certain areas. Police officers have to be very careful. A state trooper was shot and critically wounded in Pennsylvania a couple weeks ago, after stopping a driver. The police represent the will of the totality. All must submit to the authority of the law. It must be this way to maintain civilized life. Some people, though, have a problem understanding the necessity of law. These people must be controlled by force. Otherwise, we'll have a brutal world where the strong take from the weak; a disorganized world where there is no peace, and no advancements in science, technology and art. We can never allow anyone to disobey police orders. The police do not engage in unjust oppression. They are the defenders of a great way of life that many take for granted. When your vehicle is pulled over, be respectful to the police. Their job is dangerous and, in this violent world, they never know what they will encounter. There will always be some who hate America. But I say to them that it is better than most places in the world. That's why so many people want to come here. Lee Lucas, Gibbstown We need to take a stand against gun violence. Don't wait for others to stand up against the powerful gun lobby. Congress did not respond with any legislation to the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas. Since then, we have witnessed another mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and a school shooting in California. Our country's gun homicide rate is 25 times higher than the average of other developed nations. This is not normal. Two crucial pieces of legislation are currently before Congress. One is S1539/HR3207, titled ""The Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act/Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act."" This bill would close the loopholes in current federal law that allow stalkers and domestic abusers access to firearms when they are not married to their victims. The second piece of legislation is known as ""Concealed Carry Reciprocity"" (CCR). If approved, those with permits to conceal and carry guns in one state would be permitted to carry them in other states, even in states  where ""concealed carry"" generally isn't legal. New Jersey legislators and citizens have worked hard to enact sensible gun laws, including laws that do not permit most gun owners to ""conceal and carry."" I f everyone who is horrified about gun violence in our country writes to their congressional representatives, it will make a difference. To find out how you can take a stand for common sense legislation, contact your local chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense of America.

Approximately 150 cyclists participated. (Sarah Alvarado, Contributing Photographer)  For the second year, more than 150 cyclists on Saturday paid tribute to the victims of the Dec. 2, 2015, mass shooting by riding the streets of Redlands and San Bernardino. Weidhase called the outpouring of support Saturday “amazing.” “Something like this ride brings all of us together,” he added. “Everyone has their way of commemorating the day, but seeing how the cycling community can come together to remember those who died is heart-warming, it really is.” The attack that left 14 dead and 22 wounded took place during a training session and holiday gathering for San Bernardino County’s Environmental Health Services Division at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. The attackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, were killed hours later during a shootout 3 miles away. The 14-mile memorial ride was a way of showing the survivors and the victims’ families “that we’re not going to forget that day and we’re going to be strong and come together as a community,” said Alesandra Wilson, of Ride Yourself Fit, the Redlands cycling crew that helped organize the event. “This is not going to stop us.”  Moreland, a member of Ride Yourself Fit, had known Thalasinos for nine-plus years before Dec. 2, 2015. The 59-year-old said he speaks with Thalasinos’ widow, Jennifer, on a regular basis. The two talk about grief, about sleepless nights, about memories. “And to think there are 14 families going through the same thing,” Moreland said. “It’s amazing the ripple effect something like that has on the community, on people personally.” Munoz, a 9-1-1 dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol, answered the emergency phone call of a Dec. 2, 2015, survivor. Last year, Munoz participated in a memorial bike ride held by the San Bernardino Police Department. She said she shed tears that morning. Saturday, her 14-year-old son Jonathan tagged along. “Sometimes with these tragedies, it’s out of sight, out of mind,” Munoz said. “To me, this is an opportunity to remember what happened, what those people went through. The pain is always there.” Weidhase on Saturday retrieved a photo from his Facebook page of him standing shoulder to shoulder with other first responders on Dec. 2, 2015. A special agent at the time, Weidhase was involved in the fatal shootout. “I fought wars overseas,” the 49-year-old veteran said. “That day, the war came to us.”  Two years after the Dec. 2, tragedy, small remnants remain of the memorial at the corner of Waterman Ave. & Orange Show Rd, for the victims of the Inland Regional Center mass shooting in San Bernardino, Ca., Thursday, November 30, 2017.

(AP) For residents in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, Texas, worshipping together will never be quite the same. Hundreds of the faithful will gather Sunday with surviving members of the First Baptist Church, where a shooting rampage left 26 people dead. Members will hold a service for the first time since a gunman opened fire inside the small church a week earlier in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Initial plans called for gathering at a community center that could house a few dozen people. But when organizers realized about 500 people were planning to attend, the service was moved outside to a baseball park. Church representatives also plan to eventually open a public memorial inside the church, where 26 empty chairs have been placed. Authorities have put the official death toll at 26 victims, because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. Church officials have said the building will likely be demolished. First responders join in prayer following a Veterans Day event, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, near the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
      (AP) TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTER'S EX-WIFE SAYS HE ABUSED, THREATENED HER On Saturday, about 100 people gathered outside the town's community center to commemorate Veterans Day and to honor the shooting victims, nearly half of whom had ties to the Air Force. ""Maybe this will start the healing process that will get Sutherland Springs and Wilson County to put this horrific tragedy behind us and look to the future,"" county Judge Richard Jackson, his voice breaking, told the crowd, which included first responders and law enforcement officers. Jackson, the county's top administrator, thanked the first responders and others who rushed to First Baptist Church in the aftermath of last Sunday's shooting, which also wounded about 20 people. What they saw there will affect them the rest of their lives, Jackson said. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two men who heard gunfire from the church. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn't there the day of the shooting. Donna King stands for the national anthem during a Veterans Day event, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
      (AP) CHURCH IN TEXAS MASSACRE WILL OPEN TO PUBLIC AS MEMORIAL Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. Sutherland Springs is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio and not far from several military posts, including Lackland Air Force Base. The Air Force's chief of staff, Gen. David Goldfein, said 12 of those killed were either members of the Air Force or had family ties to it. Among them were Scott and Karen Marshall, both 56, who had decided to retire in nearby La Vernia after meeting when they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. On Thursday, a military funeral was held for them at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Retired Chief Warrant Officer Mike Gonzales, who led Saturday's Veterans Day ceremony, said many veterans choose to live in the San Antonio area because of its deep military ties, and families tend to migrate to the city's surrounding rural areas. ""We come here to enjoy life, to get quiet and to raise our children,"" he said. ""We've been to war zones and seen that tragedy firsthand. Never did we think that tragedy would strike here."" A steady stream of people also visited a makeshift memorial of crosses adorned with flowers, photographs, red hearts and white, purple and pink balloons. Among them was Jackie Lee, who traveled from San Antonio with several friends. ""It was on my heart since it happened,"" she said. ""I needed to come to show the community some support, to show these people some support."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

308,https://www.inquisitr.com/4617464/carrie-underwood-cancels-performances-after-falling-and-breaking-her-wrist-outside-her-home/,"Former American Idol contestant and country music superstar Carrie Underwood reportedly took quite a tumble at her home on Friday night, resulting in a serious injury and performance cancellations. As Daily Mail reports, 34-year-old Underwood is said to have fallen on some steps outside her home just days after her high-profile CMA hosting gig. In addition to suffering from painful cuts and bruises, Carrie also broke her wrist. Fortunately, while her injury is serious, it is definitely not life-threatening, and Underwood is reportedly home recuperating this weekend after being treated and released at a local hospital. After getting word that his wife had been injured, Carrie Underwood's ex-professional hockey player husband Mike Fisher reportedly headed back home to Nashville to be with her during her recovery - and he's not the only one to share some serious love with Underwood in the wake of her unexpected injury. According to UKCountryRadio.com presenter Allan Watkiss, he believes that Underwood will be virtually basking in sympathy and support from her fans as she recuperates rather than performs over the next several weeks. Watkiss also expressed relief that Carrie Underwood was injured after her CMA hosting stint and not before.""I'm sure Carrie's fans will have every sympathy with her...Thank goodness it happened after her big gig of hosting last week's CMA Awards.""On Sunday morning, Underwood took a moment to tweet about her injuries and thank her fans and her ""best hubby in the world."" According to the country music darling, she expects to be ""alright,"" although she admitted that getting back to 100 percent might ""take some time.""Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I’ll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me.— Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood) November 12, 2017Because of the extent of the injuries she sustained in her Friday night fall, a spokesperson for Carrie Underwood says that she will be missing some upcoming performances. While a comprehensive list of the shows she'll be axing hasn't been made public, her highly anticipated performance at Sunday night's Country Rising benefit concert is a definite no-go. The concert, which will take place in Nashville, was slated to include Underwood, along with a slew of additional country music icons, from George Strait to Reba McEntire. Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I’ll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me. Also included in the Country Rising lineup is Jason Aldean, who was performing onstage during the October 1 Las Vegas mass shooting. With or without Carrie Underwood, the show is scheduled to go on, and proceeds are earmarked to benefit the victims of the deadly Las Vegas shooting, as well as those impacted by this year's deadly string of hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, Florida, and Texas.Carrie Underwood was hospitalized after taking a fall at her home. Read her update to her fans: https://t.co/WsM934pI8U— JustJared.com (@JustJared) November 12, 2017While Carrie Underwood's slip and fall and broken wrist are arguably notable events in the superstar's life, her injuries aren't even the first story to get her name in the news this week. Underwood also made headlines, alongside her CMA co-host Brad Paisley, for mocking Donald Trump at the annual country music award show. As KAGSTV reports, the duo (seemingly in response to a CMA ban on journalists asking questions about guns, the Las Vegas shooting and/or political affiliations) sang a duet digging on the POTUS and his proclivity for Twitter drama. Carrie Underwood was hospitalized after taking a fall at her home. Read her update to her fans: https://t.co/WsM934pI8U According to Underwood, she and Paisley weren't allowed to do any of their ""silly little songs"" at the award's show this year. The pair then joked themselves into a Trump-mocking rendition of her hit song ""Before He Cheats,"" hysterically dubbed ""Before He Tweets.""""Right now, he's probably in his PJs, reaching for his cellphone. Right now, he's probably asking Siri, 'How in the he** do you spell Pocahontas?""when ppl say that Carrie Underwood’s fall was karma after her and brad’s joke on trump....lmao you republicans stay mad 😅— Michael Trea Smith (@TreaSmith) November 12, 2017Yeah Right, she just worried about the Back Lash she will get after she has to face in front of her fans for mocking our President— Eduardo Torres (@eddietorres915) November 12, 2017Not every country or Carrie Underwood fan was impressed by the presidential mockery, however, and many took to social media to share their disdain, even vowing to boycott the CMAs in the future.

By The Associated Press Mike Smith stopped 28 shots to blank his former team, Mark Jankowski scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the Arizona Coyotes 3-0 on Thursday night. Smith picked up his second shutout of the season and 35th of his career. The 35-year-old was making his first start against Arizona since being acquired by Calgary via trade in June. Mikael Backlund also scored for Calgary. The Flames bounced back after opening their four-game homestand with a 4-1 loss to Toronto on Tuesday night. Scott Wedgewood made 41 saves for the Coyotes. Jankowski opened the scoring 2:48 into the second by showing an elite set of hands. Set up in front on a tic-tac-toe passing sequence with linemates Sam Bennett and Jaromir Jagr, Jankowski was stopped on his first try but put his stick between his legs to zip the rebound over Wedgewood's glove. Calgary extended its lead to 2-0 at 10:19 of the third when Matthew Tkachuk neatly set up Backlund in front. Jankowski added his second of the night and fifth of the season less than two minutes later. Right off a faceoff, he went to the net and scored on a forehand-to-backhand deke. Smith, who improved to 11-8-1, had his best stop halfway through the second period when he dove across the crease to thwart Christian Dvorak. With Antti Raanta (upper body) sidelined, Wedgewood made his fourth straight start for the Coyotes and fell to 2-4-2.

Lawyers for Noor Salman had fought to move the case outside the city, arguing intense media coverage of the shooting could prompt bias in potential jurors. U.S. District Judge Paul Byron denied the request Tuesday, court documents show. Salman has been behind bars for nearly a year since her January arrest. She's facing federal charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization. If convicted, Salman could face life in prison. More: Hero cop of Pulse shooting is being terminated from force Trials are required to be held in the district where the alleged crime happens unless there is ""extraordinary local prejudice"" to prevent a fair trial, Byron wrote in the ruling, adding he didn't find anything that would merit a relocation. Lawyers for Salman, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., with Mateen and their toddler before the attack, argued news coverage by local, national and international media showed bias against her and was framed to make her appear guilty. The lawyers cited news stories, including several that included texts she and Mateen exchanged during his attack at the LGBT nightclub, which left 49 people dead and dozens more injured. The texts did not include the full context of their conversation and created an impression that she may have known about his plans, Salman's lawyers argued in court documents. More: FBI arrests wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen Byron noted that Salman shared the text messages with The New York Times in an interview after the attack. She also told the Times she saw Mateen watching jihadist videos and knew he'd been interviewed twice by the FBI, court documents show. Salman's lawyers also claimed Orlando Police Chief John Mina made a series of comments that could have created bias against her, including a Twitter post where he wrote he was glad she was charged. Byron said that point was moot because Mina never claimed Salman was guilty or spoke about any evidence law enforcement collected in the case against her. He said Mina's comments had a relatively small reach and the court encompasses more than 2.8 million people, a massive pool to find a fair jury. Attorneys are using the uncommon additional step of having potential jurors fill out questionnaires, which will help in the selection process, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

313,https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/01/we-shouldnt-blame-illegal-immigrants-for-kate-steinles-death-we-should-blame-government/,"Trending: The death of Kate Steinle was a tragedy. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate shouldn’t have been in the country. And the government failed to do its job of protecting the public. But the exploitation of Steinle’s death by those who wish to smear illegal immigrants has done more to undermine rational debate about immigration policy than to facilitate it. On Thursday, Garcia Zarate was acquitted of murder, manslaughter and assault charges for the July 2015 killing of Steinle in San Francisco, but found guilty on a gun charge. Garcia Zarate, an illegal immigrant who has been deported five times in the past, is expected to be deported once again, according to the Associated Press. That Garcia Zarate was responsible for Steinle’s death has never been in question. What has been less clear is why and how Garcia Zarate ended up firing a weapon which wasn’t his and striking Steinle. An assessment of the events leading up to the shooting gives few indications that anyone could have predicted what was going to happen. For one, Garcia Zarate, who had no history of violence, was only in San Francisco after serving several years in federal prison for after being caught in 2009 for attempting to reenter the country after being deported. In March 2015, federal officials chose to honor a request from the San Francisco Sheriff’s office for Garcia Zarate to answer for a 20-year-old bench warrant pertaining to a $20 marijuana sale. The Department of Justice could have referred Garcia Zarate to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. But they didn’t, and so Garcia Zarate was sent to San Francisco, where he was detained by the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department. On March 27, 2015, he arrived to San Francisco Superior Court, where the old, low-level charges were promptly dropped. The SFSD continued to detain him for weeks as they confirmed there were no active warrants and that he had indeed completed his federal prison sentence. During this time, ICE put in a detainer request to SFSD to detain Garcia Zarate until they picked him up. But as federal courts like the Oregon Federal District Court in Miranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County have ruled, detainer requests alone are not a sufficient basis to detain people in local jails, and thus detaining someone on the basis of a federal detainer request alone violates the Fourth Amendment. Consequently, when ICE failed to provide a request backed by a warrant, the SFSD released Garcia Zarate on April 15, three weeks after his arrival in San Francisco, having no legal justification for continuing to hold him. Months later, Garcia Zarate found himself on a San Francisco pier, came across a gun wrapped in a t-shirt which discharged, ricocheted on the pavement 12-15 feet away from him and traveled 78 feet away to strike Steinle in the back. Jurors were ultimately convinced there wasn’t any intent on the part of Garcia Zarate to kill Steinle, hence his acquittal. But while that makes sense in the constrained legal sense, the case has prompted much larger questions. At the broadest level, some have attempted to use the case to condemn illegal immigration in general. After news of the verdict broke, President Trump wrote via Twitter, “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.” And it’s true, many people angry with illegal immigration look to cases like this as an example of what goes wrong when people are in the country illegally. But to use such cases as somehow representative of illegal immigration generally is nonsensical. It’s simply dishonest to compare Garcia Zarate to the millions of illegal immigrants who have lived productive lives in the United States, sometimes for decades, become homeowners, raised children and received college educations. To smear all illegal immigrants because of the terrible things a few of them do does nothing to seriously advance realistic, humane solutions to a complicated problem involving millions of people. It’s as useful as condemning all gun owners or white men after virtually every mass shooting. Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and pundits like Sean Hannity have taken to bashing San Francisco and suggesting its refusal to honor a detainer request is why Steinle is dead. While I understand that conservatives like bashing San Francisco, this idea is simply lazy. One could just as easily say Steinle is dead because of marijuana prohibition. After all, if marijuana wasn’t made illegal, there wouldn’t have been a crime for which to send Garcia Zarate to San Francisco in the first place. Or, more practically, one could say that the Bureau of Prisons is responsible because they chose to send Garcia Zarate to San Francisco rather than hold him for ICE. These are more directly relevant than San Francisco not wanting to violate the Fourth Amendment to honor a detainer request they legally don’t have to honor, because, as conservatives should appreciate, state and local law enforcement aren’t supposed to be commandeered by the federal government. While there are various alternate universes we can imagine to prevent Steinle’s death, we ultimately can’t change the past. But we can move forward in a sensible, reasonable manner. Stoking xenophobic delusions of an America under siege, disregarding federalism and attacking all illegal immigrants for the actions of one does nothing to move us forward.

Greeted by news of another mass shooting upon his return from Asia, President Donald Trump appeared to offer condolences for the wrong massacre. “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The F.B.I. and Law Enforcement has [sic] arrived,” Trump tweeted late Tuesday night, hours after a gunman went on a rampage in Northern California, murdering four people and targeting an elementary school. A lockdown procedure at the school prevented the shooter, later identified as Kevin Neal, from killing any children. Twitter users were quick to criticize Trump for appearing to copy and paste the tweet he sent in the wake of a separate tragic shooting, nine days earlier, at a church in Texas in which 26 people were killed. “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The F.B.I. & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan,” Trump wrote earlier this month. Roughly nine hours after the president sent the tweet, it was deleted, with no explanation. View on Twitter Trump’s error only underscored the grim monotony of America’s gun-violence epidemic. The California shooting spree, which also injured 10 others, was only fleetingly covered in the national news, causing barely a ripple in the public consciousness. It also speaks to the nihilism of the Republican Party, which has continually resisted calls to impose stricter regulations on firearms. President Barack Obama made a concerted effort to pass gun-control legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012—in which a young man killed 20 children, seven adults, and himself—but was stymied by congressional Republicans. Following recent mass shootings in Vegas and in Sutherland Springs, Trump also rejected calls for greater gun control and has repeatedly criticized the politicization of tragedies, with the exception of terrorist attacks such as the one that took place in New York City earlier this month. After Vegas—the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history with 58 people dead and 546 injured—the president suggested that it would not be appropriate to talk about how the shooter had acquired his vast personal armory, or what steps might be taken to address the problem. “We’re not going to talk about that today,” Trump told reporters in the days afterward. “We won’t talk about that.” By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

315,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/506443072/0/phoenix/nation~biggest-pop-culture-moments-of/,"From the Oscars mix-up and Wonder Woman craze to the announcement of Beyoncé's babies and the #MeToo movement, a lot has happened in the last 12 months. Here are the top pop culture moments that helped define 2017. What happened: Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked onstage with the wrong envelope and announced that La La Land was best picture, instead of actual winner Moonlight. The La La Land team had already begun thanking people before producer Jordan Horowitz took to the mike to announce the mix-up. “Sorry, guys, hold on. There's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.” Why it was a big deal: The best-picture award is the highest film honor in Hollywood, and an Oscar for Moonlight would’ve been a newsworthy underdog win even if the best-picture announcement was flub-free. The indie film, about a gay man confronting his identity, is the first winner to tell a story primarily about and starring black people that isn’t about racism, the civil rights movement or slavery. More: Here's how the worst flub in Oscar history went down More: Don’t let the Oscars' mix-up ruin legacy of ‘Moonlight’ What happened: Grande was performing at the Manchester Arena in northwestern England in May when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device, killing at least 22 people and injuring more than 100. Why it was a big deal: The tragedy renewed the public's concerns with concert safety, and prompted the Department of Homeland Security to say there is no evidence of credible threats against music venues in the U.S. Grande's sold-out benefit, which was planned after the first terror attack, was held in June. The event became a unifier for thousands of attendees and several guests, including Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. The joy and dancing from the event was so contagious, even a police officer was caught on camera enjoying the music. Grande went on to become one of the most-followed celebrities in 2017, with 22 million new Instagram followers, putting her total at more than 115 million.

Why it was a big deal: The incident has been called the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. It caused performers to cancel tour dates. And it put a spotlight back on issues of live event safety and gun control. However, despite calls for legislative action, proposals including those to expand background checks on firearms haven’t gotten anywhere. The event specifically impacted the world of country music: Jason Aldean, who was performing at the time of the shooting, visited victims in the hospital; The Country Music Association asked journalists not to talk about the tragedy and gun control at the CMAs, but reversed its decision at the urging of Brad Paisley and others; and country stars, including Caleb Keeter, spoke out about gun control for the first time. More: CMA apologizes, lifts media restrictions at CMA Awards More: Las Vegas mass shooting raises new doubts about safety of live entertainment What happened: Men and women spoke out about harassment, using the hashtag #MeToo, in the wake of the news that movie producer Harvey Weinstein was accused by dozens of women of predatory sexual behavior spanning decades, which The New York Times and The New Yorker first reported in October. Harvey Weinstein scandal: A complete list of the 83 accusers Why it was a big deal: The accusations led to Weinstein's downfall: He was fired from the production company he started and figuratively blacklisted. Then, more high-powered Hollywood men fell. The #MeToo movement incited a deluge of sexual harassment and assault allegations. As a result, famous faces in movies, TV and elsewhere, including Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer and Louis CK, have been summarily fired. What happened: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria tore through Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and parts of the Southeast in August and September. The storms caused massive flooding, power outages and devastation for millions. Celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Kevin Hart, J.J. Watt, Ellen Degeneres and the Kardashians challenged others to donate to hurricane aid organizations assisting victims. Lin-Manuel Miranda rounded up fellow Latino artists for the charity song Almost Like Praying to aid Puerto Rico, while Beyoncé, Justin Bieber and Oprah were among the celebs featured at the Hand in Hand telethon for victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Hurricane Harvey: Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' to donate $1 million to J.J.

Lin-Manuel Miranda explains his new song for Puerto Rico, those Trump tweets We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST What happened: Beyoncé took to Instagram in February to announce her pregnancy — with twins! The elaborate photo shoot was the most-liked picture on Instagram for the year, with more than 11.1 million likes, and was only rivaled by her first photo — garnering more than 10.2 million likes — presenting her newborn babies, Rumi and Sir, to the world in July. Why it was a big deal: It’s Queen Bey. What happened: The world’s most eligible royal bachelor was taken off the market in November with the news that he’s engaged to actress Meghan Markle. The announcement came a couple months after the couple made their first appearance together at Harry’s Invictus Games in Toronto. Why it’s a big deal: Markle is the most atypical royal bride ever: She's a divorced, biracial, Jewish American. What happened: Kimmel became the face of health care in entertainment when he opened up about his infant son’s health problems and emotionally pleaded for affordable health care coverage for all. His son, Billy, has had two surgeries to help treat his pre-existing heart condition. Why it was a big deal: Health care reform was one of the tenets of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and major changes to the Affordable Care Act have fallen short in Congress since Trump’s inauguration. Kimmel often used his opening monologues to try to hold the administration and lawmakers accountable. Emotional Jimmy Kimmel discusses baby son's heart surgery What happened: The 1985 novel by Margaret Atwood got a critically acclaimed screen adaptation on Hulu in April. The series, a dystopian tale of a group of women forced to become breeders under a new regime, was seen as more relevant than ever to anti-Trump audiences. Why it’s a big deal: The show struck a chord with viewers. Not only did Handmaid’s Tale win five Emmys, including best drama, but women wore the red robes and white bonnets to courtrooms, and eventually the U.S. Capitol, as a way to protest bills seen as restricting women’s rights.

She also announced a massive 2018 tour. Why it was a big deal: Swift’s album sold more than 1.2 million copies in its first week, becoming 2017’s fastest and best-selling album. How Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' beat streaming to become 2017's best-selling album What happened: Kendall Jenner appeared in a tone-deaf ad for Pepsi, which showed the model joining a protest in the streets and handing a police officer a can of the soda to help calm the tension. The wildly negative response to the ad caused Pepsi to pull the commercial and issue an apology. Why it was a big deal: The commercial appeared to make light of serious issues and the Black Lives Matter movement. Having Jenner — who has been accused of cultural appropriation along with other members of her famous family — at the center of the ad did not help. And it was problematic for Jenner, who became the highest-paid model of the year and top model as far as mentions on Tumblr. Twitter takes Pepsi to task over tone-deaf Kendall Jenner ad What happened: Millions of women, and men, marched in Washington, Los Angeles, New York and other cities across the world in January as a direct response to Trump's inauguration. The attendees marched to advocate for legislation involving women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and immigration reform, among other issues. Hundreds of celebrities joined the cause, speaking on stage at the various marches and walking alongside attendees. Why it was a big deal: The marches helped lay the foundation for the current #MeToo movement, creating an environment where women could speak openly about their experiences and sparking other marches against injustices. The most memorable quotes from the Women's March on Washington ❤️ #Repost @arod ・・・ Happy Birthday to Us!!! #leos 🇩🇴🇵🇷 #305 A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jul 23, 2017 at 3:01am PDT What happened: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala in May, and it’s been nothing but cute Instagram photos and loving interviews about their relationship ever since. The picture that Lopez re-posted from Rodriguez was her most-liked picture on Instagram for the year, picking up more than 1.6 million likes. Why it was a big deal: There have been a lot of tragedies in 2017, so romance between two of the world’s biggest stars is a silver lining. Inside Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez' lavish 'baecation' What happened: In March, Netflix released the first season of 13 Reasons Why, the adaptation of a 2007 novel about a high school girl, Hannah, who commits suicide and leaves a series of tapes explaining the lead-up to her death. The show immediately became a talker on social media. Why it’s a big deal: The show sparked fears around the way suicide was depicted, and of teenage viewers making light of Hannah's death. The meme “welcome to your tape” was born. Meanwhile, the show encouraged families to have serious discussions of teen suicide after many viewers complained about the way the topic was handled. The controversial series has been renewed for a second season. What happened: Wonder Woman became the best-reviewed DC Universe film and a box-office hero when it hit theaters in May. The Gal Gadot-led film already has a sequel in the works. Why it's a big deal: Wonder Woman had the biggest opening ever for a movie directed by a woman with a $100.5 million debut, and presented a turning point for female representation on the big screen. Seeing the feminist film became an event, with fans dressing in Wonder Woman garb and posting about the movie to social media. Wonder Woman was the most-talked-about movie on Tumblr, and Gal Gadot was the second-most-popular actress mentioned on the social media site.

316,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/aND1Zin6A7w/index.html,"Do Not Sell On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein cited the recent Texas mass shooting as an example of why encryption backdoors -- or ways to circumvent security and privacy protocols -- are necessary. The tech company said it offered to help the FBI after the agency said it could not unlock the phone of Texas shooter Devin Kelley. He is accused of killing 26 people and then himself at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday. ""Our team immediately reached out to the FBI after learning from their press conference on Tuesday that investigators were trying to access a mobile phone,"" Apple (AAPL) said in a statement. ""We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us."" A source familiar with the matter confirmed the phone was an iPhone. The FBI declined to comment. The source told CNN that law enforcement agencies did not contact Apple for help within 48 hours after the shooting. Consequently, investigators may have lost crucial time that could have helped them investigate the shooter's phone. The 48-hour window In theory, law enforcement could have used the shooter's fingerprint, even if deceased, to unlock the device in the hours following the incident. Researchers have previously shown it's possible to easily spoof the fingerprint sensor if you have a clay replica of the person's finger. The FBI would not need Apple's assistance to unlock the phone in this manner. If the the agency had called Apple, the company may have suggested this method. However, it's unclear whether the shooter had Touch ID enabled. But the fingerprint scanner no longer works if the iPhone hasn't been unlocked for 48 hours -- Apple then requires users to input a passcode. Some Android phones have similar time limits before requiring a passcode to unlock. Apple has featured the 48-hour time limit since rolling out Touch ID in 2013. Its decision to frequently require the passcode helps people remember the security key. iPhone users must also enter the passcode to do things like update their software. Related: DOJ grows frustrated with tech firms over encryption Other methods Some security experts have speculated the Texas incident could further the debate on encryption backdoors. California Senator Dianne Feinstein reportedly wants to revisit proposed legislation to require tech firms to share encrypted messages if given a warrant, according to a Politico report. The encryption issue came to a head in 2015 following the San Bernardino terror attack. Apple CEO Tim Cook very publicly pushed back on the FBI's order to create software that could unlock one of the shooter's iPhones. ""In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,"" Cook wrote in a letter. Ultimately, the FBI found an alternative solution to get the information needed: it paid around $1 million to hack that iPhone. Anyone, including law enforcement, can buy hacking tools to break into phones and computers. But, as witnessed in the case of the iPhone hack, these tools can be expensive. Security experts believe the Texas shooting case is different. There is no suggestion of co-conspirators and it won't end up in court, said Nicholas Weaver, lecturer in the computer science department at UC Berkeley. Weaver said there are other ways for law enforcement to get similar data to what you would get unlocking an iPhone. For example, law enforcement can compel Apple to provide iCloud backups of information stored on the phone and disable the remote wipe feature. Tech companies such as Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) can also provide chat logs or other information when compelled by law enforcement. Further, cell phone providers can hand over data related to location and with whom a criminal is exchanging texts. Law enforcement can also get information from message recipients. Another workaround: If someone backs up a phone to a computer, it's possible to get the data from the computer instead. Weaver said computers tend to be weaker in terms of preventing analysis without a password. Apple said the company works with law enforcement every day. Its latest transparency report said law enforcement requests range from asking for information about stolen credit cards to account purchase history. The report also revealed law enforcement submitted 4,479 device-based requests and 1,692 account requests from Apple during the first half of 2017. The company provided data 80% of the time for device requests and and 84% for account inquiries. During the same time frame, Twitter received 2,111 account information requests from the U.S. government and turned over at least some information 77% of the time. ""We offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple,"" the company said in a statement.

319,https://theintercept.com/2017/11/14/las-vegas-shooting-gun-sales/,"© First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Mass shootings have in recent years been followed by a predictable cycle: Politicians raise the potential for gun control policies, and gun industry-funded groups respond by exaggerating the reach of gun control, sending people into a gun-buying frenzy. Every mass shooting is effectively transformed into an opportunity for profit. But following the October 1 mass murder in Las Vegas, which took the lives of 58 people and left 546 others injured, that cycle seems to have broken. And gun companies and their investors have noticed. Sturm, Ruger & Company, one of the largest gun manufacturers in America, had its most recent earnings call on November 1. On the call, Rommel Dionisio, an analyst with Aegis Capital, asked if the gun industry had reaped any additional sales from the “incidents in Las Vegas.” Specifically, he asked whether an increase in gun purchasing comparable to “demand spikes after San Bernardino and Orlando a year ago” had occurred. Christopher Killoy, chief executive of Sturm Ruger, said the Las Vegas shooting was “obviously a very tragic event,” but his sales team had not noted “any impact.” Listen to the exchange here: A similar conversation took place on the November 9 earnings call for Compass Diversified Holdings, a firm that owns a firearms accessory company. One analyst asked Compass partner Elias Sabo if “fairly significant firearms incidents recently” have had “an effect on demand.” Sabo said that the firm has not seen a spike in sales. In the past, Sabo noted, “There was a different tone being discussed surrounding gun control, and that doesn’t appear to be the case right now.” He added: “I don’t think that our country has become desensitized to these types of incidents, but perhaps they have, which would be pretty stunning. But I think it’s more likely attributable to the lack of discussion surrounding change in gun laws, which I think really spurred a lot of demand post the incidents that you reference.” Listen to the exchange here: During former President Barack Obama’s time in office, Democrats proposed more than 100 gun control measures, many of which were debated in direct response to mass shootings. Those proposals were often followed by statements from the National Rifle Association, which responded by exaggerating the reach of gun control, claiming that heightened background checks or limits on high-powered rifles would lead to gun confiscation and social unrest. Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump signaled quickly after the Las Vegas massacre that they would not take up significant gun control laws. While some Democratic lawmakers have called for reform, their minority status in Washington, D.C., sharply reduces the probability for legislative success. As The Intercept has reported, the gun industry has long boasted that its role in politics and its response to mass shootings has boosted profits. “The gun business was very much accelerated based on what happened after the election and then the tragedy that happened at Sandy Hook,” Ed Stack, chief executive of Dick’s Sporting Goods, a major gun retailer, boasted at a Goldman Sachs conference in 2014. Smith & Wesson executive James Debney, speaking at the Roth Capital Partners conference in 2013, noted that “the tragedy in Newtown and the legislative landscape” resulted in sales that were “significantly up.” The “fear and uncertainty that there might be increased gun control,” he added, “drove many new people to buy firearms for the first time.” After the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the NRA issued a stern statement opposing new regulations on firearms. The NRA, notably, is firmly ingrained into the business model of gun companies. Smith & Wesson, on its earnings call last year, disclosed a “$1 million contribution to the NRA” political fund as a quarterly operating expense for the firm. In other words, gun companies count donations to the NRA as essential payments just as critical as paying staff and other expenses.

There was also a restraining order issued issued in February that prohibited the shooter from owning guns. The two homemade AR-15 type semiautomatic rifles were made from parts the shooter, Kevin Janson Neal, purchased, said Phil Johnston, Tehama County’s assistant sheriff. “These firearms were manufactured illegally, we believe, by him at his home,” Johnston said Wednesday. “So they (the guns) were obtained in an illegal manner, not through a legal process. They are not registered.” More: California mass shooting suspect killed wife, hid body day before rampage, officials say Previously: Gunman kills at least 4, wounds 10, in Northern California More: Texas shooter allowed to buy weapons after Air Force failed to flag him In addition to the two rifles sheriff’s deputies found during the shooting investigation, Johnston said the 44-year-old also had two handguns that were not registered to him. Neal went on a shooting rampage Tuesday morning, killing four people and wounding 10 others, including at least two children. No children were killed, even though Neal apparently rammed the gate of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and fired numerous shots at buildings. Neal was killed during a shootout with deputies while he was trying to flee in a stolen vehicle.

323,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/why-were-still-in-the-dark-about-facebooks-fight-against-fake-news/,"Mother Jones illustration Just hours after the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas earlier this month, conspiracy theories connecting the perpetrator, Devin Kelley, to far-left antifa groups started spreading rapidly online. What first began as speculation on Twitter started becoming a commonly accepted theory after being shared by some of the most high-profile conspiracy theorists on the right, including Mike Cernovich and InfoWars‘ Alex Jones. The theory gained so much traction that tweets promoting it appeared at the top of Google searches and typing in “Devin Kelley” led to auto-complete suggestions that included “antifa.” The day of the shooting, the connection also became the basis for a story by YourNewsWire. Though the website resembles a legitimate news site, it’s actually been known to repeatedly push false reporting in the past, including the infamous Pizzagate scandal last December. This specific story incorrectly claimed that Kelley was one of two shooters at the church and, through a supposed eyewitness account, falsely stated that Kelley had vowed to start a communist revolution. The site also created an image that showed a doctored version of Kelley’s Facebook account, with an antifa flag photoshopped in. The story and accompanying images were soon picked up by other outlets, including RT, and shared across social media platforms and on YouTube. The Devin Kelley-antifa claims were almost immediately debunked, first in a Facebook post by Antifa United, which said the photo of the flag was taken from its online store, and soon after by BuzzFeed, Snopes, and PolitiFact. Nevertheless, YourNewsWire‘s story continued to make the rounds on social media for days after the shooting. Though some of the Facebook posts sharing the story are no longer available, the YourNewsWire story has been liked, commented, or shared on Facebook more than 267,000 times, far outnumbering engagement on any other platform, according to analytics site BuzzSumo. Just how quickly—and prominently—this bogus story spread highlights how difficult it has been for social media companies, and Facebook specifically, to combat misinformation, despite high-profile, positive-PR-generating efforts to do so. Last December, after initially downplaying the amount of misinformation that existed on the platform, Facebook announced it would partner with third-party organizations to fact-check stories posted to people’s feeds. But 11 months into the initiative, misinformation and conspiracy theories continue to proliferate and reach huge audiences on the platform, and Facebook has released very little data publicly to show how its efforts might be working. The result is an enterprise lacking transparency and a public still in the dark about whether the items on their news feeds is legitimate. “The honest answer is that we don’t know [if the checking is working] because Facebook hasn’t shared real data about it,” says Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, which vets Facebook’s fact-checking partners. “Until we get a sense of what the traffic was for viral hoaxes before and after this tool was put into place, we can’t evaluate it. We can’t understand what’s happened.” Buzzfeed compiled screenshots of sites that shared the Devin Kelley antifa story. Buzzfeed In announcing the initiative last year, Facebook developed partnerships with several media organizations, such as ABCNews, Snopes, PolitiFact, and Fact.Check.org, to fact-check stories on its platform. The way it works is fairly straightforward: Once Facebook determines a story might be false—either from a user reporting it, comments under the story, or other signals—it gets added to a dashboard accessible to fact-checkers at these organizations. After two fact-checkers mark a story as false, the story is visibly flagged for users on Facebook as “disputed by third-party fact-checkers.” Facebook’s algorithm starts demoting the story on news feeds, but does not remove content outright unless it violates community standards. That’s more or less the extent of the public understanding. The only data Facebook has provided so far comes from an internal email leaked to BuzzFeed in October, which Facebook subsequently confirmed: Once a fact-checker rates a story as false, future impressions of the story are reduced by 80 percent. It’s unclear how many stories, however, have actually been disputed on the platform. One of the issues the email highlights is that the process of surfacing a story and marking it as false can take more than three days. But as Jason White, who oversees Facebook’s news partnerships, wrote in the leaked email, “[W]e know most of the impressions typically happen in that initial time period.” An example of a disputed story. Facebook Since Facebook launched the fact-checking project, a number of critics have warned that the effort does not go far enough. A study from two Yale researchers recently argued that flagging a post as “disputed” does little to stop people from believing a story’s claims: Readers are only 3.7 percent less likely to believe a story after seeing the flag. (A Dartmouth study, however, found the effect to be somewhat larger.) The Yale study also noted that, in some cases, the “disputed” flag could even make some groups more willing to believe the story. Even the journalists working as Facebook’s fact-checkers have expressed frustration with the lack of available data how their efforts might be minimizing the spread of false information, according to a recent Guardian article. “I don’t feel like it’s working at all. The fake information is still going viral and spreading rapidly,” said one fact-checker who spoke anonymously. “They think of us as doing their work for them. They have a big problem, and they are leaning on other organizations to clean up after them.” One source added it was rare for stories to get a “disputed” tag, even after a fact-check, according to the Guardian, and Facebook had not provided any data internally as to how often stories are actually getting tagged. Making matters even more complicated is that several organizations known for peddling viral hoaxes are verified on Facebook, with a blue checkmark indicating that they’re an authentic public figure, media company, or brand. Individuals or media companies can request verification badges by providing government issued ID or tax documents. (Businesses are verified with a gray checkmark and have a simpler verification process, only requiring a publicly-listed phone number.) Even if these verification badges aren’t meant to endorse a publication’s content, Media Matters for America president Angelo Carusone argues that the badges can help facilitate the spreading of misinformation by making a page, and the information it shares, seem more authentic than it really is. “Intuitively, it’s persuasive. People are going to see [these groups] as legitimate publishers,” says Carusone. “If you have a choice between two unknown publications, and one has a checkmark, most people are going to go with the one with a blue checkmark. We’ve been programmed to believe that verification implies some kind of credential, and I do believe that helps [fake news sites] grow.” YourNewsWire, for instance, shared the Kelley-antifa story through one of its verified Facebook pages, “The People’s Voice,” garnering around 5,400 shares through that post alone. Though that post is no longer available, another post promoting the YourNewsWire story, posted from a different Facebook page, remains on the platform. YourNewsWire‘s Facebook page was also previously verified as a business, but has since lost its verification. (As of writing, Facebook had not responded to a inquiry asking why.) A post from YourNewsWire that is still up on Facebook as of Nov 16. Screenshot via Facebook A screenshot of The People’s Voice Facebook page, which is listed as YourNewsWire‘s owner and regularly posts stories from the site. Screenshot via Facebook YourNewsWire‘s Facebook page, which used to be verified as a business. Screenshot via Facebook Twitter, notably, suspended all of its verification processes last week after criticism over its verification of Jason Kessler, a white nationalist blogger who organized the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance,” the company’s support account tweeted last week. “We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it.” On Wednesday, Twitter modified its verification requirements and began removing verification badges from some users, including Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, and Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator. The company says it will no longer accept requests for verification as it works on a “new program [it is] are proud of.” A Facebook spokesperson tells Mother Jones that the company takes combating fake news seriously and there is no “silver bullet” to fighting misinformation. The spokesperson, who asked to be identified generally as a spokesperson per Facebook policy, mentioned that Facebook has introduced a number of initiatives in addition to partnering with third-party fact-checkers, including providing tips on how users can spot false information and showing a selection of related articles under a story to provide more context. And in August, Facebook said it would also block pages that repeatedly share false information from advertising on the platform. Though Facebook does not comment on specific pages, it says it does remove verification badges if a page violates one of Facebook’s policies. The spokesperson also says Facebook is “encouraged by the continued success of [its] fact-checking partnerships” and that it will provide an update on the initiative before the end of the year. Beginning in 2018, it plans to send more regular updates to its partners. “We are going to keep working to find new ways to help our community make more informed decisions about what they read and share,” the spokesperson tells Mother Jones. Few experts advocate removing or censoring content outright, but argue that there’s still more Facebook could do. Media Matters’ Carusone says it could include disclaimer requirements for certain pages, for instance, or exercise more discretion in its verification process. Carusone doesn’t want censorship, he says, but insists that Facebook shouldn’t be privileging sites that are repeatedly abusing its algorithms. “They shouldn’t let bad actors cheat the system and create more chaos simply because they don’t want to be perceived as biased,” says Carusone. Poynter’s Mantzarlis says that while it’s helpful that Facebook is “targeting the worst of the worst” and going after fully-fabricated content, the real issue is that it still needs to be much more transparent about its processes. He also points out that the fact-checking project doesn’t tackle content such as memes or videos, which is often how viral hoaxes are spread. Content on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, may also have a far bigger influence in spreading misinformation than previously calculated. “I think there are people at Facebook who care about this issue,” Mantzarlis says, “but until we see the data, we’re stuck.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

324,http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/the-punisher-review-netflix-marvel/,"Netflix never officially delayed the premiere date for The Punisher, but that was only because the date hadn’t been publicly announced before the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas. As Punisher star Jon Bernthal has admitted, “We put the premiere of this show off because of the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas. We did that out of respect. I think it was the right decision.” The series will debut this Friday, less than two weeks after another mass shooting, this time at a Texas church where the gunman reportedly wore black tactical gear, like the Punisher, and a mask with a skull on it, like the emblem on the Punisher’s torso. Given the similarities — including the fact that the Punisher, aka Frank Castle, is an unstable man with an arsenal of automatic weapons he uses to vent his rage on the people he blames for his unhappiness — it’s surprising at first blush that Netflix didn’t push back the premiere some more. But as another Netflix show, the great animated comedy BoJack Horseman, pointed out in a biting satirical episode earlier this year — titled, naturally, “Thoughts and Prayers,” and involving a violent movie whose release kept being pushed back due to a rash of eerily similar real-life shootings — our country has reached a sad point where there will never not be a time when a fictional drama like this won’t evoke a painfully recent American nightmare. Frank Castle is always going to be a guy who has a lot of guns and little compunction about using them, and the show’s opening credits sequence is a slow-motion parade of fetishistic images of weapons and bullets, climaxing in the skull logo being comprised of a bunch of assault rifles. In the series’ opening sequence, we see Frank kill people with a sniper rifle, a pickup truck, and a necktie (the last one played as a joke about two earwitnesses who think Frank and his victim are having rough sex in a men’s room stall). It is what it is, and delaying it yet again would simply mean it would be associated with the next massacre we’re all upset about instead of the one that just happened. The thought of that is more wearying than The Punisher itself is, though for the most part the series — created by Hannibal veteran Steve Lightfoot — trends towards the weaker, duller end of the Marvel/Netflix spectrum, possessing most of the common sins of its predecessors, good and bad, and fewer virtues than the good ones have. That opening montage of mayhem is presented as Frank doing One Last Job — or Several Last Jobs — as he takes out the rest of the mobsters who killed his family, as explained when Bernthal first played the character in Daredevil season two. After that, Lightfoot and company not only slow the story waaaaay down, but essentially start it over from scratch. The things Frank did on Daredevil still happened, and Deborah Ann Woll’s Karen Page pops up now and again to worry about him and try to talk him off his violent path, but we very slowly find out that everything we thought we knew was wrong, and that the people Frank really needs to get revenge on are part of a secret cabal involving the Marines, the CIA, Homeland Security, and perhaps a private military contractor called Anvil. Like an anvil, The Punisher is not subtle. Frank reads Moby Dick, so we can understand that he’s a man who has given his whole life over to revenge, and a friend warns him, “The only person you’re punishing is yourself!” As has unfortunately been the case with Daredevil and the Marvel shows that followed it, Punisher has many more episodes than story to fill them with. Though Netflix provided critics with the whole first season in advance, I ran out of patience after six episodes; they featured maybe enough material to justify three episodes, and probably two. Where the early shows like Jessica Jones and Luke Cage tended to start strong before running out of steam, the last few like this, Iron Fist and Defenders, have simply started slowly and then meandered from there. To fill time, and give Bernthal people to talk to when he’s not a one-man killing machine, the writers assign him a sidekick in fugitive intelligence analyst David “Micro” Lieberman (Girls alum Ebon Moss-Bachrach, playing a character usually known in the comics — because he was created in the 1980s — as Microchip), and have him periodically intersect with players in the conspiracy, plus Dinah Madani (Amber Rose Revah) as the requisite law-enforcement agent who will no doubt realize over the season (as Misty Knight did on Luke Cage) that sometimes you have to send a vigilante in to do the things a man or woman with a badge can’t. At times it almost seems as if the creative team’s heart isn’t in the grim-n-gritty of it all, and we’ll get stretches of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang-style buddy comedy where Micro’s chatty, neurotic ways get on Frank’s nerves, while Micro is stunned by how casually Frank kills people. (“There’s a dead man in a wheelbarrow out there,” he complains at one point; “I didn’t do that,” shrugs Frank.) And just as Jessica Jones became a rape parable, while Luke Cage used its superhero trappings to tackle issues within and without the black community, Punisher tries to carve a niche for itself by dealing with veterans’ issues. Frank admits he was more comfortable fighting in Afghanistan than home with his family, and his disabled buddy Curtis (Jason Moore) runs a support group for fellow veterans dealing with PTSD or other difficulties integrating back into civilian life. It’s hard to blame Lightfoot and company for casting their attention elsewhere, given how rote the conspiracy plot is. Even when that story brings in actors like Paul Schulze or C. Thomas Howell or Clancy Brown to liven things up for a few scenes, the actual details seem designed to erase themselves from your memory before you’ve even finished learning them. Every other episode or so, there will be a creative bit of action — a fight where Frank has only a sledgehammer while his opponents have guns, or a Bullitt-inspired chase between two muscle cars — but none are thrilling enough to justify all the disposable bits of exposition that come in between them. The Punisher wasn’t part of Marvel and Netflix’s initial plan, which was simply to do shows featuring each of the four solo heroes before bringing them together in Defenders. Bernthal’s intense brooding won him many fans in the middle of the uneven second season of Daredevil, and prompted the powers that be to call an audible and give him a spinoff. But — as was the case with both Iron Fist and ABC’s disastrous Inhumans — nobody seems to have had anything but the most superficial take on how to write this guy and build an entire show around him. Despite his enduring popularity among comics fans — whose devotion helped transform him from a one-note ’70s Spider-Man villain into an endlessly resourceful anti-hero — Frank Castle has never lent himself particularly well to the screen. There have been movies made starring Dolph Lundgren, Thomas Jane, and Ray Stevenson as Frank, which ranged from disappointments to outright flops at the box office, in part because a live-action Frank tends to come across as a more glum, less colorful Batman. Even on the page, he can be monotonous: the best Punisher comic of this century, the Garth Ennis-scripted Punisher Max, tended to treat him as a supporting character in his own book, and/or like Godzilla: there to rain destruction down on the characters developed enough to feel more like real people. Bernthal’s Punisher isn’t Batman or Godzilla, but he’s not hugely dynamic, either. Lightfoot tries to emphasize the combat veteran part of his origin and nature wherever possible, but this Frank just seems grumpy most of the time, except for the rare instances where we get to see him fully in action. Bernthal moves fluidly and look natural with guns and other props — there’s a reason he keeps being cast as tough guys in projects like this or Baby Driver or The Walking Dead — but the wave of bland supporting characters (which also includes Ben Barnes from Westworld as another ex-Marine) seem as much about Frank being too thin for the vessel in which he’s been placed as about the story being the same. It’s a conundrum: The Punisher is most effective when its title character is indiscriminately slaughtering his foes, but that’s also when it most consistently evokes the kinds of real-life horrors that pushed the premiere back once, and could have kept pushing it back indefinitely. There may hopefully be a time when Frank’s actions don’t instantly recall horrors from our world, but that version of his story will still need to be told much more compellingly than this.

325,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/0_tVbCs4FQg/,"As though we do not already have enough proof that the American media is nothing less than a rolling clown car packed with deviants, sycophants, and propagandists, in His infinite wisdom and generosity, the Good Lord used all of last week to reveal once again just who these terrible people truly are. ABC Tanks the Stock Market with Fake News Are we at a point yet where “BrianRossing” is now a verb that describes a left-wing reporter (but I repeat myself) rushing before a network news camera to spread flat-out lies? Or maybe “BrianRossing” should be used to describe the consequences of that behavior — such as a month off to enjoy the holidays. Back in 2012, Ross, a marquee reporter for ABC, could not wait to falsely blame a Tea Partier for a horrific mass-shooting in a Colorado movie theater. Fast-forward to last Friday, and this very same Ross could not wait to tell the world that candidate Trump issued orders to get in touch with the Russians — which would prove Trump must be impeached for colluding with said Russians. The only problem is that none of that was true. Nevertheless, ABC News took all day, seven full hours, before issuing a “clarification.” Not a retraction or correction — a clarification. Did I mention that ABC’s fake news tanked the stock market? MSNBC’s Favorite Homophobe Between 2007-2009, in what is unquestionably the most blatant and inexcusable act of homophobia attached to any single person currently working in the legitimate media, NBC’s Joy Reid — who anchors a show at MSNBC but has appeared on NBC News programs like Meet the Press — authored somewhere around a dozen articles that committed two breathtaking sins… 1) Without any proof, she outed then-Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist as gay. 2) The left-wing Reid ridiculed and demeaned Crist for being gay. Writing for her online Reid Report, and hurling nicknames like “Miss Charlie,” the NBC News star repeatedly and mercilessly attempted to denigrate Crist over his sexuality. She even questioned his marriage: “Now that he’s married to a girl,” Reid wrote, “Charlie Crist is being sought out for all KINDS of good stuff… [The GOP] are wooing Miss Charlie to run.” “I can just see poor Charlie on the honeymoon, ogling the male waiters and thinking to himself, ‘god, do I actually have to see her naked…?’,” she added. Naturally, after getting caught by the left-wing Mediaite, Reid apologized Monday, and because her politics are “correct,’ that apology will be good enough for a mainstream media that has no scruples, decency, or integrity. But in an effort to save Reid, a cherished member of the anti-Trump Resistance, no one wants to discuss the full context of her monstrous behavior. At the time, Reid’s homophobic attacks on Crist were all part of a concerted effort on the left to kill his presidential aspirations. After 2008, this smear campaign went nuclear to protect Barack Obama’s re-election chances. Because Crist was seen as a comer, an inevitable 2012 presidential candidate, and the popular governor of a crucial swing state, the left went so far as to produce and release a theatrical documentary as a means to (falsely) out him as gay. Moreover, Reid was not some young, immature blogger when she did this. Rather, she was a 40 year-old woman with more than ten years of journalism under her belt. Again, Crist, who is now a Democrat congressman, has been married twice, both times to women. There is absolutely no proof he is a homosexual. This was a straight-up smear campaign. Regardless, no one at NBC News will ever again have the moral authority to lecture anyone about anything, much less homophobia. The Failing New York Times and Very-Fake-News-CNN Openly Join The Resistance Speaking of coming out… Although the left-wing New York Times itself avoided paying any taxes in 2014 and has spent years railing against big corporations influencing our political system, last week this very same tax-dodging big corporation took full advantage (if only in spirit) of the Supreme Court’s Citizen United decision with an all-out partisan assault against the tax reform bill that ended up passing in the U.S. Senate. Going way above and beyond an editorial, the Times launched a full-fledged Resistance Campaign to kill the bill. On its print and web pages, and through social media, the Times went so far as to publish the phone numbers of senators and urged its readers to call and demand a “vote against the Senate tax bill because it would increase the deficit by more than $1.4 trillion.” Yes, after eight years of their Precious Barry doubling 230 years of national debt all on his own, suddenly the Times is worried about deficits. Over at CNN, national laughingstock and White House correspondent/preener Jim Acosta spoke at the Poynter Journalism Ethics Summit and proved that entire concept a joke by calling on his fellow preeners “to resist” Trump. “Acosta says reporters are not a part of the ‘resistance,’ but adds: ‘When journalists are attacked, journalists have to resist,'” Politico’s Cristiano Lima reported. NBC News’ (alleged) Pervert Sex toys and James Bond door-locks;  a woman bent over a chair and “harassed” until she passed out out — allegedly. This is the 20 year face of NBC’s Today Show, the 20 year face of NBC News, the man paid $25 million annually to be that face, the alleged serial predator given an office hidden away in some dark corner of 30 Rockefeller… The MSM’s Pervert-Enablers And with Matt Lauer we have been told — just as we were with NBC/ABC/Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin and the New York Times/Politico’s Glenn Thrush and CBS’s Charlie Rose and countless others — that everyone knew! about Lauer.

According to a report last week, this includes current CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who, in various roles,  oversaw the Today Show for well over a decade. — So take a good look at your mainstream media, folks… And what you will see is nothing less than an institution little different from the mafia, one populated only by liars, propagandists, homophobic smear-merchants, activists, perverts, abusers, and their enablers.

        Claudia Koerner Last updated on December 4, 2017, at 7:32 p.m. ET Posted on December 4, 2017, at 6:55 p.m. ET A 69-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after allegedly planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Florida mosque, authorities announced Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said his office received a tip in late October that Bernandino Bolatete had expressed ""strong anti-Islamic sentiment"" and planned a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover detective began speaking to Bolatete and other state and federal agencies began to take steps to prevent an attack. According to court records, the detective became friendly with Bolatete, a Philippine national who has a green card, at a local shooting range. Bolatete confessed his failing health — the result of being shot in the kidney by a police officer in the Philippines years ago. Bolatete claimed to have killed the officer who shot him, court records said, and he also described his own prowess with firearms. In one conversation, the detective and Bolatete drove past the mosque on their way to the firing range. Bolatete said he expected bad news about his remaining kidney at an upcoming doctor's appointment and would then go to the mosque to kill worshippers, according to a transcript of the conversation in court documents: ""I have to bring my ... my long guns there and uh, stay at that, uh, tower. Keep shooting those Muslims, you know, on Friday. (laughing)"" Bolatete revealed he had considered how to access the minaret at the Islamic center, the documents said. And he told the detective he had five rifles. ""So we'll try ... we will try a Christian doing uh, terroristic [sic] act this time, hum, to the Muslims the, they [laughing] they doing it all the time. You know?"" he said, according to the court records. On a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Bolatete, he described himself as a shooting sport enthusiast and posted multiple photos of himself at a gun range. At least one post contained anti-Muslim propaganda — a fake news story headlined ""EVIL: Radical Muslims Rape, Make Woman Quote Quran, But How They 'Finish Her Off' Is the Worst."" In another conversation, the detective told a story about a Muslim man who hadn't paid him for work on the man's home. Bolatete offered advice to the detective on how to kill the man and get away with it, according to the court documents. On Nov. 24, the detective mentioned a friend was selling a firearm silencer. Three days later, Bolatete asked the detective if the silencer was still for sale because he ""might need it,"" court records said. Bolatete said he did not want to fill out paperwork to register the silencer because it would give authorities the right to search him, court records said. Bolatete was charged Friday on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm silencer, a federal offense. The purchase of the silencer was captured on an audio recording, according to court records. A Jacksonville Sheriff's Office SWAT team recovered it from Bolatete as they searched the room he was renting in a local home. The FBI then informed leaders at the Islamic center about the alleged plans as well as Bolatete's arrest. At no time during the investigation was anyone at the mosque at risk, FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. If convicted, Bolatete would face up to 10 years in prison, and he could still be charged with other offenses related to his alleged plans. A civil rights investigation is ongoing, Spencer added. ""[The FBI's mission] includes enforcing civil rights statutes and protecting the public’s right to exercise freedom of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" he said. ""A civil rights investigation is ongoing. The FBI will not stand for threats of violence in our community against any group, and we will protect the freedoms the Constitution provides."" The local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations praised the arrest of Bolatete, saying the attack he allegedly hoped to commit was an act of terrorism. ""This should concern not only Muslims, but all Florida residents regardless of faith,"" CAIR-Florida communications director Wilfredo Ruiz said in a statement. ""CAIR-Florida continues to work closely with our community to keep them safe by providing security training sessions in mosques and other locations throughout the state.""

A gunman wearing all black armed with an assault rifle opened fire on a small-town Texas church during Sunday morning services, killing 26 people and wounding 20 more in the last mass shooting to shock the United States. A cat walks past a bouquet of flowers at the base of a roadblock where law enforcement officials work at the scene of a shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Monday, Nov. 6, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A man opened fire inside the church in the small South Texas community on Sunday, killing more than 20 and wounding otherds. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) SUTHERLAND SPRINGS — Crystal Marie Hill was a young widow with five children when John Porter Holcombe married her in 2012 and they celebrated at First Baptist Church here. On Sunday in that same church, Crystal Holcombe, 36, was gunned down along with three of her five children from her earlier marriage. She was pregnant with the beloved and much-wanted sixth baby with her spouse of five years. John Holcombe, 39, who was injured in the mass shooting but survived, has lost “just about everything,” said John Hill, 62, Crystal’s first father in-law, who continued to love her like a daughter. When Devin Patrick Kelley took out his assault rifle and killed 26 people and wounded 20 more, he tore into deep and loving family bonds in this small, rural community. The extended Holcombe family was particularly devastated. In all, nine of them, spanning three generations of Holcombes — officials in Texas count Crystal’s unborn child as a victim — died Sunday. Associate Pastor Bryan Holcombe, 60, was leading the service in place of Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who was out of town. Holcombe died with his wife, Karla, 58. Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36, was also killed, along with their grandchild Noah. At age 18 months, she was the second-youngest victim. Then there was Crystal and her three children — Emily Hill, Megan Hill and Greg Hill, who were between the ages of 9 and 13. Bryan and Karla Holcombe lived on a ranch in Floresville and owned American Canvas Works, which was on one of the main retail streets in town for more than 15 years. They recently donated the building to a different church so it could build a youth center. Previously, they had donated land to Harvest Christian Church for a sanctuary, which is next door to the canvas shop. “They were happy people who never had a negative thing to say,” said Jim Miller, owner of Eagle Ford Signs, around the corner from the Holcombes’ shop, which creates canvas covers for trailers. “They were dedicated to their ministry and their grandkids,” he said. Three weeks ago, Miller watched the Holcombes haul equipment and other things out of their shop so the church could start creating the youth center. “They were selfless people,” Miller said. “Even when politics started getting ugly, you couldn’t get Bryan to say anything negative. He’d just smile.” The Stockdale home of Crystal and John Holcombe is a tidy, aqua-colored house with dormers and chickens and dogs roaming about the front yard. They were married exactly one year after her first husband, Peter Hill, died of a heart attack at age 30. John Holcombe was “a heck of a man to marry a widow with five kids. They called him their ‘old dad new dad,’” said Hill, Peter’s dad. Crystal Holcombe was a “loving mother and wonderful-hearted woman,” he added. “I call (John Holcombe) my ‘outlaw in-law son,’” Hill said. Crystal Holcombe’s two other children, a 15-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter, have now lost both of their parents. The daughter was grazed by a bullet; the son was not in church that day. L.E. Stephens, who lives several houses down on the long rural road, said she didn’t know Crystal Holcombe but that the two waved at each other. “It’s just horrible, what happened,” Stephens said. Neighbor Michelle Garza, whose husband, Joe Garza, grew up in Sutherland Springs and knows the Holcombe family, said the kids were all well-behaved and raised to be respectful. Joe Garza’s cousin was wounded in the shooting. Though Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were traveling out of state Sunday, their daughter Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, 14, was not spared. Three members of another family died: Joann Ward and two daughters, Brooke Ward, 5, and Emily Garcia, 7. A 5-year-old son, Ryland Ward, was shot four times and was in critical condition. Among those who died were two couples with connections to the Air Force. R. Scott Marshall and Karen Marshall had retired to La Vernia and were trying out churches when they visited First Baptist for the first time. Karen Marshall had recently returned to Texas after finishing an assignment at Maryland’s Andrews AFB. Scott Marshall was retired from the Air Force and had been working as a civilian contractor and mechanic at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. The couple met while they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. Robert Corrigan, a staff development instructor in education and training for WellMed, and his wife, Shani Brauher Corrigan, also died in the church. He was a 29-year veteran of the Air Force who retired as chief master sergeant and group superintendent for the 55th Medical Group at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. He joined WellMed in October 2015 and was based at The Oaks in San Antonio. The couple, who lived in Floresville, were high school sweethearts from northern Michigan. Funeral homes in the area reportedly are providing coffins at no charge so families burying their loved ones will have one less stress.

Kennedy School of Government. She had been elected to represent Connecticut’s 5th District a month earlier. “I raised my hand and I said, ‘Here’s an example right now — I’m getting texts and alerts that there’s been a shooting and we don’t know what happened,’” she said. At first, it was thought that the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in Esty’s district was over a child custody dispute. But as it became clear what had happened in the hour that followed, Esty’s husband, who worked for Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, called and said she needed to come home. “I went to my hotel room, threw my stuff in the back of a car, drove back to Newtown,” she said. Florida’s Val Demings, a retired police chief, was still campaigning for her House seat when a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year. Demings’ husband is still the sheriff for Orange County, which includes Orlando, and he received a phone call at 3 a.m. “We’ve gone through it enough times when I was police chief — when the phone rings in the middle of the night, it’s probably not good news,” Demings said. “My husband and I thought that was just devastating.” As the number of mass shootings piles up across the country, more members of Congress find themselves navigating something that’s not covered in freshman orientation. WATCH: In States Affected by Mass Shootings, Members Reflect on Moving Forward Members whose districts have suffered a mass shooting said they dedicated most of their time in the immediate hours after to relief efforts: handing out snacks and water to volunteers, visiting victims in the hospital, attending news conferences with law enforcement. Within hours of the Pulse shooting, hundreds of locals swarmed a blood bank in South Orlando to donate blood. Rep. Darren Soto, then a state senator, arrived with his wife, Amanda, to see the line out the door and wrapped around the parking lot. The couple distributed snacks and water and directed traffic. Soto herded crowds inside local businesses to escape the sweltering Florida heat as they waited to give blood. Other lawmakers in similar circumstances made their first stops at hospitals that were taking in victims. For many, seeing so much death and raw grief exacted a chilling emotional toll. Esty said one of the first places she stopped after the Newtown shooting was at the firehouse, where officials were breaking the news to families that their children had been killed. Twenty children and six adults were killed in the attack at Sandy Hook. Malloy was in the next room over, offering his condolences. “You could hear parents screaming and crying,” Esty said. “I remember one mother saying, ‘[My daughter] was sick, she didn’t want to go. If I hadn’t made her go, she would be alive.’” Just hours after the shooting in Las Vegas last month that killed 58 people and wounded more than 500, Nevada Rep. Ruben Kihuen followed fellow Democrat Pete Aguilar’s advice and went to Sunrise Hospital to visit victims and their families. Aguilar’s district includes San Bernardino, California, where a gun-wielding husband-and-wife team killed 14 people and wounded 21 in 2015. The scene that greeted Kihuen was horrifying. The hospital had already taken in 190 patients — some dead or dying — by the time he got there. More gurneys of wounded people would stream in throughout the morning. “I’ve never seen a war zone,” Kihuen said. “But if I could just imagine one, that is probably as close as it gets.” Lawmakers said the chaos that ensued after mass shootings in their districts forced them to respond to the situations as they unfolded. Following their instincts became important in handling the immediate aftermath. Having not yet taken office, Esty hadn’t assembled a team and had no communications staffers or other aides to advise her on steps she should take. “I had no staff. I was in this period where it was postelection,” she recalled. “We actually had no staff at all. I had no office. I was really thrown in the deep end.” In the car on the way back to Newtown, she called her mother and her minister to talk things through. In Las Vegas, Kihuen said his phone conversations with colleagues who’d been through this before — like Soto and Aguilar — guided him in the initial hours. “Look, when you get elected to Congress, nobody gives you a manual saying, ‘This is what you’re supposed to do if a mass shooting happens in your district.’” Kihuen said. “I don’t think anybody’s ever fully prepared for something like that to happen in your city. But when it does — and it’s a similar situation in the ones we’ve seen in other places — then obviously you want to rely on some of your colleagues who have been through that.” Colorado Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter has been through two mass shootings. At the time of the Aurora movie theater shooting in 2012, the area was a part of Perlmutter’s 7th District. And as a state senator in 1999, his district bordered the neighborhood where the Columbine High School shooting took place. After the Sandy Hook shooting, Perlmutter compiled a three-page document to share his experiences and insight with other members. It covers things that one might not think about in times of chaos: how to work with first responders, best practices for outreach to families, how to handle the media, and reassigning staff member to the tasks at hand. It also includes information to make sure members are aware of the National Compassion Fund and other similar resources for constituents. Perlmutter often calls the member whose district has been affected by gun violence to share his insights. And then to follow up, he shares his document with them. The document answers questions such as “How do you help communities deal with influx of charitable support?” Esty said. “How do you make sure money is accounted for? You also have to do that troubleshooting and give them help and guidance around setting up nonprofits. How do you set up scholarships?” After the Las Vegas shooting, Soto reached out to Kihuen to exchange notes. “He’s a fellow freshman, a Hispanic, someone I’m very close with,” Soto said. One of the things Soto told Kihuen was to forget about his duties in Washington until he’d taken care of things at home. “Drop everything else. Even if there were votes up here, people in his community would need him,” Soto said. Esty said she reached out to Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen after the Las Vegas shooting and Aguilar after the shooting in San Bernardino in 2015. “How many new members had have these happen in their district?” Esty said. South Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Sanford, who represents parts of Charleston, said he spoke with Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar, whose district includes Sutherland Springs, where a shooter killed 26 people, including an unborn child, in a church on Nov. 5. Sanford said everyone goes through grief differently. “What I’d say is they are very personal events, wrought with emotion and soul-searching and as a consequence, I wouldn’t want to presume to give other folks wisdom as to how they handle,” he said. When tragedies strike a lawmaker’s district or state, their phones come alive with calls and texts of support from colleagues. That outreach went a long way for many of the lawmakers Roll Call interviewed. The support transcended party lines. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican, was struck by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s response to the shooting in Charleston where a white man entered an African Methodist Episcopal church and gunned down nine black prayer group members. “Tulsi Gabbard, who is a Democrat, I think Hindu, she and her husband came down to Charleston with [conservative Rep.] Trey Gowdy and worshipped with a group of Christians she had never met,” Scott said. “Different faith, mostly different race, different party affiliation.” Republican Sen. James Lankford flew across the country from Oklahoma to sleep overnight at Scott’s house and attend funerals the next day. “It’s hard to find the right words to express how meaningful and powerful those responses were,” Scott said. The Democratic and Republican responses usually begin to diverge a few days after mass shootings, when lawmakers issue more fleshed-out reactions to the violence. Most Democrats call for new gun control measures and safeguards. Most Republicans are equally emphatic against such moves. When crafting their follow-up statements, lawmakers do not subscribe to party playbooks. Leadership does not dictate what members can say, when they can say it, or how strongly they can say it. Democratic Rep. Dina Titus stressed the importance of keeping conversations surrounding gun control alive after the initial shock has faded. The Las Vegas shooting took place in her district. “It’s just like after Sandy Hook, just like after Orlando,” she said one month after the massacre, alongside four survivors and other members of the Nevada delegation at the House Triangle. “A lot of talk. And then [Republicans] think they can wait us out. The news cycle will change, people will forget, and we’ll move on. We just can’t let that happen.” In Las Vegas, Kihuen waited until the second day of the recovery to urge his colleagues to initiate debate on gun control measures. “One thing I knew was on that day of the shooting, my sole focus was on making sure that our local law enforcement and first responders had all the [federal] resources that they needed,” he said. “That was my main responsibility.” On the other hand, Demings, a Democratic primary candidate at the time of the Orlando shooting, made media appearances the same day of the massacre calling on Congress to act. “It’s interesting to me when people say, ‘Well, we don’t want to politicize this issue,’” she said. “Every meaningful piece of legislation that has been passed historically was a result of some horrific incident.” Soto criticized members who dodge for “weeks and months” after a mass shooting when asked about their positions on guns, saying it’s not the appropriate time. “That rhetoric is a deliberate attempt to stop any reforms that may be needed to curb gun violence,” Soto said. He said he thinks two to three days is an appropriate period for lawmakers to mourn with their constituents before focusing on policy. But the circumstances are unique in each case, he added, and lawmakers should react how they see fit. After the news crews have left the district and the renewed debate on gun legislation fades, the work of helping communities heal continues, often for years. Soto said one of the challenges is working with the “long-term psychological and physical ailments and conditions” that follow mass shootings. “Years out, we will still have people in counseling, family counseling and crisis relief counseling,” he said. “When the headlines start disappearing, when society moves on to the next crisis, it’s even more important for local leaders and their members of Congress to continue to do what they can to help out with the scars of such a tragedy.” Esty said helping first responders deal with the trauma of seeing dead children at an elementary school was especially difficult. “We are trained to protect our children,” she said. “There is a feeling of powerlessness and failure” when children die. On the anniversary of the Charleston shooting, Scott and others in the South Carolina delegation invited survivors to the Capitol to reflect on the shooting. For Esty, the mere fact that members of Congress now follow a routine protocol after a mass shooting is a tragedy in and of itself. “I am heartsick that in the last month, I had to make calls to multiple colleagues,” she said.

Ryland's grandmother Sandy Ward doesn't believe her grandson knows that his mother and two sisters were killed the massacre, but maintains that the little boy's spirits are up despite recovering from five gunshot wounds, including complications from a shattered femur. Ward spoke to KSAT-TV, where she detailed her struggles in the aftermath of the shooting, as well as her grandson's glee at receiving cards while hospitalized. ""It's really been hitting me this week,"" Ward said, talking about the loss of her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. ""It seems like all I do is cry lots of days because I still miss JoAnn and the girls (Emily and Brooke) and I'm sure it will be a long time before I get over that."" Ward added, ""They still haven't told [Ryland] yet that his mom and sisters are dead, but I'm ... sure he's kind of getting some kind of idea because he's 5."" ""Everybody else has been up there to see him, and they haven't been there,"" she explained. The mass shooting at First Baptist Church, by Devin Kelley, left 26 dead and injured 20 others. Ward noted that her grandson continues to smile despite the horror he's endured. ""You got so many nice people that are sending a card and a dollar to Ryland,"" Sandy said. ""He does really enjoy that a lot."" According to KSAT, doctors are hopeful that Ryland will go home in six to eight weeks.  KSAT reported that cards for Ryland can be sent to the following address:  P.O. Box 174 Sutherland Springs, Texas  78161 Sandy added that any money collected from cards will be put toward a Go-Kart.

332,https://hotair.com/archives/2017/11/15/newtown-spawned-zombie-lawsuit-simply-wont-go-away/,"One month from now we will reach the five year anniversary of the horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. By this point you’d think that most of the major questions would have been answered but there’s one piece of unfinished business which is back in front of the state supreme court yet again. A group of nine families has been attempting to sue Remington Arms, the manufacturer of the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack, claiming that their weapon was responsible for the carnage. That claim has already been shot down in the courts, but we’re back to covering the same ground because the attorneys for the families have developed a new tactic. They’re claiming that the advertising Remington used to promote the Bushmaster firearm was somehow delivering “a message” to the shooter, telling him that it was intended to kill human beings. (Associated Press) Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza heard the message loud and clear when gun-maker Remington Arms marketed an AR-15-style rifle as an overpowering weapon favored by elite military forces, a lawyer for relatives of some victims of the massacre told the Connecticut Supreme Court on Tuesday… [Attorney Joshua] Koskoff asked the high court to reinstate a wrongful death lawsuit against Madison, North Carolina-based Remington. He said the Bushmaster rifle and other AR-15-style firearms were designed as military killing machines and are too dangerous for the public, but Remington glorified them and marketed them to a younger demographic that included the 20-year-old Lanza. “Adam Lanza heard the message,” Koskoff told the justices, whose decision isn’t expected for several months. “They marketed the weapon for exactly what it was. They used images of soldiers in combat. They used slogans invoking battle and high-pressure missions. Honestly, I fail to see how this argument alters the facts of the matter which scuttled the lawsuit originally. Even a judge who seemed rather sympathetic to their cause found that the company was already protected from this sort of legal attack under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). That was put in place precisely to prevent Second Amendment opponents from using these types of back-door attacks to drive firearms manufacturers out of business, thereby reducing the availability of weapons. Does the type of advertising the company employed alter that scenario? I understand there are laws about truth in advertising and restrictions on which products can advertise in some circumstances, but I’m unsure how that applies here. There might be a truth in advertising question if Remington was actually claiming that U.S. Army Rangers were carrying the Bushmaster (they don’t) but that’s not really what the plaintiffs are driving at. I’ll grant you that some of their ads are kind of cheesy, such as the “Consider Your Man Card Reissued” flyer.  Others use phrasing such as, “Forces of Opposition Bow Down.” Sure, those are hardly themes you’d look for when selling jigsaw puzzles, but they’re marketing firearms. And some people may choose to make the Bushmaster their go-to firearm for self-defense. (Though there are far better options.) It seems a stretch to claim that advertisements suggesting the fact that a firearm might be capable of killing someone prompted the shooter to do something he wasn’t already crazy enough to do to begin with. It’s going back to the Connecticut state supreme court yet again, apparently. We won’t have an answer for a couple of months unless the justices just shoot this one down right out of the gate, and I wouldn’t count on that. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

333,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/21/lawyers-file-lawsuits-for-more-than-450-las-vegas-shooting-victims/,"Lawyers filed lawsuits for more than 450 victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas. The lawsuits name concert organizers, the killer's estate, and MGM International, which owns the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where the shooter launched his attack, as defendants.  In what is called the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, a gunman opened fire into a crowd of 22,000 people attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip. Fifty-eight people died and an estimated 546 suffered injuries. Shooter Stephen Paddock, 64, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Attorneys filed the lawsuits in Los Angeles Superior Court because most of the plaintiffs are from California, according to Houston attorney Muhammad Azizi, one of the lead attorneys. In addition, event organizer Live Nation Entertainment Inc. is based in California. Attorney Chad Pinkerton told Fox News the lawsuits will likely receive a fairer shake in Los Angeles. ""There would be certain advantages for MGM to defend its case in Nevada,"" Pinkerton said, adding that a jury in MGM Resorts' hometown might include people with direct or indirect ties to the company and its more than 70,000 employees. Attorneys face a difficult road to legally place the blame on parties other than the shooter, and the lawsuits could take years to resolve in court. Even so, attorneys maintain that proper security, safety, and training could have prevented the tragedy. The lawsuits also go after Paddock's estate. He is believed to have ""multimillion dollar"" real estate investments in Texas and California. But at least one account suggested Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, lost large sums of money in recent years, which may have led to depression that may have been a catalyst for him to carry out the brutal attack on concertgoers. Attorneys have filed several additional lawsuits in connection to the shooting in Nevada courts as well.

334,https://hotair.com/archives/2017/11/15/bad-guy-gun-stopped-good-guy-car/,"You probably heard about the mass shooting in California yesterday but there was another attempted mass shooting Tuesday in Cheektowaga, New York near Buffalo. A man, later identified as 29-year-old Travis Green, went to the local Dollar Store dressed in camo and body armor and started firing an AR-15 at the front door from a position in the parking lot. Only one person inside was hit, and he is expected to recover, but police believe it could have been worse if not for a couple of local businessmen who took action. From the Buffalo News: As a man started firing a pump action firearm into the discount store at Union Road and Gardenville Parkway West, Christopher Kaufmann, a manager at Daryll’s Car Audio across the street, called 911. Mark Pinnavaia, the owner of Daryll’s, grabbed his cellphone and keys and hopped into his Ford Focus in the parking lot. His initial intention, he said, was to maintain a good vantage point so he could be “the best witness that I could possibly be.” “But I felt that I had to do something,” Pinnavaia said. When he saw the gunman put down his weapon for a second time, Pinnavaia gunned his car toward him. “At that point I put my car in drive and I proceeded to drive as fast as I possibly could to hit the individual,” he said. “I had full intentions to hit him if that’s what it would take to stop him.” It sounds as if Green tried to leap over the car but didn’t avoid getting clipped. Pinnavaia says there is a shoe print on his roof. In any case, Green gave up on his attack and ran. Pinnavaia and Kaufmann chased after him on foot and moments later police arrived. An officer tackled Green and he was arrested (dash cam video is included in the clip below). Considering how Green was armed and the number of rounds he still had in his car (over 800), Cheektowaga Police Chief David Zack said Tuesday, “It is a miracle I’m not at this podium reading the names of the dead.” He also praised Pinnavaia and Kaufmann’s “incredible bravery” and said, “There is no question these individuals saved lives yesterday, they are heroes.” I’ve written several posts about people who step up in these situations. They come from every race and background but they have on thing in common: After risking their lives for others, they all deny being heroes. And sure enough, Kaufmann and Pinnavaia denied it too. Despite the accolades from police and others, Pinnavaia and Kaufmann said they don’t consider themselves to be heroes. The real heroes are the men and women in law enforcement and the military, Pinnavaia said. “You do what you do in a situation,” Kaufmann said. “I don’t think it’s about being a hero. It’s about doing what you think you need to do. You just do it, you don’t think about it. You just do it.” As for what motivated the attack, that’s still not clear but the Associated Press reports that Green’s marriage of seven years was in the midst of breaking up: His mother, Viola Green, was with her son during his arraignment and afterward said he and his wife recently broke up after seven years of marriage. She said her son spent part of the day Tuesday moving his things out of their house. “I guess the stress took over,” Viola Green said. Stress is certainly understandable in that situation, but why attack strangers at a Dollar Store unless this was an attempt at suicide by cop. Thanks to the intervention of Kaufmann and Pinnavaia, no officers had to shoot it out with Green and no officer had to go home that night having had to kill a disturbed man to protect others. You can deny that’s real heroism if you want. I just hope that if I’m even in a terrible situation like this I’m brave enough to react the way these two guys did.

We can excuse them for not seeing the winning strategy that was Donald Trump in the early days of the primaries, when he was calling out “bad hombres” and insulting John McCain. We can forgive them for sticking with Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio until the bitter end, even though the polls kept saying only one person could win. We can even overlook, albeit with raised eyebrow, those who voted third-party or didn’t vote at all rather than cast their ballot for Trump. Hey, even if they got duped by that holier-than-thou egghead Evan Mc-what’s-his-face, all’s well that ends well, right? We won, so no harm, no foul. (Of course, if you’re reading this and you voted for Hillary you’re beyond help. Please, just go back to reading The Huffington Post now.) But now, now that the crazy has really come out to play, now that Leftists have bared their teeth in Berkeley, Los Angeles, New York City, and even in the halls of Congress, there’s no longer any excuse for ignorance. Between Jimmy Kimmel, Chelsea Handler, Michael Moore, and ‘Crazy Maxine’s’ shouts of “Impeach 45!” to adoring Hollywood crowds and antifa violence - if anyone even remotely conservative was anywhere on the fence, the crazy should have pushed them to the right side of this long ago, and if it hasn’t, it says far more about them than it does about President Trump. They are liars, and you can’t trust them, ever. At least liberals are outspoken about who they are and what they want. They’re easy to deal with, because they wear their uniform on the outside. Never-Trump ‘conservatives’ are a fifth-column inside the ranks of conservatism, poisoning it from within with their smarmy smiles, their useless platitudes about ‘principle’ and their noxious virtue signaling to a Left they’re seemingly more eager to please than ordinary Americans. When it comes to politics, winning is everything. Win the public discourse, win political races, and win when it comes to implementing your agenda. Never Trumpers don’t care about winning. All they care about is being right, and despite all that President Trump is accomplishing and all he COULD accomplish if only more would unite behind him, they find more joy out of thwarting the president and his agenda than actually attempting to save America. Granted, Trump has done a few things while in office that makes us cringe. We’ll wish he hadn’t said this or he didn’t tweet that or that maybe he’d be stronger with one policy position or another. No one individual, especially a politician, will please everyone, and it’s the same with President Trump. However, if you’re ever tempted to listen to the Never Trumpers, to the arrogant, condescending, whimperings of the George Wills or the Bill Kristols or the Jeff Flakes of the world - if you’re ever tempted, even for a millisecond, to think they could be on the mark, you need to do two things. First, slap yourself upside the head for even giving these scumbags a moment of your thoughts. Then, you need to do a little walk down memory lane and consider that, a little over one year ago this month, we conservatives were given a remarkable gift, a gift that affects us all on a deeply personal level. How personal? As we move into this Season of Thanksgiving, let’s remember to be thankful for where we could easily be as a nation had Hillary Rodham Clinton become our next president. Instead of merely listening to liberal lunatics try to turn every mass shooting into a gun control speech and shaking our heads with a ‘bless their hearts,’ we’d actually be worried about real legislation to stifle our Second Amendment freedoms being passed by a feckless Congress and signed by a smirking President Hillary Clinton. Think they’d have stopped at bump stocks? Think again. Instead of a Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we’d be stuck with someone who makes Vladimir Lenin look like a capitalist. Think they’d have given us Merrick Garland? Hell, we’d be WISHING for Merrick Garland and calling Mitch McConnell an idiot for not accepting President Obama’s magnanimous offer and installing him post-haste before the election. Instead of a booming stock market and an optimistic economy helped in no small part by relaxing regulations and other Trump policies, we’d be looking at a continuation of the Obama malaise, with a dose of Carter thrown in for good measure. Instead of the possibility of tax cuts, we’d be looking at tax hikes and an ever growing government eager to spend that money on something else pointless and stupid. Instead of working toward fair trade deals with other nations, we’d be looking at a continuation of the horrible trade policies that had virtually left our industrial base for dead. Instead of an ISIS on the run, we’d be looking at bringing as many ISIS fighters as possible to our shores, as refugees and future Democratic voters of course, because “huddled masses” and all that jazz. And speaking of “huddled masses,” instead of border security, deporting criminals, and the promise of a wall, we’d be looking at more of the same - endless Third World immigration, drugs, and God knows what else pouring over our virtually unguarded border. Instead of a new electoral map that shows Republicans with the right message (hellooo Trump) can win in rust-belt states, we’d be looking at a blue Virginia and consequently the demographic death knell for a Republican ever winning the presidency again. These are just a few of the gifts you should be thankful for this season of Thanksgiving. I don't know about you, but compared to THAT, I'll take an awkward tweet or a useless spat with Rosie O'Donnell any day of the week. Don’t be like the Never Trumpers. They’re the type who wouldn’t just look a gift-horse in the mouth, they’d smack it across the face with the p*ssy-hat they were wearing to virtue-signal to liberals.

337,http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/16/3000-attend-funeral-of-8-family-members-killed-in-sutherland-springs-shooting/,"REUTERS/Darren Abate Three thousand mourners attended the Wednesday funeral for eight members of the Holcombe family killed in the Sutherland Springs church shooting. The crowd of thousands mourned together for the fallen family members at an events center in Floresville, Texas before a smaller crowd proceeded to a graveside service where they gathered around the mutli-colored coffins and released light blue and pink balloons in their honor, according to the Associated Press. Hundreds more tried to join the mourners at the events center but were turned away by fire marshals. John Holcombe, who survived the shooting, invited the public to join the funeral services. John, along with two children from his wife’s previous marriage, Evelyn and Phillip, and his sister, Sarah Holcombe, survived. His pregnant wife, Crystal, their unborn child, three children from Crystal’s previous marriage – Greg, Emily, and Megan Hill – his brother Marc, Marc’s 18-month-old daughter Noah, and his parents, Bryan and Karla died. John wrote in an earlier Facebook post that while it was too early to tell whether his and Crystal’s unborn child was a boy or a girl, they had come up with a name in either case.  Bryan was a guest pastor on the day of the shooting. The shooter killed Bryan first, shooting him in the back as he made his way up the aisle to the altar, beginning what would be the worst church shooting in U.S. history and the worst mass shooting in Texas history. The shooter killed members from three generations of the Holcombe family, comprising a third of the 26 church congregants he killed in the ensuing massacre, and targeted children crying out for help and those attempting to take cover before he was stopped and pursued to his death by Stephen Willeford. Friends of the family set up a GoFundMe account in Sarah’s name to help ease the burden of funeral costs for her 9 family members, to include John and Crystal’s unborn child, and Sarah’s closest friend, Tara, and other expenses in the aftermath of the tragedy.

Levine, treats Times’ readers to heaping doses of astrological mumbo jumbo: “Saturn’s move from a fire sign to an earth sign next month.” It respectfully conveys astrologers’ hilariously self-important evaluations of their “profession”: “‘It’s so important that we give quality literature, quality interpretation, quality astronomy and astrology,’” says the astrology columnist for Harper’s Bazaar. The article never once asks the obvious questions, including: What is the theory behind astral influence? Do stars emit some physical force, wave, particle, or gravitational field that affects events on earth, and if so, has it been measured? What is astrologers’ ex post facto batting average — how do their daily newspaper predictions stand up? Have they predicted major events with anything other than random success? The closest that Ms. Levine gets to skepticism is the following: “for a craft so often criticized for being nonscientific and, in some cases, fraudulent, horoscopes still cover the pages and websites of publications in New York and across the globe.” “In some cases fraudulent?” When are horoscopes ever not fraudulent, in the Times’ view? Anyone who is willing for an instant to credit the claims of astral influence is a walking demonstration of the tragic failure of science education. One of the greatest accomplishments of Western civilization is the development of the scientific method and the scientific disposition, which entail the development of falsifiable hypotheses about the world and the unwillingness to take unverified and untheorized claims about the world as truth, simply because someone states that they are true. But Ms. Levine writes throughout her piece as if astrology were a real activity: “There is no formal schooling to be an interpreter of the stars.” Leaving aside the assumption that the stars are actually being interpreted, what would “formal schooling” in a fraud look like? Ms. Levine likewise assumes that astrologers are actually doing something real when she recounts the “professional” activities of the New York Daily News’ astrologer. “He has used astrology,” she writes, “to help him interpret news of three hurricanes, Harvey Weinstein, North Korea, the mass shooting in Las Vegas and the attack in Lower Manhattan.” The astrologer, Eric Francis Coppolino, says that he tries really hard to “avoid rationalization.” Truly avoiding rationalization would wipe about the field, of course, by requiring falsifiable predictions before the fact. But what Mr. Coppolino means by “avoiding rationalization” is something else: not fully shifting responsibility from human agents to the stars. “‘We’re not here to blame the planets,’” he tells Ms. Levine, “‘but rather, to take some guidance and use this technique for an expanded perspective’” — whatever that means. Ms. Levine does not bother talking to an astronomer about how stars could actually influence human events. The only skeptic she approaches is . . . another astrologer! It turns out that astrology is a dog-eat-dog world in which the fraudsters routinely snipe at each others’ qualifications. John Marchesella, president of the New York City chapter of the National Council for Geocosmic Research (an astrology association), dismisses horoscope writing as “amateur” compared to the grounded offerings of “professional” astrology. No examples of the difference between “amateur” and “professional” astrology are provided. The day after the New York Times informed its readers about the “professional” world of astrology, it ran a front-page story about ICE agents’ alleged reign of terror in Atlanta, Ga., under the Trump administration. This reign of terror consists in targeted enforcement raids against individuals like an illegal Mexican who has been deported twice, served time in prison, convicted of two domestic-violence incidents, and charged with rape which he plea-bargained down to a lesser crime. The number of illegal alien law-breakers in Atlanta is so high that one is booked into a county jail every few hours, reports the Times. The Times notes with dismay that illegal aliens are being arrested for driving without insurance and without a license. Apparently Times reporters would not mind if their car were totaled by an uninsured driver. A reporter for the Spanish-language newspaper Mundo Hispanico sends out Facebook alerts of sightings of ICE agents so that illegal aliens can evade the law. Yet we are supposed to believe that it is the Trump administration that poses a threat to the rule of law. Females have always been the biggest consumers of spiritual hoaxes such as astrology, crystals, séances, and other metaphysical claims about the world that rest simply on assertion rather than scientific proof. If a credulous article on astrology can get through the editorial process at an increasingly female-dominated Times, we can expect that political reporting will grow even more unmoored from reality at the Times and other outlets experiencing a similar demographic shift.

The 52-year-old’s death comes close to a month after two other Las Vegas survivors, Dennis and Lorraine Carver, died in a car crash less than a mile from their California home, according to CNN. A vehicle struck McClellan while he was hitchhiking about 50 miles outside of Las Vegas, where he lived, CBS News reports. “This isn’t what I wanted for him. I don’t understand why he wasn’t taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way,” McClellan’s widow, Denise, told KSNV-TV. “I hope my husband found peace and he’s safe now.” Her husband had been deeply disturbed by the shooting and was going to therapy, Denise told KSNV-TV. “I’m angry. I’m angry. I feel that he was under the influence of something or drunk and didn’t want to get caught, so he bailed and left my husband laying there in the street. He doesn’t deserve that,” Denise said. Police have found the vehicle that killed Roy, and charges against the driver are pending, KSNV reports.

A white tent is being erected on a baseball field not far from the First Baptist Church of Sutherland site. The tent will be the temporary home for the congregants, KSAT reported. Nearly fifty people were shot during a church service than normally sees around that many in attendance. The new tent church will host up to 1,000 people. People are expected to travel from across the state and nation to show support for the survivors and the community. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife were not in attendence last Sunday, having traveled to Oklahoma. Their 14-year-old daughter lost her life when the gunman entered the church and began the massacre that left 26 people dead, including young children. Pomeroy said he wants to tear down the church and create a memorial site to honor those who were killed, CBS News reported. He said the building would be “too stark of a reminder.” The mother of 16-year-old Haley Krueger agreed. “There should still be church but not here,” Charlene Uhl told the CBS reporter. The initial service following the massacre will be a private service for members of the community, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Officials from the church explained the first service will only be open to the remaining congregants, members of the community, and people from neighboring areas. On Saturday, the church offered a Veterans Day observance service to honor the church victims with a military background. Rod Green, who serves as the grounds steward for the church, told reporters they church building will temporarily serve as a memorial to the victims of the mass shooting. Plans call for cleaning up the building and replacing the pews with one chair for each of the victims killed in the attack. Funerals for those killed began late last week as nearly 500 people attended the service for Scott and Karen Marshall. The two military veterans were honored at a San Antonio Air Force base. Eleven people will not be able to attend Sunday’s service because they remain hospitalized. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

341,http://www.breitbart.com/news/hotel-questions-revised-timeline-of-las-vegas-massacre/,"A day after authorities revised the timeline of events on the night of the Las Vegas mass shooting, the hotel where the gunman was staying is casting doubt on the changes. Police said earlier this week that they believe Stephen Paddock shot a hotel security guard through the door of his high-rise hotel suite six minutes before he unleashed a barrage of bullets into a crowd at a musical performance below. The injured guard ran down a hall using his radio and possibly a hallway phone to call for help, reporting he had been shot in the leg. That account differs dramatically from the one police gave last week: that Paddock ended his hail of fire on the crowd, where 58 people were killed and hundreds injured, in order to shoot through his door and wound the unarmed guard, Jesus Campos. But late Tuesday, the company that owns the Mandalay Bay hotel casino questioned the new timeline. “We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline,” said Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International. “We believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.” Las Vegas police did not respond Tuesday night to questions about the hotel’s statement or whether investigators stand behind the revised timeline released earlier in the week. The revised timeline raises questions about whether better communication could have allowed officers to respond more quickly and take out the gunman before the attack. It remains unclear if police ever received a call for help from the injured guard. “This changes everything,” said Joseph Giacalone, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former New York City police sergeant. “There absolutely was an opportunity in that timeframe that some of this could’ve been mitigated.” Nicole Rapp, whose mother was knocked to the ground at the Route 91 Harvest Festival and trampled by panicked concertgoers as bullets rained from above, said she’s “having a hard time wrapping my head around” why police changed the timeline of the shooting. “It’s very confusing to me that they are just discovering this a week later,” she said. “How did we not know this before? It’s traumatic for the victims and their families not to be sure of what happened.” Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said on Tuesday that the guard had been responding to a door alarm on the hotel’s 32nd floor when he heard an odd drilling sound. Paddock had power tools and was trying to drill a hole in a wall, perhaps to mount another of the security cameras he set up around him, or to point a rifle through, but he never completed the work, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said. He also drilled holes and bolted a metal bar to try to prevent the opening of an emergency exit door near his room. As the guard notified maintenance and security of the stairwell issue, several single shots were fired into the hallway before he shot again, unloading more than 200 rounds at the guard and a maintenance man, McMahill said. Campos, the security guard, was struck in the leg and injured, police said. Campos reported to hotel security dispatchers that he was shot before Paddock opened fire on the crowd, Assistant Sheriff Tom Roberts told The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday. It wasn’t clear exactly what time Campos called for help or if the hotel had relayed the information about the shooting to police. Las Vegas police did not respond to questions from The Associated Press about whether hotel security or anyone else in the hotel called 911 to report the hallway shooting. “Our officers got there as fast as they possibly could and they did what they were trained to do,” another Las Vegas assistant sheriff, Todd Fasulo, said Tuesday. The six minutes that transpired between the hallway shooting and the start of the gunman’s fusillade wouldn’t have been enough time for officers to stop the attack, said Ron Hosko, a former FBI assistant director who has worked on SWAT teams. Rather than rush in without a game plan, police would have been formulating the best response to the barricaded gunman, he said. “Maybe that’s enough time to get the first patrolman onto the floor but the first patrolman is not going to go knock on that customer’s door and say ‘What’s going on with 200 holes in the door?'” Hosko said. McMahill defended the hotel and said the encounter that night between Paddock and the security guard and maintenance man disrupted the gunman’s plans. Paddock fired more than 1,000 bullets and had more than 1,000 rounds left in his room, the undersheriff said. “I can tell you I’m confident that he was not able to fully execute his heinous plan and it certainly had everything to do with being disrupted,” McMahill said. He added: “I don’t think the hotel dropped the ball.” ___ Associated Press writers Ken Ritter and Sally Ho in Las Vegas, Anita Snow in Phoenix and Sadie Gurman in Washington contributed to this report. ___ For complete coverage of the Las Vegas shooting, click here: https://apnews.com/tag/LasVegasmassshooting . .

342,https://www.theroot.com/cop-suffering-from-ptsd-after-pulse-massacre-will-lose-1821125841,"With only six months to go before he’s eligible for a full pension, Cpl. Omar Delgado, one of the first police to respond to the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is losing his job. Hailed as a hero in the wake of the June 2016 mass shooting for saving the life of shooting victim Angel Colon, Delgado has since suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, after the massacre that left 49 people dead, Delgado returned to patrol duty with the Eatonville, Fla., Police Department for a few months but had to stop. He told CNN that he has had trouble sleeping and suffered from nightmares, depression and anxiety. Delgado eventually took a desk job with the department, performing administrative duties for the past eight months. Then, this past Monday, the Eatonville PD told Delgado that his last day would be at the end of the month. Delgado is not sure exactly why he’s being let go, and city officials wouldn’t comment on the case, citing privacy policies. The officer says that a doctor had found him unfit to resume full duties because of his PTSD, which he believes was a factor in the city’s decision to fire him. But Delgado—a nine-and-a-half-year veteran of the department—is being forced out just six months before he can receive his full retirement pension and disability benefits. If he made the 10-year mark, the 45-year-old officer could receive 64 percent of his salary and benefits for life. The timing of Delgado’s firing, however, means that Delgado is entitled to disability or a retirement pension, but not both, according to WESH-TV. As it stands, Delgado will only receive 42 percent of his salary (his disability pension), which will kick in when he turns 55. Delgado said that the departmental policy was news to him. “I don’t need to be a police officer with my gun belt and so forth to do those little tasks,” Delgado said about his administrative work. “Could they have let me do that for six more months? That’s the debate.” As Time magazine notes, Delgado isn’t the first officer who responded to the Pulse-nightclub shooting to be fired following a PTSD diagnosis. The Orlando Police Department let go Officer Gerry Realin, 37, in July. However, Realin will receive 80 percent of his $70,000 salary each year for the rest of life. Compare that with Delgado, who stands to receive 42 percent of his $38,5000 salary annually. But Eatonville, the home of Zora Neale Hurston and the oldest incorporated African-American town in the country, is reportedly strapped for cash. The Eatonville Town Council, following a harsh backlash to news of Delgado’s firing (WESH-TV reports that city officials have received death threats), voted unanimously to give Delgado an additional $1,200. The city also said that it would continue to help the officer with PTSD counseling. A blog posted on Psychology Today says that out of roughly 900,000 sworn officers in the U.S., approximately 19 percent may have PTSD. Some research also suggests that another 34 percent of law enforcement officers may suffer from symptoms of PTSD but “do not meet the standards for the full diagnosis.” (Note: This blog also tells us to take time to “smile at a cop,” since their jobs are so stressful, which is cute but also horseshit. Cops suffering from PTSD need real institutional support, and it’s unclear whether Delgado really received it.) Currently, PTSD is not covered by workers’ compensation in Florida. As the Orlando Sentinel notes, a proposed bill requiring first responders with PTSD to receive coverage for mental health treatment in their workers’ compensation packages advanced this week in the Florida Senate. Angel Colon, the man whose life Delgado saved last year, told Fox 35 that the Eatonville Police Department should support the veteran officer. “It’s a horrible feeling because this man, Omar, has been there for me ever since June 12,” Colon said, according to the Sentinel. “He’s the person who saved my life.” This is the type of officers we need. One who responds to a call for help, executes help, takes responsibility for his emotional well-being and by extension, the safety of his community by going on desk duty, and gets canned for it?",2017-12-08 13:15:00,Cop Suffering From PTSD After Pulse Massacre Will Lose His Job,,368082,http://theroot.com/
343,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/14-vegas-survivors-file-lawsuits,"CHICAGO (AP) — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries.” The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can’t dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. “I don’t sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,” said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. “I thought it was gunshots.” Seng, who wasn’t physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock’s bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn’t yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold “the entire supply chain” responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren’t returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting “a meticulously planned, evil … act” in a statement Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through “the appropriate legal channels.” Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains “heartbroken for the victims.” Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Florida. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general’s office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: “Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.” Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can’t fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn’t notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. “They can catch a person counting cards,” she said. “But they can’t catch someone carrying bags of guns.” Tom Barrack, longtime confidant of former President Donald Trump, has been ordered to be released Friday on a bail package… Tennessee is restarting vaccine outreach efforts it halted earlier this month due to a wave of conservative hysteria, but the… This post first appeared at ProPublica.

344,http://journalisms.theroot.com/what-if-mass-killer-were-muslim-or-of-color-1820383087,"Two African American columnists of different generations and temperaments came to similar conclusions on Tuesday: If Devin Kelley, the apparent killer of 26 worshipers Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Texas, were Muslim or black, the nation’s reaction would have been far different. “White privilege continued to protect him in case after case,” Shaun King, the Black Lives Matter activist and former columnist for the Daily News in New York, wrote for BlackAmericaWeb.com after reviewing Kelley’s history. Leonard Pitts Jr., the syndicated Miami Herald columnist, asked, “Do you think that if the Texas killer had had an exotic name or begun his attack with a cry of ‘Allahu Akbar!’ our responses would be limited to thoughts and prayers and lawmakers would be content to mouth impotent pieties?” King recalled the Las Vegas attack that killed 58 people in October. Like the attack in Texas, it, too, ranks among the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history. “Soon after that shooting, I wrote a column stating that white privilege in America is so strong that even Stephen Paddock, the deadliest single mass shooter in American history, was getting preferential treatment in death that virtually any shooter other than a white man would ever receive had they done something similar,” King wrote. “Well, it’s happening again in Texas, but this time I actually think it’s worse. Devin Kelley shot and killed multiple children. He shot and killed a pregnant woman. He killed senior citizens. The man had absolutely no regard for human life when he strapped on black tactical gear, loaded up rounds and rounds of ammunition, and walked straight into that church and rained down horror on that close-knit congregation. “We had warning signs galore. . . . “Kelley was given break after break in life. And we must investigate why that is. For the past six months I’ve spent nearly every waking moment of my life either in The Bronx or studying it. I’ve taken a deep dive into neighborhoods where families and children never get a break. If you break the law, you go to jail, then you go to prison, normally for a very long time. If you are even suspected of breaking the law, it doesn’t matter if you are a child or a grown man, you go to Rikers, where you may wait for months or even years just to see a judge. In The Bronx, I’ve uncovered case after case of people, always black or brown mind you, who’ve spent years in jail or prison for crimes they never committed. “Somehow though, the harsh judgment and punishment of America’s justice system never really visited Devin Kelley. He should’ve served hard time for fracturing a child’s skull, but he didn’t. He could and likely should have served hard time for domestic violence and sexual assault and animal cruelty, but he lives in a universe altogether different than black and brown families in The Bronx — one in which he gets a perpetual pass for violence and intimidation. . . .” Pitts wrote: “Why are we OK with this? “Not you and me as individuals, perhaps. But America, as a corporate body? It seems ever more obvious that for all the lip service we pay to ‘thoughts and prayers,’ for all the candles we light and tears we weep, this is a thing we accept. As opposed to Islamic terror, which we don’t. You can read the distinction starkly in Donald Trump’s tweets. “After a Muslim shot up a nightclub in Orlando, the then-candidate decried our lack of toughness and demanded a ban on Muslim travel. “After a non-Muslim killed nearly 60 people in Las Vegas and wounded over 500 more, he said the killer’s ‘wires were crossed pretty badly in his brain.’ “After a Muslim killed eight people in New York City, he mused about sending him to Gitmo and demanded the ‘DEATH PENALTY.’ “After Sunday’s murders by a non-Muslim, he promised to stand with the people of Sutherland Springs. “It’s not that Trump won’t condemn a non-Muslim killer, but that he saves his greatest energy and outrage for the killer who claims to worship Islam, even though the former is the far deadlier threat. “And though Trump is often an outlier, his moral inconsistency here seems to reflect America’s own.  . . .” Boston University: Permissive gun laws linked to higher homicide rates Bill Bramhall, Daily News, New York: Mass Shooting Condolence Cards (cartoon) Elvia Díaz, La Voz | azcentral.com: Insulting my gun knowledge after Texas shooting is wrong — and you know it Editorial, News & Record, Greensboro, N.C.: President Trump, it’s a gun situation Editorial, San Antonio Express-News: Shooter should not have been allowed guns Editorial, Philadelphia Inquirer: Bullet points: Separating the lies from the truth about guns Solomon Jones, Philadelphia Daily News: People of faith feel particular pain from hateful violence Lauren McGaughy, Dallas Morning News: Dear Sutherland Springs, you deserve an apology from the news media Phillip Morris, Plain Dealer, Cleveland: America and its churches are being baptized in blood Tony Norman, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Another day, another massacre in America Molly Pahn, Anita Knopov, Michael Siegel, Boston University: Gun violence in the US kills more black people and urban dwellers Eugene Robinson, Washington Post: The blood of innocents is on our hands CBS News, the Los Angeles Times and NPR were among the news organizations that noted the diversity of the winning candidates in Tuesday’s election. “Racial and religious minorities and LGBTQ candidates picked up historic wins in races across the country Tuesday,” Jaweed Kaleem reported for the Los Angeles Times. “They included two openly transgender politicians, African Americans who prevailed in several mayoral races and the first Sikh mayor in New Jersey. . . .” Brian Naylor of NPR added: “In the northern Virginia suburb of Prince William County, Danica Roem became the first openly transgender candidate to win a statehouse seat anywhere in the country.

Trump made his own history in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he was holding a campaign rally just weeks before his election,” Jim Rutenberg reported Wednesday for the New York Times. “ ‘AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN,’ he told his audience, calling the proposed merger an example of a media ‘power structure’ that was working to suppress his vote and the voices of his supporters. It was, he said, ‘a deal we will not approve in my administration.’ “He specifically cited media concentration. But his singling out of CNN in the context of an alleged plot against him was lost on no one. “Now, CNN is at the heart of a dispute between the Justice Department and AT&T and Time Warner. Three people from the companies said Wednesday that the department insisted that AT&T divest either CNN’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval. “This raised the chilling possibility that Mr. Trump was making good on his threatening statements in Gettysburg. . . .” Editorial, Seattle Times: Media consolidation undermines democracy Brian Stelter, CNNMoney: AT&T takeover of Time Warner hits snag with DOJ as dispute goes public “Ilia Calderon will replace Maria Elena Salinas as co-anchor with Jorge Ramos of Univision’s flagship 6:30 p.m. newscast Noticiero Univision in mid-December, the network announced Wednesday,” Marisa Guthrie reported Wednesday for the Hollywood Reporter. “Calderon, a native of Colombia, becomes the first Afro-Latina to anchor an evening newscast for a major broadcaster in the U.S. “It is a distinction she also achieved in Colombia, where she was the first black woman to host a . . . national [news] program. “Calderon will also serve as co-host of Univision’s Sunday night newsmagazine, Aquí y Ahora (Here and Now), which airs on Sunday nights, alongside Teresa Rodriguez. . . .” Soledad O’Brien, HuffPost: We Must Challenge The Systemic Hurdles All Latina Women Face Last month, “The Gleaner daily in Jamaica hosted a timely forum about news literacy,” the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers reported Tuesday. “Ten secondary students had been suspended after they launched social media challenge . . . encouraging people to describe the extent to which they would go for sexual pleasure. “ ‘These youngsters tend to be very creative and talented,’ Clement Lambert, a University of West Indies education professor, told The Gleaner. ‘So sometimes when some schools are giving up the aesthetics for other subjects because they want the high passes in the sciences, while ignoring other talents for the children, we’re at fault, too.’ . . . “ The association cited the forum as one way that “News organizations around the world are finding new ways to show young audiences how to critically examine content for its credibility — and have some fun in the process.” “By means of a set of free reports and an extensive database, both commissioned by the American Press Institute, WAN-IFRA suggests more than 100 ways news organizations can get started on the crucial task of helping young audiences learn to use the news and navigate all kinds of content,” Aralynn McMane reported. “When we talk about Asian eyes, we talk about slantedness, roundness, smooth monolids and deep eyelid folds. But what we’re also talking about is Westernization, beauty standards and self-acceptance,” Jessica Prois wrote on Oct. 31 for HuffPost. Her story was part of “Listen to America,” in which HuffPost hit the road “to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears — and what it means to be American today.” “To talk about Asian eyes is to have a unique lexicon,” Prois continued. “There are clinical terms — like the epicanthal folds. There are secret tools and routines — like eyelid tape. And there are hushed ways to talk about permanent changes — like ‘getting your eyelid surgery.’ “For Asians and Asian-Americans, eyes are the literal portal through which we perceive beauty standards — and they’re often the physical feature we use to measure ourselves against these benchmarks. “In America, there’s a history of Asian eyes, racism and disenfranchisement. Propaganda signs at the time of Japanese-American imprisonment during World War II or when the Chinese Exclusion Act was in force during the 19th and 20th centuries depicted characters with hyperbolized slanted eyes to dehumanize Asians. And these stereotypes persist today. “Asian-Americans who spoke to HuffPost expressed everything from dissatisfaction to ultimate acceptance of their eyes and appearance. Their feelings about Asian eyes were fraught with centuries-old, cross-continental beliefs about attractiveness. They described a confluence of factors informing how they see their eyes — including a history of war, Westernization, an unforgiving media and unattainable beauty standards. “Below, hear from 13 Asian-American men and women about slants, folds, taunts and self-acceptance. . . .”  “What is Latinx and why do so many people dislike the term?” NBC Latino asked on Tuesday. “NBC Latino went out to the streets of New York to ask people what they think about the term.” (video) Lawyers, Legislators Fight Criminalization of Poverty “While most people in this country believe that debtors’ prisons are a thing of the past, Americans are in jail by the thousands for no other reason than being unable to pay a fine and its accompanying fees — which is unconstitutional, in many instances,” Peter Edelman wrote Friday for the Nation. “Yet even when jail doesn’t ensue, the courts’ policy of garnishing wages and seizing tax refunds creates a prison of another kind. An estimated 10 million people currently owe a collective $50 billion in court debt. “Meanwhile, even more people are locked up pending trial on low-level misdemeanors or violations because they can’t afford the bail set for them. “Altogether, roughly 500,000 people are in jails across the country simply because they are poor. These men and women haven’t been found guilty of any crime. Rather, most of them have merely been accused of low-level infractions that shouldn’t be crimes at all and that often don’t carry jail time. One result is that many low-income people plead guilty just to get out even if they are innocent, leaving them with a lifetime of collateral consequences. (For more on this, see ‘The Injustice of Cash Bail,’ by Bryce Covert, in the November 6 issue of The Nation.) “The criminalization of poverty has metastasized into other areas as well. . . .” However, Edelman wrote later in the piece, “Across the country, a growing movement is pushing back, using everything from law to legislation to policy to dismantle the vicious circle of debt and incarceration that traps so many poor people. “Lawyers have been at the forefront of this push. . . .” “Radio Mwana aims to empower the province’s indigenous people by training pygmy teenagers as youth reporters,” Christopher Clark reported Tuesday from Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of Congo, for the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Sixteen-year-old Elisée Nyanokonzo used to be afraid to walk alone around the streets of Mbandaka, the crumbling provincial of Équateur Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “As a Batwa pygmy, Nyanokonzo was constantly fearful of being taunted or attacked by someone from the majority Bantu population, known to routinely stigmatise the Batwa minority. “ ‘I never felt comfortable approaching a Bantu. I’d been made to believe I was less than them, that we pygmies weren’t whole people,’ Nyanokonzo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “But that changed last year, when Nyanokonzo was recruited into a project at a community radio station called Radio Mwana — meaning ‘child’ in the local Lingala language. “Launched in late 2014 with the support of Congolese non-profit groups Secteur Media and Children’s Radio Foundation, Radio Mwana aims to empower the province’s indigenous people by training pygmy teenagers as youth reporters. “Together with young Bantu reporters, Nyanokonzo and other teenage Batwa reporters now produce eight radio programmes a month, drawing a sizable listenership across Mbandaka and in the forested countryside that surrounds the city. . . .” If all of these below mentioned (white) mass  killers had been black, brown and/or Muslim - we would have been collectively placed in internment camps.

Ethan Miller/Getty Images When Cam, the Grammy-nominated singer and co-writer of the 2015 breakthrough single “Burning House,” released that starkly intense tune about a failed relationship, it set off a chain reaction she was initially unprepared to deal with. She was soon hearing what she recalls were some “really heavy” personal stories from fans about how they could relate to its metaphorical message, which equated a home engulfed in flames with a couple who have been burned and scarred by their experiences with one another. “At first I got a little freaked out because I didn’t quite know… I’m like, ‘I’m just a kid, I don’t have the answer!” she tells Rolling Stone Country. “And then you realize people are just sharing because you shared, and you opened up this floodgate, you know, and they just want a hug. It’s an amazing thing.” Related

						The Best Audiophile Turntables for Your Home Audio System The personal feedback from that tune, she notes, helped prepare her for yet another flood of response as she released “Diane,” the exhilarating first taste of her upcoming second LP. The confessional tale from the perspective of a remorseful woman as she reveals to her ex’s wife that she was unaware he was married while they were involved, “Diane” bounces along to a carefree beat – think vintage ABBA/Fleetwood Mac – but at its darker heart is an earnest plea for understanding, forgiveness and female solidarity. Flipping the script on Dolly Parton’s auburn-haired temptress, “Jolene,” “Diane” – which, like “Burning House,” was penned by the singer with Jeff Bhasker and Tyler Johnson – is the victim of indiscretion, and the earnestness in Cam’s remarkable vocal comes not from a place of self-pity or fear, but from the knowledge that the truth will, with any luck, set you free.  “This song came from me thinking about one of my good friends whose parents went through a rough divorce,” says the California-born performer. “One of my other good friends right now is going through a rough divorce. Infidelity is obviously, if it’s not happening to you, it’s happening to your best friend. It’s something that happens all the time and people just don’t want to talk about. So, this is kind of taking the lid off and letting people talk about it.” While clandestine meetings, inappropriate photo-sharing and secret marriages are just a few of the details that have emerged from tales she’s heard, Cam says the search for truth is the one constant thread in all of them. “Everyone deserves the truth,” she says. “There’s not a story that says, ‘I wish I never knew.’ It’s not OK to act like it’s polite to hide the truth from people. Yes, it’s gonna be hard, it’s gonna be a difficult conversation. You need to know what your motives are, about how you’re telling someone and when you’re telling someone, but everyone deserves the truth.” Cam notes that the hotly anticipated follow-up to her Untamed album is “90 percent there,” adding that there are a few songs that need more production, and there are some that are still in contention for inclusion on the project, which will be released sometime next year. “We all like tweaking up until the last minute,” she explains, “when someone literally pries it out of our hands and says, ‘It’s going. You have to let go.’ Otherwise it feels weird to stop and say, ‘Oh, it’s in the can for a few months.’ We don’t let you do that. It’s almost done, but we will continue tweaking until the last day, I assure you.” On November 28th, Cam will head back to her home state for the Best Coast Tour, and in between stops on that California trek, will play the final two shows opening for George Strait as his 2017 Las Vegas residency comes to a close.  “Every time someone actually says that out loud, I kind of, like, can’t believe it,” she says with a laugh. “People come in from all over. Most of them buy tickets for two nights to hear the first 30 Number Ones and the second 30 Number Ones. They’re dancing to their wedding songs, crying to their first love songs. It’s just like a whole lifetime soundtrack that he’s playing; people have just lived their whole lives with him.” In the wake of last month’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, Cam returned to the city for the Vegas Strong concert and has also visited survivors who remain hospitalized there. “I got to meet with the ER staff, got to hang out at the radio stations… and one girl said, ‘Before this, I never was really proud to be from Las Vegas, there wasn’t really anything….’ Now, after we watched how everyone came together, she’s so proud. She’ll be proud for the rest of her life, to be from Las Vegas. Because even though I know the headlines were like this horrible moment in time, all the good completely outweighs it, when you actually go hear all the stories.” As the conversation about not only concert security but also gun control has escalated in the weeks since the tragedy, Cam says she has been comforted and impressed by the country music community’s reaction and notes that the conversation needs to continue. “We think of fans as family,” she says. “I think the next step that you think of is how concerned everyone is for security. [T]hen the next part is gun control and talking about what that means. I think people are realizing the divisiveness over, like, when people are trying to make it like someone’s trying to take away your guns. Nobody’s trying to take away guns. Eighty percent of gun owners believe that there should be background checks.” As one of a very small group of country musicians who signed an open letter to Congress in 2016, Cam joined the Dixie Chicks and Rosanne Cash, along with nearly 200 artists and executives, in an effort to address gun violence and a need for reform after the mass killings at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub that June. Billboard, which printed the initial letter, reran it after the events at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.  “People wanted to come on Twitter and come at me for backing background checks,” the singer recalls. “And the thing is, the overall narrative becomes ‘which side are you on?’ As if there’s a side to a completely multifaceted thing. I hope that people can start seeing through that. What you realize is that there is something we can all agree on, and it’s just that nobody should be able to walk in and buy that many guns. We do it for Sudafed! We can come up with a couple basic things, and it’s not anti-guns. I’m coming from a household that has guns. I think not letting politics divide everyone is hopefully where we’re headed.” Next week, Cam participates in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, airing at 9 a.m. on NBC. In This Article:

346,https://www.opednews.com/articles/An-epidemic-of-mental-illn-by-Paul-Abramson-Health_Mental-Health-Privacy-171210-229.html,"We soon mark the anniversary of the shooting that wounded Rep. Giffords
(January 8th) and others that day. We'll sooner see the anniversary of Sandy Hook in
Newtown CT (December 14th), and too many others.
After recently being reacquainted with a friend from the '70s who shared a horrific
series of events that he endured as a child and a teen, it is painfully obvious that
we need to address our failing and deteriorating mental-health systems,
specifically research, to develop and use improved diagnostic tools to properly
diagnose mental illnesses. This friend's parents had their child institutionalized between ages five and
seventeen, at great cost, merely to be rid of him. In addition, the private
institutions happily kept him there without any medical basis or diagnosis while
receiving large sums of money.
The lack of substantive diagnostic tools to accurately diagnose mental illness and, at the time, the lack of regulation allowing two private mental-health institutions
(in MN and IL) to admit and detain him for years with no documented diagnosis
is inhumane and unthinkable.
There were also no advocating agencies supporting patient rights, in this case
the child, inappropriately institutionalized and labeled mentally ill, to ensure that
he was being treated appropriately and fairly. Misdiagnosis, or in this case, no
diagnosis results in ineffective or inappropriate treatment, which further worsens
the outcome.
Yes, we have gotten better at diagnosing Autism and Asperger's syndrome,
which is an improvement from the 1970s, when we were institutionalizing
sufferers and essentially mistreating or not treating them at all, but we are still
misdiagnosing bipolar and unipolar disorders. If we had diagnostic tools that
could actually verify a diagnosis, we would be able to treat more effectively and
begin to make progress with the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of mental
illnesses.
We have fewer available beds today in our hospitals and institutions for the
seriously mental ill and we are incarcerating many in our prisons. Fifty years
ago, we began the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill and we transferred
much of the fiscal responsibility to the federal government. During the last thirty
to forty years, we have seen it become a very costly failure, costly in lives and
dollars.
The CDC stated the following in September 2011, comparing illnesses: ""Mental
illnesses account for a larger proportion of disability in developed countries than
any other group of illnesses, including cancer and heart disease."" We have too many instances of mass killings, mass murders/suicides, individual
suicides, and a host of other violent acts that are perpetrated by people who
have gone undetected or undiagnosed.
When we look at the shooting that wounded Rep. Giffords, and others, the Sandy
Hook mass shooting, and too many others, and when these instances are
discussed and analyzed in our media, they are said to have been done generally
by young males who are not that severely ill. When further investigated, family,
friends, educators and others may have seen signs, but they went unmentioned
or not investigated. We also hear too often that they are over eighteen and that
families may not be able to do anything because they are of age and they have
not been a threat previously to themselves or others. Again, mental illness in this country seems to be misdiagnosed, undiagnosed
and/or untreated and when treatment is attempted, many times it is done with
over-prescribing medications that may be creating or exacerbating more
illnesses.
Something clearly needs to be done with what appears to be an epidemic of
mental-illness issues having profound affects on our communities and cities.
In regard to the horrific shootings in Sandy Hook, of Rep. Giffords, and the
others, it is not that they occurred, but that they were preventable, and we
continue to blindly turn our backs on a shattered mental-health system.  1

347,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/flashbacks-nightmares-panic-attacks-las-vegas-survivors-describe-the-emotional-toll/,"Darla Christensen and her son Royce at a candlelit vigil on October 3, 2017.Al Kamalizad/Mother Jones When the bullets started flying on that October evening, some hit Las Vegas’ Route 91 concert stage so close to Royce Christenson that shards of aluminum landed in his hair. He saw a man go down, and the man “did not get back up.” He applied pressure to a bullet wound in a woman’s leg. Amid the chaos, he tried to keep people hidden behind tour buses, and keep them calm. When the shots finally stopped, Christensen exited through the field—“the killing zone,” he calls it—where “there was a body every five feet. Some of them were covered, some of them were not.” In an area where people had taken the injured, the gutters were covered in blood. He looked up and saw a truck weighed down with the wounded and the dead screech by, honking its horn. “I had never seen any video game, any movie, nothing that prepared me for the gruesome things I was seeing,” he recalls. “I didn’t know how to react, I guess, I just started laughing—that nervous laughter that you can’t believe it.” More than a month has passed since the massacre in Las Vegas that claimed 58 lives and wounded hundreds more, but Christensen can’t shake the scenes from his head. Sometimes he’ll be at the sink washing his hands and find himself transported back to “that place,” he says—the screaming and running, the rapid-fire gunshots, the people sobbing over their loved ones—and he doesn’t snap out of it until the sink starts to overflow. His mother, Darla, who was also at the concert, instinctively takes cover behind cement walls when she’s near tall buildings, subconsciously seeking out barriers that would shield her from gunfire. Neither of them get much sleep these days, and they have a hard time going out. Royce and Darla are members of a family of security guards who work for Contemporary Services Corporation, a crowd management company that provided security for the Route 91 Country music festival. Royce was positioned closest to the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, and therefore, the shooter. My colleague Al Kamalizad and I covered their story in the days after the massacre, when they spoke at a roadside candlelit vigil. The Mandalay Bay loomed golden in the background as a collection of survivors shared their stories. “Twenty-two thousand people were in attendance Sunday night,” said Samantha French, a Las Vegas native who spoke at the vigil. “That’s 22,000 people who experienced war.”  Now, after the initial shock has faded, survivors are confronted with how to deal with what may prove, in some cases, to be long-term trauma. “On average, about 20 percent of people who experience events that are tragic to this degree are susceptible to PTSD,” says Noelle Lefforge, the assistant director of clinical services and research at The Practice, UNLV’s community mental health clinic, which has been offering free services to those affected by the shooting. “We know that a significant number of people are going to have a really hard time returning to functioning after this.” Lefforge says mental health workers are just beginning to see what the long-term impact might look like. Some survivors have been able to return to normal life, yet others remain overwhelmed. “This has really shattered their sense of safety in this world.” As with combat soldiers, it’s not uncommon, she says, for survivors to experience a sense of hypervigilance: They’re quick to startle, they have nightmares and trouble sleeping, and they find it difficult to concentrate and connect with others. Some, like Royce, have panic attacks. “The stress on the nervous system this can cause can impact your immune functioning,” Lefforge adds. “You can literally be more susceptible to feeling sick.” In 2015, my colleagues at Mother Jones published a breakthrough investigation, in collaboration with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation economist Ted Miller, on the annual cost of gun violence in America. The report found that the total financial impact exceeds $229 billion annually, including direct costs such as emergency care, medical expenses, and court and prison costs, and indirect ones related to declines in a person’s productivity and quality of life. The long-term cost to society of a single murder is almost a half-million dollars, according to the report—a typical victim’s hospital expenses runs more than $10,000, and mental health treatment for the victim’s family in an average case exceeds $11,500.  There are gaps in what we know about the costs associated with mental trauma caused by gun violence. As my colleague Mark Follman wrote in the investigation, Miller had to rely on a study he co-authored back in 1998 to estimate current costs because no contemporary research existed. That study calculated the rate at which people sought counseling, and the corresponding costs. “Applying those numbers to current data on gun injuries and deaths gives an estimate of $410 million annually in direct mental-health costs,” Follman wrote. “But that sum would rise substantially if all gun victims and their families could afford to seek counseling. Miller hasn’t had resources to build on the data since, and Mother Jones could find no other firearm-related mental-health studies by government or private institutions.” But it’s clear that survivors such as Royce and Darla suffer an array of consequences. Shortly after the shooting, unnerved by simply being in Las Vegas, Royce flew to Utah to spend time with his fiancé. He missed several weeks of work. The first day back on the job, he had a panic attack. “Being back in my uniform brought some bad memories,” he notes. Many of the events he provides security for have fireworks, which is problematic because, like so many at the Route 91 music festival, he first thought that was what the gunshots were. “If I don’t know about it,” he says, “it can catch me off guard and I duck for cover.” Royce, who finds comfort in group therapy and who sees a counselor no less than once a week, has had several panic attacks since the Route 91 shootings, at work and elsewhere. He’s sometimes surprised by what triggers them. “Maybe the smell of pine dirt, like what was there in the back of the stage, or maybe the smell of blood—or somebody screams in an awkward way, or maybe for no reason at all—and I’ll have these flashbacks and start crying.” The same thing has happened to Darla. “I went to go visit someone to give them a thank you gift, and where she lives she has a view of the strip,” she told me. “I looked down and instantly started crying.” For the first week after the shooting, the Christensens wouldn’t leave the house for fear of what they might encounter. On sleepless nights, they would find each other pacing in the living room, trying to calm themselves down. Even now, says Darla, “I question how to keep my family safe.” Their sense of insecurity was only exacerbated by news of the rampage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, one month after the Las Vegas massacre. “Hearing about that church shooting, it puts you right there,” says Darla. “You know what they went through, what they felt and what they heard and what they saw…People say, ‘You’re probably in the safest city in the world right now because this definitely won’t happen again.’ And then, when another mass shooting happens, suddenly you’re like, ‘Oh wait, this is pretty darn common.’” “It scares me to think of all these shootings lately,” Royce says. “I feel so much for those people.” He adds: “Before the shooting, I thought it couldn’t happen to me. After, I feel like it could happen anywhere.” Nevada’s mental health system is being stretched by the Las Vegas aftermath—perhaps beyond its capacity. Psychologist Michelle Paul, a professor at UNLV who was among a small army of volunteer mental health professionals who mobilized after the shooting, told Mother Jones that Nevada was already facing a mental health crisis. “We don’t have providers for the need, and that was before this happened. Are people going to be able to find a therapist without a long waiting list? Are they going to find somebody who takes their insurance?” “We’re dedicated to doing everything we can,” says Lefforge, Paul’s colleague, “but it is pretty daunting to consider this on top of everything else we were already doing.” Time will help, but survivors will face heartbreaking milestones that bring their horrific memories flooding back. “A month is one milestone,” says Lefforge. “But people have their own dates: If you’ve lost somebody, you’re going to have to struggle through their birthdays and anniversaries, and with the holidays coming up, they’re going to have a different experience this year.” In terms of scope, the Vegas massacre was perhaps the most shocking event in a horrific year for mass shootings. They began in January with a rampage at Fort Lauderdale airport. In the months to follow, there were mass shootings in downtown Fresno, California; at an Ohio nursing home; an awning manufacturer in Orlando, Florida; a Pennsylvania supermarket; a San Francisco UPS store; the Las Vegas strip; a Maryland business park, a Colorado Wal-Mart; a Baptist church in rural Texas; and in the rural town of Rancho Tehama, California. All told, there have been nearly 700 casualties—not including family members, friends, and bystanders left to navigate their newfound grief. Until it happened to him, Royce says, “I wasn’t afraid of the world.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

348,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/the-house-just-took-one-step-toward-allowing-americans-to-carry-concealed-guns-everywhere/,"RonBailey/iStock The semi-perennial attempt by House Republicans to allow anyone permitted to carry a concealed gun in one state to be able to do so in any other state—even if that state has much stricter standards for issuing concealed carry permits—took a frightening step forward Wednesday afternoon. HR 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which the National Rifle Association (NRA) has called the group’s “highest legislative priority” in 2017, passed the House—taking the provision as close as its ever been to becoming reality. Introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) on the first day of the year’s legislative session, HR 38 lingered relatively untouched for most of the year until last week when there was a flurry of unexpected activity: GOP leaders, after conducting a whip count and sensing the measure would have enough support to pass a floor vote, passed it out of the House Judiciary Committee, while simultaneously rejecting amendments brought by Democrats, including banning violent offenders. Debate on the House floor lasted just an hour on the bill, and six Democrats joined a united Republican caucus in voting to pass it. The legislation can now be taken up for a vote in the Senate. Strategically, and despite the efforts of some on the left, Republicans had folded reciprocity into a broader guns package that also includes a bi-partisan measure called the Fix NICS Act—a provision aimed at improving the accuracy of background check data in order to prevent criminals and individuals with mental illness from being able to purchase guns. This notion gained particular urgency after the recent mass shooting in Texas, in which the gunman had been convicted of assaulting his wife and his infant stepson while in the Air Force, but the military never sent his criminal records to the background checks databases. The move put Democrats in a difficult position: In order to pass the Fix NICS Act—which has support from groups as varied as Everytown for Gun Safety and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence to the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the NRA—they had no real choice but to pass the national reciprocity bill, which in various forms has been opposed by the party for years. Gun advocates typically claim that the need for reciprocity is a matter of convenience to travelers who must contend with a “patchwork” of gun laws while on interstate road trips, often decrying, as Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) did on Twitter after the House voted on Wednesday, “The Second Amendment doesn’t disappear when law-abiding citizens cross state lines. H.R. 38 guarantees that.” Opponents, meanwhile, argue that reciprocity effectively guts existing state laws. Some states have stringent safeguards in place for issuing conceal carry permits, like mandating training and thorough evaluations; other states do almost nothing to vet the people who would be carrying guns in public. In Utah, for instance, all someone has to do to get a concealed carry permit is take a gun safety class certified by the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification. In Virginia, people get four attempts to answer 15 of 20 questions correctly after taking an online course to get a permit. Currently, 19 states don’t require any gun safety training in order to carry a concealed gun in public, and 12 states don’t require a permit or background check, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. HR 38 effectively neutralizes the playing field. What’s more, there is a loophole that would allow individuals who don’t qualify for a permit in their state of residence to be able to get one in a state with little to no restrictions. “Under Hudson’s bill, a California resident who cannot get a concealed-carry permit in California can easily get one from Utah, and then carry guns in California without ever setting foot in Utah, and not for some short duration like a tourist stay, but for the rest of his life and every day,” Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles, explained to me when the bill was introduced in January. “The real impact of the Hudson bill is not to protect interstate travelers; it’s to require states with restrictive concealed-carry policies to allow their own residents to carry guns.” A handful of previous efforts to pass national reciprocity have failed. And while HR 38 has now passed the House, a version of it will still have to contend with the Senate, which will need eight Democrats to support the measure for it to pass. While those prospects seem slim, if it were to pass the Senate, two things are certain: First, it’s all but guaranteed that President Trump will sign it into law. “Trump has been a strong supporter from the very beginning of the whole concept of concealed carry, even before he ran for president,” says Todd Rathner, a prominent gun rights lobbyists based in Arizona. “I don’t think he’d have any hesitations signing this.” The second is that lawsuits will be waiting. In a statement, Eric Tirschwell, director of litigation and national enforcement policy for Everytown for Gun Safety, said, “We fully expect that the Senate will hear the voices of law enforcement and the public, and stop this dangerous legislation from becoming law. But if it were to make it to the president’s desk, we’d be waiting on the other side fully prepared to challenge it in court.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

349,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/10/4/1703712/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-The-politics-of-it-all,"James Hohmann/WaPo: The Daily 202: 10 ways politics may — or may not — change after the Las Vegas shooting Virtually no Republican in Congress, and certainly no one in leadership, is willing to cross the powerful gun lobby. Even if Trump decided he wanted to act, which he will not, his party would block him…. But Vegas makes it much harder for Republicans to roll back existing gun laws. In the wake of the attack, House Republican leaders have decided to table a bill that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. At least for now. “That bill, introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), has been approved by the Natural Resources Committee and was expected to be on the House floor soon, though it had not yet been scheduled for a vote,” Politico reports. “Consideration of the bill was (already) postponed earlier this year after Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot in June at a congressional baseball practice.” Khaled Beydoun/WaPo: We have yet to determine whether [Las Vegas shooter Stephen] Paddock was motivated by anyone or anything, so many are tiptoeing around terms such as “terrorist.” But if Paddock were Muslim, his status as a local individual would be entirely irrelevant, and the motive of “Islamic terrorism” or “jihad” would likely be immediately assumed, even without any evidence. The Las Vegas shooting raises several questions linked to race and religion and how they figure into our imagining and policing of terrorism. President Trump has ushered in the third phase of the war on terror, and his brazen “clash of civilization” rhetoric around U.S. anti-terrorism policy and programming has fixated on Muslims. ProPublica: Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. Were Close to Being Charged With Felony Fraud New York prosecutors were preparing a case. Then the D.A. overruled his staff after a visit from a top donor: Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz. In one email, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the emails, they worried that a reporter might be onto them. In yet another, Donald Jr. spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the email. There was “no doubt” that the Trump children “approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,” one person who saw the emails told us. “They knew it was wrong.” Reed Galen/RCP: These are questions we rarely ever had to ask ourselves. We never would’ve thought about them. But too many mass shootings later, there is no segment of society, no demographic, no geography, no political bent that is safe from the AR-15 or the AK-47 on American soil. That is a disgrace. What’s worse than that? So many of us are so desensitized to these horrors that we’re beginning to believe that this is now just part of life. Don’t. Don’t allow yourself to fall into that trap. We cannot and we must not forget the shattered latticework of lives affected by these events. Change can only begin and end with us. It won’t be delivered to our doorstep by Amazon. If chaos truly presents opportunities, let’s take this one and make something of it. We owe it to all those kids, office workers and concert-goers who will never have the chance.  President Trump: ""Now I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack"" https://t.co/3DSMX2ysAx  David Frum/Atlantic: Trump’s speech to the nation after the Las Vegas atrocity, however, was steeped in hypocrisy. He is the least outwardly religious president of modern times, the president least steeped in scripture. For him to offer the consolations of God and faith after mass bloodletting is to invite derision. “It is love that defines us,” said President Trump, and if we weren’t heartbroken, we would laugh. Those who praised the speech, as CNN’s John King did, are reacting on reflex. This is the kind of thing we are used to hearing from Republican politicians; Trump is a Republican politician; therefore this is what he should say. But whereas Vice President Pence could have pronounced those words with sincerity, or a convincing simulacrum thereof, Donald Trump looked shifty, nervous, and false. Speeches are watched as well as heard, and the viewer saw a president who wished he were somewhere else because he had been compelled to pretend something so radically false to his own nature.  I see your well-reasoned arguments. However, you've elected ppl who are handsomely paid & richly rewarded to refuse to see reason.  Aaron Blake/WaPo: Terrorism or not? Las Vegas reignites a real — and really important — debate.  This may seem like a semantic debate. Lots of people are dead and wounded, and a word isn't going to change that. But that word does have all kinds of implications for how these episodes are treated both by the federal government and in our national discourse. It's important. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) noted the implications of the debate.  Now we're obsessing over whether the NV carnage was ""terrorism"". If we decide it is, we'll mobilize untold resources. If not, nothing.   As for the technical definition of terrorism, it importantly deals with the motive rather than the size of the carnage. Federal law says terrorism is “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” In other words, whether 50 people are killed or a few people are hurt, what matters is what the attacker intended.  @JeremyKonyndyk Jeremy Konyndyk with further observations on Trump's response to Puerto Rico https://t.co/Q29hbXgwNt  Greg Sargent/WaPo: Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue on guns was very powerful. It’s not enough, Jimmy. No question, Kimmel said many of the things that needed to be said. He demolished the dumb talking point that now is not the time to debate solutions: “We have 59 innocent people dead, it wasn’t their time, either.” He excoriated the fact that gun violence has now become accepted as routine. He rightly contrasted inaction on guns with our willingness to use government to combat other public safety threats. He even named names, tearing into Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan for offering empty “thoughts and prayers” while doing nothing, because “the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” But Kimmel nowhere fingered the Republican Party as the obstacle to action on this issue, instead aiming the blame at “congresspeople.” If you are Jimmy Kimmel, and you want more regulation of guns, the Republican Party is your problem. The Democratic Party has long supported and pushed for the very same solutions Kimmel called for last night. The GOP has blocked them. James Fagone/HuffPost: WHAT BULLETS DO TO BODIES The gun debate would change in an instant if Americans witnessed the horrors that trauma surgeons confront every day. [Trauma surgeon Amy] Goldberg jumped in. “As a country,” Goldberg said, “we lost our teachable moment.” She started talking about the 2012 murder of 20 schoolchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Goldberg said that if people had been shown the autopsy photos of the kids, the gun debate would have been transformed. “The fact that not a single one of those kids was able to be transported to a hospital, tells me that they were not just dead, but really really really really dead. Ten-year-old kids, riddled with bullets, dead as doornails.” Her voice rose. She said people have to confront the physical reality of gun violence without the polite filters. “The country won’t be ready for it, but that’s what needs to happen. That’s the only chance at all for this to ever be reversed.” It is so hard to ask families and relatives to release these pictures. Don’t say: “if they would just...” If you haven’t been there, you don’t know what you are asking. Not everyone has the strength and resolve of Emmett Till’s mother. White House says now not the time for gun debate https://t.co/ClB9cVo64F pic.twitter.com/iKc7emAEl2  Ã¢ÂÂThe time is always right to do what is right.Ã¢ÂÂ Martin Luther King, Jr. https://t.co/lWo5zFbEPx  Monkey Cage Blog/WaPo: In our research, we discovered that people who live close to a mass shooting are more likely to support gun control than those who don’t. Alice Dreger/Chronicles of Higher Education, in a piece I find hard to characterize, about academic freedom. BTW, sexual discussions with Alice are not only not rare, they are what she does. The blowjob reference is not gratuitous: Take Back the Ivory Tower Democracy depends on having a public capable of thinking Forgive me while I reminisce about the days when I worked at a place that protected a Holocaust denier on the faculty. This was in early 2006, when I was only about a year into my decade of being on the faculty at Northwestern University. An electrical-engineering professor named Arthur Butz had just made a statement denying the Holocaust. In response, our university president, Henry Bienen, issued a statement I saved like a prize: ""There is no question that the Holocaust is a well-documented historical fact,"" but ""we cannot take action based on the content of what Butz says regarding the Holocaust — however odious it may be — without undermining the vital principle of intellectual freedom that all academic institutions serve to protect."" In other words, the brilliance of the many depends fundamentally on the right of the one to be stupid. Reading Bienen’s statement, I knew Northwestern was a place where I could do what I needed to do as a scholar and teacher. We had the right to be wrong! And that was true. Until Northwestern’s administration changed, along with the rest of academia, and I learned the hard way that I had been branded. Trigger warning: Here comes the blowjob.  Ã¢ÂÂResist tribalism. Punish one another only for the mortal sin of making crap up.Ã¢ÂÂ --@AliceDreger to scholars.https://t.co/UaLu44d74c  For the record, the manuscript specified making shit up."" https://t.co/6XwhbheJIN  Dan Drezner/WaPo: Yesterday the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released its first in-depth poll about what Americans think about America first [Full disclosure: I am on the advisory board that oversees this survey.] My Post colleagues Dan Balz and Emily Guskin suggest that the reports are not good for the Republican Party: “The council’s survey finds that Trump’s most fervent supporters solidly support his views on these issues, but Republicans with less favorable impressions of the president are far less enthusiastic and are more closely aligned in their attitudes with the overall population. The survey also underscores the degree to which Trump, despite the bully pulpit of the White House, has been unable to shift public opinion in his direction on foreign policy issues. In fact, the opposite has occurred. Public attitudes have moved away from a number of the positions he espoused during his campaign and since.” Someday…. this might happen. It’s years and years away.

The tensions came to a head around the time President Donald Trump delivered a politicized speech in late July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson once led, the officials said. Just days earlier, Tillerson had openly disparaged the president, referring to him as a “moron,” after a July 20 meeting at the Pentagon with members of Trump’s national security team and Cabinet officials, according to three officials familiar with the incident.

The country superstar sat down for an interview with NBC’s Today show, describing the horrific experience from the first moments he realized something was wrong to his thoughts since the massacre that rocked the country-music community and sparked a new gun debate in the U.S. “So, when it first happened, I thought a speaker had blown is what I thought. It just sounded like a crackling something,” Aldean said. “I’m kind of looking around like, ‘What is that?’ Trying to figure out what it is. Well then it stopped. So I was like, ‘Alright, well they must have got it fixed.’ And so I kept doing my thing, and then it happened again and it lasted longer the second time.” Related

But fully processing the tragedy, which claimed 58 lives and injured more than 500, has taken much more time, he explained. Getting back onstage at the Country Rising benefit in Nashville this past weekend was, he noted, “therapeutic.” Since the shootings, he has returned to visit some of the injured in Las   Vegas, adding that the nation can’t move forward while divisiveness reigns. “There’s so much focus on politics and race and all these other things that just… at the end of the day, we’re all in this together. We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time working on the issue that’s really the problem,” he said. Also featured in the above video are fellow artists Dierks Bentley and Lady Antebellum. Lady A singer Charles Kelley recalled reaching out to Aldean in the wake of the shooting. “We’re texting Aldean and he’s texting us back, telling us, ‘It was the scariest moment. I hope you never have to go through it,'” Kelley said. “I’ve never told him I loved him ever before and that was the first thing: ‘I love you, buddy, so much. So glad you’re safe.'” In This Article:

352,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/insider/sutherland-springs-shooting-media-frenzy-adding-to-towns-pain.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Simon Romero SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — It wasn’t the television presenters elbowing their way to the front of the scrum near the massacre scene that finally drove home how the news media was aggravating the tragedy here. It wasn’t the run on food at Theresa’s Kitchen or the point at which the number of journalists seemed to rival the few hundred souls of the town’s population. It was the scene in Rosanne Solis’ living room. Ms. Solis, 57, a former factory worker who was shot in the shoulder when a gunman killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church last week, had agreed to an interview with The New York Times. Through fatigue and pain, she described in detail the trauma of surviving one of the most hideous mass shootings in United States history. As I got up and thanked Ms. Solis for her graciousness at such a strenuous time, the door to her trailer home swung open and a swarm of other journalists rushed inside. Without asking permission, a photographer began taking pictures a few inches from Ms. Solis’ face. A television crew insisted on an interview as she tended her wound. “Please, no, I’m just too tired,” Ms. Solis told them. But as I went to my rental car to file my story, no one seemed to heed her plea that she was too exhausted to talk. Sitting behind the wheel, I gazed at the horizon and wondered what those of us documenting this tragedy were doing to this poor town. I’ve covered gruesome events around the world — earthquakes, hurricanes, fires. But none of those experiences prepared me for the media maelstrom in Sutherland Springs, a tiny, poverty-stricken town hit by the unimaginable slaughter of babies, children and adults in one of its houses of worship. Ignoring such shootings, or passively accepting how widespread and devastating they are becoming, cannot be an option. But there may also be something terribly wrong with the spectacle of covering this bloodshed. By now, some of my colleagues are veteran chroniclers of such shootings, grimly bumping into one another with gallows humor over the past few years in Las Vegas; Colorado Springs; San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Orlando, Fla. Perhaps because of the small size of Sutherland Springs, the ungainliness of the media’s rush to cover the latest shooting touched a nerve here. As satellite trucks staked out coveted parking spots and broadcasters from around the world described the town’s horrors in German or Russian or Portuguese, tempers flared. Some residents in the town simply slammed doors in journalists’ faces, a reaction any of us might have had under such circumstances. Others in the town put a price on their cooperation. Reporters from a wide array of organizations scrambled to interview anyone else they could find. “Eventually the media pressure began to weigh even on me,” Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote in an eloquent apology to the people of Sutherland Springs. “I did a few on-the-ground interviews before rejecting the rest. It was too stressful. I expressed my growing disgust with a few other journalists, and many agreed with me.” Journalists were not the only ones who descended on the town. Sidewalk preachers from San Antonio convened at the Valero gas station opposite the church, bellowing their prayers, if not in front of townspeople then for reporters’ iPhone cameras. Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team meandered through the town. Brad Kessler, an aspirant for mayor of San Antonio, dropped in to shake hands around the yellow crime-scene tape that cordoned off the killing field. The Homicide Survivors Support Group of Corpus Christi set up a table with stuffed animals, where reporters quickly conducted interviews with the volunteers. I grew up in a rural outpost in northern New Mexico about the size of Sutherland Springs. I know how suspicious, and sometimes awed, residents of small towns can be of privileged, big-city visitors. Still, I have a hard time imagining what it’s like for the people here to have so many cameras pointed at them and so many tape recorders thrust their way. As some of the network television trucks began to pull out of town, I wondered how big a role I myself had played in amplifying the suffering of Sutherland Springs. After all, I, too, had approached residents who wanted nothing to do with reporters. I’d asked Ms. Solis, the factory worker, to talk to me when she could have been tending the shoulder where a bullet had sundered her flesh. When the country endures one mass shooting after another, why they happen certainly ought to be the main focus of the national conversation. But maybe it’s time we also discuss how they’re covered on the ground. For now, I’m left wondering what happens next in Sutherland Springs. Bertha Cardenas-Lomas, 57, the head of the town’s cemetery board, seemed to be in shock as I interviewed her, expressing dismay over all the friends and neighbors she now has to bury. She touched on what it’s like to face a barrage of interview requests when she’s struggling to simply mow the grass on the burial ground. “No one can ever be prepared to find their way in this situation,” she said, holding her head in her hands. “I’m afraid that the real pain, the reality of this violence, will set in when all of you are gone.” Advertisement",2017-11-13 12:58:47,"Covering a Mass Shooting, and Adding to a Town&#x2019;s Pain",,1,http://nytimes.com
353,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/guns-congress-shootings.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion-editorials,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board Last year, Senator Christopher Murphy decided it was time to resort to a filibuster about the need to control the nation’s relentless gun violence. With the help of colleagues in the Senate chamber, he spoke for 15 hours. Nothing changed. This year, the Connecticut Democrat, sounding even more desperate, tried political candor: “I wish it didn’t feel like Groundhog Day — but one day it won’t,” Mr. Murphy insisted after the Las Vegas gun rampage left 58 dead and many more wounded last month. “There’s no great social change movement in this country that didn’t have failures before it had success,” he said of his perennial proposal, perennially rejected, for tighter background checks on gun buyers. In the Capitol, no one more clearly epitomizes the Groundhog Day image of dogged persistence in the face of repeated rejection than Senator Dianne Feinstein. The California Democrat responded to the Texas massacre last week (26 dead) by once more introducing her signature proposal to revive the federal ban on rapid-fire assault weapons adapted from the military battlefield. Resolute as Sisyphus, she had helped pioneer and steer to passage a 1994 ban with a 10-year life (the result of a compromise) that the equally dogged National Rifle Association successfully blocked when the time came for renewal. Had the earlier ban survived, and her fellow legislators showed the same gumption in the face of the gun lobby’s threats, the sorts of military-style, semiautomatic weapons brandished to spray death in Las Vegas and Texas would have been banned. Now she’s back again, ignoring Groundhog Day with a passion that was ignited in 1978 when, as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, she was the first on the scene when two colleagues — Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone — were shot to death by an assassin. She persists, she explains, “so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.” Meanwhile, to fool those same people, and dampen public outrage, President Trump and Republican legislators in political hock to the N.R.A. have trotted out familiar political bromides: Isn’t this a complex mental health problem? And that awful “bump stock” gadget that sped up the Las Vegas shooter’s firing power — shouldn’t that be banned instead of the weapon itself? Ms. Feinstein, who knows this shell game, already has a bump stock ban in her latest proposal, along with more than 200 different assault weapons now flooding the gun industry’s civilian market, plus ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. She points out that the rate of mass shootings has grown with the modern market’s access to these rapid-fire weapons, more than doubling in the most recent decade to 50 mass shootings and 437 deaths. For lawmakers who would rather praise first responders than confront the real issue, the senator notes that one in five police officers who perished in the line of duty in 2014 was killed by an assault weapon. Last week’s elections produced victories for some Democratic candidates who dared call for tougher gun safety. From Mr. Trump came yet another genuflection before the N.R.A. There is no gun problem in the nation that cannot be dealt with, he said, if enough citizens have guns. Happy Groundhog Day.

Shear President Trump appeared to offer his condolences for the wrong mass shooting on Tuesday in a late-night Twitter post, which was later deleted. “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post at 11:34 p.m., soon after arriving back in the United States from his 12-day trip through Asia. That attack occurred more than a week ago, on Nov. 5, when a gunman opened fire at a church, killing 26 and wounding 20 others. Another mass shooting took place early Tuesday, as a gunman in California opened fire at an elementary school and other locations, killing at least four people and injuring several others before he was fatally shot by the police. It was not immediately clear whether the error was caused by a sloppy cut-and-paste job by a jet-lagged president or some other issue. A spokesman for the White House did not respond to emails seeking an explanation. But Tuesday’s tweet was very similar to a Twitter post by Mr. Trump on the day of the Texas shooting. Critics on Twitter pointed out that the F.B.I. and law enforcement were in fact needed in California. Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California was the 17th mass shooting this month, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.

          / CBS/AP LAS VEGAS -- A man who survived the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 concert-goers and injured hundreds in Las Vegas has been killed in a hit-and-run in southern Nevada. Roy McClellan of Las Vegas was killed Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on State Route 160 in Pahrump, about 50 miles west of Las Vegas. His widow, Denise McClellan, told KSNV-TV she can't understand why her 52-year-old husband survived the shooting, only to die in a hit-and-run. She says the mass shooting ""was messing with his head"" and that he was undergoing therapy. ""I'm angry. I feel that [the driver] was under the influence of something or drunk and didn't want to get caught, so he bailed and left my husband laying there in the street. He doesn't deserve that,"" McClellan told the station. The Nevada Highway Patrol says it is seeking the driver of a Chevrolet Camaro with front-end damage. Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire at an outdoor music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino before killing himself.

356,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/a30HnIZz3kc/donald-trumps-high-caliber-hypocrisy-on-mental-health-and-guns,"SEARCH ‘Ironically, the assertion that mass violence is about mental health and not guns is all about guns, and not mental health.’ When a white guy shoots up a church or a country music festival, Donald Trump says the problem is the person, not the weapon. “This isn’t a guns situation,” he said after the Sutherland Springs slaughter. “Mental health is your problem here.” But he’s done nothing as president to make it harder for the mentally ill to get guns—quite the contrary. “Seems to me, this is one thing we can all agree on, no guns for the mentally ill,” says DJ Jaffe, founder and executive director of Mental Illness Policy Organization. Jaffe was blogging for The Hill newspaper on the gun issue last year when the Trump campaign contacted him and asked for policy recommendations. He was thrilled when Sam Clovis, Trump’s policy director, told him the campaign had adopted some of his suggestions in the party’s platform. One had to do with guns and the mentally ill, the other with helping parents get around privacy regulations to help adult children. “And then within 90 days (of winning the election), they make it easier for the mentally ill to get a gun,” Jaffe told The Daily Beast. He is referring to an Obama-era gun regulation that would have prevented people unable to work and handle their own money from purchasing guns. With strong NRA backing, the GOP-controlled Senate voted to revoke the rule 57-43, with four red-state Democrats and Maine independent Angus King joining every Republican. Trump signed the measure into law in the Oval Office without any photos or fanfare—signaling his awareness that he had gone back on a campaign promise. After two recent shootings, one in a church in rural Texas, the other along the Las Vegas strip, Trump repeated his convenient dodge that the massacres resulted from a mental health problem, not a gun problem. The connection between mental illness and mass shootings is hotly debated within the mental health community, where advocates say linking the two unfairly stigmatizes people. The ACLU and several disability rights groups joined the NRA in its support for overturning the Obama-era rule. Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, whose constituents include the Sandy Hook parents whose first-graders were gunned down, said during the debate on the rule change, “It is correct to state that there is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being dangerous… But the risk here is not just that an individual is going to buy a gun and use it themselves. The risk is that someone who can’t literally deposit their own paycheck probably can’t, or likely can’t, responsibly own and protect a gun.” Jaffe points out that any decision made under the rule, which Obama pushed through in his final days in office, could be appealed. A proud liberal and a Sanders voter—and someone who has experienced severe mental illness within his family—Jaffe is frustrated that fear over stigmatizing people is standing in the way of getting treatment for the severely mentally ill. “The relationship between violence and untreated mental illness is clear,” he says, offering statistics compiled in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a government report. Eighteen percent of the U.S. population has minor mental health issues, while 4 percent have serious issues that affect their ability to function. That’s 10 million adults over 18—2 million of whom have received no treatment in the past year. “Treating people with serious mental health issues clearly reduces violence,” he says. Often that violence is directed at family members. The most recent mass shooting in Texas, where a family dispute may have been the shooter’s motive, has raised questions about the link with domestic abuse. Even so, mass gun violence statistically remains exceedingly rare, so will eliminating any one factor provide a meaningful reduction? Jeffrey Swanson, a psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor at Duke University, has written extensively on the behavioral links to mass shootings. He thinks acts of past violence are a better predictor of someone predisposed to commit a mass killing. He said in an email that he thinks the president’s statements on mental illness and mass shootings were “misguided and a deflection to avoid talking about guns.” Paul Appelbaum, professor of psychiatry, medicine, and law at Columbia University, said in an email that many of his colleagues welcome tying mass gun violence to mental issues as a way of getting more resources for underfunded mental health services. If Trump says mental illness is the problem, he should commit more money for mental health. He hasn’t, Appelbaum says, because he and other political leaders talking about mental health after massacres aren’t really interested in improving mental health services. “They care a great deal about guns and are very interested in resisting meaningful regulation of access to guns. We see this playing out now as many of the people who talk most about gun violence as a mental health issue support eliminating the ACA, including its Medicaid expansion, which will disproportionately impact people with serious mental illnesses.” Trump has his talking points down. When one of these mass shootings occur, he parrots the NRA, that it’s not guns, it’s mental health, but don’t be fooled, says Appelbaum. “Ironically, the assertion that mass violence is about mental health and not guns is all about guns, and not mental health.”",2017-11-13 05:00:00,Donald Trump’s High-Caliber Hypocrisy on Mental Health and Guns,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

PM May is under pressure to cancel Trump’s as yet unscheduled state visit but has declined to do so, citing our “special relationship”. Apparently they have been completely gobsmacked by Trump’s behavior but are leaning on this special relationship forged in previous decades and centuries, by actual adults, to give Trump a pass. How many times does he get away with it before the special relationship is destroyed?  Perhaps they will just keep dragging it out until he is impeached. One can dream. The responses from British MP’s and government officials and religious leaders have roundly condemned Trump, including the suggestion that Twitter delete his account (for real). www.google.com/... The row was raised in the House of Commons on Thursday morning with Home Secretary Amber Rudd saying she hoped Mrs May's criticism ""would have some impact on the president"".  Responding to a call by MP Peter Bone for the president to delete his Twitter account, she said: ""It's interesting to note [Mr Bone's] advice regarding Twitter accounts - I'm sure many of us might share his view.""  Former Conservative minister Tim Loughton said if Twitter was ""genuine in its commitment to fight hate crime online"" it would delete the US president's account.  Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn asked whether Mr Trump should be ""charged with inciting racial hatred"" if he comes to the UK, a view echoed by fellow Labour MP Naz Shah.  The UK's opposition party is Labour - their foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 5 live that Donald Trump was ""not America"" and the government should ""ignore"" and ""work round him"".  The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the senior bishop in the Church of England, said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"".  Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Mr Trump had ""endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me"", adding: ""He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing."" Trumplodytes, trumpanzees and other knuckle dragging supporters of this disgusting behavior cheered Trump's rebuke of Theresa May Scrivener on Twitter saying “that will leave a mark” and other such high praise, before realizing Trump tweeted some random woman with six Twitter followers. www.google.com/... .@Theresa_May, donÃ¢ÂÂt focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

And I missed nothing at all. Washington Bureau Chief The words in my reporter’s notebook from the day before my daughter was born say “neo-Nazis,” “many sides” and “repugnant.” That’s where the political world froze for me on August 14th at around 1 p.m., when I went into what would be 21 hours of labor, followed by three month and a half months of maternal bliss. In those 90 or so days, I missed approximately 55,541 news cycles—and that’s just inside the White House. While I was trying to master baby origami (a.k.a. swaddling an infant in the dark on 30 minutes of sleep) and Googling things like “neck cheese,” Steve Bannon left the West Wing, Seb Gorka soon followed, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price resigned. (Note to self: don’t let the government pay for those private jet trips again.) President Trump appeared to defend a group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people” and then disavowed them and then didn’t again; got in Twitter spats with a congresswoman over a conversation with a gold star widow; threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea (I have to say, there’s something uniquely disturbing watching the president bait nuclear war whilst feeding a newborn); and ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, struck a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to save it, then killed the deal he had reportedly struck. Outside the White House, healthcare repeal/reform efforts died at least twice, a tax reform bill passed the House, more than a dozen members of Congress announced they were retiring or otherwise moving on with their lives, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Ed Gillespie to become the next governor of Virginia, Sen. Rand Paul’s neighbor attacked him over yard waste, maybe, Sen. Luther Strange lost his primary to former Judge Roy Moore. Speaking of Roy. He was accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old district attorney. Then Al Franken admitted and apologized for groping a radio host during a USO tour, and Rep. John Conyers was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment, paid settlement claims but has denied wrongdoing. It’s all part of the chain reaction in the halls of power—from Washington to New York to L.A.—set off by the women who stepped forward to accuse Harvey Weinstein of everything from sexual harassment to rape. Hillary Clinton released a book blaming the election outcome on the Russians, Donna Brazile released a book blaming the election results on Hillary Clinton (full disclosure: I have not read either yet, because of the aforementioned infant). Natural disasters wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and Houston, Texas. The response in Texas was swift, the response in Puerto Rico remains less so. Man-made disasters also took a toll. In my 90 days of maternity leave, there were more than 90 mass shootings—defined as the wounding or killing of four or more people in one incident—not including the shooter, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. That included the largest such shooting in American history in Las Vegas and one inside a Texas church. They were each followed by wrenching stories about the victims. Politicians offered thoughts, prayers, and very little action. Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election rolled on. Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, was charged with money laundering and tax fraud, the world learned the name George Papadopoulos—a former member of Trump’s campaign foreign policy team—who plead guilty to lying to the FBI. (Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI on my first day back.) Also on the Russian front, (thanks to reporting from The Daily Beast) we learned just how far Russian trolls went on social media to fuel American political divisions. So that guy Charlie from St. Pete, Florida, in your feed that was posting all these crazy anti-BLM memes? He was actually Sergey from St. Petersburg, Russia. In response (not really) Twitter doubled the number of characters you can use. Something no one asked for ever. Speaking of Twitter, the president tweeted about hate groups, his rally in Phoenix, ending the filibuster, the debt ceiling, James Clapper, Fake News, McConnell not doing his job, veterans, Chief of Staff John Kelly, Sen. Bob Corker, Corkers resignation, David Clarke’s new book, the Wall, NAFTA, Mexico, a Mother Teresa quote (on Aug. 27… I know, that one threw me too), a tax reform speech in Missouri, James Comey, Hillary Clinton (of course), Hillary Clinton’s new book, North Korea, DACA, Congress’ role in implementing DACA, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the response to both hurricanes, the criticism of the response to Hurricane Irma, ESPN, chain migration, the kid who mowed the White House lawn, supporting Sen. Luther Strange, blaming Strange for losing, his speech at the United Nations, the earthquake in Mexico, the Emmys, the greatness of Fox & Friends, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy’s healthcare bill, Rand Paul, standing for the national anthem, the NFL, Roger Goodell, John McCain, Nikki Haley, Jerry Jones, Roy Moore, his speech in Indiana about tax reform, welcoming Steve Scalise back to the House, adoration for Sean Hannity, Yom Kippur, FEMA, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello, Rex Tillerson, “Rocket Man,” the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the stock market, Ralph Northam, Ed Gillespie, endorsing Gillespie, blaming Gillespie for losing, CNN, NBC News, Jemele Hill, his tax reform speech in Pennsylvania, National Farmer’s Day, Pakistan, Lou Dobbs, Chuck and Nancy, the Democrats, Tom Marino withdrawing from being the drug czar, CBS, ABC, Frederica Wilson, Niger, his call with the widow of a fallen soldier, wildfires in California, coal miners singing the national anthem, polls showing no one trusts the media, Lavar Ball... and so much more. In many ways I feel like I’ll never catch up and yet, at the same time, the political world is exactly how I left it. The tax reform bill is still moving through the legislative process, Obamacare—while weakened—is still the law of the land, and a government shutdown still looms. Democrats are still scrambling to get their party together after their staggering 2016 election loss, Republicans are still scrambling to get their party together after the staggering 2016 election win. President Trump remains himself. Case in point: as I started ramping back up for work this week, he made a joke about Pocahontas while honoring World War II Navajo code talkers... in front of a portrait of noted killer of Native Americans President Andrew Jackson. Also this week: Trump reportedly questioned whether the infamous Access Hollywood tape was real (it is, he apologized for it) and whether President Obama was born in the U.S. (he was, Trump admitted this last year).

          / CBS News Michael Caster was one of the hundreds of people hurt when a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas earlier this year. CBS News' Adriana Diaz met Caster just two days after the massacre and has been following his progress ever since. Caster was shot in the back. His girlfriend Tawny Temple risked her life to get him to the hospital.    ""Well, I did take a bullet for her. So she was just paying me back,"" he joked while back at home in California for a brief visit before heading back to Denver for therapy. Doctors said it was too dangerous to remove the shrapnel lodged in Caster's spine, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. But Caster is a fighter. And for the last eight weeks, recovery has been his full-time job at Craig Hospital, a rehab center in Denver. At 41, he has to re-learn what used to be second nature.   ""You never think of all the things that you took for granted, you know? That were so easy, going to the bathroom, or just sitting in a chair,"" Caster said. ""I go through some times where I get angry but it's not going to change anything. I just got to kind of take it how it is."" He says he hasn't really thought about that night or watched much news since then. He's focused on moving forward. ""We've kind of just been focused on rehab and getting home,"" he said. Temple put her life and job on hold to be with him. ""He'd do it for me, in a heartbeat,"" she said. Now, they're learning how to navigate life in a new way: everything from boarding a plane to getting in a car with special hand controls.    Caster's family has a GoFundMe page to help pay for his recovery, a new wheelchair-accessible home and car. What he's most looking forward to about going home? ""Just being back. Seeing her dogs, her roommates, my family, my dog,"" Caster said.    He's only home for a few days before he returns to Denver for outpatient therapy. And again, Temple will be by his side.   ""She saved me. She's my hero,"" Caster said. ""I don't look at it as that. I look at it as like we saved each other,"" she responded. The official Las Vegas Victims' Fund, created to help victims of the mass shooting, has raised more than $14 million. The cutoff date for donations is January 31.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas – The Latest on the Texas church shooting (all times local): 3:20 p.m. Longtime congregants at the small-town Texas church where a gunman's rampage left more than two dozen dead say they were afraid of the attacker. Husband and wife Rod and Judy Green tell The Associated Press Friday that they are good friends with Devin Kelley's in-laws, and that Kelley had often exhibited troubling behavior. Authorities have said Kelley's mother-in-law attended First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and she'd gotten threatening texts from him. Rod Green says that at a Christmas dinner one year, Kelley had ""bragged about being armed."" The Greens also said they watched Kelley closely when he showed up wearing all black last month at a festival at the church. Judy Green says Kelley was ""completely distant and way out in thought."" Kelley died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Sunday's massacre. ___ 12:40 p.m. The sanctuary of the small-town Texas church where a gunman carried out a massacre will be turned into a temporary memorial for the more than two dozen victims. The grounds steward of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs tells The Associated Press Friday that services will never take place there again and the building will eventually be demolished. The gunman shot and killed 25 people at the church on Sunday. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because one victim was pregnant. Grounds steward Rod Green says the building will be scrubbed down and the church will place 26 chairs inside to commemorate the victims. Green says the church plans to build a new structure on church property elsewhere. Green says regular services will be held Sunday at a community hall run by a local association. ___ 12:15 p.m. More than 500 people have attended a private funeral on a San Antonio-area Air Force base for a husband and wife who were among the more than two dozen killed when a gunman opened fire at a small-town Texas church. The San Antonio Express-News reports that the service for Scott and Karen Marshall was held Thursday afternoon at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Randy Martin, spokesman for the 12th Flying Training Wing, says a traditional military funeral was held for the couple, who were killed Sunday at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. The service was closed to media and the public at their family's request. Martin told the newspaper that Karen Marshall was promoted posthumously to senior master sergeant. She had been planning to retire from the military soon. Martin said Scott Marshall, already a military retiree, was a civilian employee at the base. ___ 12:05 p.m. Medical officials say 11 people remain hospitalized with wounds from Texas church shooting that left more than two dozen dead remain hospitalized. Conditions of the patients at two San Antonio hospitals range from good to critical. They were among those wounded when a gunman opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs last Sunday. The gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by bystanders and crashing his car. Brooke Army Medical Center on Friday reported having seven patients from the church. The hospital says patients include five adults and two children. University Health System had four patients, two of whom are children. Officials at both hospitals declined to release more specific information on the wounded patients. ___ 10:05 a.m. A weekly food pantry has resumed operations at a site next to the Texas church that less than a week ago endured the state's worst mass shooting. The pantry's director, Lula White, was among the more than two dozen killed Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherlands Springs. White was also the 71-year-old grandmother of the gunman's wife. On Friday, people crowded the small space, tearfully hugging and filling bags with donated bakery goods, groceries and used clothing. As 68-year-old Brandy Johnson walked in, she exclaimed she could ""see Lu at the desk."" Husband and wife, Rod and Judy Green, have operated the pantry for 11 years. They were married at First Baptist but didn't attend the service that Devin Kelley brought to an untimely end with semi-automatic gunfire. ___ 12:04 a.m. Some gave blood. Others stocked the food pantry. Residents and neighbors of Sutherland Springs volunteered Thursday as a way help the tiny Texas community recover from the shooting at a Baptist church that left more than two dozen dead. Twenty-year-old Karyssa Calbert of neighboring Floresville, who is six months pregnant, could not give blood but came to give moral support. She says people are doing what they can, ""but honestly everyone feels so helpless."" The pastor of the First Baptist Church says that the church will be demolished. Members and visitors say the congregation should continue but not in the same building. One assistant to the congregation says she and others are trying to figure out a temporary solution to keep it going, perhaps in another building.

364,http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/15/lawsuit-claims-ar-15-advertisements-caused-sandy-hook-shooting/,"BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Victims of the Sandy Hook massacre argued a lawsuit Tuesday blaming gun manufacturers and AR-15 advertisements for causing the 2012 shooting. The Connecticut Superior Court dismissed the same lawsuit last year, but a group has now appealed the case to state Supreme Court, NBC News reported. The case centers on the allegation that shooter Adam Lanza wrongfully possessed an AR-15 when he used his mother’s weapon to kill 20 schoolchildren and six adults in December 2012. Attorneys also claimed that Remington’s AR-15 marketing instigated Lanza’s choice to use the weapon. “Remington may have never known Adam Lanza but they had been courting him for years,” Attorney Josh Koskoff said. “It wasn’t just that Remington marketed the weapon looking for people with characteristics of Adam Lanza but that Adam Lanza heard the message. He idolized the military and wanted to be an Army Ranger and Remington marketed the AR-15 as the weapon used by the Army Rangers.” A Superior Court judge dismissed the case last year, ruling that the allegations fall well within gun manufacturers’ and dealers’ broad immunity laid out in the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). The lawsuit also accuses the local gun store of negligent entrustment for originally selling the AR-15 to Nancy Lanza. Remington attorney James Vogts is asking the court to dismiss the case yet again, and derided the plaintiffs’ accusation that Remington’s advertisements were responsible for the shooting. “There is no need for a legal re-examination of the law. Under the law, the manufacturer of the gun used by the criminal that day isn’t responsible legally for his actions,” Vogts claimed. “The plaintiffs haven’t explained how advertisements fit into the issue of negligent entrustment. There is no case law on advertising being declared a cause of death.” Follow Anders on Twitter Send Tips: anders@dailycallernewsfoundation.org Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

365,https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/10/gabby-giffords-gun-control-group-sues-find-ties-trump-administration-nra/,"Gabby Giffords’ gun control group is suing the Trump Administration, seeking documents it alleges could show the NRA has influence over President Trump’s gun policy decisions. The suit was filed Tuesday by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. According to HuffPo, Giffords Law Center claims it has repeatedly asked Trump’s ATF for information via Freedom of Information Act requests, but has received none. Giffords’ group is casting a large net, seeking “records relating to Trump administration policies on concealed carry reciprocity, gun silencers, bump stocks and assault weapon exports; evidence that Donald Trump Jr. improperly lobbied on behalf of gun manufacturing companies; communications between gun lobbying groups and senior administration officials following last month’s mass shooting in Las Vegas; and attempts by the NRA to review bump stock regulations in coordination with ATF.” HuffPo suggested the Trump administration’s response to the October 1 Las Vegas “[sounded] a lot like the NRA’s talking points after mass shootings.” In making this point, the HuffPo overlooked the fact that President Trump and his Counselor, Kellyanne Conway, in fact voiced opinions that were ran counter to NRA positions. Giffords group has yet to file a suit to see how much political influence Michael Bloomberg achieved over Democrats via the $52.7 million he spent for gun control in 2014 alone.

367,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/mm8sCnhCev4/,"The “assault weapons” ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and about two dozen other Democrats could mean prison time for anyone who loans an AR-15 rifle to a friend. She introduced her ban on November 8, just three days after the heinous attack in Texas, marking the umpteenth time she has introduced such a ban since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. As is typical for gun control introduced by Feinstein, her “assault weapons” ban does much more than ban assault weapons. It also bans “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and creates a punitive system whereby AR-15 owners could face prison time for loaning their rifle to a friend. According to the NRA-ILA, owners of “grandfathered” AR-15s would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL) and have their friend undergo a background check in order to legally loan the gun. Data of the transaction would be recorded on the backside of that transaction, thereby contributing to the compilation of a gun owner’s database. This is the second time in roughly five weeks that Feinstein has pushed an “assault weapons” ban. And she admits that she is introducing it over and over again in the event that a shift in the make-up of the Senate makes it feasible to secure a vote. Until such a shift occurs, she wants her liberal constituents to see her pushing gun control. The Hill quoted her saying, “We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.” It should be noted that the Texas church attacker did not acquire his guns by borrowing them from a friend but by passing background checks.

(AP Photo) The wife of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year in the name of ISIS, will stand trial in the Florida city, a judge ordered Wednesday. Noor Salman’s attorneys had filed a motion in September to have her trial moved to another city, claiming that media coverage of her husband’s attack and remarks from Orlando Police Chief John Mina wouldn’t allow her to have a fair trial, according to WESH. Noor Sulman faces charges of aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice Salman has been charged with providing material support to a terror organization and obstruction of justice, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Salman’s husband, Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded almost 70 others when he opened fire at Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016 in one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. The gay bar on the night of the shooting was packed with more than 300 people. Mateen called 911 when he was pulling off the attack to pledge his allegiance to ISIS, and was shouting “Allahu akbar” while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News around the time of the attack. Salman knew about her husband's plan before the shooting and how he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group, prosecutors said. She shopped with her husband the night before the attack when he bought five containers of ammunition, a source close to the investigation told Fox News. Prosecutors have said Salman knew about her husband's plan to attack Pulse nightclub before the mass shooting occurred.
      (AP Photo) The motion filed for Salman, according to the Sentinel, cited remarks made by the police chief, one of which said: “I am glad to see that Omar Mateen’s wife has been charged with aiding her husband in the commission of the brutal attack on the Pulse nightclub.” PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING: 49 VICTIMS REMEBERED ONE YEAR LATER The statement stems from comments Mina made when Salman was arrested in January. He said her arrest provides “some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.” The judge’s order quoted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling which said, “prominence of media coverage does not necessarily produce prejudicing and juror impartiality does not require ignorance,” WESH reported. Salman’s trial is scheduled for March 1.

According to a Tuesday report by Boston's WFXT-TV, 14 U.S. sites of mass shootings are listed on the nativity, which went up over the weekend. Some sites featured on the list included the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the concert massacre in Las Vegas, and the Columbine High School shooting. WFXT reported that a banner placed above the nativity scene reads: ""If only you knew the things that make for peace."" St. Susanna's Father Stephen Josoma told KTRK-TV that he hopes the reminder of those killed in mass shooting paired with a display of Jesus will persuade people to call for gun control. Josoma explained to WFTX that he hopes the list will spark conversation to effect change: ""There’s cities, nursing homes, coffee shops, military installations, churches, theaters.

370,https://in.reuters.com/article/australia-security-raid/australia-police-arrest-man-accused-of-plotting-nye-attack-in-melbourne-idINKBN1DR2MH,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Tom Westbrook 2 Min Read SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of planning to use an automatic rifle for a mass shooting on New Year’s Eve in downtown Melbourne, Australia’s second largest city. Victoria state police said on Tuesday that the man was acting alone and had not been able to acquire a firearm before his arrest late on Monday. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the man, an Australian citizen with Somalian parents, had been monitored by authorities since the beginning of the year. “He’s accessed documents produced by al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula which is a guide book in respect to how to commit a terrorist act and also how to use firearms, guns and handguns and rifles,” Patton said at a press conference in Melbourne. “We are alleging that ... he is a sympathiser of ISIS.” The man had planned to shoot as many people as possible at Melbourne’s Federation Square, which swells with crowds on New Year’s Eve as the focus of the city’s celebrations, Patton said. He was charged with preparing to commit a terrorist attack and gathering documents likely to facilitate a terrorist act, according to the Australian Federal Police Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert since 2014 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East or their supporters. A gunman in a deadly 2014 Sydney cafe siege boasted about links with Islamic State militants, although no direct ties with the group were established. The shooting murder of a police accountant by a 15-year old boy in 2016 was claimed by Islamic State. Around a dozen significant plots have been foiled since the alert was issued, according to officials, including a plot to attack prominent sites in Melbourne last Christmas Eve and a plan to blow up an Etihad Airways flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer.

371,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Llz_nIRCFLg/,"Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Doug Jones is quiet about his positions on gun laws, but it is clear that he supports expanding background checks to gun shows. Forcing gun show attendees to undergo a mandatory federal background check would not have prevented even one mass shooting in recent memory, but it would make grandpa’s trip to the gun show a more cumbersome task. In turn, grandpa may even forgo buying a collectible firearm as a way to avoid putting his name in a database via Jones’ gun show background check. Finding Jones’ position on gun issues is not easy. As VoteSmart reports, “Doug Jones has refused to provide voters with positions on key issues covered by the 2017 Political Courage Test, despite repeated requests.” A copy of the 2016 VoteSmart Political Courage Test shows one simple question on guns: “Do you generally support gun-control legislation?” The candidate can answer by either checking “yes” or “no.” There are additional lines below the question where the candidate can explain which gun controls he supports. But Jones has said enough in small soundbites to make clear that he supports expanding background checks to cover gun shows. The Washington Post quoted him saying such an expansion “would be helpful.” His support for gun show regulation is the logical outgrowth of his overarching belief that the Second Amendment has “limitations.” In fact, Jones believes every natural right protected by the Bill of Rights is limited. The Alabama Political Reporter quoted Jones saying, “We’ve got limitations on all constitutional amendments in one form or another.” The problem with Jones’ view is that our Founding Fathers gave us the Bill of Rights to place limits on government, not limits on the people’s liberty.

373,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/11/texas-church-shooting-encryption-rod-rosenstein-244794,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has spent months hinting that the Trump administration will take a harder line against the tech industry’s trend toward unbreakable encryption. | Carlos Osorio/AP Photo By ERIC GELLER 11/11/2017 10:36 AM EST The investigation into last weekend’s mass shooting in a Texas church may launch a new round in the decades-old fight between the FBI and Silicon Valley over law enforcement’s access to encrypted data. And this time, the government player leading the charge will be Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has spent months hinting that the Trump administration will take a harder line against the tech industry’s trend toward unbreakable encryption. It’s a cause Rosenstein has quietly pursued for years, including two cases in 2014 and 2015 when, as the U.S. attorney in Maryland, he sought to take companies to court to make them unscramble their data, a DOJ official told POLITICO. But higher-ups in President Barack Obama’s Justice Department decided against it, said the official, who isn’t authorized to speak to the news media about the cases. Now Rosenstein may get another chance as the FBI tries to gain access to the iPhone used by Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. So far, encryption on the devices has thwarted their efforts, a U.S. official disclosed this week. Encryption that blocks law enforcement “costs a great deal of time and money. In some cases, it surely costs lives,” Rosenstein told a breakfast audience Thursday in Maryland, citing the stymied investigation. “That is a very high price to pay.” Rosenstein is perhaps best known for hiring special prosecutor Robert Mueller to investigate possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Rosenstein also played an instrumental role in Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey — who had previously been the Justice Department’s most outspoken encryption critic. Comey repeatedly warned that the increasingly ubiquitous technology allows terrorists, drug dealers and other wrongdoers to “go dark.” Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

This sign-up form is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Digital security specialists and civil libertarians strongly disagree with Rosenstein and Comey, insisting that guaranteeing law enforcement’s access to people’s secure chats and emails would inherently weaken the protections that keep the world safe from hackers and oppressive regimes. But Rosenstein believes the government's inability to pry open that digital chatter is hamstringing lawful investigations into terrorism, child pornography and all manner of crime. “I want our prosecutors to know that, if there’s a case where they believe they have an appropriate need for information, and there is a legal avenue to get it, they should not be reluctant to pursue it,” Rosenstein told POLITICO in an interview last week in his Justice Department office, days before the Texas massacre. Rosenstein’s remarks followed months of speeches on a topic that has entangled the tech and law enforcement communities for decades — including an inconclusive court battle between the FBI and Apple in 2016. If a similar fight erupts this time, many on both sides of the debate expect Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be much more aggressive in going after the industry. So far, there’s no indication that prosecutors will pursue that path in the Texas case— for one thing, the FBI may be able to recover Kelley’s data from a computer or his iCloud backup. But before the shooting, the other Justice Department official told POLITICO that “interest” exists inside DOJ “in exploring the use” of existing laws to force a court battle to set a precedent on the issue. (The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.) The Obama administration spent years trying to persuade tech firms to voluntarily redesign their encryption to enable access by law enforcement. But after former government contractor Edward Snowden exposed the massive underbelly of the government’s surveillance apparatus in 2013, the companies rushed to introduce new privacy and security features — both to avoid looking like government stooges and to meet the needs of newly anxious customers. For some tech products, such as Apple’s iPhone and Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging app, the trend has included encryption that even the companies themselves cannot break. Tensions between the government and Silicon Valley came to a head in February 2016, when the Justice Department sued Apple over its refusal to help the FBI access the locked iPhone of one of the shooters who killed 14 people in an ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino, Calif. The government eventually dropped the case after saying it had found another way to gain access to the phone, and the debate has essentially been at a standstill since then. But in an October speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, Rosenstein indicated that the Trump administration was tired of waiting for the tech industry’s cooperation. “The approach taken in the recent past — negotiating with technology companies and hoping that they eventually will assist law enforcement out of a sense of civic duty — is unlikely to work,” he said. Participants on both sides of the encryption debate took notice. “It’s basically the gloves coming off,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society. “His comments telegraph the concern that is clear across government — that we are not getting the traction,” said Ron Hosko, a former head of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division who now leads the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. By ANDREW RESTUCCIA, ANNIE KARNI and JOSH DAWSEY Rosenstein and his allies have one thing in their favor: Silicon Valley has lost sway with the public since the Apple-FBI dispute, with Americans becoming increasingly suspicious of the behemoth industry’s priorities and motivations. The companies are struggling to respond to extremists who use their technologies for propaganda and recruitment, as well as the Russian government’s use of social media to spread divisive content before the 2016 election. “If there was going to be a legislative fix or oversight, this is the time that it would happen,” said Robert Anderson, who headed the FBI’s criminal and cyber branch from 2014 to 2016. Indeed, Pfefferkorn said she was “somewhat worried about the [government’s] ability to capitalize on that public sentiment.” Few expected that Rosenstein would become the driving force behind the government’s attempts to get visibility into encrypted chatter. In fact, tech specialists wondered whether the government might become rudderless on the subject after the sudden ouster of Comey, who built a reputation as the government’s top encryption warrior and led the fight with Apple. But Rosenstein has taken the encryption mantle from Comey — months after writing the scathing rebuke of the former FBI director’s conduct that the White House offered as the official explanation for firing him. The deputy attorney general has been interested in encryption for years, in part because of several vexing experiences during his 12 years as U.S. attorney in Maryland. The first case, in 2014, involved a wiretap of “a violent organization” that Rosenstein declined to identify. “Our attorneys realized that they were not capturing all the text communications” because some members of the group used Apple’s encrypted iMessage platform, he said. The second case, in 2015, involved data stored on a phone. Rosenstein said the phone maker, which he would not name, “was uncooperative with us.” “My experience in those cases made it clear to me just how serious this issue was for traditional law enforcement,” he told POLITICO. “Increasingly it’s impacting our attorneys in their routine criminal cases.” Rosenstein supported taking the tech companies to court in both instances, but higher-ups in Washington ruled against it. “There was hope that we could resolve encryption-related issues amicably with the providers,” said the other DOJ official. But that hope is eroding, and behind the scenes, officials are considering other possible solutions. In recent months, the National Security Council's cyber team has “convened to form options” for Trump and his team, according to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Rosenstein would not comment on discussions among agencies, but he said that “senior officials in the department and the administration recognize that this is a problem.” And the DOJ’s No. 2 has received backing from Christopher Wray, Trump’s new FBI director, who said last month that encryption prevented federal agents from gaining access to more than 6,900 devices in the first 11 months of the 2017 fiscal year. Sessions has also occasionally referenced encryption. But mostly, it has been Rosenstein making the public case. By CRISTIANO LIMA The deputy AG said his frequent engagement on the encryption issue was “a conscious decision on my part … because I think it’s one of the most important law enforcement challenges we face.” His arguments have enraged civil liberties advocates, with many tech experts taking issue with Rosenstein’s characterizations of their community, as well as his technical assertions. Pfefferkorn accused Rosenstein of essentially calling tech companies “un-American,” a charge he denies. “It’s not un-American to try to make a profit,” Rosenstein told POLITICO. But “when you see somebody advertising a device … and part of their marketing is, ‘The government can’t get into this,’ you have to think about what it is they’re trying to achieve there.” On the technical front, Rosenstein has suggested that companies could design strong, warrant-friendly encryption because some already scan emails to generate ads. But Dan Boneh, a Stanford University computer science professor, told POLITICO that Rosenstein’s remarks mischaracterized how email scanning worked, saying it is “not done on encrypted data.” Rosenstein believes his point stands: “The question is, can you build in enough security so that the ability to comply with the court order doesn’t defeat the encryption? … And I think that there are experts who acknowledge that it can be done.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

By JACQUELINE KLIMAS 12/05/2017 04:13 PM EST Updated 12/05/2017 05:12 PM EST The military justice system's failure to share critical information with civilian law enforcement agencies is far more rampant than initially believed, the Pentagon's independent watchdog has found — in some cases nearly a third of the time. After former airman Devin Patrick Kelley shot and killed 26 people in a rural Texas church last month, the Air Force admitted it had not followed the procedure to alert civilian authorities to Kelley’s domestic violence conviction while in uniform — something that would have prevented him from being able to buy a gun. It subsequently found dozens of other such cases. But the problem is far more widespread, the Pentagon's inspector general reported Tuesday. It found a series of ""troubling"" things when it reviewed 2,502 cases across all four military branches between Jan. 1, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2016. Of those, fingerprint cards were not submitted to the FBI in 24 percent of the cases and a final disposition report was not submitted in 31 percent. The military is required to submit data to the FBI when service members are convicted of a number of crimes, including drunk driving, stalking and kidnapping. That information is then included in a federal database that is checked when someone tries to purchase a gun. The Air Force actually performed better than the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, the new IG report found. For example, it failed to submit fingerprint cards and final disposition reports in only 14 percent of convictions, the report found.

The Navy and Marine Corps didn’t submit fingerprint cards in 29 percent of cases and the Army did not submit a final disposition report in 41 percent of its criminal convictions. “The failure to populate FBI databases with all the required fingerprint records can result in someone purchasing a weapon who should not,"" the report says. ""It can also hinder criminal investigations and potentially impact law enforcement and national security interests. It is therefore troubling that many fingerprint cards remained missing.” The IG made several recommendations, including that the military services each review their criminal investigative databases dating back to 1998 to ensure all paperwork is submitted to civilian agencies and they implement greater oversight of the reporting process.

375,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/lKGjZuEpts4/,"When President Trump returned from a week and a half in Asia, his longest foreign policy trip to date, he arrived back to a series of domestic issues that festered while he was gone. As Trump spent time overseas outlining his “Indo-Pacific Dream” vision, bonding with world leaders, and needling North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, American political life at home was hit with new sexual misconduct allegations, Congressional gridlock and another mass shooting. Here are the three major issues awaiting Trump’s return to the Oval Office. On November 9, the Washington Post published accusations by four women that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had initiated sexual contact with them while he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. The news rocked the political world: Moore called the attacks “fake news” and many Alabama Republicans stood by him, but other national GOP leaders called on him to drop out of the race. The White House released an official statement saying Moore will “do the right thing and step aside” if the allegations are true. But Trump, who infamously dealt with his own sexual misconduct allegations during his run for president, was uncharacteristically quiet on the matter. “Honestly, I’d have to look at it and I have to see,” he told reporters on a flight to Vietnam. “I’ll have further comment as we go down the road. I have to get back into the country to see what’s happening.” If Trump does provide “further comment” when he returns, it could shake up a scandal that shows no signs of receding from view. On Monday, calls were growing from Republican senators for their prospective colleague to leave the race (dropping the “if true” language from many of the original statements). The same day, a fifth accuser came forward and said Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a minor. It’s a political pickle for Trump. Defending Moore could put him on the wrong side of the swelling ranks of GOP leaders denouncing him; condemning him might anger a base Trump is loathe to turn his back on. And Trump won’t want to risk losing a Republican seat in the Senate, which could jeopardize his policy objectives already struggling to pass under a slim majority. In October, GOP leaders said they were aiming to have the package passed by Thanksgiving. Before Trump left on his trip, he promised that signing tax reform into law by the end of the year would be his “Christmas gift” to the nation. But with the end of the year rapidly approaching, it’s looking less and less likely that Congress will be able to pass the major legislation in time. A House committee passed its version of tax reform but could still have its efforts gummed up by Democratic maneuvers that could force Republicans to accept or reject politically charged changes; the Senate will begin marking up its bill in committee this week, a process that could end up being messy and drawn out. Heading into his last day on the trip, Trump signaled he was already looking ahead to tackling taxes when he gets back: “I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.},” he tweeted Monday. “We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” But the president’s tweet belies the political reality that it’s extremely unlikely Congress will be able to couple repealing the Obamacare individual mandate with tax cuts. Any significant changes to Obamacare have proved impossible, even with a Republican-controlled Congress. Taxes are far thornier, and combining the two would be like tossing a flaming oil tanker aboard a melting-down nuclear plant. Any votes Republicans may get from conservatives tempted by scrapping Obamacare could be offset by a centrist flight from those who want health care considered in a measured way. With congressional Republicans so far unable to mark any major achievements besides confirming Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump will likely be ramping up the pressure on Senate leadership even more when he’s back in the States. Just one day after Trump arrived in Asia, a gunman killed 26 people at a church in Texas. The president told reporters in Tokyo on Nov. 6, the day after the shooting, that the massacre was the result of a “mental health problem” rather than an issue with gun laws. The following day, he argued that more restrictive gun laws would have led to even more casualties. Trump’s response, compared with his statements after the recent terrorist truck attack in NYC, demonstrates a willingness to politicize acts of terrorism but not domestic mass shootings. And it’s a near certainty that Congress won’t bring up any comprehensive gun control legislation, even after Texas and the Las Vegas shooting, the worst in U.S. history, not to mention another recent shooting in California which left four dead. Still, with 2017 becoming the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern American history, the question of how to make the country safer— and the role gun laws play in that debate— isn’t going away any time soon.

“California shooting suspect was out on bail for stabbing neighbor,” said the headline in the New York Post a day after Kevin Janson Neal went on a murderous rampage in Northern California, killing five, wounding ten, then being shot dead by police. “Alleged gunman in Northern California rampage had history of violence,” said USA Today. “Shooter identified as 44-year-old man who had problems with neighbors,” was the Redding Record Searchlight’s headline. Let’s review: crazy guy, history of wreaking violence on others, and multiple weapons at his disposal in a state with the toughest gun laws in the nation. It doesn’t quite add up. Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. Sign Up In the aftermath of America’s latest mass shooting, all sides in the country’s red-hot firearms debate will move into the next stage: name-calling, blame-gaming and staking our positions. And while gun enthusiasts will take cover behind the Second Amendment, arguing that the Tehama County tragedy just shows that no laws can stop a maniac, gun-control proponents will argue that the shooting shows what a lousy job we do of enforcing our existing, if fragile, gun laws. Some questions: Was Neal truly a threat, ready to explode? The AP reported that the gunman was out on bail for a charge of stabbing a neighbor, had been the object of complaints from neighbors who said he had been firing off hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and had been the subject of a domestic violence call the day before the attack. Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said the shooter was facing charges of assaulting one of the feuding neighbors in January and that she had a restraining order against him. And the Sacramento Bee reported that Neal had been accused twice this year of assaulting his neighbors. With his violent history, why hadn’t anyone done anything to get this guy off the streets? Johnston did not comment immediately on the shooter’s access to firearms, but he did tell the Sacramento Bee that one of the fatalities was a woman who lived near Neal and had been the victim of the assault in late January that ended with the suspect in jail. Johnston added that he “believed the suspect was slapped with a restraining order following the January arrest that would have prevented him from owning firearms for at least a period of time,” the Bee reported, “although he had no details on that.” Neal’s neighbors, though, certainly are expecting some answers and soon. Cristal Caravez and her father live across a ravine from the roadway where the gunman and his first victims lived. She said they and others heard constant gunfire from the area of the gunman’s house, but couldn’t say for sure it was him firing. “You could hear the yelling. He’d go off the hinges,” she told the AP. The shooting, “it would be during the day, during the night, I mean, it didn’t matter.” Caravez and her father, who is president of the homeowners association, said neighbors would complain to the sheriff’s department, which referred the complaints back to the homeowners association. “The sheriff,” said Juan Caravez, “wouldn’t do anything about it.” Did his family try to do anything? The gunman’s sister, Sheridan Orr, said her brother had struggled with mental illness throughout his life and at times had a violent temper. She also said Neal had “no business” owning firearms. Orr said their mom, Anne, did try and help — by listening to her troubled son every time he’d call her back in North Carolina where he’d come from. “The phone calls were exhausting,” the News reported, “and often detailed his precarious welfare and the growing suspicion that his neighbors were running a methamphetamine lab.” Orr, Neal’s older sister, said her brother “would get wound up and I think (our mother) spent a lot of time calming him down. He would be irrational, irate and uncontrollable, and scream and yell. It was difficult to manage him. I don’t know how she put up with it.” The phone calls took a toll on their mother, “who always listened, often helplessly,” said the report. She was hopeful her son could find the help he desperately needed. “As he got older,” Orr said, “it got harder to know what was real and what was in his mind.” Did the authorities do anything after his arrest in January? Yes. Neal, 43, was arrested Jan. 31 and booked into Tehama County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, according to police logs published in the Red Bluff Daily News, which is owned by the parent company of this newspaper. Documents reveal that Neal was due to stand trial Jan. 11, 2018, on charges of second-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment by violence, discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, possession of an assault weapon and misdemeanor battery, according to the News. Tehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen told the News that Neal had a long-running dispute with his neighbors and during the January incident allegedly shot through a wooden fence at two female neighbors as they walked along the fence. Neal then jumped the fence, confronted the women, stabbed one and took a cellphone from the other, Cohen told the newspaper. At the time of the shootings, Neal was out of jail on $300,000 bail and had been since shortly after the January incident. His trial was scheduled for January following a preliminary hearing set for Dec. 15. Neal sometimes used the last name Smith, Cohen told the News. The January incident was the first contact his office had had with Neal. The assault weapon he apparently used was involved in a complaint against him earlier this year. So why wasn’t it taken away from him at the time? According to a report in the Redding Record Searchlight, prosecutors alleged Neal attacked one woman and robbed another in the Jan. 31 incident, according to court documents. “A Tehama County judged signed a protective order against Neal for both women and a felony criminal trial against Neal was set to begin next year,” said the report, adding that Neal had held both women against their will using violence. Court records show he also fired a gun during the attack  — possibly an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle. “The rifle was specifically called out as an illegal assault rifle in the criminal complaint against Neal, though it’s unknown whether the same weapon was used during Tuesday’s deadly shooting.” Neal is reported to have used some sort of assault-style weapon in the shooting; many types of assault weapons are illegal in California. Large ammunition magazines (holding 10 or more bullets) are also illegal in the state; one neighbor said Neal clearly had such magazines, judging from the number of bullets he was firing around his place in the weeks before his allegedly murderous rampage. So what about that California law banning certain weapons from certain people who’ve had run-ins with authorities? It’s called APPS for short, or the Armed and Prohibited Persons System, and it’s designed to allow California law-enforcement officials to automatically track firearm owners and proactively disarm convicted criminals, people with certain mental illnesses, and others deemed dangerous. But as my colleague Robert Salonga and I wrote recently in this newspaper, APPS is far from a perfect remedy to get crazy people to give up their guns. “The biggest challenge you have is a huge number of people who are not supposed to be in APPS,” said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Calguns Foundation. DeLuz and fellow advocates told us that a big problem with the system is that there’s no quick way to remove someone’s name from the system once their court-ordered weapon restriction ends. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store  or the Google Play store. “There is no guarantee that when your time is up, your name is going to be removed,” DeLuz said. “A big part is simply keeping up with the system, and doing basic administration that could really make a difference.” It’s not clear at this point in the investigation whether Neal’s name was even on the state’s APPS database, or whether authorities had previously taken guns away from him. But supporters of APPS like Richard Aborn say such programs need to be replicated in other states given the increased frequency of mass shootings in the United States. Aborn is president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City and an architect of the defunct federal assault weapons ban as well as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that implemented routine federal background checks for gun purchasers. Referring to the recent church shooting in Texas, Aborn said “what we saw on Sunday is what happens when a deranged individual has possession of lawful firearms. Every time (APPS) is enforced and guns are returned, we’re preventing a tragedy. Mass shootings are a form of domestic terror. We should equip citizens to prevent mass shootings as much as we can.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-11-15 12:49:17,The Tehama County shootings: Why did this guy have guns?,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

Police say Atchison carried a backpack with a Glock pistol inside of it. He also had a thumb drive with information on it about his plans to hold a class hostage, kill students and ultimately kill himself. ""He lived in Aztec with his parents, he worked at a local gas station and he planned this thing,"" said San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen. Atchison shot and killed junior Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez and senior Casey Marquez before taking his own life on Thursday. ""This person is not only a coward,"" Christesen said. ""He's evil."" Read more: Shooter among dead in New Mexico high school shooting On a note he wrote at 6:51 a.m. Thursday, the shooter stated, ""If things go according to plan today, today will be the day that I die."" He then described his plans to ""gear up,"" hold a classroom hostage and ""go apes--t"" and then to ""blow my brains out."" ""Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,"" the shooter wrote before the event. The note was found on the thumb drive he carried. After he entered the school, Atchison went to the bathroom on the second floor, where he began getting ready for the shooting. Fernandez had asked to be excused from class to go to the bathroom. He walked in on Atchison. State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said Fernandez had no chance to survive. After he shot Fernandez, Atchison killed Marquez when he saw her in the hallway. The school officials had heard the gunshots, and the school went into lockdown. Custodian Thomas Hall pursued the shooter down the hallways, yelling for teachers to lock their doors. Substitute teacher Kathleen Potter did not have the keys to lock the computer lab door. She took the students into a supplies room and barricaded the door with a couch. Atchison entered the computer lab. Police say he knew where the students were in the supplies room, and he fired rounds toward them. None of the students were injured. Christesen said Atchison didn't have a criminal history and was not on the Sheriff's Office's radar. The only interaction Atchison had with police was during an FBI investigation last year. Someone reported a message he wrote on an online gaming site asking about cheap assault rifles for a mass shooting. The FBI did not find any evidence of a crime being committed and ended the investigation. Police say Atchison claimed he had made the post as an Internet troll. He did not have any weapons in 2016 and purchased a Glock legally last month in the San Juan County area, which he used in the shooting, according to police. When searching Atchison's house after Thursday's shooting, police found a note that outlined his schedule for the day. At 8 a.m., Atchison had planned to die.Police say neither victim was targeted.

378,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/12/house_republican_response_to_las_vegas_massacre_is.html," Gallery: NJ lawmakers oppose concealed carry WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are bringing up their first gun rights bill for a vote since the deadly Las Vegas massacre: a measure that would compel New Jersey to honor concealed weapons permits for people who got them in their home state. The debate, scheduled for this week, comes after two mass shootings in two months, the killing of more than 50 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and more than two dozen parishioners at a Texas church in November. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the top legislative priority of the National Rifle Association, the gun rights group that spent more money to elect President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans last year than any other outside organization. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who helped organize the June 2016 House Democratic sit-in to force votes on gun safety measures, called it a ""disgrace"" to make concealed carry the first gun bill after Las Vegas, the worst mass shooting in American history. The legislation ""will make it easier for people -- including those with dangerous histories -- to carry hidden, loaded guns across the country,"" said Watson Coleman, D-12th Dist. ""This bill will jump start a race to the bottom for states to weaken their own gun laws and undermine New Jersey's own attempt to manage gun safety in the manner we best see fit."" The House will not be voting on bills to ban or limit bump stocks, the device that allowed the Las Vegas shooter to convert his semi-automatic rifle into one that fired more rapidly. The legislation on the House floor would require New Jersey, whose residents must to show a ""justifiable need"" before obtaining a concealed weapons permit, and all other states to recognize concealed carry permits the same way they now accept out-of-state drivers' licenses. New Jersey is one of only 10 states that do not honor concealed carry permits issued outside its borders. In states that recognize such permits, ""there's literally no evidence that such policies have unleashed a wave of violence across state borders,"" said Alexander P. Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, a gun rights group. ""However, many violent crimes and sexual assaults are thwarted by concealed handguns."" Roubian said concealed carry was unrelated to the Las Vegas shooting. In advance of the vote, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a victim of gun violence, will run TV commercials against Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-11th Dist. and Jason Lewis, R-Minn. The group will also run online ads against those two and six other GOP lawmakers. The group plans to spend more than $100,000. ""We are putting Congress on notice that siding with the gun lobby's campaign cash over public safety will put their careers in jeopardy,"" said Peter Ambler, executive director of the group, now known as Giffords. The concealed carry bill has 214 sponsors, including Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-3rd Dist. MacArthur has said gun owners shouldn't have to fear arrest when they cross state lines and still would have to follow the rules of their home state to get a permit. The NRA last year spent $55 million to elect Donald Trump president and keep Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. ""Law-abiding citizens should be able to exercise their fundamental right to self-defense while traveling across state lines without fear of unknowingly breaking the law,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. Earlier this year, with Trump's support, congressional Republicans voted to repeal regulations designed to keep weapons out of the hands of those with mental problems. A House committee also voted to make it easier to buy gun silencers and armor-piercing bullets, though that bill has yet to reach the floor. Jonathan D.

Diwang Valdez for Rolling Stone Last night, the new Call of Duty came out, and Post Malone was so stoked about it that he parked himself in front of his Xbox until 6 a.m. Right now it’s 4 p.m. and he’s back at it. It’s a sunny Friday in the affluent L.A. suburb of Tarzana, but the shades are drawn in Malone’s den to block the light – his wall-size projecting screen is particularly susceptible, he says, to glare. Malone is only 22, but he’s one of the most popular musicians in the country. His single “Rockstar” has been America’s Number One hit for five weeks and counting. The track, which features 21 Savage, celebrates a raw brand of hedonism – “I’ve been fucking ho’s and popping pillies, man/I feel just like a rock star-ar-ar” – that smudges into fatalism. The music is sparse and chilly; the two actual rock stars Malone likens himself to in the lyrics, Bon Scott and Jim Morrison, both died young. Related

He’s fresh off a two-month tour he describes as “exhausting, but it’s always cool to meet fans.” He adds, “On Halloween, they came dressed up like me, which is easy: Just look homeless.” Behind him, in the kitchen, members of Malone’s entourage mill about.

It’s like hitting a punching bag to let off steam.” Turns out that today he just wants to stay in, “but I can show you what I got here if you want,” he says, at which point he leads me to a walk-in closet, which is where I learn that Malone owns a disconcerting amount of weaponry. “This is an M14 – the gun Navy SEALs use,” he says, placing a chunky rifle in my hands. He takes it back, hands over a Walther PPK – “James Bond’s gun” – with decorative engraving down the barrel. Next up are a .44 Desert Eagle hand cannon and an M1911 pistol, then two gold-plated Glocks – “I’d never actually shoot these.” Finally, there’s his Cobalt AR-15, an assault rifle, specially modified to pass California regulations, that he’s particularly proud of. “Looks like something out of Halo, right?” He ducks into a bathroom to ash the cigarette he’s smoking, then makes for his master bedroom, which he shares with his longtime girlfriend, Ashlen. On the floor beside their bed is a pump-action Mossberg shotgun: “Great for home defense.” He reaches behind a pillow, fishes out an FN Five-Seven pistol fitted with a laser sight and – to better disorient any home invaders, he explains – a strobe light. He goes behind another pillow, pulls out a Glock 19. “This is for Ashlen. It’s supereasy to use.”  I say “holy shit” a lot, and ask several variations on a question: Why does he have all these guns? “They’re fun, they’re practical, and bad shit happens,” he says. “If you hurt me, I’m gonna hurt you back.” Has anyone made threats against him? He shakes his head. “Just being in the public eye. I have a lot of valuable shit. I have a lot of friends I wanna protect.” Also: “The world is going to shit. They’re taking away a lot of our rights. We have a shitty thing going on in the White House – I don’t like Trump. But I don’t think it’s just him. Something’s coming.” “The world is going to shit. They’re taking away a lot of our rights.” It is mere weeks after America’s worst mass shooting in modern history – a train of thought he anticipates: “A lot of people are sensitive about it these days, but it’s an American right to own a gun. It kinda sucks that now we have to live in fear of going out to a concert, but there’ll always be bad people, and if bad people want firearms, they’ll get ’em no matter what.” I wasn’t expecting to debate gun control with Post Malone, but I tell him that, when I learned that the Las Vegas shooter used a so-called “bump stock” to effectively turn his rifle fully automatic, I couldn’t understand why anyone would need a weapon like that. Malone contemplates this. “I don’t know. … Get tighter groupings, show off your aim to your buddies at target practice?” He ruminates a bit more, then shrugs and smiles. “I don’t know, man. I don’t have all the answers – I’m just trying to get my money and get out.” Malone has cultivated a hard-partying image, but there’s been a dark streak to his music since his 2015 single “White Iverson,” which sounds mournful even though it’s ostensibly about chasing success. When I mention this downbeat vibe, he nods. “I’ve always had a loneliness. I’ve always been anxious.” He taps his skull and chuckles. “Big brain. Lot of thoughts.” Even sitting atop the pop charts, he says, “It’s easy to feel numb.” Not that he doesn’t enjoy himself now and then. When “Rockstar” first went to Number One, he says, he celebrated with a blowout meal with Ashlen at Olive Garden: “I love Olive Garden.” He has an extravagant loafer collection, including $1,700 Louboutins with embroidered crests that say “Loubi for ever” in gold. “Those are super-ignorant,” he says, beaming. Out in the driveway, there’s a shiny white Rolls-Royce Wraith. “You wanna go for a ride?” He pads outside, still barefoot, turns on the ignition. He presses a button and hundreds of tiny fiber-optic lights in the ceiling flash on, like we’re in a mobile planetarium. “I’m giving you the hot-chick treatment,” he says of the light show. He bursts down his block and hangs a hard right. “This is not a good message, but this car is a great drunk-driver,” he notes. “It’s got human detection.” He sticks his foot outside the driver’s side window, lets the breeze blow through his toes.  He was born Austin Post in Syracuse, New York. When he was nine, his dad got a job managing concessions for the Dallas Cowboys, and they moved to Texas. As a kid, Austin turned a Guitar Hero habit into an actual guitar-playing hobby. His tastes were all over the map. In high school, he made a hip-hop mixtape called Young and After Them Riches, and played “in a metal band and in an indie band.” He loves Hank Williams and A$AP Ferg, Biohazard and Father John Misty. His talent is broad: You can find videos of him covering Bob Dylan’s “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” with convincing tenderness, Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name” with convincing ferocity. Classmates of Malone’s once voted him “Most Likely to Become Famous,” but this testified less to his popularity than his eccentricity. For an art class, he made a jokey synth-pop track under the pseudonym Leon DeChino, complete with a video in which he danced in booty shorts and a leopard-print head scarf. At one point he saved up $800 from his job at a place called Chicken Express and blew it on a pair of Versace loafers: “I was weird.” At his home, the doorbell rings and Malone’s Dallas buddy Jason Probst walks in. A few years ago, Probst became an unlikely online micro-celebrity by streaming video of himself and friends playing Minecraft while cracking jokes. In 2014, Probst moved west, renting a house in Encino with some other Minecraft players, and Malone left Dallas to tag along, “chilling and freeloading,” he says, hoping that proximity to the music industry might lead to a big break. “I had to make it work,” Malone says. “It was that or Chicken Express.” Within a year, he’d talked his way into free time at a studio, where he met the producer FKi 1st, who liked Malone enough to work on some tracks with him. One was “White Iverson,” which Malone put on SoundCloud, where it took off – Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller tweeted endorsements, and Malone soon signed a major-label deal. Six more platinum-certified singles followed. Before long, Kanye West invited Malone to join him and Rick Rubin in the studio, and Justin Bieber picked him as an opening act and sang on his debut, 2016’s Stoney.   When I ask Malone about Bieber, he calls him “a fucking awesome, great dude” and “a genuine friend.” He adds, “He’s gotten super-religious recently. Real culty.” He’s referring to Hillsong, a megachurch that Bieber belongs to. “It’s not culty!” Ashlen interjects. “It’s a total cult,” Malone continues. “He’s already given them, like, $10 million. Those are the worst kinds of people. I used to be super-religious. I believed in God. But now I see through it. It’s nice to support something you believe in, I guess, but people are spending so much money, and God doesn’t care that your church has a fucking gold roof.” I ask if he’s shared these thoughts with Bieber. “We don’t talk about this stuff,” he says. (A source close to Bieber denies that he’s given $10 million.) Malone believes that “genre is stupid,” so to him there’s no contradiction in making a song with Bieber one moment, 21 Savage the next. But some border crossings are more fraught than others, and as a white man who’s become hugely successful in a black art form, he’s aware of his status as an outsider. He’s had to apologize for an old Vine in which he jokingly used the word “nigga”; more generally, he’s had to answer to skeptics. The most prominent such encounter came in 2015, when the radio host Charlamagne tha God took Malone to task, asking him, among other things, what he was doing to support Black Lives Matter. Malone’s answer, he admits, was insufficient: “I guess what I can do to help Black Lives Matter is keep making music. … I don’t know,” he replied. Looking back, Malone tells me, “I wish I’d said, ‘What are you doing for Black Lives Matter?’ Some sassy shit to shut him up. Like, maybe my music’s not the best, but I know I’m not a bad person, so you’re just being a hater.” Malone shakes his head. “He’s not a good person. He hates me because I’m white and I’m different. But we’re still rocking and we’re still successful, and he can’t stop it.” (Reached for a response, Charlamagne mentions his involvement with various social-justice organizations, and says, “I don’t not like people because they’re white – I just didn’t like him because at the time I thought he was wack,” adding that he loves “Rockstar” and encourages Malone to “keep growing, keep winning” and “give back to the black community in some form.”)  I tell Malone that, to my ear, Charlamagne was raising the issues, however confrontationally, of white allyship and cultural appropriation. Malone nods but says that, in his view, he’s been the target of so-called reverse racism. “People are gonna hate you for what they’re not gonna understand you for,” he says. He notes that he supports NFL players who kneel during the anthem. “It’s all about pushing for equality – in both directions,” he says. “Especially with the power of music, we can push past the world’s flaws and make it a more beautiful place.” A few hours later, the sun has set, and Malone has switched from Call of Duty to Ghost Recon to the wrestling game WWE2K18. Besides gaming and gun ranges, Malone binges TV shows like Power and Designated Survivor. When I ask if he pays attention to the news, he says, “I’m more into alternate news. Shit not a lot of people read, like conspiracy shit. There’s crazy shit that goes on that we can’t explain. Chemtrails and shit.” I ask if his interest in conspiracies is ironic or real. “It’s real,” he says. “Like, they have a gun that gives you a heart attack, and they can’t tell the difference.” It’s after 8 p.m. Probst and some of the other guys announce that they’re headed out to see the new Thor. Malone sticks to his couch. He’s enjoying the downtime, he says. When he hasn’t been touring, he’s been working on his second album. It’s nearly finished and is set to feature collaborations with Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla $ign, John Mayer and Tommy Lee. “I’m trying to push the genre,” he says. He has no home studio here, but there will be one, he vows, in his next house: a 13,000-square-foot home in northern Utah that he’s about to buy for “like, $3 million.” Set on nearly seven acres, it will serve as both a party palace for his homeys – “I’m gonna put in, like, 30 bunk beds” – and a secluded compound for him and Ashlen to hunker down at, playing Xbox together, riding motorbikes, firing off guns that no one else will be able to hear. “It’s free country out there,” Malone says. “Like, you can buy suppressors in Utah. You can do open-carry. Walk into the grocery store with a handgun on your hip. Cowboy shit.” He grins. “I can’t wait.”  Update: Carl Lentz of Hillsong NYC responds: I put no stock in comments made by people who know absolutely nothing about the subject they are speaking on. I do not know Post Malone and I have no idea why he would say reckless things about our church, which he has never visited. Justin has not given our church 10 million dollars and we do not have gold ceilings. We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us. With that said, I’m still a Post Malone fan; he is a very gifted artist and I wish him nothing but the best. In This Article:

Ethan Miller/Getty Images When Cam, the Grammy-nominated singer and co-writer of the 2015 breakthrough single “Burning House,” released that starkly intense tune about a failed relationship, it set off a chain reaction she was initially unprepared to deal with. She was soon hearing what she recalls were some “really heavy” personal stories from fans about how they could relate to its metaphorical message, which equated a home engulfed in flames with a couple who have been burned and scarred by their experiences with one another. “At first I got a little freaked out because I didn’t quite know… I’m like, ‘I’m just a kid, I don’t have the answer!” she tells Rolling Stone Country. “And then you realize people are just sharing because you shared, and you opened up this floodgate, you know, and they just want a hug. It’s an amazing thing.” Related

						The Best Audiophile Turntables for Your Home Audio System The personal feedback from that tune, she notes, helped prepare her for yet another flood of response as she released “Diane,” the exhilarating first taste of her upcoming second LP. The confessional tale from the perspective of a remorseful woman as she reveals to her ex’s wife that she was unaware he was married while they were involved, “Diane” bounces along to a carefree beat – think vintage ABBA/Fleetwood Mac – but at its darker heart is an earnest plea for understanding, forgiveness and female solidarity. Flipping the script on Dolly Parton’s auburn-haired temptress, “Jolene,” “Diane” – which, like “Burning House,” was penned by the singer with Jeff Bhasker and Tyler Johnson – is the victim of indiscretion, and the earnestness in Cam’s remarkable vocal comes not from a place of self-pity or fear, but from the knowledge that the truth will, with any luck, set you free.  “This song came from me thinking about one of my good friends whose parents went through a rough divorce,” says the California-born performer. “One of my other good friends right now is going through a rough divorce. Infidelity is obviously, if it’s not happening to you, it’s happening to your best friend. It’s something that happens all the time and people just don’t want to talk about. So, this is kind of taking the lid off and letting people talk about it.” While clandestine meetings, inappropriate photo-sharing and secret marriages are just a few of the details that have emerged from tales she’s heard, Cam says the search for truth is the one constant thread in all of them. “Everyone deserves the truth,” she says. “There’s not a story that says, ‘I wish I never knew.’ It’s not OK to act like it’s polite to hide the truth from people. Yes, it’s gonna be hard, it’s gonna be a difficult conversation. You need to know what your motives are, about how you’re telling someone and when you’re telling someone, but everyone deserves the truth.” Cam notes that the hotly anticipated follow-up to her Untamed album is “90 percent there,” adding that there are a few songs that need more production, and there are some that are still in contention for inclusion on the project, which will be released sometime next year. “We all like tweaking up until the last minute,” she explains, “when someone literally pries it out of our hands and says, ‘It’s going. You have to let go.’ Otherwise it feels weird to stop and say, ‘Oh, it’s in the can for a few months.’ We don’t let you do that. It’s almost done, but we will continue tweaking until the last day, I assure you.” On November 28th, Cam will head back to her home state for the Best Coast Tour, and in between stops on that California trek, will play the final two shows opening for George Strait as his 2017 Las Vegas residency comes to a close.  “Every time someone actually says that out loud, I kind of, like, can’t believe it,” she says with a laugh. “People come in from all over. Most of them buy tickets for two nights to hear the first 30 Number Ones and the second 30 Number Ones. They’re dancing to their wedding songs, crying to their first love songs. It’s just like a whole lifetime soundtrack that he’s playing; people have just lived their whole lives with him.” In the wake of last month’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, Cam returned to the city for the Vegas Strong concert and has also visited survivors who remain hospitalized there. “I got to meet with the ER staff, got to hang out at the radio stations… and one girl said, ‘Before this, I never was really proud to be from Las Vegas, there wasn’t really anything….’ Now, after we watched how everyone came together, she’s so proud. She’ll be proud for the rest of her life, to be from Las Vegas. Because even though I know the headlines were like this horrible moment in time, all the good completely outweighs it, when you actually go hear all the stories.” As the conversation about not only concert security but also gun control has escalated in the weeks since the tragedy, Cam says she has been comforted and impressed by the country music community’s reaction and notes that the conversation needs to continue. “We think of fans as family,” she says. “I think the next step that you think of is how concerned everyone is for security. [T]hen the next part is gun control and talking about what that means. I think people are realizing the divisiveness over, like, when people are trying to make it like someone’s trying to take away your guns. Nobody’s trying to take away guns. Eighty percent of gun owners believe that there should be background checks.” As one of a very small group of country musicians who signed an open letter to Congress in 2016, Cam joined the Dixie Chicks and Rosanne Cash, along with nearly 200 artists and executives, in an effort to address gun violence and a need for reform after the mass killings at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub that June. Billboard, which printed the initial letter, reran it after the events at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.  “People wanted to come on Twitter and come at me for backing background checks,” the singer recalls. “And the thing is, the overall narrative becomes ‘which side are you on?’ As if there’s a side to a completely multifaceted thing. I hope that people can start seeing through that. What you realize is that there is something we can all agree on, and it’s just that nobody should be able to walk in and buy that many guns. We do it for Sudafed! We can come up with a couple basic things, and it’s not anti-guns. I’m coming from a household that has guns. I think not letting politics divide everyone is hopefully where we’re headed.” Next week, Cam participates in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, airing at 9 a.m. on NBC. In This Article:

381,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/01/abc-news-issues-corrects-bombshell-michael-flynn-report.html," ABC News on Friday corrected a stunning news report about Michael Flynn, the former White House official who pleaded guilty to giving a false statement to the FBI, which sparked a feeding frenzy and ricocheted across markets. Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security advisor, admitted to lying to federal investigators about conversations he held with Sergey I. Kislyak, a Russian diplomat. The former general's plea was part of an ongoing probe into Russia's suspected attempts to influence the 2016 election. Earlier in the day, ABC cited an unnamed source saying Flynn was prepared to testify that he made overtures to the Russian ambassador at Trump's behest, while the heated presidential contest was underway. Yet by Friday evening, the network had backtracked, saying Flynn would likely state that Trump's instructions occurred after the election. That distinction effectively altered the timeline and lessened the significance of the discussions — which according to ABC's report were meant to galvanize U.S.-Russian efforts to fight ISIS in Syria. Via Twitter, ABC initially called the updated story a ""clarification,"" but later formally corrected the piece and deleted its original tweet. ABC tweet By that time, much of the damage had already been done. Multiple media outlets, including CNBC, pounced on the ABC report, which reverberated through markets and stirred speculation that the Trump campaign may have colluded with the Russian government. Vanderhei ABC's handling of the story drew harsh criticism from media critics and defenders of the president. For his part, Donald Trump Jr., blasted the report as ""fake news"" in a Twitter post on Saturday, even as his father refrained from making any immediate comment. ABC retracts their misleading ""bombshell"" and removes their tweet approximately 12 hours after they knew it to be false. I know it's rare for you guys to get more than 200 RTs so I guess you milk it when you can?!?! #fakenews Brian Ross, one of the network's most prominent journalists who first broke the news, was excoriated for his role in the report. Several critics recalled the time that Ross wrongly implicated the Tea Party in a 2012 mass shooting that took place in Aurora, Colorado. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

382,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gay-hate-no-crime-in-too-many-states-even-after-pulse,"SEARCH The picture is as clear as it is frightening: LGBT people are the most likely to be targeted with hateful violence, and the least likely to be protected from it. If Omar Mateen had been apprehended alive after the Pulse nightclub massacre, Florida prosecutors would have been able to enhance his punishments with state hate crime legislation. His misdemeanor and felony charges would all be bumped up a degree. Any of his first-degree misdemeanors would become third-degree felonies. He would already been guaranteed to spend life behind bars for murdering 49 clubgoers, of course, but symbolically speaking, adding extra centuries to his prison sentence would have sent a powerful message of protection to a badly-shaken LGBT community. In the wake of the Pulse massacre, public attention has rightly turned to gun laws, with Democratic House members staging a sit-in over the House’s inaction on the issue. But after Orlando, it’s also obvious that state-level hate crime laws are also in dire need of strengthening. For LGBT people living in the United States, hate-crime laws are a messy patchwork system. The majority of states have hate crime laws, but only some are inclusive of sexual orientation and even fewer cover gender identity. According to data from the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), 20 states do not enhance penalties for crimes motivated by a victim’s sexual orientation. Thirty-four states lack penalty enhancement for crimes targeted at transgender people. These figures include five states that have no hate-crime laws at all: Georgia, South Carolina, Wyoming, Indiana, and Arkansas. The categories of race, religion, and ethnicity are protected in almost every state that has a hate crime law. But LGBT people are excluded in many — even though they are now the most probable target for hate crimes. As the New York Times reported last week, FBI statistics from 2014 show that LGBT people are now more likely than Jews, Muslims, African-Americans, Asians, and Latinos to be victims of a hate crime. Black transgender women of color are especially likely to be killed. In 2015 alone, a record 21 transgender people were murdered in the United States, primarily young trans women of color.   All together, one in five hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2014—the most recent year on record—were based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  The picture is as clear as it is frightening: LGBT people are the most likely to be targeted with hateful violence, and the least likely to be protected from it. The federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which President Obama signed in in 2009, can sometimes provide assistance when states do not have the means to investigate or prosecute a hate crime. For example, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch brought hate crime charges against white supremacist and domestic terrorist Dylann Roof, who perpetrated the Charleston church shooting, last July. As CNN reported at the time, South Carolina could not charge him with a hate crime because it had—and still has—no applicable laws.  But the Shepard/Byrd Act is far from a perfect solution for the many gaps in state-level legislation. The HRC perceives it as a “backstop,” not a replacement for state enforcement. And as the HRC notes, the Justice Department can only prosecute a tiny fraction of the thousands of hate crime cases reported to the FBI each year. States could easily fill in the gaps on their own by simply adding categories to their current hate crime laws. But they still aren’t doing so. As recently as this February, the Utah state legislature turned down a simple measure that would have enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by both anti-religious and anti-LGBT bias. Utah Governor Gary Herbert said of the measure, “If I kill you, you’re just as dead whether I hated you or I love you and killed you.” And in the wake of the Orlando shooting, most of the governors of the five states that have no hate crime legislation whatsoever merely offered “prayers.” Much like requiring universal background checks for gun purchases, expanding hate crime legislation to include LGBT people is hardly controversial. As long ago as 2007, 68 percent of Americans supported fully LGBT-inclusive federal hate crime legislation, according to Gallup polling. More recent polling on that question is not available but CBS polling on the Pulse shooting suggests that the vast majority of Americans perceived it as a hate crime: 54 percent said it was both terrorism and a hate crime and an additional 25 percent said it was mostly a hate crime. After the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was perpetrated in a gay nightclub on Latin night, there are no more excuses for state hate crime laws that protect some groups while leaving LGBT victims to rely on federal law. Three Democratic U.S. senators announced on Tuesday that they want to boost funding to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division as a result of the Pulse massacre but, so far, with limited exceptions like Milwaukee State Senator Tim Carpenter, state representatives have been quiet about revisiting their hate crime legislation. Making even slight changes to U.S. gun laws appears to be something of a brick wall, with the Senate voting down a background check measure just days after the Pulse shooting. In the meantime, it would be simple for states to respond to the tragic events of Orlando by expanding their hate crime legislation. It is, quite literally, the least they could do.",2017-11-30 06:45:44,"Gay Hate No Crime in Too Many States, Even After Pulse",,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
383,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aztec-high-school-gunman-posed-as-student-thumb-drive-may-reveal-motive-officials/,"Watch CBSN Live  December 8, 2017 / 2:56 PM
          / CBS/AP AZTEC, N.M. -- Authorities say a 21-year-old gunman killed two students at a New Mexico high school Thursday in a planned attack after disguising himself as a student to gain access to the building.San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen told reporters Friday that 21-year-old William Atchison of the small town of Aztec had legally purchased a 9mm Glock pistol a month ago. Officials said Atchison, who had previously attended Aztec High School, went there before buses arrived and was able to ""mingle"" with students and walk into the building undetected. Atchison killed the two students apparently at random, one in a restroom and the other just outside, Christesen said. Authorities confirmed Friday they do not believe the gunman targeted Casey Jordan-Marquez and Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez. More lives could have been lost had Fernandez not walked into the bathroom, authorities said. That's when the gunman shot Fernandez. Atchison walked out into the hallway and encountered the second victim, Casey J. Marquez, and killed her. After shooting both dead, he went on a rampage within the school, walking up and down the hallway and shooting through glass and walls as students and teachers barricaded themselves. Then, he fatally shot himself with the same gun. ""This person is not only a coward, he's evil in my mind,"" Christesen said. Christesen said writings found on a thumb drive show that the 21-year-old had planned the attack and carried it out with an intent that was ""focused"" and ""deranged."" Christesen displayed some of the writings at a press conference Friday. ""If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,"" the writings said. ""I wait until the school buses are detected, then head out on foot disguised as a student. I go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apes----, then blow my brains out."" In the writings, Atchinson spoke of being unhappy with work, school and his life and said, ""I just want out of this s---."" Officials said they were still baffled as to a motive but they believe further information on the thumb drive, which has been turned over to the FBI, will help authorities understand what led up to the shooting. New Mexico State Police chief Pete Kassetas said it was ""very obvious"" Atchison wanted officials to find the thumb drive because it was on his body. ""There's a lot more information there, we've barely scratched the surface of that, of what was speaking to his mindframe,"" Kassetas said. Investigators also found a timeline of what the gunman had planned, with a final time-stamped note that said, ""Die."" Speaking Friday, an FBI agent said Atchison had previous been investigated by the FBI after making comments on an online gaming forum about buying ""cheap assault rifles"" for someone who wanted to commit a mass shooting. Terry Wade, FBI special agent in charge in Albuquerque, said that the agency checked databases and interviewed him and his family in March 2016. Wade said the man didn't have a gun at that time and told agents that he had no plans for an attack. He also didn't have ties to any organizations. Family members said Atchison was known for making comments to get people ""riled up,"" Christesen said, and Wade said Atchison admitted he liked to ""troll"" online. The FBI closed the investigation when it determined no crime was committed. Christesen hailed brave acts of school staff and law enforcement who he said helped save lives. He told reporters Friday that a substitute teacher heard the gunshots but didn't have a key to lock the door to the computer lab, so she took students into an office or storage area and barricaded the door with a couch. He said Atchison came to the room and yelled that he knew they were in there and then fired multiple shots into the room. Christesen and other officials praised the bravery of school staff and law enforcement who arrived at the scene in less than a minute, which he said prevented more bloodshed. Christesen also hailed a brave custodian who he said pursued the gunman and yelled to alert teachers there was an active shooter and to lock down. Christesen said it was a ""miracle"" no other injuries were reported. The shooting has rocked Aztec, a community of about 6,500 near the Colorado border. Hundreds gathered for prayer services and candlelight vigils to honor the victims and more gatherings are planned over the weekend as residents look for answers.

17:51 You will remember when the government cut £1,500 a year from disabled people through slashing the employment and support allowance. This was justified through an effective work and health programme. Today’s statement is clear evidence that they have broken this promise. There were good discussions about future frameworks, how powers would work across the UK. We are not in a position to support the withdrawal bill yet because of the elements of it that affect devolution, but there was acknowledgement that there was an opportunity for the UK government to consider our amendments as the bill goes through parliament. There should be agreement not imposition. We understand what the UK government is trying to do and we share the same destination, but either they do it through imposing rules on the rest of us or they do it by us all agreeing. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. 5.37pm GMT
17:37 On Radio 4’s PM programme Sir Christopher Meyer, the former British ambassador to the US, and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications director, are speaking about Theresa May’s response to President Trump. They both said they thought she got it about right, and that it would have been counter-productive for May to have attacked Trump more aggressively. Meyer said he could not recall a British prime minister rebuking an American president in the way May did in public in his lifetime. But Meyer and Campbell both said they thought it was a mistake for May to offer Trump a state visit as quickly as she did. Updated

17:13 Damian Green, the first secretary of state, has published a written ministerial statement correcting something he said at PMQs yesterday when he deputised for Theresa May. He told MPs the government spends £90bn a year on disability benefits. But the figure is £50bn, Green says in his statement. 5.09pm GMT
17:09 Jeremy Corbyn has been revealed as the latest cover star of men’s magazine GQ. British GQ tweeted a photo of its January/February issue cover, which features the Labour leader in a dark Marks & Spencer jacket and red tie, the Press Association reports. The issue has been billed a “2018 Election Special” and carries the headline “Jeremy Corbyn’s hostile takeover”. His appearance marks a change in direction for the magazine, which has featured the likes of Liam Gallagher, Alec Baldwin, Cara Delevingne and the Duke of Cambridge on the cover this year.

16:56 According to Sky’s Darren McCaffrey, Foreign Office officials told the Irish government to ignore what Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said about Brexit when he visited Dublin recently. Here is McCaffrey’s story. And here’s an excerpt. Sky News has learnt that Foreign Office officials told Ireland’s government “not to listen to whatever he had to say” ahead of Johnson’s visit to Dublin a few weeks ago. Extraordinarily, officials in Whitehall were very open with their counterparts in the Irish capital to “ignore the public utterances” of Britain’s chief diplomat. The Foreign Office has not commented. 4.50pm GMT

16:42 Lisa O'Carroll Ireland’s newly installed deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has said the EU will not “abandon” Dublin and force it to veto progress of Brexit on its own if a satisfactory deal on the Irish border is not on the table by Monday’s deadline. He told MPs in the Dail there was “a very strong understanding across the 27 EU states in relation to what is required” in order to get talks over the line into the second phase of negotiations. He said the decision on whether to move to the next stage or not was of “real historic significance” to Ireland. He said: This is about permanent change in the relationship between Ireland and Britain and within this island. Coveney who was promoted to the post of tanaiste on Thursday was responded to calls by the Sinn Fein deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald to use Ireland’s veto if necessary. He said Ireland had been consistent in its demands that there was no regulatory divergence over the Irish border as a result of the UK pulling out of the EU.“What perhaps has changed is the expectation of others that Ireland might change its position,” he said in reference to the UK. 4.37pm GMT
16:37 Robert Wood Johnson, the US ambassador to London, has been inviting people to submit questions to him on Twitter. (He calls it #AskWoody). Here’s a flavour of the questions he’s been getting. The US ambassador in London is holding an #askwoody session. It's going pretty much as you would imagine. https://t.co/LDD7gx8dcc pic.twitter.com/B6moKWEzRs And he seems to have got the message. He posted this earlier. I wanted you to #AskWoody. Thank you for your questions and feedback. I have relayed your concerns to Washington. The U.S. & UK have a long history of speaking frankly with each other, as all close friends do. Our relationship is strong, vital and enduring. 4.27pm GMT
16:27 Last year a lot of books were published about the EU referendum. I summarised some of the best ones here. But the Brexit books are still coming, and over the last few weeks two particularly good one have landed on my desk. Here they are - both strongly recommended. The Lure of Greatness by Anthony Barnett: Barnett, director of Charter 88 and a founder of openDemocracy, has spent his life campaigning for democratic change from the left only to find that, when the moment of seismic, anti-elitist, constitutional upheaval did arrive, it was in the form of Brexit, and from the right. This is his attempt to make sense of it. It is not a campaign book; it’s about the political forces that explain what happened, and it is remarkable in its reach. Barnett is particularly interested in Brexit as a consequence of England’s lack of self-government (“England-without-London” voted 55% leave, he points out), but he ranges very widely, covering neoliberalism, Iraq, Blair’s constitutional reforms and even Princess Diana (an early exponent of “celebrity populism”, he argues.) Some of his judgements are probably too harsh, but overall this is a dazzling, all-encompassing, big picture analysis of the Brexit vote, easily the best of its kind in print, brilliantly written and endlessly thought-provoking. Do read it. Sample quotes Unlike all other parts of the UK and the EU, England has no government of its own. The researchers [for an IPPR report] surmised that there was a causal relationship: being deprived of a credible, representative power that clearly belongs to you, leads to anger with the most remote authority of all, which is blamed as the source of your powerlessness. Or to put it the other way round, you only feel comfortable within as large an international association as the EU if you feel directly represented by a government formed of your own primary identity. Within England this seems to be confirmed, as London with its mayor has lower levels of euro-resentment. The government launched the campaign to remain by saying in effect: ‘We too are against the EU, but think it is in Britain’s selfish interests to remain.’ The rest of the booklet [sent to homes before the referendum] set out the advantages the UK could extract from membership while not being exposed to the risks of full-blooded engagement. In this way, the public was offered a choice between two varieties of hostility to Europe. A majority found the stronger brew more attractive. The UK walked out of Europe on two Big-British Eurosceptic legs. One was called leave, the other remain. Brexit and Ireland by Tony Connelly: No other country will be more affected by Brexit than Ireland and Connelly, RTE’s Brussels editor, has written the definitive book on its plight. It’s subtitled “The Dangers, the Opportunities and the Inside Story of the Irish Response”, but the opportunities bit barely fills a chapter (UK banks relocating? Farmers benefiting if UK agriculture completely collapses?) and mostly this is a tale about a looming threat. Connelly covers the politics very well, but he also writes vividly, with colour and pace and detail, about the businesses and communities that will be affected. It’s a superb work of reporting, and a much needed one. Northern Ireland voted 56% remain. Yet the demise of the SDLP, and the fact that Sinn Fein refuse to take their seats, means that in parliament the region is just represented by the pro-leave DUP (think 10 joyless versions of Peter Bone) and a single independent. Northern Ireland’s remain concerns are not being heard at Westminster. Brexit and Ireland helps to explain them, and all MPs should read it as a matter of urgency. Sample quote It soon became clear [in spring 2017] Theresa May’s government didn’t actually know themselves what they meant by an ‘associative’ relationship [with the customs union]. One Irish official found himself at a meeting in the Department of International Trade, the engine room of Britain’s new buccaneering global-trade ambitions. Teething problems were evident. ‘The department has gone from a unit of 40 to 220,’ says the official. ‘There aren’t enough seats for people. They’re wandering around. It’s fairly chaotic. The vast majority are new, so a clear policy is by no means articulated. They state things that are total conundrums, things you can’t have, matter and anti-matter in the same sentence. We want to stay as close to the single market, but actually we’re not going to be really. We want to be part of the customs union, but we realise that what we say we want to do isn’t compatible with that either’. Another Irish official was contacted by her British counterpart, who asked what she had been ‘hearing back’ from the EU about the idea of an ‘associated membership’. (This was before article 50 was triggered, so Britain could not engage directly with the EU.) She replied with some incredulity: “What am I going to hear? What does associated membership even mean? Like, what is it?’ Her counterpart replied: “Oh, right, Okay.’ Updated

15:43 A British woman has been on the receiving end of scores of tweets and phone calls after President Trump mistakenly tweeted at her instead of Theresa May. As the Press Association reports, Theresa Scrivener, who lives in Bognor, used her middle name to set up the account TheresaMay in 2009. She has been inundated with messages after Mr Trump directed a tweet at her on Wednesday night. The PA story goes on: Speaking exclusively to the Press Association, Scrivener said she had received “huge numbers” of messages, adding: “If I wanted to be famous I would have gone on X Factor.” “It’s amazing to think that the world’s most powerful man managed to press the wrong button,” she said. “I’m just waiting for a call from the White House with an apology.” Most of the responses on Twitter were from people offering their condolences, with many Americans apologising for their president. “I’m just glad he was not contacting me to say he was going to war with North Korea,” she added. Scrivener, 41, said the first she heard of the incident was when she woke at 4am to huge numbers of messages on her phone from reporters hoping to speak to her. It was not until a few hours later she saw the tweets from Mr Trump. Speaking from her home on Thursday, she said: “I wasn’t really sure what to make of it. I was in bed by half 10 last night and oblivious to it all. “It has been very surreal. I am laughing about it now but he is the one who sent the tweet and I have been inundated with calls. “I haven’t been able to leave my house. I’ve been bombarded and been contacted by press from around the world.” Scrivener said she wanted to stay out of the debate surrounding Trump’s conversation with the prime minister, but added: “He needs to think before he tweets. We - Theresa May and I - are so different. Our profiles are completely different. She runs the country, I’m a mum from Bognor.” Scrivener’s account has just six followers compared with May’s 427,000. 3.43pm GMT
15:43 Lisa O'Carroll A senior member of the Irish cabinet has said Ireland is still waiting for the British government to “put flesh on the bones” of a proposal to secure a frictionless border with Northern Ireland post Brexit. Agriculture minister Michael Creed told RTE’s Sean O’Rourke programme that the clock was ticking and there was still no sign of draft working on a deal ahead of Monday when Theresa May has been asked to put forward her final proposals on the three key Brexit issues - the divorce bill, Ireland and EU citizens. “It is now incumbent on the British government to clearly deliver a roadmap,” he said. Sources say wording for the draft proposal is being circulated in Whitehall to satisfy Ireland’s demands that there is no “regulatory divergence” between the Republic and Northern Ireland. The proposal will succeed or fail on the wording - Ireland is looking for a guaranteed commitment that can be delivered in the second round of talks. Talk of “regulatory alignment” between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland would give Ireland the highest degree of legal comfort but the alternatives “regulatory convergence” or “regulatory equivalence” are also acceptable, it is believed. Earlier in Dublin, Ian Paisley, DUP MP for North Antrim, renewed his attack on Ireland’s position that the region should stay in the customs union and the single market even if the UK withdraws on exiting the bloc. He said Ireland should stop “shouting about” the border and the Good Friday Agreement and talking about “doom and gloom” and instead work with the UK to get a solution. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Paisley said he would “love to encourage” the Republic to leave the EU along with the UK but he that respected the decision to stay. Paisley warned that any efforts to “trip up” the UK as it left the EU would have repercussions. He was commenting less than a day after telling a parliamentary committee that Ireland had been acting “disgracefully” in relation to the Northern Ireland question. 2.54pm GMT
14:54 Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador in Washington, has confirmed that he complained about President Trump’s Britain First tweets to the White House. He has posted this on Twitter. British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right, which seek to divide communities & erode decency, tolerance & respect. British Muslims are peaceful and law abiding citizens. And I raised these concerns with the White House yesterday. 2.26pm GMT
14:26 The Labour MP Wes Streeting wasn’t impressed by what Theresa May said in her Q&A. Barely any rebuke and the honour of a state visit remains. Pathetic. If you can’t even stand up for yourself @Theresa_May how can you stand up for Britain? pic.twitter.com/5A6AhqtpXS 2.18pm GMT
14:18 Here are the main points from Theresa May’s Q&A. Britain First is a hateful organisation. It seeks to spread to division and mistrust among our communities, it stands in fundamental opposition to the values that we share as a nation - values of respect, tolerance and, dare I say it, just common British decency. On the issue of radical Islam, British Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding people who have themselves been the subject and victims of acts of terror by the far right. There are those who conduct acts of terror in the name of Islam, but it is not in the name of Islam. And as prime minister I am very clear about the priority that I give to dealing with the challenge of the threat of terrorism, and that’s dealing with the threat of terrorism and and extremism from whatever source they come ... The fact that we work together does not mean that we are afraid to say when we think that the United States have got it wrong and to be very clear with them. And I am very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. Her wording was virtually identical to the wording her spokesman used at the Number 10 lobby briefing yesterday. She did not resile from what was said yesterday in any way, but she did not develop her criticism either. An invitation for a state visit has been extended and accepted. We have yet to set a date. I have made my position clear on the tweets I have seen from President Trump. But at that point she had only commented on the Britain First tweets, not the overnight tweet about herself. (The ‘I’ve answered that already’ response, when you haven’t, is a classic politician’s way of avoiding a difficult question.) Let me be clear about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. This is a long-term special relationship that we have. It’s an enduring relationship that is there because it is in both our national interests for that relationship to be there. And as prime minister’s I’m clear that that that relationship with the United States to continue. I think it is in the interests, both of the United Kingdom and of the United States and of the wider world. Of course, as I said, we take the need to deal with the terrorist threat very seriously. That’s about what we do domestically in the United Kingdom. It’s also about what we do elsewhere in the world, such as the work I saw yesterday in Iraq. I have absolute confidence that my cabinet ministers would not be retweeting material from Britain First. Just to be clear, I’m not a prolific tweeter myself, as you may have seen, and that means I don’t spend all my time looking at other people’s tweets. But when I feel that there should be a response, I give it. And I have given it to President Trump’s tweets. Updated

13:33 May has now finished. If anyone was hoping for a Love Actually moment, they will have been disappointed. May did not resile from the Downing Street criticism of Trump issued yesterday, but she did not take it any further either - and seemed anxious to change the subject as quickly as possible. I will post a summary soon. Updated
            at 1.38pm GMT 1.28pm GMT
13:28 Q: Would you sack a cabinet minister who retweeted something from Britain First? May says she has “absolute confidence” that her ministers would not do that. Q: How did you feel when you saw Trump’s recent tweet? May says she is not a prolific tweeter. She does not spend a lot of time looking at Twitter. But she has made her views clear. Q: Do you think Trump is a supporter and enabler of far-right groups? May says we must all take the far right seriously. She has commented in the past on the far fight in America. 1.25pm GMT
13:25 Q: Trump also tweeted that you should keep out of his business. Is that acceptable? May says she want the US-UK relationship to continue. It is good for the world. Q: Will the state visit go ahead? Is Trump a fit person to meet the Queen? May says the invitation has been extended and accepted. 1.23pm GMT
13:23 May is taking questions. Q: You have talked about online extremism. What do you think about President Trump spreading hate speech on Twitter, and what will you do it? May says Britain First is a hateful organisation. It stands against common Britain decency. She says Muslims have been the victims of far-right terrorism. As home secretary and prime minister, she has been confronting terrorism, wherever it comes from. She says she works together with the US. But she is not afraid to say when they have got something wrong. And rewtweeting Britain First is wrong, she says.",2017-11-30 06:29:53,MPs debate Trump's Twitter jibe at May after speaker grants Commons urgent question - Politics live,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
386,https://nypost.com/2017/11/27/las-vegas-shooting-survivor-killed-by-hit-and-run-driver/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit November 27, 2017 | 9:31am				| Updated November 27, 2017 | 10:11am A Las Vegas man who survived the country music festival attack that left 58 people dead was killed earlier this month by a hit-and-run driver, leaving his widow reeling “in another dimension.” Roy McClellan, 52, was killed Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on a highway west of Las Vegas in Pahrump after leaving the home of a friend he was helping with a house project. His wife, Denise McClellan, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal she had a horrible feeling in her gut that something was wrong after filing a missing persons report and seeing news coverage about the death of an unidentified man the following day. “I read the words ’52-year-old man’ and ‘Pahrump,’” she told the newspaper. “And I just knew.” Denise McClellan said she now feels like she’s in “another dimension” after her husband survived the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history only to be killed weeks later. “My husband battled on a daily basis with depression, but that’s only one side of him,” she told the newspaper. “He was also someone who would give up his last dollar or give someone the shirt off his own back. That’s who he really was.” Roy McClellan, according to the Nevada Highway Patrol, was walking illegally in the right lane of State Route 160 when a Chevrolet Camaro struck him. The driver took off and McClellan was later pronounced dead at the scene. It’s unclear why he was walking in the roadway, and the Clark County coroner’s office had not determined an official cause and manner of death as of Sunday, the Review-Journal reports. The vehicle believed to be involved in the fatal crash was located one day after the accident, but police said a person of interest had not been charged as of Sunday. “I just want some answers,” Denise McClellan told the newspaper. “I want to know why this person has not been arrested.” Denise McClellan said her husband told her that the Oct. 1 shooting was “messing with his head” and that surviving the bloodbath during an outdoor music festival at the Mandalay Bay hotel casino before gunman Stephen Paddock took his own life had worsened his mental state. “I believe that he’s happy now and he doesn’t have to battle his demons anymore,” she told the newspaper. “And I at least have that to hold onto.” But Denise McClellan said she’s struggling to understand how tragedy has struck her again some seven weeks after surviving the shooting with her husband, who returned to the scene later to see if anyone needed a ride to safety. “This isn’t what I wanted for him,” she told KSNV. “I don’t understand why he wasn’t taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he’s safe now.” An online fundraiser to offset funeral costs for McClellan’s family had eclipsed $3,800 as of Monday. “All of your comments are so touching,” Denise McClellan wrote. “Yes I am having a hard time, it’s all so overwhelming and I know he’s in heaven [where] he will never feel sadness, pain, fear again. That is what gives me some comfort.” Read Next Hawaii fires up air raid system amid North Korea tensions Share Selection This story has been shared 365,550 times.

387,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/congress-to-vote-on-trump--and-nra-backed-bill-to-remove-local-gun-restrictions?CMP=twt_gu,"Ex-congresswoman Gabby Giffords attacks the bill, which passed by 231 to 197 and removes states’ power to control who can carry concealed, loaded handguns First published on Wed 6 Dec 2017 14.10 GMT On the day of an annual vigil in Washington DC that honors the victims of American gun violence, congressional Republicans passed a Trump-endorsed bill that would eviscerate local gun restrictions, removing states’ power to control who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded handgun in their streets. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 231-197. Fourteen Republicans voted against while six Democrats voted for it.  Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting, called the vote “unthinkable”. “The House of Representatives passed a bill that would let almost anyone carry loaded, concealed firearms almost anywhere in the United States,” Giffords said in an email to gun control supporters. Officials in New York and Los Angeles warn that the legislation would allow an unknown numbers of tourists – perhaps hundreds of thousands each year – to carry concealed handguns into America’s densest urban areas, including Times Square and the New York City subway. Big city police chiefs across the county have spoken out against the bill, calling it a law enforcement nightmare. The bill, which is the National Rifle Association’s “number one legislative priority” has prompted a renewed battle over states’ rights, with Democrats for once arguing against the power of the federal government, and Republicans hoping to use that federal power to undermine local control. “It’s so transparently hypocritical. Republicans spend all day talking about states’ rights, except when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns, they want to take away states’ ability to make decisions for themselves,” Senator Chris Murphy, a leading gun control advocate who represents Newtown, Connecticut, said on Tuesday, in advance of the vote. The NRA called the vote a “watershed moment”, one more step in what the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, described as a “30-year movement” to ensure that Americans can carry their self-defense weapons across state lines. Despite an easy victory in the House, the bill faces a much more uphill battle in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass. “Right now, there’s no indication that the Senate Republicans want to take this legislation up. In fact, the opposite,” Murphy said. “My suspicion is there are not 60 votes for a national concealed weapons bill [in the Senate],” he said. Americans have a constitutional right to own guns in their home for self-defense. But America's 50 states have dramatically different laws when it comes to carrying guns in public, which all states allow in some form. Twelve conservative states now generally do not require any permit or training for an adult to carry a loaded handgun in public, a policy called ""constitutional carry."" In contrast, seven more liberal states issue permits sparingly and require citizens to demonstrate a justifiable need for carrying a concealed weapon. These tougher laws mean that few residents of cities Los Angeles or New York are given permits to carry concealed guns. There is also wide variation in training requirements – from states that require applicants to demonstrate actual proficiency in firing a gun, to Virginia, which requires only an online safety training course. Under current law, states do not have to recognize carry permits issued by other states, creating a confusing patchwork of regulations on whether gun owners from one state can carry their concealed weapon in another state. For years, the NRA has been trying to pass a federal law to require every state to recognize every other state's gun-carrying permits – which would make it as easy to carry a concealed gun across the country as it is to drive a car. Donald Trump has endorsed the legislation. Law enforcement officials from the nation's largest cities say this legislation would be a public safety disaster, gutting the tough restrictions in states like New York and California to and forcing them to recognize gun carry permits from all states, no matter how weak those state's laws. The NRA-backed legislation would force all states to recognize gun-carrying permits from any other state, including the dozen states that generally do not require any training or permit to carry a gun, a policy called “constitutional carry”. West Virginia’s choice to allow “constitutional carry” of concealed handguns “might be fine for West Virginia, but it’s not fine for New York City”, said Cy Vance, Manhattan’s district attorney. “I wouldn’t presume to tell West Virginia, as a New Yorker, what West Virginia’s laws should be with regard to gun possession. Can you imagine how mad they’d be?” Donald Trump endorsed the legislation during his campaign last year. Its passage came the same day that gun violence survivors, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, were visiting congressional offices to ask politicians, once again, to take some action on gun control. Nearly five years after the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which left 26 children and educators dead, Congress has yet to pass any gun control laws. It’s not (just) about the money. In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. But for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The NRA has plenty of cash to spend. It bet big on the 2016 US elections, pouring $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. But “the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA professor of constitutional law. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, that number is disputed, but whatever its actual size, membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect."" Read more “We have nothing but heartache and compassion for the victims of Sandy Hook, but concealed carry reciprocity has nothing to do with this tragedy,” said Tatum Gibson, a spokeswoman for Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican congressman who introduced the legislation, said in a statement when asked about the timing of the vote. “I don’t know that putting the NRA’s agenda on the floor of the House is the right way to mark five years since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told the Guardian. “It is heartbreaking to think as we come up to the fifth anniversary of Newtown, Republicans in the House are pushing through a bill to make our country less safe.” At the same time, Murphy argued, the political maneuvering over the bill could be seen as a sign of the growing strength of the gun control movement. Before the House vote, Republicans combined the controversial NRA-backed “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” with a modest measure to make sure the military and other federal agencies are reporting records to the nation’s gun background check system. The Sutherland Springs mass shooting last month revealed that the air force had failed to submit to the background checks system dozens of records that should have disqualified dangerous people from gun ownership, including the domestic violence conviction of the man who went on to murder 26 people at a small Baptist church in Texas. “It says something really interesting about the vulnerability that Republicans feel on guns today,” Murphy said. “Republicans are increasingly worried about the optics of pushing the NRA agenda, and that’s why they’re trying to add on some anti-gun violence legislation.” Republicans’ attempt to tear down local restrictions on gun carrying comes just weeks after two of America’s deadliest mass shootings, at a country music concert in Las Vegas and a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The move highlights the stark divide in Americans’ opinions on guns, with some conservatives seeing increased civilian gun carrying as a way to prevent or lessen the toll of mass shootings, even as many other Americans are trying to fight against America’s gun-carrying culture and get guns off the street. Under current law, states have dramatically different standards for who is allowed to carry a concealed, loaded weapon. A handful of more liberal states give law enforcement officials discretion when granting a carry permit and some require that applicants demonstrate a specific need for self-defense. But the majority of states make it easy for citizens to get a carry license. While some states require that permit holders demonstrate proficiency with a gun at a firing range, others only require some kind of gun safety course. In Virginia, applicants don’t even need to leave the house: it’s possible to get a concealed carry license after taking a gun safety course online. Many states currently recognize each other’s carry permits, in the same way states recognize each other’s driver’s licenses, but some states pick and choose which licenses they will honor, and a few states, including New York, recognize no outside permits at all. Gun rights advocates say the current patchwork of state laws governing gun carrying is confusing for law-abiding gun owners, and that American states and cities with the toughest gun control laws are violating Americans’ constitutional right to carry firearms for self-defense. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, hailed the bill’s passage in a statement saying “the truth is that concealed carry laws save lives”. Opponents of the legislation say the right way to fix the confusion over differing regulations is to create a uniform national standard for training and eligibility, not simply force the states with the toughest gun control regulations to allow the most untrained, unvetted gun carriers to walk their streets. Adam Winkler, a gun law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, said the legislation the House is currently considering would also allow local residents in cites with tough restrictions to do an end run around local laws, and get their permit to carry a gun from another state with weaker laws. One of the proposed Democratic amendments to the bill would close that loophole. An estimated three million Americans report carrying a loaded handgun on a daily basis, and an estimated nine million report doing so on a monthly basis, according to a recent study based on a survey conducted by Harvard and Northeastern researchers.",2017-12-06 23:17:47,House passes 'unthinkable' NRA-backed bill lifting local gun restrictions,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
388,https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/11/10/hand-over-your-weapons/6IxJLanMKGak7RvCLipwbN/story.html,"In the AFTERMATH of the Texas church shooting last week, Democratic lawmakers did what they always do: They skewered their Republican colleagues for offering only “thoughts and prayers,” and demanded swift action on gun control. “The time is now,” said Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something.” Trouble is, it’s not clear the “something” Democrats typically demand would make a real dent in the nation’s epidemic of gun violence. Congress can ban assault weapons, but they account for just a tiny sliver of the country’s 33,000 annual firearm deaths. And tighter background checks will do nothing to cut down on the 310 million guns already in circulation. In other words, the proposals aren’t just difficult to enact in the current political climate; their practical effects would also be quite limited. On occasion, though, leading Democrats will make oblique reference to a more sweeping policy change: seizing a huge number of weapons from law-abiding citizens. Advertisement At a New Hampshire forum in the fall of 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke approvingly of an Australian gun buyback program that collected more than 650,000 weapons — a buyback that, she neglected to mention, was compulsory. And just a few months earlier, then-President Barack Obama offered coded support for the same confiscatory approach. “When Australia had a mass killing — I think it was in Tasmania — about 25 years ago, it was just so shocking, the entire country said, ‘Well, we’re going to completely change our gun laws,’ and they did,” he said. Democrats have even let the word “confiscation” slip out, on occasion. After the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a radio interview that when it came to assault weapons “confiscation could be an option, mandatory sale to the state could be an option.” It was an option Cuomo didn’t pursue. But five years after that slaughter of schoolchildren — and with fresh tales of murdered kids on the floor of a Texas church — might gun-control advocates expand their agenda? Advertisement The logic of gun control lies, at bottom, in substantially reducing the number of deadly weapons on the street — and confiscation is far and away the most effective approach. Is there any conceivable turn of events in our politics that could make confiscation happen? And what would a mass seizure look like? ON APRIL 28, 1996 a deranged man named Martin Bryant used a semi-automatic rifle to slaughter 12 people in 15 seconds at the Broad Arrow cafe in Port Arthur, Tasmania, a popular tourist spot on the site of a former Australian prison colony. He killed eight more in the gift shop, and several others in the parking lot. And as he drove away, he came across Nanette Mikac and her two daughters fleeing the scene. Bryant told Mikac to get on her knees and as she wailed, “Please don’t hurt my babies,” he blew a hole through her forehead and fired several shots into her 3-year-old, Madeline. Alannah, 6, ran into the woods and Bryant gave chase. When he found her curled up behind a tree, he put his gun to her neck and fired. Bryant, who killed 35 people that Sunday afternoon, shocked Australia into action. It took just 12 days for conservative Prime Minister John Howard to announce a full slate of gun restrictions in a nation with a long tradition of frontier firearms. There was a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons and shotguns, an extensive registration system, and a 28-day waiting period between getting a permit and buying a gun. Advertisement But the centerpiece was the mandatory buyback, with a temporary tax financing the multimillion dollar purchase of hundreds of thousands of weapons deemed illegal under the new law. Some feared resistance. Howard, at one point, wore a bulletproof vest during a speech to a group of gun rights supporters. But the buyback went forward peacefully, and it claimed an estimated one-fifth of Australia’s gun stock — one of the largest gun confiscations in modern history. The seizure and the other gun control measures seem to have had a significant effect. Since passage of the law, the country hasn’t seen a single mass shooting — defined as a killing of five or more people, not including the gunman. A study by researchers at Australian National University and Wilfrid Laurier University found a 59 percent drop in the firearm homicide rate and a 65 percent decline in the firearm suicide rate in the decade after the law was introduced. And while critics have noted the firearm death rate was already declining before passage of the legislation, the data show it dropped twice as fast afterward. Here in the United States, interest in large-scale gun buybacks — both voluntary and involuntary — has mounted with each mass shooting. Matt Miller, a journalist and onetime senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for American Progress, has proposed what he calls a “massive, debt-financed” buyback. Advertisement The idea is to supersize the small-scale, voluntary buybacks that happen in American cities — offering hundreds of dollars more per weapon in a bid to make them more effective. “Instead of $200 a gun, Uncle Sam might offer $500,” Miller wrote, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post after Sandy Hook. “After all, overpaying powerful constituencies to achieve public policy goals is a time-honored American tradition; we do it every day with Medicare drug benefits and defense contractors, to name just two.” John Rosenthal, co-founder and chairman of Massachusetts-based Stop Handgun Violence, says it may be time to embrace a mandatory buyback — the relentless tide of mass shootings leaving weary activists with little choice. “I am so struggling right now to find the strength to keep going,” he said earlier this week, a day after the Texas church shooting. “And guess what, I have been thinking a lot about Australia. They had that one horrific event, with 35 killed, with an assault weapon. They banned them, they bought them back — and there hasn’t been a mass shooting since.” It’s a model the Aussies themselves have been touting to any Americans who will listen — suggesting it could succeed in the United States with a little political courage, especially on the right. In Australia “many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives,” wrote Howard, the former prime minister, in The New York Times a few years ago. “Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair. Many of them had been lifelong supporters of my coalition and felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws. I understood their misgivings. Yet I felt there was no alternative.” Advertisement THE TROUBLE WITH all of this is that America is not Australia. As Howard himself has noted, Australia is a more intensely urban society than the United States, meaning there is a larger natural constituency for gun control Down Under — and a smaller rural opposition. The Australian gun lobby, moreover, is not as powerful or well-financed as the National Rifle Association. And the Aussies don’t have a constitutionally protected right to bear arms. While the Second Amendment isn’t absolute — no less than conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ruled that it’s “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose”— it would undoubtedly serve as the basis for a robust legal challenge to any involuntary buyback program. And the courts would not be the only site of resistance. Gun culture runs especially deep in a country born of violent rebellion. And over the last couple of decades, firearms have become one of the most important fault lines in American culture. It is hard to overstate the devotion — or if you prefer, the fanaticism — of the 3 percent of the population that owns half the guns in circulation. Many of those hard-core gun owners see their weapons as a guard against government overreach. And sending government agents to claim them could end very, very badly. An NRA article on the specter of Australian-style confiscation coming to the United States is subtitled “There Will Be Blood.” Part of the problem is the sheer scale of the enterprise. An operation on par with the Australian buyback — claiming one-fifth of American guns — would mean tens of thousands of police officers collecting some 60 million guns. It is, on some level, simply unimaginable. But perhaps gun-control advocates can propose something smaller — something more targeted. Before Elliot Rodger killed six and wounded 14 in a shooting spree in Santa Barbara, Calif. in 2014, his mother and a social worker raised concerns with the police. But because Rodger had broken no law, there was nothing law enforcement could do. After the rampage, California lawmakers passed a measure allowing family members to seek court orders seizing guns from disturbed people before they can hurt anybody. Similar laws are in place in Washington, Indiana, and Connecticut. And legislators in 18 other states, including Massachusetts, considered so-called “extreme risk protective order” legislation this year, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Giffords Law Center, says Devin Kelley, the Texas church killer, would have been a “perfect candidate” for an order of this kind. “People knew that there was something going on with him,” she says. “He was sending threatening messages to his mother-in-law. . . .  He had [committed] domestic violence and animal abuse.” Cutilletta says restraining orders and other measures designed to deprive the most dangerous people of guns — like background checks and tighter restrictions on domestic abusers — are more politically viable, and legally defensible, than gun confiscation. And they can have an impact, she says: States with tougher gun laws have fewer firearm-related deaths. Still, 
even if we find a way to keep guns out of the hands of people who have engaged in disturbing or violent behavior — no small task, given all the stories of the troubled shooters who slipped through the cracks — it will only get us so far. The United States’ astronomically high rates of firearm violence aren’t rooted in some unique American propensity for derangement and delinquency. Studies show our levels of mental illness and basic criminality are on par with other wealthy countries. Other common explanations, like the social fissures created by our racial diversity, have been debunked by researchers, too. The only explanation left — an explanation borne out by a number of careful studies — is the sheer size of the American arsenal. There are 310 million handguns, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons in American homes, garages, and waistbands. Ultimately, if gun-control advocates really want to stanch the blood, there’s no way around it: They’ll have to persuade more people of the need to confiscate millions of those firearms, as radical as that idea may now seem.

          / CBS/AP LAS VEGAS — The organizers of a fund for the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting say they will stop taking donations on Jan. 31. Stephen Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest music festival below before killing himself. Las Vegas Victims' Fund Committee Chairman Scott Nielson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal Friday that they are gearing up to allocate funds between all the victims and their families. The fund received about $16 million in donations so far. Survivors, first responders, people who worked the event and family members of the victims are eligible to submit a claim for a donation from the fund. CBS affiliate KLAS reported on Nov. 28 that the most recent draft of the fund's proposed guidelines for distribution prioritizes relatives of those who were killed and survivors who were hospitalized.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. LAS VEGAS – The maker of a rapid-fire gun accessory that police say was used in the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 people and left hundreds injured at an open-air concert on the Las Vegas Strip has been removed from a wounded California woman's negligence and damages lawsuit, a lawyer said Thursday. Attorney Craig Eiland, representing Rachel Sheppard, said the decision to strip Slide Fire Solutions from the case will let him focus on her claims that hotel owner MGM Resorts International and concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment did not follow active shooter planning and procedures. Eiland noted that Texas-based Slide Fire still faces a separate lawsuit seeking class-action status in Nevada on negligence and product liability claims relating to its ""bump stock"" weapon modification device. Court filings allege that Slide Fire marketed the device to gun owners who wanted semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. ""One of the MGM and Live Nation defenses will be foreseeability,"" Eiland said of a contention that no one could know that a 64-year-old high-stakes video poker player would amass an arsenal of 23 guns and rain gunfire from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. Police have said many of the assault-style guns in the room had been modified with ""bump stock"" devices to help the gunman shoot more rapidly. Eiland said he found evidence that Las Vegas Strip casino-hotels plan with police for responses to crimes and disasters. ""If police are working with you on a response to an active shooter, it means it is foreseeable,"" Eiland said. An MGM Resorts spokeswoman, Debra DeShong, declined to comment on the new legal filing or its claims. ""We will give our response through the appropriate legal channel,"" she said. Live Nation and Slide Fire Solutions did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Live Nation, of Beverly Hills, California, has previously expressed sorrow that people were ""forever impacted by this senseless act of violence."" Authorities say shooter Stephen Paddock killed himself before officers reached his room. A motive for what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history has not been identified. The lawsuit by Sheppard, of Tehachapi, California, is one of several filed to date in Nevada and other states. A set of five cases filed Nov. 20 in Los Angeles by Houston-based attorneys on behalf of some 450 plaintiffs killed or injured in the concert crowd did not name Slide Fire as a defendant. Eiland noted that federal product liability laws make it difficult to sue firearms makers. However, the ""bump stock"" maker was named, along with MGM Resorts, Live Nation and other defendants, in a series of 14 cases filed together Nov. 15 in Nevada state court in Las Vegas.

Now, they want Apple to hand over his iCloud data. The tight security of Apple phones is yet again an issue in a mass shooting. Devin Patrick Kelley walked into a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5 and began firing into the Sunday service. He killed 26 people and injured another 20 in the worst mass shooting in the state's history. Investigators searching his vehicle afterward found an Apple iPhone SE covered with blood stains. The Texas Rangers are trying to access his phone's data, and they've served Apple with a search warrant. According to court records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, the search warrant was granted on Nov. 9 for files stored locally on Kelley's phone, as well as any iCloud data that may exist on Apple's servers. It's unclear whether authorities have managed to retrieve any of Kelley's data yet. Apple's policy on law enforcement requests for data is that it ""will only provide content in response to a search warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause."" The company previously faced conflict with the FBI over requests to unlock a phone belonging to one of the attackers in a 2015 mass shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Investigators were eventually able to access that phone's data without Apple's help. An Apple spokesperson told CNET on Monday that the company does not comment on law enforcement matters but added that aside from the warrant, the company has yet to receive any request from law enforcement for technical assistance with the device. On Nov. 8, Apple said it had contacted the FBI. ""We were shocked and saddened by the violence in Texas...and we join the world in grieving for the families and community that lost so many loved ones,"" Apple said in a statement on Nov. 8. ""Our team immediately reached out to the FBI after learning ... that investigators were trying to access a mobile phone.

393,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/opinion/sunday/christians-support-gun-control.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by Opinion By Richard Parker SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — Here in rural Texas, the hay, baled and rolled, waits for winter. The corn is shorn and the stiff yucca stands guard in the dusk. I know this country; it is a short drive from my home, past places like the Devil’s Backbone and Purgatory to skinny Cibolo Creek, choked by mesquite and live oak. In Sutherland Springs, a family of five trudges in front of me in the headlights, past the police cordon, shuffling, heads down, apparently headed home. They call it God’s country, partly for its beauty, partly because it sometimes feels like God is the only thing out here. As in many small Texas towns, the center of Sutherland Springs is the church. And if anything stands out about the worst mass murder in the history of Texas, which took place here last Sunday, killing 26 and wounding at least 20, it is this: a simple, white wooden sanctuary with the peaked roof, next to an unkempt field by a lonesome two-lane road. Now they are going to tear it down, bulldozing it from the South Texas plain, as if doing so could remove the sacrilege of killing defenseless people during a Sunday sermon. This is what America’s response to mass homicide has come to. We don’t remove the killing machines that have put tens of thousands of Americans in their graves or hospital beds in this century, but we do demolish the First Baptist Church that has stood at this lonely crossroad for nearly a century. It is this doomed site, rooted in the black soil, that cries out for people of faith to act. The killer, Devin Patrick Kelley, used his Ruger AR-556, with 15 30-round magazines, to shoot nearly 50 helpless, trapped people. The weapon is a variant of the AR-15, itself barely distinguishable from the M-16, the American military’s standard-issue infantry weapon. These, along with handguns, are the weapons of choice for today’s mass killers. I won’t pretend to be more religious than the next person, nor am I afraid to call myself a Christian. Like a lot of Americans, I have a complicated relationship with my faith. But that shouldn’t lessen our sense of moral obligation in the face of what some blithely call the new normal. Nor should we fall for the siren call of more guns, the unproven good-guy-with-a-gun myth, something many of my fellow Texans have indulged in over the past few days. Instead, we have a duty to confront these machines and the profiteering behind them. It is easy to feel numb, powerless and hopeless. For the dead, one can only grimace at that last moment of fear. For the survivors and their beloved, a harsh sentence awaits. First, there is the trauma, like an amputation, something C. S. Lewis wrote about after the death of his wife, Joy Davidman, in 1960. “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid,” Lewis, a member of the Anglican Church, wrote in the slender and tortured memoir “A Grief Observed.” “The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.” When traumatic death strikes, the most common question is, “Why?” The second most common question is invariably, “Where was God?” But the last and most troubling of all is, “What does God want?” It is the same cry that Jesus let out from the cross as darkness spread across the land: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” I won’t pretend to know the mind of God, so all I can offer is a simple guess at what he would say: Stop the killing. Of course killing will never end, completely; we are imperfect creatures of free will, prone to sin — the absence of good — as well as beauty. But that is categorically different from allowing the proliferation of machines solely designed to kill large numbers of people quickly, machines that bear no more semblance to a rifle than a nuclear weapon does to a firework. And the sin of omission — doing nothing — is nearly as bad as the murder itself. In recent years, time after time, the AR-15 or one of its close cousins has played the starring role in an American mass shooting. In Las Vegas it shared a macabre double-billing with the semiautomatic version of the Russian AK-47. Chattanooga. Orlando. San Bernardino. Aurora. These two and the like are nearly always there. And there is a reason. Because of the weapons’ quasi-military design, even an unskilled hand can pull the trigger 40 times in a minute. A typical hunting rifle will hold several rounds. A typical AR-15 magazine holds 30. There are at least five million AR-15-type weapons in this nation alone. Sturm, Ruger & Company, the Connecticut company that made the weapon used here, reported $664 million in net sales last year. Here in Texas, the politicians have come and gone, visiting Sutherland Springs on a raw, rainy Wednesday night, making empty calls for prayers and excuses for inaction, as when Vice President Mike Pence awkwardly intoned, “Words fail when saints and heroes fall.” Indeed, they do. The words, bereft of real meaning, just blow away into the cold north wind. He appears to forget his purportedly deep religiosity. Christianity demands action. It insists on the protection of the innocent. In the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas justified war in self-defense, but he also opposed the killing of innocent civilians. “Aquinas holds that causing the death of innocents in a foreseeable manner, whether intentionally or indirectly,” according to the Cambridge divinity scholar Daniel H. Weiss, “is never justified.” And yet Christian evangelicals, particularly white Southern Baptists, have generally parted ways with Catholics on gun laws. Some are simply politically opposed to gun control because they are Republicans; others understandably distrust a society that does not seem to embrace God. But that opposition is crumbling. While six in 10 evangelical leaders report living in a household with a gun, nearly as many, 55 percent, favor stricter gun laws, according to an August survey by the National Association of Evangelicals. “They accept the Second Amendment,” said Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals when the survey results were released. But they “also deeply grieve when weapons are used to take innocent lives.” The same is true in Texas. Though some 37.5 percent of Texans own guns, according to an estimate by the Pew Research Center, tiny fissures have opened up in the state’s conservative political culture since the massacre here. Jason Villalba of Dallas, a prominent Republican state legislator, has called on the state’s political leadership to appoint a bipartisan commission to “focus on all possible causes of gun violence in Texas.” At first, this might sound like a political dodge, but Mr. Villalba wants new gun restrictions on the table: “There needs to be common-sense gun control reform in Texas.” The Dallas Morning News, the state’s largest newspaper, quickly endorsed the plan: “Our goals ought to be simple. The most deadly kind of weapons should be harder to get.” All the people of the Abrahamic faiths share the same duty — to protect the innocent. The Jewish bystander is to rescue a person in peril. Islam requires the protection of all innocent lives. I fear that if we fail in this, bulldoze our churches and let the machines of war and profit win over faith, then God will never forgive us. For that would be the worst sin of all. Advertisement",2017-11-11 14:30:01,Opinion: Why Christians Must Support Gun Control,,1,http://nytimes.com
394,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2017/11/20/after-sutherland-springs-use-the-second-amendment-to-prevent-mass-gun-violence/,"A procession of hearses pass along a country road to a graveside service for members of the Holcombe... [+] family who were killed in the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church shooting, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Since Orlando we’ve experienced multiple mass shootings. Las Vegas was the most horrendous such incident in modern America. Sutherland Springs is merely the most recent and, unless we act decisively, surely not the last. The only thing I find more frightening than those mass shootings is how quickly they disappear from the national consciousness. Simply ignoring this problem is unacceptable. Sending prayers to the families of the victims is surely not enough. After the mass shooting in Orlando I wrote a column, After Orlando, Let’s Require Gun Owners To Join The National Guard, pointing out that Switzerland has a gun culture that rivals that of America’s, yet with an order of magnitude less gun violence. This column explained how, by taking the Second Amendment to the Constitution seriously and in full we can dramatically reduce gun violence while impeccably respecting the Bill of Rights. I’m a Constitution nut. A solution lies hidden in plain sight right in the Second Amendment: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The militias now, by and large, are subsumed into the National Guard. The Guard is a very well-regulated militia indeed. Without doing any violence to the letter or spirit of the Constitution, it is entirely possible to make gun ownership contingent upon membership in the Guard or other legally recognized state militia. If done in full good faith -- with NRA officials given seats at the table -- this will appeal to the right (which has high respect for our military and for service) and will be at least palatable to the fair-minded left. … As reported in Time Magazine in a 2012 article, The Swiss Difference: A Gun Culture That Works: “Even as the gun-control debate rises again in the U.S. in the aftermath of the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the gun-loving Swiss are not about to lay down their arms. Guns are ubiquitous in this neutral nation, with sharpshooting considered a fun and wholesome recreational activity for people of all ages. “Even though Switzerland has not been involved in an armed conflict since a standoff between Catholics and Protestants in 1847, the Swiss are very serious not only about their right to own weapons but also to carry them around in public. Because of this general acceptance and even pride in gun ownership, nobody bats an eye at the sight of a civilian riding a bus, bike or motorcycle to the shooting range, with a rifle slung across the shoulder. … “Switzerland trails behind only the U.S, Yemen and Serbia in the number of guns per capita; between 2.3 million and 4.5 million military and private firearms are estimated to be in circulation in a country of only 8 million people. Yet, despite the prevalence of guns, the violent-crime rate is low: government figures show about 0.5 gun homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. By comparison, the U.S rate in the same year was about 5 firearm killings per 100,000 people, according to a 2011 U.N. report.” Think about it. Switzerland rivals the United States in gun ownership yet experiences only one-tenth of the gun violence. How can this be? It is because the Swiss celebrate gun ownership as a patriotic duty and conjoin it with high gun responsibility. What does this mean for us? Control gun violence by respecting the Second Amendment, including its first thirteen words. Despite drawing 34,000 readers, that heterodox column had no notable policy impact. The NRA is opposed to almost anything that represents restrictions on gun ownership. Many professional gun control advocates appear to believe that eventually mass shootings will shift popular sentiment toward incremental, then rigorous, gun control. Many leaders from both sides are engaged in dogmatic Virtue Signaling rather than Constitutionally rigorous, classically liberal, civic engagement. Time to return to first principles. In this case: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” I do not fetishize the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. I respect them not out of sentimentality. They are fully deserving of respect. The Constitution’s authors were political geniuses. Statesmen of historic stature. We depart from their shrewd insights at our peril. The debates around gun ownership at the founding of the United States make it clear that the founders were not trying to protect the rights of deer hunters, much less Big Game hunters whose idea of a good time is to slaughter some innocent elephant. Based on their experience in the American Revolutionary War, they wanted an armed citizenry as a bulwark against tyranny. As nicely summarized at the Lectlaw.com. As Noah Webster put it in a pamphlet urging ratification of the Constitution, ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe."" George Mason remarked to his Virginia delegates regarding the colonies' recent experience with Britain, in which the Monarch's goal had been ""to disarm the people; that [that] . . . was the best and most effectual way to enslave them."" A widely reprinted article by Tench Coxe, an ally and correspondent of James Madison, described the Second Amendment's overriding goal as a check upon the national government's standing army: As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms. Thus, the well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state was a militia that might someday fight against a standing army raised and supported by a tyrannical national government. How do we dramatically reduce the level of gun violence without doing violence to the Bill of Rights? Take seriously the full text and purpose, including the first, explanatory, clause of the Second Amendment. What does a well regulated Militia look like? Back to TIME: …Switzerland’s gun ownership is deeply rooted in a sense of patriotic duty and national identity. Weapons are kept at home because of the long-held belief that enemies could invade tiny Switzerland quickly, so every soldier had to be able to fight his way to his regiment’s assembly point. (Switzerland was at risk of being invaded by Germany during World War II but was spared, historians say, because every Swiss man was armed and trained to shoot.) TIME later wrongfully asserts that “the Swiss mentality can’t be transposed to the current American reality.” That is preposterous and betrays a smug denigration. Cultivating a “culture of responsibility and safety that is anchored in society” is custom tailored to America. Let's embrace it and inculcate it rather than persist in the political warfare between those who advocate gun ownership repression and those who prefer gun anarchy. The right to keep and bear arms also entails a civic duty. What to do? The state militias have been largely subsumed into the National Guard. I propose that we open the National Guard to auxiliary members who meet its standards for moral and psychological rectitude, making membership a predicate for gun ownership. That will screen out those who the Founders would not have tolerated in the State militias of their day. Doing this also would ensure that gun owners receive training, and even a modest degree of drilling, and be subject to inspection to ensure their compliance with Guard regulations. Done with integrity it would exalt, not degrade, the clear purpose of the Second Amendment. I myself am a gun owner. Based upon my informal polling of other rank-and-file gun owners, this proposition could be palatable, even welcome, if carried out in good faith. Gun owners trend patriotic and, moreover, respectful toward the Armed Services. To be required to join the Guard, on reasonable terms, would be more of an honor than onerous. There will be plenty of specifics to argue about. As Van der Rohe once observed, “God is in the details.” The National Guard is under the joint authority of the state governors and the president. And the contingency of federal control is something that needs, and deserves, to be very carefully considered and even constrained for the spirit of the Second Amendment to be fully honored. The NRA certainly will, as it should, be militant at helping to shape the specifics of what “well regulated” should look like and prevent this from turning into a pretext for disarming the American people. And the left, rather than hoping for a turn in the tide of public sentiment in favor of plenary gun control, will  then assuredly stand up for reasonable standards that will be effective without trampling a Constitutional right. “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” I am the editor-in-chief of the Committee To Unleash Prosperity's Supply Side Blog; founder of the Prosperity Caucus, and, with Charles Kadlec, co-editor of the Laissez… I am the editor-in-chief of the Committee To Unleash Prosperity's Supply Side Blog; founder of the Prosperity Caucus, and, with Charles Kadlec, co-editor of the Laissez Faire Books edition of Copernicus's Essay on Money.

395,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/insider/sutherland-springs-shooting-media-frenzy-adding-to-towns-pain.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&_r=1,"Advertisement Supported by By Simon Romero SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — It wasn’t the television presenters elbowing their way to the front of the scrum near the massacre scene that finally drove home how the news media was aggravating the tragedy here. It wasn’t the run on food at Theresa’s Kitchen or the point at which the number of journalists seemed to rival the few hundred souls of the town’s population. It was the scene in Rosanne Solis’ living room. Ms. Solis, 57, a former factory worker who was shot in the shoulder when a gunman killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church last week, had agreed to an interview with The New York Times. Through fatigue and pain, she described in detail the trauma of surviving one of the most hideous mass shootings in United States history. As I got up and thanked Ms. Solis for her graciousness at such a strenuous time, the door to her trailer home swung open and a swarm of other journalists rushed inside. Without asking permission, a photographer began taking pictures a few inches from Ms. Solis’ face. A television crew insisted on an interview as she tended her wound. “Please, no, I’m just too tired,” Ms. Solis told them. But as I went to my rental car to file my story, no one seemed to heed her plea that she was too exhausted to talk. Sitting behind the wheel, I gazed at the horizon and wondered what those of us documenting this tragedy were doing to this poor town. I’ve covered gruesome events around the world — earthquakes, hurricanes, fires. But none of those experiences prepared me for the media maelstrom in Sutherland Springs, a tiny, poverty-stricken town hit by the unimaginable slaughter of babies, children and adults in one of its houses of worship. Ignoring such shootings, or passively accepting how widespread and devastating they are becoming, cannot be an option. But there may also be something terribly wrong with the spectacle of covering this bloodshed. By now, some of my colleagues are veteran chroniclers of such shootings, grimly bumping into one another with gallows humor over the past few years in Las Vegas; Colorado Springs; San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Orlando, Fla. Perhaps because of the small size of Sutherland Springs, the ungainliness of the media’s rush to cover the latest shooting touched a nerve here. As satellite trucks staked out coveted parking spots and broadcasters from around the world described the town’s horrors in German or Russian or Portuguese, tempers flared. Some residents in the town simply slammed doors in journalists’ faces, a reaction any of us might have had under such circumstances. Others in the town put a price on their cooperation. Reporters from a wide array of organizations scrambled to interview anyone else they could find. “Eventually the media pressure began to weigh even on me,” Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote in an eloquent apology to the people of Sutherland Springs. “I did a few on-the-ground interviews before rejecting the rest. It was too stressful. I expressed my growing disgust with a few other journalists, and many agreed with me.” Journalists were not the only ones who descended on the town. Sidewalk preachers from San Antonio convened at the Valero gas station opposite the church, bellowing their prayers, if not in front of townspeople then for reporters’ iPhone cameras. Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team meandered through the town. Brad Kessler, an aspirant for mayor of San Antonio, dropped in to shake hands around the yellow crime-scene tape that cordoned off the killing field. The Homicide Survivors Support Group of Corpus Christi set up a table with stuffed animals, where reporters quickly conducted interviews with the volunteers. I grew up in a rural outpost in northern New Mexico about the size of Sutherland Springs. I know how suspicious, and sometimes awed, residents of small towns can be of privileged, big-city visitors. Still, I have a hard time imagining what it’s like for the people here to have so many cameras pointed at them and so many tape recorders thrust their way. As some of the network television trucks began to pull out of town, I wondered how big a role I myself had played in amplifying the suffering of Sutherland Springs. After all, I, too, had approached residents who wanted nothing to do with reporters. I’d asked Ms. Solis, the factory worker, to talk to me when she could have been tending the shoulder where a bullet had sundered her flesh. When the country endures one mass shooting after another, why they happen certainly ought to be the main focus of the national conversation. But maybe it’s time we also discuss how they’re covered on the ground. For now, I’m left wondering what happens next in Sutherland Springs. Bertha Cardenas-Lomas, 57, the head of the town’s cemetery board, seemed to be in shock as I interviewed her, expressing dismay over all the friends and neighbors she now has to bury. She touched on what it’s like to face a barrage of interview requests when she’s struggling to simply mow the grass on the burial ground. “No one can ever be prepared to find their way in this situation,” she said, holding her head in her hands. “I’m afraid that the real pain, the reality of this violence, will set in when all of you are gone.” Advertisement",2017-11-13 07:00:00,"Covering a Mass Shooting, and Adding to a Town’s Pain",,1,http://nytimes.com

Roy McClellan was killed in a hit-and-run accident Nov. 17 in southern Nevada (Facebook/Denise McClellan) A man who survived the Oct. 1 mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas was killed last week in a hit-and-run in southern Nevada. Roy McClellan died Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on State Route 160 in Pahrump, about 50 miles west of Las Vegas. ""I don't understand why he wasn't taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way,"" McClellan's wife, Denise, told KSNV. ""I hope my husband found peace and he's safe now."" Jonathan Hunt shares and update on the investigation. The McClellans were attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip when Stephen Paddock began shooting from his 32nd-floor suite at the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel-casino. In all, 58 people were killed and more than 500 were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Denise McClellan told KSNV that the shooting ""was really messing with [Roy's] head and he was going to therapy."" On Friday, Denise posted on Facebook that Roy had ""stormed off"" after a fight with a friend the night before he died. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people in deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. KSNV reported that investigators had located the car believed to be involved in the accident and charges were pending. A GoFundMe to support McClellan's family had raised $1,640 as of Saturday evening. Click for more from News3LV.com.

Millions of dollars in donations have poured in for the victims of the mass shooting at a Las Vegas country music festival, leaving local officials and national experts to sort how to fairly and quickly distribute the money. An online fundraiser launched hours after the Oct. 1 shooting has topped $10 million, and millions more have been collected by nonprofits, businesses and others. Donation amounts have ranged from $5 and $10 anonymous contributions to a $3 million gift from the MGM Resorts International, the owner of the concert venue and the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, where the gunman perched from a 32nd floor suite and sprayed gunfire onto the crowd. A new nonprofit group, working with local officials and experts who have helped distribute funds after other tragedies, is finalizing a plan to determine who will get money and how. Questions and answers about the donations: WHO IS OVERSEEING THE DONATIONS? The Las Vegas Victims' Fund is the nonprofit created to oversee the money. It is overseen by a 16-person committee headed by Scott Nielson, president of a consulting firm and former executive at Station Casinos. Other members include representatives from local law enforcement, victim advocates and business leaders. The National Compassion Fund and Ken Feinberg, who helped administer claims after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and other mass shootings and tragedies, are helping. The committee on Thursday released a draft plan for distributing funds and plans to take public comments on the proposal until Dec. 8. ___ WHAT'S BEEN RAISED? About $15 million has been raised so far, with donations still flowing in. A GoFundMe page started by Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has collected about $11.5 million. Several more million dollars have been collected by the Direct Impact Fund, a nonprofit affiliated with GoFundMe, and the National Compassion Fund, which was created by victims and families of mass casualty events like 9/11 and the Columbine school shootings. Nielson said the committee's goal is to combine that with money raised by private business and other groups. ___ WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR DONATIONS? Under the draft plan, donations would be distributed to relatives of the 58 people killed and to the hundreds hospitalized with injuries. The most money would go to relatives of those killed or victims whose injuries left them with permanent brain damage or paralysis, requiring constant home care. Under the current proposal, the rest of the injured would be eligible to receive money if they were admitted to a hospital within two days of the shooting and stayed at least one night. Those hospitalized longer would get more money. ___ HOW DO VICTIMS GET MONEY? Victims or their relatives must submit claims by Jan. 31, 2018. Fund officials would verify information about injuries and deaths with hospitals, the FBI and others. Fund officials would start deciding how much recipients would get in March and begin distributing money on March 5. ___ HOW CAN VICTIMS USE THE MONEY? Victims would receive lump sums to use however they want, Feinberg and Nielson said. ""You're not trying to pay for somebody's medical expenses or for their economic loss,"" Neilson said. ""This is just basically dividing up a gift that's been made."" ___ WILL IT BE ENOUGH? ""It won't be enough,"" Sisolak said Tuesday. ""We've got a huge number of victims, more than any other of these incidents. You're never going to possibly come up with the funds that could compare."" The victims' fund in Boston gave away about $80 million, with the families of the three people killed each receiving more than $2 million. More than 260 others who were injured received amounts between $12,500 to $3.3 million. In Orlando, about $32 million was raised. Each of the estates of the 49 who were killed received about $350,000, while more than 60 injured received amounts ranging from $35,000 to 300,000. About 180 others who were in the nightclub but uninjured in the shooting received about $25,000 each. ___ WHAT OTHER HELP ARE VICTIMS GETTING? Some victims and their families have started their own fundraising campaigns to help cover medical costs and other bills. Victims can also seek help from Nevada's state-run Victims of Crime Program, where they can be reimbursed for medical bills, funeral expenses and counseling. California, where a number of the victims were from, is also providing help through its crime victims' fund. Additionally, a number of local businesses have offered help, including at least one hospital chain that is not charging patients for the medical costs they incurred. Mental health clinics and dental and plastic surgery practices have also announced free services for those who suffered injuries in the attack. ___ Follow Price on Twitter at https://twitter.com/michellelprice .

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) Las Vegas plans to post police snipers on rooftops during Sunday’s marathon in the aftermath of the Oct. 1 mass shooting at a country musical festival. LVPD says the beefed-up security plan for the event also includes assigning more cops to protect runners as they pass by world famous high-rise casino-hotels and the crime scene. About 350 cops will be on hand. ""We've made a few changes, some subtle things,"" Capt. Andrew Walsh said. ""Obviously, the threat of a sniper attack is something that we know can happen. So, we added some counter-sniper surveillance posts along the route."" Organizers have urged the runners to wear their Vegas Strong gear. Tens of thousands of runners are expected to participate.

      (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) A high-stakes gambler and real estate investor killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after shattering the windows of his hotel suite and unleashing gunfire on the Route 91 Harvest music festival below. From the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel, Stephen Paddock had an unobstructed view to rain bullets on the crowd, who had few places to hide. A police helicopter will circle runners the route of the marathon which gets underway just before sunset Sunday. Semi-trucks, dump trucks, buses and other large city vehicles will be positioned at key intersections to try to prevent anyone from driving onto the course, Walsh said, following recent attacks in the U.S. and abroad in which vehicles have plowed into crowds. Walsh acknowledged the event presents a huge challenge to police and encouraged casino employees, visitors and others to alert authorities of anything suspicious. Security checkpoints will be set up for the Sunday races — a marathon, half marathon and 10K — and a Saturday 5K and concert. ""With all the things that we've seen happen in the world, whether it's in Texas at a church, whether it is in New York City on a bike path, or whether it's here at a concert, the vulnerabilities that exist and try to predict and prevent each and every one of those is a tremendous challenge,"" Walsh said. Organizers moved events away from the scene of the massacre. The concert, typically held at the outdoor venue where the shooting took place, was shifted miles north, across from the SLS hotel. The start of the marathon, usually outside Mandalay Bay, was moved a mile north to the front of the New York-New York casino-hotel. The race has always featured live bands every mile, but on Sunday, the first 2½ miles — when runners will go by the crime scene twice — will be silent. Spokesman Dan Cruz said that will serve as an extended moment of silence. ""Running the marathon symbolizes miles of grit, determination; these are driven athletes, who know all about adversity,"" he said. ""So, for them, it's the perfect event to help Las Vegas bounce back."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

          / CBS News Before the suspect in Sunday's deadly mass shooting at a Texas church fled a mental health facility in 2012, he allegedly told other patients being treated at the hospital he'd ordered guns online, according to police documents obtained by CBS affiliate KENS. Devin Patrick Kelley: What we know about the Texas church shooting suspect Devin Kelley was sent to the Peak Behavioral Health Services Center in Santa Teresa, New Mexico after multiple incidents between June 2011 and April 2012 in which he beat his wife and stepson, who suffered a fractured skull in one incident. He escaped on June 13, 2012 with his wallet and credit card, according to the documents. Kelley, who was listed at the facility as a high-risk patient — a danger to himself and to others — told other patients that he ordered guns online about 48 to 72 hours before he fled the facility, according to the documents. Police were notified through a 911 call at 10:49 p.m. that night that Kelley was missing. He was found at an El Paso bus station, just over an hour and a half later, at 12:30 in the morning. While Kelley was missing, 911 dispatchers alerted officials at Hollaman Air Force Base, where Kelley was stationed, that he escaped. Texas church shooting victims: Pregnant mother, children among lives lost An El Paso Police Department report from the incident warned that Kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms"" onto the base, where he ""was attempting to carry out death threats that (he) had made on his military chain of command."" El Paso police arrested Kelley without incident at a bus stop and turned him over to New Mexico police. Kelley was sentenced about five months later, on November 7, 2012 for the assaults on his wife and child, and was ordered to serve a year in confinement. In 2014, Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, which was supposed to notify the FBI of his domestic violence conviction. Kelley should have been barred from buying the weapons used in Sunday's shooting, federal officials say. The Air Force acknowledged Monday that it failed to flag Kelley as banned from buying firearms. The Air Force said it has launched a review of how the service handled Kelley's criminal records. Texas authorities say Kelley did not have a license to carry firearms. However, Kelley purchased four weapons in total during the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Two were bought in Colorado and two in Texas, ATF officials said. Three weapons were recovered at the scene of the shooting -- a Ruger AR-556 rifle found at the church, and two handguns, a Glock 9mm and a Ruger 22, found in his car, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF Houston. In a statement to CBS News, Peak Behavioral Health said it would not confirm whether Kelley was a patient at the facility, citing federal and state law, as well as the company's policies. ""Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrible act and their families and friends, and like everyone else in Texas, we are doing everything we can to help the community in recovering and healing from this tragedy,"" the company said.

AP Photo/John Locher Tragedy Should Redouble – Not Dilute – Your Focus in Community It seems that nearly every week now, we wake to morning news of some devastating tragedy somewhere in the world, and often very close to home. There are the natural disasters like hurricanes and fires, and the manmade ones, like the recent mass shootings in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and in Egypt. When these tragedies unfold, we want to respond. We feel an instinctive pull to drop everything and run to the aid of our fellow human beings. If we were in close proximity, we might well grab a bucket to bail water or squelch flames, take in those needing shelter, provide aid to the injured, or even – as was the case in Texas – chase away those doing evil. And when we read about tragedies that are hundreds of miles or even oceans away from us, we still want to respond, and do so with our gifts of money, prayers, and conversations with those around us about what might be done to provide relief, help rebuild, and prevent future catastrophe. These are natural and noble responses. But they can also distract us from the tragedies that unfold daily in our own communities. Their physical distance from us can lead us to overlook the nearby occurrences that apply to our own work. The shooters in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, and the terrorist attackers at an Egyptian mosque got our attention because of the scale of their assaults and the many people who lost lives. Yet people lose their lives to gun violence in our own communities more often than we notice. Chicago recorded over 600 homicides by mid-November of this year, for example. But the loss of one or two local lives to violence is no less of a tragedy or a mental health issue than the loss of multiple lives far away. If we care about gun violence that happens in other communities, then we must care about it in our own and maintain a focus on what we can do right here, right now. The hurricanes and fires that devastated so many homes and lives at either end of the country are likely tied to our changing climate. And that climate is changing in the heartland of America just as it is on the coasts. Therefore, addressing the issue at home in, say, Omaha, Nebraska is just as important as it is in Sonoma County, California or in Houston, Texas. In addition, there are those in our communities who are devastated by loss of homes for myriad reasons, some having to do with those forces of nature and others the forces of social policies, economy or simply neglect. How do we respond to – or better yet work to prevent – those tragedies? This isn’t to say we shouldn’t lend our aid in any way possible to those in need across the country or around the world.

403,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/505159542/0/phoenix/local~Las-Vegas-shooting-Patients-went-to-wrong-hospital-as-misinformation-spread/,"LAS VEGAS — They found the couple sprawled across the warm asphalt outside the Route 91 Harvest festival. Blood seeped from bullet wounds, his near an elbow, hers on the head. Panicked concertgoers streamed past them. David Hendrickson, an EMT who attended the Oct. 1 concert, stopped and knelt beside the couple. The woman was growing woozy. Blood soaked through the shirt tied around her head. Hendrickson tightened it, and then took off his own shirt and tied it around the man’s arm. “We need to get these guys to the hospital,” Hendrickson told his girlfriend, Michelle Wolters. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. The four climbed into Wolters’ Mercedes. Blood seeped into the leather seats. Hendrickson started the car and inched through the crowd near Mandalay Bay. They had driven in from California and nobody in the car knew the local hospitals, so Wolters pulled out her iPhone. With shaking fingers, she typed in ""Vegas hospital."" Sunrise Hospital appeared at the top of the list. “All right,” Hendrickson said, “we’re gonna go there.” They had no way to know that Sunrise would soon become overwhelmed with patients, with every gurney full and ""red-tag"" triage patients waiting for care. At the same time, the county’s most comprehensive trauma center, University Medical Center, barely three miles away, was preparing itself for victims who never arrived. Metropolitan Las Vegas has a trauma response plan designed to send manageable numbers of patients to each hospital. The plan dictates which injuries must be treated at a trauma center and which ones can go to a regular hospital. It splits Clark County into three areas and assigns each one a trauma center where patients should be taken. The Route 91 Harvest festival stage was at a location designated for UMC. But in the hours after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, that plan became impossible to follow. MORE: The 58 victims of the Las Vas shooting Bystanders like Hendrickson and Wolters loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the first hospital they could find, bypassing the county's transport system entirely. Confusion and rumors swirled, partly because the county lacks the central communications system that emergency planners called for in 2009. That resulted in an uneven rush of patients into hospitals all over Clark County. Sunrise, a Level II trauma center, treated 199 patients in a few hours. UMC, Nevada’s only Level I trauma center and the hospital President Donald Trump visited after the massacre, took 104 patients. A handful of UMC's beds remained empty as rumors it had closed it doors spread through the county. Hundreds more patients filtered into smaller hospitals. “Some places got hit hard,” said UMC trauma director Dr. John Fildes. “But that’s what happens when 500 people went down.” City, county and hospital officials insist their response to the shooting went as smoothly as possible. “From an emergency response perspective, the event was very professionally managed,” Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said in a statement. No complaints have been filed with the state’s health department, and a spokeswoman for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health said she was not aware of any complaints about the emergency response. “If it’s a problem, it needs to be addressed,” said John Hammond, the EMS and trauma system manager for the Southern Nevada Health District, about the imbalance of patients at hospitals. “But I don’t know if it’s a problem.” Among the unanswerable questions from a night of terror is whether the Level I trauma center should have received more patients, potentially spreading the work more evenly among over-burdened emergency workers. The drop in care from a Level I to a Level II trauma center is minimal, experts say, and often disputed. Nationwide studies of their treatment have given mixed results. Some research shows that more people die at Level II centers, which aren’t required to have as many specialists or treat as many patients annually as top-tier centers. Other research shows more people die at Level I centers, because those places receive the patients closest to death. It’s impossible to know if the confusion caused any patients to receive lesser treatment. But it at least created disparate levels of chaos at the region’s two largest trauma centers. At Sunrise, the flow of patients seemed never to stop. Staff, space and resources ran thin. The hospital used up its entire supply of universally compatible O-negative blood, and at least one ER doctor said he worked until his brain couldn’t process charts anymore. Every gurney and wheelchair in the hospital held a patient. Some patients waited on the floor. Others with minor injuries walked out, not wanting to take up time or resources that could be used on more critical patients. A few miles away, UMC’s trauma director wondered where the rest of the patients were. Around 1:45 a.m., Fildes counted nine empty trauma bays. Three operating rooms sat open. Even two months after the shooting, nobody has determined exactly why patients stopped arriving at UMC. But in the immediate aftermath, rumors spread by word of mouth and on social media that UMC had closed its doors. Multiple emergency workers and hospital staffers told The Arizona Republic they heard, at some point during the evening, that UMC had stopped taking patients. Representatives of two ambulance companies heard it. Two Sunrise staffers said they heard it. Two medics working at the concert venue received texts about it. None of those people could identify the source of the rumor. ""So many injuries that UMC hospital having to divert to other hospitals,"" Las Vegas blogger Christy Oldenkamp wrote on Twitter. Other accounts tweeted similar rumors. It wasn’t true. UMC didn’t close, and nothing similar appears in an audio recording of Clark County Fire Department dispatchers in the first hour after the shooting. Fildes, the UMC trauma director, recalled telling somebody at Sunrise that he had room to take their excess patients. He remembered asking for them to come three at a time, so his teams could focus on the most critical patients. In an email, Fildes said he couldn't remember how many more arrived. The Southern Nevada Health District’s trauma plan, last updated in February 2015, dictates that a patient must be taken to a trauma center if he or she has certain injuries, including a “penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso or the extremities proximal to the elbow or knee.” It then divides Clark County into three segments: Trauma patients injured in an eastern area should be taken to Sunrise, which is northeast of the Strip. Patients in an area to the south should go to St. Rose Dominican Hospital, Siena Campus, in nearby Henderson. Patients found anywhere else in the county go to UMC, which is northwest of the Strip. The Route 91 concert stage was in a part of the county for which UMC was responsible. The plan allows for exceptions if bad traffic or dangerous weather make the designated hospital too difficult to reach in time. It's designed to make first responders, ambulance drivers and other emergency personnel work in unison, all following the same strategy to move people to hospitals. It does not mention how to handle a mass of gunshot victims being transported in pickup trucks and strangers’ backseats. So when it came time for the plan to be implemented, confusion ruled the moments after the shooting. Emergency responders weren’t sure if it was safe to head toward the festival grounds. False reports of multiple shooters circulated. One man on the Clark County Fire Department dispatch radio kept repeating reports of a man in Army fatigues climbing into a van. Through it all, audio recordings obtained by The Arizona Republic show, the dispatch feed flooded with requests for ambulances. “The ambulances do not have enough units to transfer all the gunshot wounds,” one responder reported. “We are out of ambulances and we still have a couple more criticals,” said another. “Chief, we’re currently loading patients into private vehicles. We have no more ambulances,” still another said. “We’re getting pickup trucks full of patients coming in."" In 2009, a study of the region's trauma plan concluded that Clark County needed a centralized communications center to handle emergency situations, rather than relying on a patchwork system of dispatchers and hospitals. That center was never created. “We’ve been trying to fix that problem for a while,” the health district's Hammond said recently, noting that the initial set-up of a system could cost upward of $1 million. “Not just for large events, but for everyday movement of patients within the system, a centralized system would be better.” The streets were jammed when Hendrickson pulled his girlfriend’s car off the Strip. He and Wolters tried to introduce themselves to the strange couple in their backseat, searching for some way into a conversation. The man said his name was David, too. That was a start. He introduced his girlfriend as Stephanie. Her alertness started to fade. They reached a red light. Hendrickson blew through it. A truck filled with bleeding people sped past them, clambering over the median and through a turn lane. A six-mile drive took 10 minutes.

Hospital staff had filled the ambulance bays with as many wheelchairs and gurneys as they could find. An ER doctor and nurses worked in a hurried quiet. A small group crowded around the Mercedes. “Backseat,” Hendrickson told them. He and Wolters watched as nurses pulled out the couple and helped them onto gurneys. Then they disappeared into the crowded hospital. ""We’ve been trying to look for them and see if they’re OK,"" Wolters said recently. ""It does kind of bother us that we don’t know how they are.""

Is it going to be right before or right after this airs?'"" For it's seventh installment, Ryan Murphy's ""American Horror Story"" traded in supernatural elements for more grounded storylines that tapped into the audience's real-life fears. To do so, the FX horror-anthology used the divisive 2016 presidential election as a jumping-off point, a decision that had some skeptics rolling their eyes. After all, the season premiered less than a year after the events it depicted, events that were already being rehashed in politics and media on a daily basis. Leslie Grossman, who joined ""AHS"" this season as Meadow Wilton, admits that people were ""concerned"" when Murphy first announced his intentions to tackle the election directly. But in an interview with TheWrap's Stuart Brazell, the actress said that to focus on that element of the season misses the point.

""But I think the real overarching theme is fear, and how fear can be used to manipulate and control people, and how you can let fear change who you are if you give into it."" And that's not the only time ""Cult"" found itself depicting a real-life event. However, the second time wasn't intentional. Grossman's character was at the center of a public shooting in an episode that aired just a few days after the shooting in Las Vegas left 58 people (plus the shooter) dead and more than 500 injured. The episode was re-cut for air, though the original versions are still available for viewing online.

408,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-guns-mass-shootings-hoax-conspiracy-theories?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark,"After mass shootings, survivors and victims’ families face a second round of attacks online – and fighting back is ‘like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter’ Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Mike Cronk was sitting half-naked on a street corner, hands covered in blood, when the TV news reporter approached. The 48-year-old, who had used his shirt to try to plug a bullet wound in his friend’s chest, recounted in a live interview how a young man he did not know had just died in his arms. Cronk’s story of surviving the worst mass shooting in modern US history went viral, but many people online weren’t calling him a hero. On YouTube, dozens of videos, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, claimed Cronk was an actor hired to play the part of a victim in the Las Vegas mass shooting on 1 October.  Conspiracy theorists harassed him on Facebook, sending messages like “How much did they pay you?” and “How does it feel to be part of a hoax?” The claims multiplied and soon YouTube’s algorithm began actively promoting the conspiracy theory. Two months later, Cronk’s online reputation appears damaged beyond repair. Type “Mike Cronk” into Google and YouTube, and the sites automatically suggest searches for “actor” and “fake”, leading to popular videos claiming he and his wounded friend were performers and that the Mandalay Bay tragedy that killed 58 people never happened. “It’s awful that we have to go through what we did and then you have a whole new level of attacks on you and who you are,” said Cronk, a retired teacher. “I don’t want negative stuff associated with my name, but how do we stop that?” As record-breaking mass shootings have become a ritual of life in the US, survivors and victims’ families across the country have increasingly faced an onslaught of social media abuse and viral slander. Bullying from the ugliest corners of the internet overwhelms the grief-stricken as they struggle to cope with the greatest horror they’ve ever experienced. The cycles of hoaxer harassment are now as predictable as mass shootings. And yet those with the most power to stop the spread of conspiracy theories have done little to address victims’ cries for help. Alison Parker was a television reporter who was shot dead by a disturbed former colleague during a routine morning broadcast. Her father, Andy Parker, first encountered the conspiracy theorists who believed her murder was a hoax on his YouTube page. Before the shooting, he had uploaded a selection of videos appropriate for a 62-year-old Virginia dad: kayaking footage, recordings of Alison’s dance recital, old commercials in which he appeared as a young actor in New York. Afterwards, strangers online had seized on his decades-old acting career as proof that his daughter’s August 2015 shooting had been staged and that Andy Parker had supposedly been hired to act the role of a grieving father. Commenters said he was part of a plot to trick the public into supporting gun control. “It was like a swarm of locusts,” he recalled. Andy quickly made his page private – but the hoax theorists did not go away. This spring, nearly two years after Alison’s death, as Andy’s wife, Barbara, was searching online for something related to the foundation they had set up to honor their daughter’s memory, she found something else. “The second thing that opened up on Google was a YouTube video that the foundation is just a scam for Andy Parker to make money, a complete hoax.” “I don’t care what they say about me,” Andy said, “but leave the foundation alone. Leave my daughter alone.” It didn’t take much searching for the father to find other YouTube videos. “There were pages, endless pages of stuff.” Posts about Alison’s murder that analyzed footage and photographs, asking why there was no visible blood from her being shot. Others claimed Alison was still alive, that she had had plastic surgery to change her appearance and was now living in Israel. Hoaxers said Andy’s “acting” in TV interviews was subpar. One video of the choked-up father talking about Alison had a caption floating above his forehead: “No tears!” More recently, Cori Langdon, a Las Vegas taxi driver who picked up survivors of the October massacre, became one of the prime targets for conspiracy theorists after she posted video from the scene. Her footage was stolen and republished across the internet and used as “proof” of a number of debunked claims, including the rumor that there was a second shooter. Violent threats quickly filled Langdon’s inbox and populated the comment sections on YouTube and Facebook. People called her “queen of cunts” and “one of the dumbest fucking idiots”.Others said she was “braindead”, “FAKE AS FUCK” and “fucking stupid!”, with one writing: “They should bring this cab driver in for questioning.” “I was a basket case, it was so overwhelming,” she said, recounting the first week after the shooting. One conspiracy theory surrounding Langdon was that she had been killed after the massacre as part of a cover-up. She tried to make light of it, hoping that if the trolls believed she were dead, they would leave her alone. But she recalled one friend telling her: “Somebody might try to kill you, Cori, so they can prove their conspiracy theories.” Meanwhile, Braden Matejka, who survived a gunshot to the head in Vegas, received such a high volume of online attacks and death threats from people calling him an “actor” that he had to close his Facebook account. One message said: “I hope someone truly shoots you.” Lenny Pozner, whose six-year-old son, Noah, was killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in December 2012, has faced some of the most vicious abuse and threats. This year, a woman was sentenced to prison for sending him violent threats, telling him on multiple occasions that death was coming “real soon”. Rob McIntosh, who survived a gunshot to the chest in Las Vegas, said he could not figure out the motives of anonymous users online accusing victims like him of lying: “I don’t know what the driving force behind people being like that is. I don’t understand.” There is no easy way to change the mind of a conspiracy theorist. Colleen Seifert, a University of Michigan psychology professor, said people were inclined to trust content they viewed on YouTube and might be drawn to mass shooting conspiracy theories simply because the tragedies were so implausible and frightening to them. “The idea that you could be innocently going to a concert and could be shot – you don’t want to believe that’s true. You’re protecting your own feeling of security and safety.” It’s unclear how much belief in conspiracy theories has changed over time. A study based on reader letters sent to two major newspapers between 1890 and 2010 found the percentage stayed flat. But in recent years, conspiracy theories have begun to spread at much faster rates online, and many different kinds of people believe them, said Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “It was always assumed that this is just a small group of lunatics,” he said. “We now know, because of representative samples in various countries, that this is really very widespread.” One recent survey suggested that more than half of Americans believe 9/11 conspiracy theories and that more than 40% support theories about alien encounters, global warming and John F Kennedy’s assassination. There is little research on the prevalence of the “crisis actor” theory – a belief that the government or other conspirators stage mass shootings – but the hoaxes now reliably populate social media within the first 24 hours of many shooting tragedies. “It’s typically very hard to discredit a conspiracy theory,” Van Prooijen said. “Anything people say that goes against a conspiracy theory can be seen as a sign that you are a part of the conspiracy theory.” When Langdon, the Vegas taxi driver, briefly took down her viral video from Facebook so she could remove identifying information about her passengers, some conspiracy theorists said it was proof that the FBI was trying to silence her and cover up the truth. “I’m a mainstream media gal. I don’t think the government is after me,” she said. “It just makes me sick.” It can be particularly upsetting to victims of conspiracy theories to discover that intelligent people – and even their own friends – believe hoaxes. Langdon said she learned that a mutual friend was duped by the fake news that she was murdered: “It made me realize, even in my own circle of friends and people I work with, there are people with some crazy imaginations.” Van Prooijen, a widely cited scholar on the subject, said one of his best friends was a conspiracy theorist. The professor hasn’t been able to change his views. Another reason it is so hard to challenge conspiracy theories is the threats and bullying that now arise from simply speaking up. One shooting victim who was subjected to an aggressive harassment campaign did not want to do an interview for fear of inviting further abuse. Journalists and academics are often spammed with hundreds of messages when they write about the subject. Some conspiracy theorists, however, change their tone when they are no longer writing to strangers on the internet. Amy Hallas, a 44-year-old Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, woman, sent dozens of Facebook messages to the family of Braden Matejka, the Vegas victim who survived a gunshot in the head, accusing them of being liars and demanding proof of his injuries. Criticizing a GoFundMe page the family promoted to help raise funds for Matejka during his recovery, she called the family “beyond fake”, saying the victim was guilty of the “worst acting” she had ever seen. In a phone call weeks later, Hallas claimed to the Guardian that she had never attacked the family and said she was just searching for answers. Reminded that she had posted a meme on the Facebook page of Matejka’s brother that called the shooting victim a “lying cunt”, she said she didn’t remember and must have been caught up in the moment. “I do feel bad. They are people, just like everybody else. Who am I to be calling anybody any kind of names?” she said. Asked if she regrets the attacks, she said: “I 100% do, and if I could apologize to them, I would.” Andy Parker, whose daughter was murdered on live television, said he was not interested in understanding the psychology of those claiming a hoax. He said he just wanted the videos off of YouTube. His first step was calling a customer service hotline for Google, which owns YouTube. A young man from Manila, he remembered, explained how he could flag the videos to be taken down. Parker began the work, but after marking about 10 videos, he said, he had to stop. There was footage of his daughter being killed all over the internet, but Parker had never wanted to see it himself. He had changed his YouTube settings so the videos would not automatically play, but even looking at their thumbnail images was too much. “I just couldn’t do it.” The situation made him angry. Couldn’t a company as powerful as Google, he thought, provide a better way to combat conspiracy theorist harassment than asking the father of a murdered journalist to clean up YouTube himself? The internet as we know it is founded on a simple legal principle: companies like YouTube and Twitter are not legally responsible for the content shared on their websites. But the tech corporations have been forced over the years to craft their own ethical standards, defining what kind of material is prohibited. Still, the companies have not shifted far from their core objectives of maximizing engagement – prompting users to share and consume high volumes of content and enabling the instantaneous purchasing of ads without scrutiny. The resulting algorithms are a perfect match for conspiracy theorists. Some grieving parents have turned the grim task of tracking down hoax theory videos into a daily job. In 2014, Pozner, whose child was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, founded the Honr Network, an organization dedicated to holding conspiracy theorists accountable. Hundreds of volunteers now help monitor the offensive content online. With YouTube, Pozner uses different tools to argue that videos should be taken down: invasion of privacy, harassment and, in some cases, copyright infringement. Often, it feels like he’s arguing with a robot – one that makes arbitrary decisions. Sometimes, the flagging process gets results. Other times the videos remain. The whole system, Pozner said, was frustratingly opaque. “If I’ll report something for privacy, they’ll [sometimes] say: ‘We’ve decided not to take any action on this.’ Who do you appeal to, who do you contact, who do you pick up the phone and call?” Parker talked to Pozner about his work, and Honr began flagging the Alison Parker hoax videos. But the conversation only reinforced Parker’s frustration with Google. “I am so grateful to these folks that are doing this … but the problem is, to me, we shouldn’t have to be doing this piecemeal,” Parker said. “It’s like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter. You kill a couple and a bunch of them come back. What we’re doing is demanding that they be responsible corporate citizens.” Parker said YouTube should pay a team of humans to proactively remove content: “The burden shouldn’t be on us to prove that this content is bad … They’re not acting like a human company.” Parker finally had a call with Google executives in October to discuss the problem, and he said he was now more optimistic that the company would work closely with the Honr network to address harassment. It’s true that it might not be a huge expense for Google to hire one person to deal with Sandy Hook and similar hoax theory videos, said David Karger, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, who researches online harassment. But, he said, “would they need to hire someone else to handle all the white supremacist harassment, and someone else to handle all the gender harassment? It’s an issue of scale.” YouTube, however, has no policy against conspiracy or hoax theory videos in general. In the wake of concerns from Parker and Pozner earlier this year, it clarified internally that hoax theory videos that targeted the victims or family members of public acts of violence would count as harassment, and could be taken down. “Our hearts go out to the families who have suffered these incredibly tragic losses,” a YouTube spokesperson said in an email. “We recognize the challenging issues raised by the victims’ families, and that is why we updated the application of our harassment policy last summer. As a result, we have removed hundreds of these videos as they have been flagged to us and we will continue to do so.” Cronk, the Vegas survivor and target of “crisis actor” hoaxes, said he tried to ignore the slander and attacks and focus on moving forward. He said he felt an obligation to live his life to the fullest, considering how lucky he was to survive. “I’m not going to let it define who I am,” he said. YouTube and Google, however, appear to have other plans for him. After the Guardian sent a number of videos targeting Cronk to company spokespeople, several were removed. Some of the worst ones, however, remained on the site. “They are a business. In my mind, if people can slander people and they are allowing this kind of stuff there … they should absolutely be held responsible,” Cronk said. One video that YouTube did not remove picks apart every comment and expression in one of his first television interviews as signs of his bad acting skills. In the video, titled “Las Vegas Hero Eyewitness or Actor???”, the narrator viciously mocks Cronk for appearing to smile in the interview. “Yeah, Mike Cronk, and I’m totally sure that’s your real name too, wink wink. It was so horrific, so horrific that you had to smirk and smile on camera as you duped us with delight,” the narrator shouts. “Huh, silly boy!” Despite multiple inquiries from the Guardian over several weeks, YouTube still suggests that Mike Cronk is a “crisis actor” in its search bar. The “Eyewitness or Actor?” video, viewed by more than 15,000 people, continues to be one of the top search results.",2017-11-28 10:25:39,US gun violence spawns a new epidemic: conspiracy theorists harassing victims,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
409,http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/11/fbi_cuyahoga_falls_man_threate.html,"Wei Li CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A Cuyahoga Falls man threatened to carry out a ""historic"" mass shooting at a Las Vegas casino where his estranged wife worked, according to federal investigators. Wei Li, 28, also threatened to carry out a mass shooting at a church with at least 1,000 people in attendance, according to the FBI. He is now charged in federal court in Northeast Ohio with interstate threatening communication and destruction of evidence. U.S. District Court Magistrate George Limbert on Thursday ordered him held in custody without bail until a Nov. 21 detention hearing. Li sent several text messages Nov. 6 threatening to kill his estranged wife and said that he would carry out a mass shooting at the hotel and casino where she worked, the FBI said. The FBI and court records do not disclose which hotel he referenced in those text messages. He also sent his wife photos of himself holding a rifle and knives and a list of Las Vegas casinos, court records say. He also told her that he had an automatic rifle, court records say. He told his wife that if his green card didn't go through, that he'd kill her, court records say. Prior to the text messages, Li went to the casino, walked around and told his wife that no security or police stopped him, court records say. ""No one checked me,"" he said, according to court records. He told his wife that his killing spree would make history and that he would blame his wife for all of the deaths, the FBI said. His wife responded by saying: ""You are too cruel"" and ""Are you sick?"" among other interactions in the profanity-laced text string between the two, court records say. Li also mentioned carrying out a mass shooting at a church. ""There are 1,000 people in our church,"" Li said in a text message to his wife, according to court records. ""I will make the biggest in history."" Li's wife became fearful for her life and the lives of the people at the casino she worked for, court records say. Cuyahoga Falls police and FBI agents interviewed Li last week. During the interview, Li confessed to sending the text messages, court records say. He said the threats were not serious, court records say. He also said he did not have any guns. He had a rifle in 2014, but it was stolen. That was verified by Cuyahoga Falls police, according to court records. Investigators found the phone he used to send the threats at his home, next to two knives, court records say. Li took out his phone and deleted the string of text messages that included the threats, the FBI said. Li at first denied deleting the messages but later admitted that he did because the texts were ""bad,"" court records say. He was arrested Nov. 10 and booked into the Summit County Jail, where he was held on $500,000 bond until his case was transferred to federal court. The threats came after two of the most deadly mass shootings in U.S. history, one that killed 58 people and wounded 546 at a concert outside a Las Vegas casino and another at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas that killed 26 people and wounded 20 others.

410,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/501736548/0/phoenix/nation~Was-Reno-highrise-gunman-mimicking-Las-Vegas-shooter-months-ago/,"RENO, Nev. — A gunman shooting from an eighth-floor condo rained bullets on downtown Reno but died after a SWAT team raided his unit, police said Wednesday. The incident — which brought to mind Stephen Paddock's 32nd-floor attack on ground-level concertgoers Oct. 1 at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas — began late Tuesday when the Reno shooter took a woman hostage. She later was rescued without injury, and officials have not released her name nor the name of the gunman. “Honestly, I knew the shooter was close, I could feel the windows vibrate, (and) I could hear things falling from walls,” said Karl Fiebiger, who lives on the seventh floor of The Montage condominium complex where the shooter was holed up. “I was pretty glad to evacuate because I knew I wasn’t in the safest situation if bullets started flying.” ► Oct. 4: The fateful 11 minutes of the Las Vegas mass shooting► Oct. 2: Vegas mass shooting raises new doubts about safety of live entertainment► June 19: 79 people now confirmed dead or missing after London high-rise blaze Fiebiger grabbed shoes, a jacket, his laptop and a photo of his parents, then headed for the elevator. Fiebiger said he felt more anxious than scared though it took a while for the reality of the situation to set in. “I guess this is the country we live in now,” he said. In Reno, no one on the ground was injured. One woman suffered a superficial injury to her hand. The gunman, who was in his mid- to late 20s, used a shoulder-fired rifle that held 20 to 50 rounds of ammunition from his perch in the 22-story condominium renovated from what used to be the Golden Phoenix casino. He fired bursts of five to eight shots at Sierra Street that sparked as they ricocheted off the asphalt, said Reno's deputy police chief, Tom Robinson. Gaps between bursts lasted minutes, and the entire incident lasted 30 minutes, Robinson said. It was unclear whether the gunman and his hostage lived in the condo where the shooting occurred. The suspect's motive also remained unclear early Wednesday though officers suspect that mental issues might have been a factor, Robinson said. Radio chatter during the incident suggested that the suspect might have been seeing things. ► April 2015: Chinese builder puts up 57-story skyscraper in 19 days► March 2015: 3 die in North Carolina scaffolding collapse Mike Pavicich of Las Vegas, in Reno on business, was walking down Fourth Street in front of the Eldorado casino late Tuesday when the first shots first rang out. Pavicich's wife was a nurse who was called in to work after Paddock, 64, opened fire on the Las Vegas music festival 59 days ago from his 32nd-floor suite at Mandalay Bay Casino.

James Bell from Nashville, Tennessee, looks over rifle scopes during the National Rifle Association's (NRA) annual meetings and exhibits show in Louisville, Kentucky in 2016. America has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world. John Sommers II / Reuters Editor's note: After the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead — the deadliest shooting in the US to date —The World chose to spend a full show trying to understand America's mass shooting crisis. PRI’s data team used the Gun Archive and a library created by Reveal to sonify one year (January 2017 to Nov. 17, 2017) in mass shootings in the US. Since the Nov. 5, 2017 attack at Sutherland Springs, 89 people have died in mass shootings. Our latest data sonification is at the bottom of this piece. It includes data from Nov. 5, 2017 to the most recent Feb. 14 attack in Parkland, Florida. When Devin Kelley entered the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5 and shot and killed 26 people, it became the 308th mass shooting of 2017 in the United States. It came four weeks after the Las Vegas shooting, when Stephen Paddock killed 59 people from a 32nd-floor hotel room above an open-air country music concert. Since the Sutherland Springs shooting, there have been more than 10 mass shooting events, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks incidents where four or more people are shot. The bleak totals for 2017 in mass shootings in America: 415 killed and more than 1,700 wounded. Both events have reignited America’s gun debate. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats reintroduced an updated assault weapons ban, but no Republicans have supported the measure. The World devoted its Friday, Nov. 17, show to discussing gun culture in America and around the globe.  A sign for Recon Tactical is displayed at the Guntoberfest gun show in Oaks, Pennsylvania, US, Oct. 6, 2017. Joshua Roberts/Reuters The US doesn’t require gun owners to register guns the way many other countries do, so researchers have to estimate ownership. A 2013 study estimates there are between 262 million and 310 million guns of various kinds in the United States — which calculates to roughly 101 guns per 100 people. It’s the high rate of gun ownership, says University of Alabama criminology professor Adam Lankford, that is directly correlated with America’s mass shooting problem. “It’s not that we have higher homicide rates,” Lankford says. “It’s not about wealth. It’s not about urbanization. It’s not about suicide rates. The difference between us and other countries that explains why we have more of these attacks was firearm ownership rate. We have almost double the firearm ownership rate of any other country.” Related: When trying to determine why the US has so many mass shootings, only one statistic matters Lankford studied 171 different countries and tallied up mass shootings across the globe from 1966 to 2012. Of the 272 events he found, 31 percent occurred in the US. (The US has only 5 percent of the world’s population.) “Purely in terms of numbers, we have more than 200 million more guns than the next highest country, which is India,” Lankford says. “And India has a much greater population than ours, so purely in terms of the number of guns, which is really the product of American gun culture, really, there’s no comparison between us and anywhere else.”  Salvadoran army reserve soldiers wait to board trucks after an official ceremony prior to their deployment to deal with gang violence in San Salvador, El Salvador June 14, 2016. Jose Cabezas/Reuters Susan Cruz was 6 years old the first time her mother taught her how to shoot a gun. “Feeling both that shock and that amazement and that adrenaline, that power of something — that didn’t look like much of something to me at the age of 6,” Cruz remembers. “I still remember the feeling of the gun going off and then going to the cinderblock wall and seeing where the bullets lodged.” Cruz grew up in El Salvador but fled at age 8 when civil war broke out. That first lesson was only an introduction to a life surrounded by guns. After moving to Los Angeles, Cruz joined a gang as a teenager and lost friends to gun violence. She moved back to her home country in 1993, but gang violence followed as the US began deporting gang members back to El Salvador. El Salvador had the highest homicide rate in the world in 2015, according to the most recent United Nations data, with 108.6 killings per 100,000 inhabitants. Honduras was second, with 64 per 100,000. “On any given day in El Salvador, there’s an average of at least 12 homicides per day,” Cruz says. “That’s a dozen people being murdered.” Cruz now lives in the Washington, DC, area with her family and is the founder of Sin Fronteras, a organization dedicated to helping troubled youth on both sides of US-Mexico border. After a lifetime surrounded by guns, she says she feels more anxious with them around, but not everyone agrees. “I have friends and family who will argue with me that they need this gun to stay safe,” Cruz says. “The ethos of ‘good guy with a gun will prevent a mass shooting, good guy with a gun will make sure the family’s protected’ — it is a very prevalent mentality and I think it has a lot to do with the infusion of a military culture.” Cruz says gang members think in similar ways as well: They want to be armed to protect themselves against others, a “kill or be killed” worldview. “When you have an entire country that thinks that way, it’s no wonder countries like El Salvador have the highest per capita homicide rates in the world,” she says.  Followers of the Shi'ite Houthi movement shout slogans as they attend a rally commemorating the death of Imam Zaid bin Ali in Sanaa, Yemen Oct. 26, 2016. Khaled Abdullah/Reuters Yemen ranks No. 2 in the world in gun ownership, with an estimated 55 guns per 100 people, according to the 2007 Small Arms Survey, the best count of global gun ownership in countries where people are not required to register firearms. Yemen’s gun culture is visible in the streets, in the open-air markets, or souks, says reporter Tik Root, who lived in Yemen before civil war broke out in 2015. He remembers visiting a gun market in Jihana, near the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. “When you get there, the street looks like a normal market in a lot of ways,” Root says. “There’s shops down both sides. But the majority of the shops are selling firearms — everything from pistols to automatic weapons to [rocket-propelled grenades] RPGs. I saw tank shells and I’m told if you ask the right person you could get a tank itself.” At those markets, people can go and buy as many weapons as they want. Guns are both status and safety in Yemen, Root says. “It’s definitely a tool of culture, it’s a tool of status,” Root says. But the mass shootings in Yemen — Lankford counted 11 in his study — are different from those in the US. “The shootings that happen seem to have more relation to either tribal conflict or an ongoing dispute with something,” Root says. “The shootings that I heard about or saw in Yemen usually had maybe more of an explanation than they do in the US. You didn’t hear the mental health argument as much as usually a clear reason why somebody had used their gun.”  Heiko Junge/Reuters Bjørn Ihler was 20 when Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in Oslo and then, dressed as a police officer and, showing false identification, took a ferry to the island of Utøya and opened fire on Norway’s Labor Party youth summer camp. “He started shooting at our group and the kids and I jumped in the water,” Ihler remembers. “I kind of swam straight outwards and sank, so I dodged his bullets somehow.” Breivik shot 68 people that day, over the course of more than 90 minutes, before police arrived. “I stood up again in the water, I looked back to the marshland,” says Ihler. “I saw Brevik take aim at me.” An officer arrived later and had to convince Ihler and the others with him that he was a real police officer. “Feeling safety after that has been difficult,” Ihler says. “After the shooting I felt a need to understand Breivik. He wanted to kill me and my friends. As I saw it, we didn’t pose any threat to him or his identity.” Breivik, who ultimately killed 77 people that day, was convicted and sentenced to 21 years in prison, Norway’s maximum penalty. On the day of the attack, he published a manifesto that lays out a far-right, anti-Islam, anti-feminist worldview. Since then, Ihler has sought to understand political extremism and he claims to have met with more reformed extremists than anyone else in the world. “It was really difficult to deal with the fact that someone coming out of my community wanted to kill me for essentially being me,” Ihler says. “That’s kind of why I started ... going around traveling to meet with former extremists and learn their path into extremism.""  People hold candles during a memorial service for Charleston Hartfield, an off-duty Las Vegas police officer who was killed during the Route 91 music festival mass shooting, in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, Oct. 5, 2017. Chris Wattie/Reuters The deadly attack at Sutherland Springs’ First Baptist Church was the 14th fatal shooting at a house of worship since 2012, according to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, which tracks gun violence. “It’s only gotten worse as the power of the NRA and the gun industry has grown and is holding Congress hostage,” says director Rabbi Jonah Pesner. Along with representatives from 50 religious organizations, Pesner signed a letter calling on US lawmakers to take tougher action on gun control. “Enough is enough with empty thoughts and prayers that are not followed by action,” Pesner says. “As a Jew, I believe that every prayer is a call to action.” Related: After a mass shooting, thoughts and prayers. But then what? And Pesner is reassured by polling that shows broad support from American voters for what he calls common sense gun regulations. “Evangelicals tend to see it differently,” says Joe Carter, editor at The Gospel Coalition, a network of evangelical churches founded in 2005. “One reason is regional,” Carter says. “A lot of evangelicals are from the South. A lot of them served in the military. A lot of them are more familiar with guns than the average American, and they own more guns than the average American.” Related: The origins of the Second Amendment “I mean, if you’re going to shoot up a church, you’re not going to worry about a gun control law,” says Carter, who is also a vet and a gun owner himself. Gun ownership is not the solution in all cases, Carter says. But a good guy with a gun can prevent somebody who is armed and prepared to do innocents harm, he says. Carter says many of the mass shootings at US churches or elsewhere are the result of domestic violence, which is something religious leaders need to take more seriously. “That’s the problem with the gun control issue,” Carter says. “That’s always the go-to thing. And it drowns out other conversations we should be having.” The recent shooting at the Texas church brought back horrific memories for people at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, where a white supremacist fatally shot six people in 2012. “It's coming to be a normal thing now,” says temple spokeswoman Nirmal Kaur-Singh. “It can happen anywhere.” Asked if she thinks that more guns in more people’s hands might be good for safety and security at places of worship, Kaur-Singh says, “I don’t know.” “But I don’t like guns.” The Gun Archive was created in 2013 to track gun violence in the United States. PRI’s data team used the archive and a library created by Reveal to sonify one year in mass shootings in the US. Each note represents a day when a mass shooting occurred. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are shot and/or killed. (This standard is not as strict as that used by criminologist Adam Lankford to tally global mass shootings. Lankford also excluded domestic violence incidents and only included shootings where bystanders were killed.) The volume of each note corresponds with how many people were killed. Shootings in which no one died are represented with a low note. The loudest note is the Las Vegas shooting, where 59 people died. The last note is from Nov. 16, when a shooting in Columbus, Georgia, injured seven. (PRI chose to represent injuries with a faint note.) Here, you can listen to just the sound of shootings from January through Nov. 17, 2017. Since the attack at Sutherland Springs, 89 people have died in mass shootings.

Interstate 10 in Phoenix, just before dawn.Credit...David Walter Banks for The New York Times Supported by By Cecilia Kang PHOENIX — Three weeks into his new job as Arizona’s governor, Doug Ducey made a move that won over Silicon Valley and paved the way for his state to become a driverless car utopia. It was January 2015 and the Phoenix area was about to host the Super Bowl. Mr. Ducey learned that a local regulator was planning a sting on Lyft and Uber drivers to shut down the ride-hailing services for operating illegally. Mr. Ducey, a Republican who was the former chief executive of the ice cream chain Cold Stone Creamery, was furious. “It was the exact opposite message we should have been sending,” Mr. Ducey said in an interview. “We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas.” If the state had a slogan, he added, it would include the words “open for business.” Mr. Ducey fired the regulator who hatched the idea of going after ride-hailing drivers and shut down the entire agency, the Department of Weights and Measures. By April 2015, Arizona had legalized ride-sharing. Arizona has since built upon the governor’s action to become a favored partner for the tech industry, turning itself into a live laboratory for self-driving vehicles. Over the past two years, Arizona deliberately cultivated a rules-free environment for driverless cars, unlike dozens of other states that have enacted autonomous vehicle regulations over safety, taxes and insurance. Arizona took its anything-goes approach while federal regulators delayed formulating an overarching set of self-driving car standards, leaving a gap for states. The federal government is only now poised to create its first law for autonomous vehicles; the law, which echoes Arizona’s stance, would let hundreds of thousands of them be deployed within a few years and would restrict states from putting up hurdles for the industry. “We are in the Wild West phase of autonomous vehicles, where companies are looking for the state with the least amount of sheriffing going on,” said Henry Jasny, senior vice president at Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a nonprofit based in Washington. The payoff for Arizona has been a tech boom, with dozens of autonomous vehicle companies flocking here to set up operations. Every day, Waymo, the driverless car business owned by Google’s corporate parent Alphabet, as well as Uber, Lyft, General Motors and Intel now deploy hundreds of cars that drive themselves on the streets of Phoenix, a sprawling metropolis of 1.4 million people. Some companies have pushed boundaries by conducting first-of-its-kind experiments in the state. Waymo announced this past week that it had begun testing self-driving cars in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler without an employee at the wheel to take over in an emergency. Until then, all driverless car trials had a human driver in the front seat, just in case. Uber said it was also exploring similar tests, with employees moving to the back seat. But Arizona’s permissiveness has drawn criticism from safety advocates who said the companies have too much freedom to conduct their trials on public roads. They said car companies and state officials have not solved questions about the privacy of passengers, the prevention of cyberattacks on autonomous cars, and how to insure vehicles that don’t have a driver. “It’s open season on other Arizona drivers and pedestrians,” said Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a nonprofit that has pushed for stronger state and federal rules. “There is a complete and utter vacuum on safety.” Arizona officials said the public is essentially protected by basic rules that require a licensed driver somewhere in the driverless car. They added that they planned to take a back seat to the experts when it comes to rule-making. The state insurance regulator, for example, said he would wait for the insurance industry to guide regulators on liability policies for driverless cars, amid questions about who is responsible in a crash if the car isn’t driven by a human. “We shouldn’t be getting in the way by prescribing regulations when we really don’t know how the equipment will perform,” said John Halikowski, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation. The state’s hands-off approach has already been tested. In March, Arizona experienced its first crash involving a driverless car, when a human-driven vehicle collided with a self-driving Uber in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. The case was quickly resolved because police said Uber’s car was not at fault, but some Arizona officials acknowledged they have not thought through all the legal scenarios with autonomous car accidents. “We embrace innovation,” said Mark Mitchell, the mayor of Tempe. “But there are some things we’ll have to look at moving forward.” Mr. Ducey, a native of Ohio who came to Arizona for college and then stayed, was elected governor in 2014 on a pro-business and innovation platform. He quickly lifted restrictions on medical testing for companies like Theranos, a Silicon Valley company that later faced scrutiny for its business practices. He also touted Apple’s decision to build a $2 billion data center in the state. “We can beat California in every metric; lower taxes, less regulations, cost of living, quality of life,” he said several months after he became governor. In early 2015, Mr. Ducey’s shutdown of the sting operation that would have hit Uber and Lyft had an immediate effect. Days after his decision, which the companies were made aware of by his staff, Lyft and Uber executives called the governor to thank him. At the time, Uber already had a small operation in Arizona for mapping roads. Two months later, the company announced it would open a center in Phoenix for customer and driver support with 300 employees. By August 2015, Mr. Ducey was taking his first steps into driverless vehicles. That month, he signed an executive order supporting autonomous cars. Under that order, any driverless car could be on Arizona roads as long as a passenger had a license and the car had a basic liability insurance plan. Mr. Ducey also set up a “Self-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee” comprised of transportation, public safety, insurance and other regulators to advise “how best to advance the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads.” The group was not intended to create any new rules. And Mr. Ducey became a pitchman. Early last year at a global economic forum on the Georgia coast, Mr. Ducey said he approached Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, with a business card and talking points on the state’s embrace of self-driving automakers. Shortly thereafter, Waymo scoped out Chandler to begin autonomous car tests. Chandler’s officials sealed the deal with further promises to stay out of the way. “We don’t think it’s our role to be engaged in regulation,” said Micah Miranda, Chandler’s director of economic development. Waymo opened operations in Chandler in August 2016, hiring dozens of local test drivers. The company hosted a grand opening with Mr. Ducey and Chandler’s mayor, and held several community events to win over the public. “The enthusiasm for new tech from the public and Governor Ducey makes Arizona a place where innovation can thrive and companies like ours can set up roots,” said Waymo. Mr. Ducey also traveled to Silicon Valley to visit driverless car companies and investors. In late 2016, he stopped by Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested in companies including Lyft, which is working on self-driving technology. There, Mr. Ducey found an inquisitive audience about the state’s regulation-free policy for self-driving cars. “Although Washington gets much of the attention, a lot of the real action on tech policy is taking place at the state and local level,” said Ted Ullyot, an Andreessen Horowitz partner who attended the meeting. “Governor Ducey is a key pro-innovation leader, making Arizona a highly welcoming environment for autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies.” Arizona particularly stood out against other states. In the absence of federal rules, 33 states have created their own laws and regulations around the new technology. Many are taking a more legislation-heavy approach. In California, Google, Uber, GM, and Ford have fought lawmakers on self-driving rules. One rule required carmakers to report on the number of times a driverless car switched from autonomous mode to human-driven mode, which irked automakers who said those statistics give a misleading impression of safety. Last December, Uber clashed with California regulators when it tested its self-driving cars in San Francisco without permission from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The company was quickly ordered to shut down its trials. Uber’s executives called Mr. Ducey. “We responded by saying we weren’t going to hassle them,” Mr. Ducey said of Uber. “I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank my partner in growing the Arizona economy, Jerry Brown,” the Democratic governor of California. Days later, Uber loaded a fleet of driverless sport utility vehicles onto semi trucks headed for Tempe. The company now has several dozen driverless cars in a garage there that is the size of two football fields, with plans to add more cars. “Governor Ducey’s prioritization of the sharing economy has made the Grand Canyon State an ideal environment for our self-driving pilot,” Uber said. Under Mr. Ducey, driverless car experiments in Arizona have multiplied over the last year. Uber’s self-driving Volvo SUVs now pick up customers around Tempe on a daily basis. Waymo has dispatched more than 100 Chrysler self-driving minivans to chauffeur select families and other residents as part of a closely guarded trial; the company plans to expand to 600 vehicles by the end of the year, with the majority in Chandler. And dozens of vehicles for GM, Ford, Intel, and Lyft are also covering thousands of miles a day on the flat and sun-drenched roads around Phoenix. Some residents are ambivalent. Groups representing the blind are enthusiastic supporters of driverless cars, which could give their members more independence. Others like the idea of tech-related jobs coming to the state. But some are cautious. “I’m on the fence,” said Jake Guadarrama, 22, a Phoenix area resident. “What if the battery died on the car and it goes out of control? And will it take way from the work force?” Those questions are not just academic. Already, the incorporation of driverless cars into human-driven traffic has run into problems. Around dusk on March 24, for example, Alexandra Cole, a Tempe resident, inched her 2008 Honda CRV into a busy suburban intersection in the city. With five seconds left on the pedestrian crossing signal and no cars coming toward her in the two closest lanes, she began a left turn. She did not see Uber’s self-driving Volvo SUV darting through the yellow light in the furthest lane toward her. The cars collided. Uber’s vehicle flipped onto its side and crashed into two more cars waiting in traffic. The crash — Arizona’s first with a driverless vehicle — was soon resolved. There were no injuries and police said Ms. Cole, and not Uber’s car, was to blame for failing to yield on a left turn. But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles. Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision. The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident. Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate. N.H.T.S.A. said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress. Ms. Cole and her insurance company declined to comment. If the crash had turned into a criminal case, police would likely have asked for data from the self-driving cars. If the carmakers refused, they might have sought warrants for the data — a practice that put the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Apple into a fierce battle last year related to unlocking an iPhone used by a suspect in a mass shooting. Waymo and Uber said their policies are to comply with local laws wherever they operate. Insurance would also have been a question, with debate over who takes responsibility in a driverless car crash — the company or the third-party software or parts makers or the passenger with a license — since there is no driver. “The insurance companies need to figure out how they will insure this,” said Stephen Briggs, a spokesman for Arizona’s Department of Insurance. Arizona hasn’t changed its minimum insurance liability rules for self-driving car trials. “The government doesn’t have the resources to do this.” Angel Carbajal, Tempe’s assistant chief of police, acknowledged there are many unknowns. “This is new, so there isn’t a lot of legislation yet that explains how to respond to motor vehicle collisions involving autonomous vehicles,” he said. For Mr. Ducey, none of this is a problem. He said the crash was handled properly and that even if driverless technology is not fully ready, the state’s bet on autonomous vehicles will continue. “These are cultural opportunities for Arizona to be seen as a place to live, work and play,” he said.

413,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/04/las-vegas-shooting-patients-went-wrong-hospital/922057001/,"LAS VEGAS — They found the couple sprawled across the warm asphalt outside the Route 91 Harvest festival. Blood seeped from bullet wounds, his near an elbow, hers on the head. Panicked concertgoers streamed past them. David Hendrickson, an EMT who attended the Oct. 1 concert, stopped and knelt beside the couple. The woman was growing woozy. Blood soaked through the shirt tied around her head. Hendrickson tightened it, and then took off his own shirt and tied it around the man’s arm. “We need to get these guys to the hospital,” Hendrickson told his girlfriend, Michelle Wolters. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. The four climbed into Wolters’ Mercedes. Blood seeped into the leather seats. More: Was Reno high-rise gunman mimicking Las Vegas shooter 2 months ago? More: Las Vegas massacre survivor killed in hit-and-run Hendrickson started the car and inched through the crowd near Mandalay Bay. They had driven in from California and nobody in the car knew the local hospitals, so Wolters pulled out her iPhone. With shaking fingers, she typed in ""Vegas hospital."" Sunrise Hospital appeared at the top of the list. “All right,” Hendrickson said, “we’re gonna go there.” They had no way to know that Sunrise would soon become overwhelmed with patients, with every gurney full and ""red-tag"" triage patients waiting for care. At the same time, the county’s most comprehensive trauma center, University Medical Center, barely three miles away, was preparing itself for victims who never arrived. Metropolitan Las Vegas has a trauma response plan designed to send manageable numbers of patients to each hospital. The plan dictates which injuries must be treated at a trauma center and which ones can go to a regular hospital. It splits Clark County into three areas and assigns each one a trauma center where patients should be taken. The Route 91 Harvest festival stage was at a location designated for UMC. But in the hours after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, that plan became impossible to follow. Bystanders like Hendrickson and Wolters loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the first hospital they could find, bypassing the county's transport system entirely. More: Las Vegas shooting lawsuits stack up with 14 more filed More: Jason Aldean remembers 'pandemonium' during Las Vegas shooting Confusion and rumors swirled, partly because the county lacks the central communications system that emergency planners called for in 2009. That resulted in an uneven rush of patients into hospitals all over Clark County. Sunrise, a Level II trauma center, treated 199 patients in a few hours. UMC, Nevada’s only Level I trauma center and the hospital President Trump visited after the massacre, took 104 patients. A handful of UMC's beds remained empty as rumors it had closed it doors spread through the county. Hundreds more patients filtered into smaller hospitals. “Some places got hit hard,” said UMC trauma director Dr. John Fildes. “But that’s what happens when 500 people went down.”  City, county and hospital officials insist their response to the shooting went as smoothly as possible. “From an emergency response perspective, the event was very professionally managed,” Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said in a statement. No complaints have been filed with the state’s health department, and a spokeswoman for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health said she was not aware of any complaints about the emergency response. “If it’s a problem, it needs to be addressed,” said John Hammond, the EMS and trauma system manager for the Southern Nevada Health District, about the imbalance of patients at hospitals. “But I don’t know if it’s a problem.” More: Couple who survived Las Vegas mass shooting die in car crash More: 'Is this real?': Seven hours of chaos, bravery at Las Vegas hospital after mass shooting Among the unanswerable questions from a night of terror is whether the Level I trauma center should have received more patients, potentially spreading the work more evenly among over-burdened emergency workers. The drop in care from a Level I to a Level II trauma center is minimal, experts say, and often disputed. Nationwide studies of their treatment have given mixed results. Some research shows that more people die at Level II centers, which aren’t required to have as many specialists or treat as many patients annually as top-tier centers. Other research shows more people die at Level I centers, because those places receive the patients closest to death. It’s impossible to know if the confusion caused any patients to receive lesser treatment. But it at least created disparate levels of chaos at the region’s two largest trauma centers. At Sunrise, the flow of patients seemed never to stop. Staff, space and resources ran thin. The hospital used up its entire supply of universally compatible O-negative blood, and at least one ER doctor said he worked until his brain couldn’t process charts anymore. Every gurney and wheelchair in the hospital held a patient. Some patients waited on the floor. Others with minor injuries walked out, not wanting to take up time or resources that could be used on more critical patients. A few miles away, UMC’s trauma director wondered where the rest of the patients were. Around 1:45 a.m. MT, Fildes counted nine empty trauma bays. Three operating rooms sat open. Even two months after the shooting, nobody has determined exactly why patients stopped arriving at UMC. But in the immediate aftermath, rumors spread by word of mouth and on social media that UMC had closed its doors. Multiple emergency workers and hospital staffers told The Arizona Republic they heard, at some point during the evening, that UMC had stopped taking patients. Representatives of two ambulance companies heard it. Two Sunrise staffers said they heard it. Two medics working at the concert venue received texts about it. None of those people could identify the source of the rumor. ""So many injuries that UMC hospital having to divert to other hospitals,"" Las Vegas blogger Christy Oldenkamp wrote on Twitter. Other accounts tweeted similar rumors. It wasn’t true. UMC didn’t close, and nothing similar appears in an audio recording of Clark County Fire Department dispatchers in the first hour after the shooting. Fildes, the UMC trauma director, recalled telling somebody at Sunrise that he had room to take their excess patients. He remembered asking for them to come three at a time, so his teams could focus on the most critical patients. In an email, Fildes said he couldn't remember how many more arrived.  The Southern Nevada Health District’s trauma plan, last updated in February 2015, dictates that a patient must be taken to a trauma center if he or she has certain injuries, including a “penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso or the extremities proximal to the elbow or knee.” It then divides Clark County into three segments: Trauma patients injured in an eastern area should be taken to Sunrise, which is northeast of the Strip. Patients in an area to the south should go to St. Rose Dominican Hospital, Siena Campus, in nearby Henderson. Patients found anywhere else in the county go to UMC, which is northwest of the Strip. The Route 91 concert stage was in a part of the county for which UMC was responsible. The plan allows for exceptions if bad traffic or dangerous weather make the designated hospital too difficult to reach in time. It's designed to make first responders, ambulance drivers and other emergency personnel work in unison, all following the same strategy to move people to hospitals. It does not mention how to handle a mass of gunshot victims being transported in pickup trucks and strangers’ back seats. So when it came time for the plan to be implemented, confusion ruled the moments after the shooting. Emergency responders weren’t sure if it was safe to head toward the festival grounds. False reports of multiple shooters circulated. One man on the Clark County Fire Department dispatch radio kept repeating reports of a man in Army fatigues climbing into a van. Through it all, audio recordings obtained by The Arizona Republic show, the dispatch feed flooded with requests for ambulances. “The ambulances do not have enough units to transfer all the gunshot wounds,” one responder reported. “We are out of ambulances and we still have a couple more criticals,” said another. “Chief, we’re currently loading patients into private vehicles. We have no more ambulances,” still another said. “We’re getting pickup trucks full of patients coming in."" In 2009, a study of the region's trauma plan concluded that Clark County needed a centralized communications center to handle emergency situations, rather than relying on a patchwork system of dispatchers and hospitals. That center was never created. “We’ve been trying to fix that problem for a while,” the health district's Hammond said recently, noting that the initial set-up of a system could cost upward of $1 million. “Not just for large events, but for everyday movement of patients within the system, a centralized system would be better.” The streets were jammed when Hendrickson pulled his girlfriend’s car off the Strip. He and Wolters tried to introduce themselves to the strange couple in their back seat, searching for some way into a conversation. The man said his name was David, too. That was a start. He introduced his girlfriend as Stephanie. Her alertness started to fade. They reached a red light. Hendrickson blew through it. A truck filled with bleeding people sped past them, clambering over the median and through a turn lane. A six-mile drive took 10 minutes. Finally Hendrickson pulled into the curve behind Sunrise’s emergency room. Hospital staff had filled the ambulance bays with as many wheelchairs and gurneys as they could find. An ER doctor and nurses worked in a hurried quiet. A small group crowded around the Mercedes. “Back seat,” Hendrickson told them. He and Wolters watched as nurses pulled out the couple and helped them onto gurneys. Then they disappeared into the crowded hospital. ""We’ve been trying to look for them and see if they’re OK,"" Wolters said recently. ""It does kind of bother us that we don’t know how they are.""

A 21-year-old disguised himself as a student before he walked into a New Mexico high school on Dec. 7 and opened fire, according to reports. William Atchison walked into the Aztec High School bathroom to prepare the assault, the Associated Press reported Friday. He was interrupted by a male student -- who he shot and killed. Police said Atchison fatally shot one more student in the hallway as he fired his gun before he turned it on himself. Atchison was reportedly known to law enforcement officials, but he did not have a criminal record. He also purchased his handgun legally, authorities said. Here’s what we know about Atchison and the shooting so far. Atchison was a former student at small-town Aztec High School. Authorities said the shooter did not have a criminal record. The only contact with law enforcement was what they described as a generic message on an online gaming forum in 2016 in which he talked about what weapons might be used in a mass shooting. The FBI said the posting was flagged and investigators talked with the gunman at his home in Aztec, where he lived with his parents. At the time, he reportedly did not own any weapons other than an airsoft pellet gun and said he had no plans for an attack and just liked to troll sites online. Casey J. Marquez and Francisco I. Fernandez were the two victims in the shooting. Marquez was a cheerleader and was planning to participate in the upcoming Orange Bowl. Her classmates said she came across as a student leader. Bryn Divine, a senior at Aztec High School, remembered Marquez being a vibrant and friendly student who often won dance contests at school events. “She lit up pretty much any room we were all in,"" Divine said. ""She was such a fun person to be around."" Fernandez was known for his speedy typing and interest in computers. His family said he had a bright future ahead of him. According to a KOB4, a local news station, Fernandez was a recent transfer to Aztec High School. He participated in sports and wanted to attend college. His father ""never saw this coming,"" KOB4 reported. Police said the two victims were not specific targets. Atchison left a thumb drive on his body which apparently contained a note that detailed his plan for Thursday morning. “If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,” Atchison’s note begins. In his note, he said he planned to “gear up” before holding a classroom hostage. He said he would eventually commit suicide. “Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,” he said in his note. “I just want out of this s---.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

418,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/08/new-mexico-high-school-shooter-planned-to-die-had-been-investigated-by-fbi-in-2016/," The man who killed two students at Aztec High School in New Mexico on Thursday morning was a former student who entered the school with no intention of walking out alive.   The shooter was 21-year-old William Atchison, a local gas station employee. According to plans found on a thumb drive in his backpack, he planned to hold a class hostage and kill students before killing himself.  “If things go according to plan today, today would be when I die,” the document said. “I wait until the school buses are detected, then head out on foot disguised as a student.  “Go somewhere and gear up, then hold a class hostage and go apes—, then blow my brains out.”    The letter revealed that Atchison was fed up with life, and ready to end his own, although it doesn’t explain why he felt the need to kill students in the process.  “Work sucks, school sucks, life sucks,” he wrote. “[Expletive] this state, it really is bad. Think I’m insane? I’m actually more rational, peaceful and less loony than a majority of the citizenry of this entire region.”   Atchison entered the school with students, and went to a second floor bathroom to prepare for the shooting.  A student, Francisco Fernandez, unknowingly walked in on him in the bathroom. That’s when Atchison killed him.  Shortly after, he saw another student, Casey Marquez, in the hallway and killed her.  The gunshots alerted officials to put the school on lockdown. Atchison fired some shots at students hiding in a supply closet, but no one else was injured.  Atchison shot himself just as police were entering the school.   Atchison didn’t have a criminal history, but he was the subject of an FBI investigation in 2016.  Someone reported Atchison for a message he wrote online asking about cheap assault rifles to use in a mass shooting. The FBI found no evidence of criminal activity, and Atchison claimed he wasn’t being serious.  The gun he used to kill the two Aztec students was a legally-purchased Glock 9mm.  Police found a note in Atchison’s home after the shooting which apparently scheduled out the day, including times for ""work,"" ""prep,"" ""pack up,"" ""walk,"" and finally, at 8 a.m., “die.”   We use cookies to better understand website visitors, for advertising, and to offer you a better experience.

419,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/07/concealed-carry-bill-passes-in-the-house-but-the-senate-will-likely-shut-it-down/,"The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow gun owners' concealed carry permits to be recognized across state lines.  The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which passed 231-198, has another measure attached to it designed to beef up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. That many believe the NICS bill could prevent future shootings like the church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last month. The Air Force admitted it failed to report a domestic violence court-martial conviction for the Sutherland shooter, Devin Kelly, to the federal background database, as required by Pentagon rules. That information would have made him ineligible to buy a gun. The legislation was initially two separate bills and 14 House Republicans voted against it. Six Democrats voted in favor of the bill: Sanford Bishop (Ga.), Henry Cuellar (Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Ron Kind (Wis.), Collin Peterson (Minn.), and Kurt Schrader (Ore.). House GOP leaders said the bills were combined so that lawmakers would have to cast only one vote, The Hill reported.  People crossing state lines with a concealed carry permit and firearm would be allowed to carry their guns concealed if they have a valid government-issued photo ID. Also, they would be required to follow established state and locals laws for handguns. According to the bill, qualified individuals who lawfully carry or possess a concealed handgun in another state are not subject to the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone and may carry or possess a handgun in federally owned lands that are open to the public. Those opposing the legislation say it won't work since concealed carry laws such as gun safety training, age limit, and prohibitions on people with a history of violence vary from state to state.  The NICS legislation forces federal agencies such as the military — and encourages states — to do a better job reporting offenses that would prohibit people from buying firearms, according to the Post. The NICS determines gun buyers' eligibility to purchase based on criminal records and other offenses that are reported to the agency. The ""fix NICS"" legislation would penalize federal agencies that fail to report criminal records and domestic violence records to the FBI. It also incentivizes states to regularly and accurately report criminal records to the bureau by allocating federal grants to states that comply. This portion of the bill had wide bipartisan support.  Gun control advocates are saying the Republicans should have kept the bills separate and are accusing the GOP of using the bipartisan portion of the measure to get the concealed carry portion of the legislation passed. • “When we were negotiating in a very bipartisan, good-faith way, the understanding was the NICS-fix bill would be considered on its own,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), an original co-sponsor of the bill told the Post. “Combining them would be completely unwise and unacceptable, and everyone knows it.” • ""The bill is horrible,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told Politico. ""What it does is rob every state the ability to maintain standards on concealed carry."" • ""Congress has failed the American people,"" said former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords (D), who suffered severe injuries during a 2011 mass shooting. ""After two of our nation's worst mass shootings, Congress took direct instruction from the gun lobby and passed a bill that will override existing state laws and allow dangerous, untrained people to carry guns in every state and every city. Let's be clear: These politicians are trading our safety for political contributions from the gun lobby.""  • “Taken together, these two bills preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman  Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Tuesday, according to the Post. “I believe that both bills complement each other in keeping people safe.” • “This vote marks a watershed moment for Second Amendment rights,” NRA Executive Director Chris W. Cox. “The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the culmination of a 30-year movement recognizing the right of all law-abiding Americans to defend themselves, and their loved ones, including when they cross state lines.” • “We support both bills, and if they get combined we’ll support the combined bill — and if they’re not combined, we’ll support both bills separately,” Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, told the Post. “They’re both good bills and they both should pass, and Americans should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right.”  It would take eight Senate Democrats, along with all 52 Senate Republicans to get the 60 votes needed to pass the next hurdle. “When you put them together, it makes it harder for us to do what we can do, and can do now,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who co-authored the NICS bill, said.  “I want to separate those two out, get the 'fix NICS' bill passed, and hopefully save some lives.” “I don’t think the votes are there in the Senate to pass concealed carry,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, according to the Post. Murphy is a lead author of the background checks bill. According to The Hill, a bipartisan coalition in the Senate has enough votes to break a filibuster on a stand-alone NICS bill.

        Claudia Koerner Last updated on December 4, 2017, at 7:32 p.m. ET Posted on December 4, 2017, at 6:55 p.m. ET A 69-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after allegedly planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Florida mosque, authorities announced Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said his office received a tip in late October that Bernandino Bolatete had expressed ""strong anti-Islamic sentiment"" and planned a mass shooting at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida. An undercover detective began speaking to Bolatete and other state and federal agencies began to take steps to prevent an attack. According to court records, the detective became friendly with Bolatete, a Philippine national who has a green card, at a local shooting range. Bolatete confessed his failing health — the result of being shot in the kidney by a police officer in the Philippines years ago. Bolatete claimed to have killed the officer who shot him, court records said, and he also described his own prowess with firearms. In one conversation, the detective and Bolatete drove past the mosque on their way to the firing range. Bolatete said he expected bad news about his remaining kidney at an upcoming doctor's appointment and would then go to the mosque to kill worshippers, according to a transcript of the conversation in court documents: ""I have to bring my ... my long guns there and uh, stay at that, uh, tower. Keep shooting those Muslims, you know, on Friday. (laughing)"" Bolatete revealed he had considered how to access the minaret at the Islamic center, the documents said. And he told the detective he had five rifles. ""So we'll try ... we will try a Christian doing uh, terroristic [sic] act this time, hum, to the Muslims the, they [laughing] they doing it all the time. You know?"" he said, according to the court records. On a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Bolatete, he described himself as a shooting sport enthusiast and posted multiple photos of himself at a gun range. At least one post contained anti-Muslim propaganda — a fake news story headlined ""EVIL: Radical Muslims Rape, Make Woman Quote Quran, But How They 'Finish Her Off' Is the Worst."" In another conversation, the detective told a story about a Muslim man who hadn't paid him for work on the man's home. Bolatete offered advice to the detective on how to kill the man and get away with it, according to the court documents. On Nov. 24, the detective mentioned a friend was selling a firearm silencer. Three days later, Bolatete asked the detective if the silencer was still for sale because he ""might need it,"" court records said. Bolatete said he did not want to fill out paperwork to register the silencer because it would give authorities the right to search him, court records said. Bolatete was charged Friday on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm silencer, a federal offense. The purchase of the silencer was captured on an audio recording, according to court records. A Jacksonville Sheriff's Office SWAT team recovered it from Bolatete as they searched the room he was renting in a local home. The FBI then informed leaders at the Islamic center about the alleged plans as well as Bolatete's arrest. At no time during the investigation was anyone at the mosque at risk, FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. If convicted, Bolatete would face up to 10 years in prison, and he could still be charged with other offenses related to his alleged plans. A civil rights investigation is ongoing, Spencer added. ""[The FBI's mission] includes enforcing civil rights statutes and protecting the public’s right to exercise freedom of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" he said. ""A civil rights investigation is ongoing. The FBI will not stand for threats of violence in our community against any group, and we will protect the freedoms the Constitution provides."" The local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations praised the arrest of Bolatete, saying the attack he allegedly hoped to commit was an act of terrorism. ""This should concern not only Muslims, but all Florida residents regardless of faith,"" CAIR-Florida communications director Wilfredo Ruiz said in a statement. ""CAIR-Florida continues to work closely with our community to keep them safe by providing security training sessions in mosques and other locations throughout the state.""

Aldean was the headlining performer when a gunman opened fire at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday, Oct. 1. (Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File) (Amy Harris/Invision/AP) Jason Aldean is speaking out in his first interview since the mass shooting in Las Vegas that occurred during one of his shows. Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show, Aldean, who was on stage when a gunman opened fire on the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, said that he initially thought a speaker had blown when he heard a sound like a crackling over his in-ear monitors. After the shooting continued, he looked over to the side of the stage to figure out what was going on. ""When I turned to look, my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, like 'Let's go,'"" Aldean said. ""And my security guy was running on stage telling me to run."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino. SWAT teams with explosives then stormed his room and found he had killed himself. ""Everyone was scrambling, just didn't know what was going on,"" Aldean said. ""It was panic. That's probably the best way to describe it."" The country star cancelled some of his tour dates, but resumed touring about two weeks after the shooting. ""Honestly being back on stage probably helped us more than anything,"" he said. Aldean did not address gun control in the interview. ""At the end of the day, we're all in this together,"" Aldean said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time like working on the issue that is really the problem."" Aldean was joined in the interview by fellow country stars Dierks Bentley and Lady Antbellum, who were all gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday to raise money for hurricane and Las Vegas victims. The Country Rising concert, which also featured performances by George Strait and Chris Stapleton, raised more than $4 million for relief efforts. ""I just hope everybody can start to heal,"" Aldean said. ""Some of this stuff you can never get over. I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.

423,http://uproxx.com/news/las-vegas-mass-shooting/,"Getty Image Updates are available at the bottom of this story. A gunman opened fire on attendees of a country music festival outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas late Sunday night. At least 58 have been confirmed dead and over 515 have been injured, according to multiple reports. The Washington Post reports that lone male gunman was responsible for the carnage — later identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock — has been “confronted” and killed. The Post also noted that local police were “searching for a woman named Marilou Danley who was said to be the gunman’s ‘traveling companion.'” The authorities have since located her. Accounts of the attack that have emerged so far paint a gruesome and terrifying picture. According to the Las Vegas Journal Review, the shooter was “firing down at concertgoers from upper-level rooms at Mandalay Bay.” The attack came during the last performances on the final night of the three-day Route 91 country music festival, which has been held for the past four years on a 15-acre lot on Las Vegas Boulevard across from Mandalay Bay … Concertgoer Ivetta Saldana said Jason Aldean stopped in the middle of his performance and was rushed off the stage. She was there with a friend and said the shots sounded like fireworks. She said she hid in a sewer. “It was a horror show,” she said standing in Town Square shopping center south of the Strip. “People were standing around, then they hit the floor.” Matt and Robyn Webb from Orange County were watching the final performance of the night at Route 91 when the shooting started and people began to run for the exits. They said they sheltered underneath their seats as burst after burst of gunfire rained down from the direction of Mandalay Bay. “It just kept coming,” Robyn Webb said. “It was relentless.” Multiple reports have noted that the Mandalay Bay hotel was put on complete lockdown, and flights in and out of the nearby McCarren airport were suspended out of fear that a plane might be hit by the gunman’s bullets. Video footage captured by country fest goer Drew Akioshi embedded below provides a window into the moment the shooting started and gives a glimpse of the horror and chaos concert-goers experienced on Sunday night. From the sound of the gunfire, it appears as though the gunman used some sort of military grade, rapid-fire automatic weapon. Warning: the video is quite disturbing. UPDATE #1: NBC News was first to report at least 50 people have now died and over 200 have been injured. The suspect, who was shot and killed by police, has been identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock from Mesquite, Nevada, who had been living with Marilou Danley]. According to CBS News, authorities located Danley, who they believe was with Paddock before the shooting occurred, shortly after they began searching for her. UPDATE #2: Moments after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed with NBC News that Trump had been briefed on the events in Las Vegas, the president issued his first response to the shooting on Twitter. “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting,” he wrote. “God bless you!” My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #3: In an early morning press conference, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Paddock was firing down on the concert attendees from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. This is also where police ultimately confronted and killed the suspect.

US mass shootings. Las Vegas, 2017: 50+ killed Orlando, 2016: 50 killed Virginia Tech, 2007: 32 killed Sandy Hook, 2012: 27 killed San Ysirdo, 1984: 21 killed San Bernadino, 2015: 14 killed Edmond, 1986: 14 killed Fort Hood, 2009: 13 killed Columbine, 1999: 13 killed — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #5: Las Vegas Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed with CNN that at least a dozen guns and “a number of long rifles” were recovered from the suspect’s hotel room at the Mandalay Bay. Sheriff Lombardo and other law enforcement officials previously avoided providing a number of potential weapons when asked by reporters. There were at least 8 guns and a number of long rifles in the alleged shooter’s room, per Las Vegas Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #6: According to a new statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, an estimated 406 people were injured during Sunday night’s mass shooting. In addition, the LVMPD also revealed officers “found the suspect dead” when they breached his hotel room in the Mandalay Bay shortly thereafter. Sheriff Lombardo told reporters in a subsequent press conference they believe the suspect killed himself prior to their entry. Stephen Paddock, the shooter in the las Vegas massacre, is believed to have killed himself before police got it him. Had 10 rifles. — Tom Namako (@TomNamako) October 2, 2017  UPDATE #7: As the sun began to rise in Las Vegas, Fox News revealed a first look at the two windows allegedly blown out by the shooter on the 32nd story of the Mandalay Bay. It isn’t clear if only one or both of the windows, which were covered by blue tarps flapping in the wind, were used by the suspect during Sunday night’s mass shooting. First look at the 32nd floor where the shooter fired down onto the conert-goers https://t.co/rszdpxcb3W pic.twitter.com/aLobEpxTiF — Fox News (@FoxNews) October 2, 2017 UPDATE #8: Roi Kais, a correspondent with Israel’s English-language news service Ynet, reported ISIS is claiming responsibility for the Las Vegas shooting. The Islamic State also purportedly released a video depicting the city as a possible target last May. Considering what the authorities have said publicly about the suspect, however, there’s little evidence to suggest the claim is valid. UPDATE #9: FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse briefly commented on the claim made earlier by the Islamic State during a press conference. “As this the event unfolds, we have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,” he said. “As this investigation continues, we will continue to work with our partners to ensure this is factually, thoroughly and absolutely investigated to be able to bring comfort and peace back to this community.” BREAKING: Despite online claims, FBI says have found no connection with any int’l terror group in Las Vegas attack. https://t.co/JQMPbcbWs1 — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 2, 2017",2017-12-04 16:00:43,Over 50 Killed In Mass Shooting At Music Festival On Las Vegas Strip,,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

US Vice President Mike Pence shakes hands with Johnnie Langendorff, one of two men who chased the assailant, near the site of the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Nov. 8, 2017 Jonathan Bachman/Reuters Every time there's a mass shooting in the US, the same question comes up. Does the availability of guns lead to such tragedies? Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama, saw an opportunity to use data to provide an unambiguous answer. His paper, ""Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries,"" has been widely quoted as proof of a link between the frequency of mass shootings and handgun ownership. The US leads in both categories. Related: How other countries can help us understand America's mass shooting crisis Lankford dipped into databases and news articles that spanned from 1966 through 2012. Significantly, 1966 was the year Charles Whitman climbed the clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin and shot at people below for the next 96 minutes. The attack by the ""Texas Tower Sniper"" marked the beginning of an era of mass shootings. In order to make apples-to-apples comparisons between countries, Lankford came up with criteria that narrowly define a mass shooter. ""These were individuals who attacked, in public, using firearms, killing not only someone they had a grudge against, but also random strangers or bystanders,"" he says. ""And I was looking specifically at individuals who killed four or more victims, as kind of a baseline threshold."" He looked at school shootings, workplace shootings, theater shootings, church shootings, mosque shootings and the like. To qualify, killings couldn't be acts of organized terrorism or genocide. ""Violence committed in Rwanda or in Bosnia by a group of people with firearms who are exterminating the population, that kind of thing wouldn't count,"" he says. He concluded that, yes, the United States has the most mass shootings, overall and per capita. ""We had 31 percent of these offenders, despite the fact that we only have about 5 percent of the world's population. So, we have well more than our share. And of course, that's very concerning for a variety of reasons."" Lankford says comparing the US with other large countries shows how serious America's gun problem is: ""China and India would be two clear examples, and yet they don't have anywhere near the public mass shooter problem that we do."" Once he had determined the number of mass shootings that took place in different countries over the 46-year period, Lankford looked at different variables to see if countries with a high frequency of mass shootings shared any other patterns. ""This is not a matter of opinion; this is a matter of applying statistical models to data from all these 171 countries."" Lankford compared countries' homicide rates, their gross domestic product, their level of urbanization, the balance of men and women in their population and the frequency of suicide in each country. Nations with lots of mass shooters did not seem to have much in common until Lankford factored in the availability of guns. ""The difference between us and other countries, that explains why we have more of these attackers, was the firearm ownership rate. In other words: firearms per capita. We have almost double the firearm ownership rate of any other country."" Lankford says he expected the US to come out on top, but another finding did surprise him. ""I was a little surprised that it wasn't attributable to other things, like homicide rate or suicide rate. So, if you look at this on an individual level, these people are committing acts of homicide and they're often committing acts of murder-suicide and they're using firearms. But if you look cross-nationally, there are a lot of countries with more homicides and suicides than we have. And yet, they don't have this problem. It really was the firearms, and I was surprised at the strength of that statistical association."" He says his research underscored the influence of America's embrace of gun ownership. ""You could certainly make the argument, I think a lot of people would, that American gun culture is to some degree holding us back from real reform when it comes to guns. Purely in terms of numbers, we have more than 200 million more guns than the next highest country, which is India. And India has a much greater population than ours, so purely in terms of the number of guns, which is really the product of American gun culture, really, there's no comparison between us and anywhere else."" Lankford notes that other countries, by limiting gun ownership, show a lower incidence of mass shootings. And in at least one case, a country has begun to reduce mass shootings by decreasing the number of guns owned by the public. ""Australia is one example — they had a horrible mass shooting there a number of years ago and they did enact better gun control,"" he observes. ""They engaged in a gun buyback program that reduced the number of firearms in their country by 20 percent and they have seen major dividends in terms of fewer mass shootings in that country.""

425,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/507500642/0/phoenix/nation~Leave-it-to-the-NRA-to-hijack-the-first-bipartisan-gun-bill-in-years/,"Two months. Two horrific mass shootings that rocked America. Then, two gun bills in the House of Representatives. And one terrible idea from National Rifle Association headquarters. Leave it to the gun lobby to ruin a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. More: The day of the Sutherland Springs massacre, I went to buy a gun. I got a lesson instead. More: On gun control, there's nothing and everything left to say: Jill Lawrence There is a bill that is backed broadly in the House and has enough Senate Republican support to beat a filibuster. The “Fix NICS” Act would improve the gun-sale background check system simply by helping ensure that the staffs of federal agencies and states complete a couple more keystrokes and mouse clicks every day and submit more records into the system. It would even incentivize compliance, making it pay for states to do the job. Ultimately, more records in the system would make it less likely that a felon — or another convicted domestic abuser like November’s Texas church shooter — gets a gun and destroys lives. But some House members decided they had to carry the NRA’s water. Just days before Americans mark five years since the horrifying mass shooting at Sandy Hook School on Dec. 14, 2012, they hijacked this popular, common-sense bill and saddled it with the gun lobby’s top priority, “Concealed Carry Reciprocity.” They paired a sensible, urgently needed solution with the gun lobby’s biggest dream and passed them together, as a package, on Wednesday. It was a cynical, reckless gambit by the gun lobby and its allies. And it reduced to absurdity the so-called ""gun debate"" in this Congress. Talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul. As a package, “Fix NICS” would keep guns from domestic abusers — while “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would force states to allow people to carry concealed guns in public even if they are domestic abusers, have other dangerous histories, or lack even the most basic safety training to carry concealed guns in public. “Fix NICS” would decrease the chance that the next domestic violence call to which a cop responds involves an abuser with a firearm. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would leave local police powerless to stop people with dangerous histories from carrying guns. In short, “Fix NICS” would strengthen our gun laws. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would eviscerate them. The bad far outweighs the good, and it isn’t a close call. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would gut our gun laws because it would force each state to accept the concealed carry standards of every other state — even states that have weaker standards, or worse, no standards at all. And it would not establish a national standard for who is allowed to carry a hidden, loaded gun in public. More: Chris Matthews: RFK came around to pushing gun control. We should too. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media For example: Some states allow abusive dating partners or people with violence misdemeanor convictions to carry. During the House Judiciary Committee’s hearing on “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” last week, the committee chair found himself forced to admit that, yes, the bill would allow violent misdemeanants to carry concealed guns across the country. In addition, 12 states do not require a permit or a background check to carry. Nineteen states do not require any gun safety training in order to carry. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would make those weakest links the law of the land. It would do nothing to improve public safety. In fact, it would make America less safe. That’s the reason the opposition to “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” is so widespread. The American Prosecutors Association opposes it. So does the U.S. Conference of Mayors. So does the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, which includes many of America’s largest law enforcement organizations. “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” would force states to allow many people to concealed carry without a permit — a move the American people oppose, too. A Pew survey released in June found 81% of us oppose allowing people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. (Polling commissioned by Everytown for Gun Safety notably found opposition registering above 85% in a number of red states.) So, just weeks after two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, and as polls show the American public increasingly demanding stronger gun laws, there were two possible paths for the House. The one it chose was to let NRA headquarters run amok and try to impose its “guns everywhere” vision on America. The other path, the right path, is still an option in the Senate. It should listen to law enforcement and the American people, reject the combined “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” package and pass a clean version of “Fix NICS” to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.

I asked her to write this quick “How to Tweet” guide for the public. Liriel, a former nationally ranked gymnast, was a congressional reporter early in her career, then oversaw social media for the Half the Sky movement, and finally joined the Times in 2014 and has been with us since. Here’s her guide to how to make Twitter work for you. It’s easy to hate on Twitter. It recently ditched its trim 140-character identity to become (to the naysayers) a bloated 280 characters. It verified (then unverified) a white supremacist,
                                        but it suspended Rose McGowan’s Twitter account,
                                        leaving the initial impression it had to do with her speaking out about Harvey Weinstein. It enabled racist, misogynistic trolls to
                                        attack Leslie Jones. But for all its flaws, Twitter is where so much public debate happens, much of it fascinating. It’s where you can actually reach beyond your bubble. It’s where you can leapfrog publicists and aides
                                        and interact with your idols. Here are my suggestions for how you should use it — and why it’s worthwhile. Start by listening. There’s a misconception that the main use of Twitter is for self-promotion. Unless you’re @Beyonce,
                                        who has tweeted 10 times and has 15.2 million followers, chances are, you won’t have tons of followers when you’re starting out. Thoughtful tweeting certainly improves the platform as a whole, but
                                        you don’t need any followers to mine Twitter for useful information. Don’t just follow people you personally know. Follow people who are experts in your fields of interest. Maybe you like comedy, in which case Aparna Nancherla (@aparnapkin)

                                        in response to allegations about Roy Moore pushes back at the idea that a 14-year-old can consent to sex or sexual contact at that age.

                                        To make it a thread, reply to your previous tweet (instead of just composing a new tweet), so if someone clicks on one tweet, all the tweets will appear. And it’s good to number your tweets to signify that

                                        is what Michelle Goldberg does (@michelleinbklyn). If you’re feeling conflict-averse, block them. They
                                        won’t be able to follow you, and won’t see your tweets, and vice versa. If you really want to be protected, you can make your account private, in which case you need to grant permission for people
                                        to follow you. You can also confront them and retweet with a comment to your followers. If someone is being racist or misogynist, they’re fair game for being called on it. Use a profile photo. Make it easier for people to find you by using a photo, especially if your name isn’t unique. It also makes people who don’t know you less likely to mistake you for a troll
                                        or a bot. If someone is impersonating you or someone you know, report them.
                                        You can further personalize your profile by adding a header photo and 
                                        pinning a tweet that
                                        represents you for people coming to your profile for the first time who are deciding whether they want to follow you. Create or subscribe to lists about topics you care about. Say you’re conservative but want to keep tabs on what liberals are saying, without their tweets sullying your feed. You can create a “Democrats
                                        and liberals” list that follows accounts like Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi),

Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds when he killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others at a country music festival on the Strip last month, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told a local newspaper Wednesday. Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence. (Ret) Lt. Randy Sutton of Las Vegas Police on the mass murder's message. Paddock fired on a crowd of thousands who were attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino on the night of Oct. 1. He killed himself as police approached his suite. Lombardo added that authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said gunman Stephen Paddock had been depressed after losing a significant amount of money in the past two years
      (Erik Verduzco/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP, file) Nearly two months after the massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, authorities have yet to determine Paddock's motive or why he stopped shooting. In the weeks since the shooting, numerous conspiracy theories about Paddock have flourished. Lombardo told the Review-Journal he was ""frustrated"" by the proliferation of conspiracy theories and said he hoped to release more information about the shooting in the next two weeks. He added that federal investigators interviewed Paddock's girlfriend Marilou Danley earlier this week, but ""nothing substantial was obtained. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(AP) Attorneys who filed one of the first lawsuits after the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 concert-goers and left hundreds injured on the Las Vegas Strip filed four new negligence cases Monday on behalf of more than 450 victims. This time, however, Houston-based lawyers Chad Pinkerton and Mo Aziz filed the cases in Los Angeles against companies including MGM Resorts International, the corporate owner of both the Mandalay Bay resort and the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert venue. Pinkerton said the intent was to get the cases before a jury less likely to be influenced by the size and clout of a casino company that is both an active political contributor in Nevada and the largest employer in the state. ""Los Angeles is a better venue for fairness for our clients,"" Pinkerton said in a telephone interview ahead of a news conference announcing the filing of two wrongful death lawsuits, a third case stemming from a woman's head wound and a fourth on behalf of 450 people claiming injuries in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. ""There would be certain advantages for MGM to defend its case in Nevada,"" Pinkerton said, adding that a jury in MGM Resorts' hometown might include people with direct or indirect ties to the company and its more than 70,000 employees. The company has said through representatives it won't litigate shooting lawsuits in the media. In statements, it has blamed the massacre on the gunman, Stephen Paddock. Defendants in the new lawsuits also include Live Nation Entertainment, the concert promoter. In a statement, the Beverly Hills, California-based company expressed sorrow for ""countless people forever impacted by this senseless act of violence"" and said it was cooperating with an active FBI investigation. It declined to comment about the lawsuits. Documents submitted Monday in Los Angeles also seek compensation from Paddock's estate. They included a refiling of a negligence claim originally filed Oct. 10 in Las Vegas on behalf of a wounded California woman, Paige Gasper, with four new plaintiffs added. Gasper's original case was dismissed Friday in Nevada. ""Most of our clients from California."" Pinkerton said. ""Most all are getting their treatment here."" The lawsuits do not seek class-action status, but Aziz said he expects they will be consolidated during pretrial investigations and evidence exchanges. The new lawsuits followed a wave of cases filed last week in Nevada state court in Las Vegas on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot, injured or say they were traumatized trying to escape. A Chicago law firm helped prepare those filings, involving plaintiffs from the Chicago area and a California man who was shot and wounded. Police and the FBI say the 64-year-old Paddock rained bursts of gunfire for 10 minutes from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people in the concert venue across Las Vegas Boulevard. Paddock, a high-stakes video poker gambler with homes in Reno and the southern Nevada resort town of Mesquite spent several days amassing an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammunition in a two-room suite. Authorities say he killed himself before officers reached his room. A motive for the deadly rampage has not been identified. Plaintiffs in mass-shooting lawsuits face a high legal bar to prove responsibility and liability by someone other than the shooter, and lawsuits can take years in court. But Pinkerton said he believes he can show that tragedy could have been avoided if hotel and corporate officials followed hotel weapon possession policies already in place and implemented recent safety recommendations. ""We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that,"" the lawyer said. ""This was the largest venue security failure in U.S. history.""

          / CBS/AP LAS VEGAS -- The top lawman in Las Vegas says the gunman who killed dozens of people at a concert last month fired more than 1,100 rounds. The newly released estimate from Sheriff Joe Lombardo offers more detail about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Lombardo tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the music festival below before killing himself. Authorities have said they have not determined Paddock's motive or why he stopped shooting. Lombardo says authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite. He said he is frustrated by the lack of progress in determining a motive. Lombardo said police continue to interview Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, most recently on Monday.

The gun legislation the senators announced on Thursday morning would not require a background check on every single gun sale, despite new polling data showing that 95% of Americans – a record high – support these universal background checks.  Instead, the compromise legislation would simply add new accountability measures to make sure states and federal agencies are entering the proper records into the background check system. For years, the federal database that is supposed to stop dangerous people from buying guns has been undermined by missing records. At least three of America’s most high-profile mass shooters were legally barred from buying guns, but were able to purchase them anyway because of the federal system’s failures. Among them was the gunman who murdered 26 people in a Texas church this month. Early reports from the mass shooting in northern California on Tuesday, which left five dead and included an attack on an elementary school, also suggested the shooter had been barred from owning firearms by a court order. Federal agencies, including the military, are already required by law to submit records to the gun background checks system, under a 2008 measure passed in the wake of the Virginia Tech University shooting a decade ago, which left 32 people dead. But the air force announced after the Texas shooting that it had failed to submit the record of the Sutherland Springs church shooter’s 2012 domestic violence conviction to the background check system, allowing him to legally purchase multiple firearms in the years that followed. It’s not yet clear how widespread the failure to submit military domestic violence convictions may have been. Officials for the Department of Defense and the air force have announced they are investigating the issue. “For years agencies and states haven’t complied with the law, failing to upload these critical records without consequence,” John Cornyn, a Texas Republican co-sponsoring the bill, said on Thursday. “This bill aims to help fix what’s become a nationwide, systemic problem so we can better prevent criminals and domestic abusers from obtaining firearms.” Cornyn has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. The new legislation was introduced by four Republicans and four Democrats, and requires states and federal agencies to release public “implementation plans” describing how they ensure that “all information” is entered into the system. The bills increases requirements for public scrutiny of how many records federal agencies are contributing to the background check system. A Democratic co-sponsor said the legislation on Thursday called the new legislation a “big deal” and said: ‘The reforms aren’t window dressing.” Chris Murphy of Connecticut, whose gun control advocacy has been shaped by the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, said: “It’s no secret that I believe much more needs to be done. But this bill will make sure that thousands of dangerous people are prevented from buying guns.” Murphy led a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor last year in the wake of the mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando. A spokesperson for the NRA did not immediately respond for a request for comment. The group called the 2008 NICS Improvement Act “a win for American gun owners.” Murphy praised Cornyn’s work on the bill and said the legislation “provides the foundation for more compromise in the future”. Gun violence prevention advocates said new legislation was needed to ensure compliance with the current system, and that even if the new legislation passed, many loopholes would still remain in the law. “The failures are so stark here, and the danger to the public is so stark, so I think there’s clearly a need for some dramatic action,” said Lindsay Nichols, the federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nicols said it was not clear how many other gun murders might have been stopped if the military’s background check reporting had been fixed earlier. “If the air force failed to report somebody, and instead of resulting in the deaths of 26 people in a church, it resulted in the death of one person on the streets of Chicago, it probably would not have sparked the same national conversation,” she said. “I don’t know if we’d even know about it.” For years, Republicans in Congress have blocked any attempt to pass new gun control laws. But they have shown willingness to try to force compliance, once again, with current law. In 2007, after a mass shooting at Virginia Tech University left 32 people dead, Congress passed a new law that attempted to close holes in the background check system. The Virginia Tech perpetrator, a senior at the university, had been able to buy a gun because the mental health record that would have disqualified him from gun ownership had not been entered into the system. The bipartisan law, signed by George W Bush, offered financial incentives to help states to put their disqualifying mental health records into the background check system, so the error that left dozens of Americans dead would not be repeated again. A decade later, mental health record reporting has improved, but it’s still far from complete. National Rifle Association-approved compromises inserted into the legislation to allow people with past mental health records to restore their gun rights have undermined the effort, a 2013 ProPublica investigation found. Other changes to the background check process might also improve safety. In 2015, a white supremacist who went on to murder nine people in a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, was able to buy a gun because a background check investigator juggling multiple cases could not immediately locate the arrest record that contained the admission that he had used illegal drugs. Because current law allows gun stores to sell a firearm if an investigation into the status of the buyer goes on for more than three days, the stalled investigation meant that the shooter was allowed to legally purchase a gun. The Charleston shooting “could have been prevented if there were more time for the background check system to work”, Nichols said. But changing the law to allow for more than three days to block a gun sale is “not part of the conversation, and it would be good if it were”. America’s debate over gun control has remained deadlocked since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. The shooting prompted the US Senate to debate legislation in April 2013 that would have expanded background checks, but the bill failed to clear even a procedural vote with all but four Republicans voting against it. Four Democrats also joined Republicans in killing the measure, delivering a blow to gun control advocates and Barack Obama, who made the strengthening of gun laws a priority of his second term. But even as a series of deadly shootings have come to pass, gun-related legislation has been stymied on Capitol Hill amid steep opposition from Republicans and the NRA. In addition to the failed vote on background checks in 2013, the Senate twice rejected proposals to prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. The latter votes followed both the Orlando massacre in June 2016, which left 49 dead and 58 others wounded, and the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 people were killed and 22 more were injured at an office holiday party. In both incidents, the perpetrators claimed to be inspired by Islamic State.",2017-11-16 11:18:37,Senate's new background checks gun bill simply enforces current law,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

          / CBS News This week the House is expected to pass a bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, that would allow gun owners with a state-issued concealed carry permit to carry a handgun in any state that allows concealed weapons. While the majority of Americans are calling for stricter gun laws in light of several mass shootings, including America's most deadly mass-shooting to date in Las Vegas this past October, the powerful gun lobbying group has called the bill its ""highest legislative priority in Congress."" If passed, the legislation would be a major win for the National Rifle Association (NRA), which faced a tough series of election losses this past year. Several special election candidates backed by the NRA since President Trump's victory -- such as Republican candidate in the Virginia governor's race Ed Gillespie and Republican Alabama Senate primary candidate Luther Strange -- have failed. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee backed concealed carry bill. While the legislation is likely to pass the House, it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it will need 60 votes to pass.

By ELIANA JOHNSON and ANNIE KARNI 11/15/2017 05:03 AM EST Updated 11/15/2017 07:25 AM EST Mike Pompeo has established himself as a Cabinet member willing to perform uncomfortable cleanup duty for the president. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo President Donald Trump has turned his daily intelligence briefing — a routine that in previous administrations has been a dry, formal affair — into a free-flowing conversation during which he peppers his CIA director, former House member Mike Pompeo, with questions about everything from national security threats to the internal dynamics of Congress. After their 10 a.m. sessions, which Pompeo conducts in person about four mornings a week, Trump often asks Pompeo to accompany him to his next meeting — whatever it is. The CIA director’s favored status in the West Wing has made him the odds-on choice to succeed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, according to more than half a dozen administration officials and outside advisers familiar with the White House’s current plans. It’s not clear when Tillerson might leave — he has vigorously denied rumors that he plans to resign anytime soon — but Pompeo has told associates that he expects the president to tap him for the position and that he’d accept the job if it’s offered to him. Trump’s relationship with Pompeo mirrors the close bond he developed with John Kelly while the retired Marine general was serving as secretary of Homeland Security — and he promoted Kelly to chief of staff within six months, replacing former Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus. “Like President Trump, Director Pompeo is clear-eyed and hard-nosed about the threats we face, and he speaks in the direct, blunt manner of a man who has no time to waste when confronting those threats,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who served alongside Pompeo in the House. Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

A White House spokesman said Trump has no personnel announcements to make and that the president’s relationship with Tillerson remains strong. “The president is very pleased with his entire national security team, which includes Secretary Tillerson and Director Pompeo,” said Raj Shah, the White House’s principal deputy press secretary. “Together, they have led the world toward unprecedented pressure on North Korea, are crushing ISIS in Iraq and Syria and have convinced NATO members to contribute more to the common defense.” Pompeo is an amalgam of the qualities the president prizes most among his subordinates, from sterling academic credentials to military valor and business success. When introducing Pompeo, Trump frequently cites the fact that he was the top graduate in his West Point class or that he attended Harvard Law School. Pompeo went on to found an aerospace and private security company before running for Congress in 2010. As a staunch conservative and a foreign policy hawk, he is also a closer ideological match with Trump than the former ExxonMobil chief executive, an establishment Republican who has routinely clashed with the White House. “Trump likes guys who finished first at West Point; that’s a Trump kind of guy,” said a friend of Pompeo’s. “He also likes people who have had considerable business and wealth-creating success.” Pompeo has established himself as a Cabinet member willing to perform uncomfortable cleanup duty for the president, defending Trump at some of the lowest points of his presidency. He made the Sunday show rounds to defend the president’s response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August, even as other administration officials went silent. Last week, he took a meeting at Trump’s request with Willian Binney, a conspiracy theorist who has denied any Russian interference in the 2016 election, which appeared to lend credence to a theory that has been discredited by the CIA and every other American intelligence agency. Pompeo has, however, publicly broken with the president over the question of Russian interference in the election, making clear that the CIA’s view differs from that of the president himself, who has steadfastly refused to say explicitly that he believes in Russian malfeasance. When Trump on Saturday said that he believed Vladimir Putin was sincere when he denied any meddling, the CIA reiterated that the agency stood by its assessment that the Kremlin was behind email hacks and social media campaigns designed to benefit Trump. Yet, whereas Tillerson has consistently worked to counter the president’s hawkish instincts, pushing to open talks with North Korea and opposing the decertification of the Iran nuclear deal, for example, Pompeo’s views are more in tune with the president’s views on foreign policy. Foreign Policy By NAHAL TOOSI “Pompeo is a skeptic toward the traditional thinking in Washington about Iran and North Korea,” said Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, a former deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush. “Tillerson pushed back on policy things and at times he reflected that there’s always a diplomatic solution. Pompeo will think outside the box. He’s also willing to not attack Trump openly, which most of this administration seems willing to do.” While Trump initially viewed Tillerson as a peer in the Cabinet — another plain-spoken millionaire who had achieved considerable business success — the relationship was quickly strained, with his status as the nation’s top diplomat challenged by presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. Trump publicly vetoed his first-choice deputy, Elliott Abrams, just weeks into the new administration. Since then, the two have clashed on issues ranging from trade and immigration to the decertification of the Iran deal. Few believe anymore that he speaks for the president — a privilege required for a secretary of state to conduct diplomacy. In a remarkable news conference last month, Tillerson publicly swatted down rumors of his imminent resignation after NBC News reported that he had privately called the president a “moron.” His refusal to explicitly refute that charge, however, sent the president, who at the time was aboard Air Force One en route to Las Vegas to console survivors of a mass shooting, into a rage, according to White House officials who traveled with him. Pompeo has told associates that he is in no rush to leave the CIA and would happily serve there for eight years — but that, if asked to take another position in the administration, he prefers one where he would grapple with some serious challenges. “This has never been a topic discussed during the secretary’s regular breakfast meetings with the director,” said State Department spokesman R.C. Hammond. “I do know they discuss the national security challenges facing the United States and coordinate how they are implementing the president’s strategies for protecting our country.” The CIA declined to comment for this story. During his time at the CIA, Pompeo has made it a goal to put the agency on a more aggressive footing, making it more agile and increasing the number of clandestine agents sent into the field. “We’re back in the business of stealing secrets,” Pompeo told reporters last spring, a tacit critique of his Obama administration predecessor, John Brennan, who rankled agency veterans last year when he told NPR that the U.S. government doesn’t “steal secrets.” How Pompeo would fare in a diplomatic role, overseeing a department with about 75,000 employees, is less clear. Elected to Congress to represent Kansas’ 4th District in the tea party wave of 2010, Pompeo quickly emerged as one of the GOP’s rising stars — an unabashed partisan with an instinct for the political jugular and the brains to back it up. Along with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), he wrote a 48-page addendum to the final report submitted by the House Select Committee on Benghazi — not to dispute any of its findings, but merely to highlight some of its conclusions, including what they characterized as the Obama administration’s willful public deception about the attacks for political reasons. As Pompeo’s relationship with the president has deepened, people close to Trump say he has cooled on the idea of nominating U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to succeed Tillerson. Haley has been perhaps the most visible face of American foreign policy in the Trump administration. Though she has often been mentioned as a potential successor to Tillerson, Haley late last month told CNN that she “would not take” the secretary of state job if it was offered to her. The president has been turned off in part by speculation that Haley has her eyes on a presidential bid, two people close to the president said. Like Pompeo, she is more in tune with the Trump foreign policy agenda than Tillerson — but unlike the CIA director, she has cultivated a media profile. Appearing frequently on the Sunday morning talk-show circuit on the administration’s behalf, she quickly eclipsed Tillerson as the administration’s leading diplomat. A senior White House official said that for a president who likes to be the center of attention, Haley “flew too close to the sun.” Pompeo was confirmed by the Senate two days after the president’s inauguration in late January, and he has been participating in Trump’s morning intelligence briefings ever since. By LOUIS NELSON Since the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created in 2005 to integrate the intelligence collected across numerous U.S. agencies, however, that office has been responsible for producing and performing the President’s Daily Brief, or PDB — the daily briefings presidents receive on the most pressing intelligence and national security threats. When Dan Coats, the president’s director of national intelligence, was confirmed in mid-March, the assumption was that he would take over the briefings — but Trump asked Pompeo to keep making the trip downtown from Langley. Pompeo’s almost-daily presence at the White House marks a departure from the past 12 years, when the director of national intelligence and more junior CIA officials typically delivered the briefing, though the CIA director has always participated on occasion. POLITICO reported in June that Pompeo spends so much time in the White House that he set up a temporary office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. “A big chunk of his day is structured around doing these personal briefings for the president,” said one person close to both Trump and Pompeo. “I think he probably spends more time with Trump than anyone who works on national security other than [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster.” Pompeo’s friends said he worries that may change if he moves to Foggy Bottom. “He has this very close relationship with Trump, and you can’t nurture it the same way when you’re traveling all the time,” Jeffrey said. “He wants to maintain a close relationship with Trump, and as long as Trump is president, that’s a good thing.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" November 12, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY"" HOST: I’m Chris Wallace. The push for tax reform heats up as a Republicans face growing political pressure to produce. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is about actually improving people's lives and making a positive difference. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: If they think that this is the bill that they must pass in order to stay in power, they have it all wrong. WALLACE: We’ll discuss what’s in the House and Senate plans and whether Republicans have the votes with a point man on tax reform, Republican Chairman Kevin Brady. Then, after sweeping election losses this week, the GOP is now dealing with growing calls for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside. ROY MOORE, R-ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE: These attacks involve a minor, and they are completely false and untrue. WALLACE: We’ll discuss what it means for the special election with Chris Van Hollen, head of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm. Plus, President Trump on the world stage, taking his America first message abroad. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore. WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel about the president's trip to Asia and his latest comments about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. And our power player of the week, a new high-tech museum for the good book. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The bible is, love it or hate it, it’s just one of the great reads of all time. WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday."" (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. We begin with breaking news. President Trump dealing with a new controversy when he seems to suggest after meeting with Vladimir Putin he believes Putin's denial of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. White House correspondent Kevin Corke reports from the Philippines. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: As to whether I believe it or not, I’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In attempting to clear up confusion over whether he accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials of meddling in the U.S. election last year, President Trump to the surprise of many repeated his beliefs Saturday that Putin was sincerely convinced that there was no meddling. TRUMP: I think it was very obvious to everybody. I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes. CORKE: However, U.S. intelligence agencies have long since concluded that there was meddling. The president’s recalibrated explanation threatens to overshadow his final stop in this five-country Asia tour, and followed a firestorm of criticism back home. There's nothing America first about taking the board of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community, said Arizona Senator John McCain in a statement. Trump said he wasn’t interested in arguing over meddling, and instead wanted to get Russia to work with the U.S. on problems like North Korea, Syria and Ukraine. The president taken to Twitter to slam his critics, writing: When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing? (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: In another tweet, the president actually took a swipe, Chris, at the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, who has repeatedly called the 71-year-old commander-in-chief old. The president tweeting: Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me old when I would never call him short and fat? The president added that he’d been working hard to become his friend, and despite the dustup, was holding out hope that that could still happen. Good luck with that -- Chris. WALLACE: Kevin Corke traveling with the president in the Philippines -- Kevin, thank you. Now to the push by Republicans to pass tax reform. Both chambers take up separate proposals this week that have big differences, while the House appears on track to pass its version, the process is just beginning in the Senate. If the goal is to get on the same page and send a compromise to the president by Christmas. Joining me now from Texas, Congressman Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee that passed its tax plan this week. Chairman, the biggest difference between the House and Senate tax plan seems to be over the question of deducting state and local taxes. Let's drill down on this, your bill lets people deduct $10,000 in property taxes on their federal returns. The Senate plans kills all the deductions for state and local taxes. And Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says that if they eliminate those state and local taxes, it could cost Republicans the House in 2018. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I say to every one of my Republican colleagues in the House who come from a suburban district, this bill could be your political doom. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Chairman, you've got more than two dozen Republican congressman from high tax states. Can you guarantee them -- because they are threatening to vote against an elimination of all the state and local tax deductions, can you guarantee them that the final bill they vote on will not include the total elimination in the Senate plan? REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIR, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: Yes -- well, I can. And here's why, because we want people to get more of what they aren't regardless of where they live, including in these high tax states. That's why we keep the home mortgage deduction, we keep the charitable deduction. We restore $10,000 of the property tax deduction, which is twice the national average, but we didn't stop there for these states. So, the way we set the income brackets, we created this new family tax credit that is eligible for families up to $230,000 of income, and we restored the state and local property tax deduction. WALLACE: I understand that -- BRADY: So, the combination of all of these gets the job done for these families. WALLACE: But, Chairman, how can you guarantee House members from blue states that the Senate plan, the total elimination will not be in the final bill? BRADY: Look, I’m convinced that this is where we will end up because this is -- it’s important, again, as I told you, Chris, make sure people keep more of what they earn, even in these high tax states. And so, what we are working toward, and what we work so carefully with, our lawmakers from New York and California, New Jersey, is to make sure we deliver this relief, and I’m committed to it. WALLACE: So, are you saying then that the House will not accept a total elimination, that that just won't fly even if the Senate passes it? BRADY: That's what I’m saying. WALLACE: Good, thank you. I want to go through some other big differences between the House and Senate plans. They are technical but they are important, as you well know, to every individual taxpayer. For wealthy people and businesses, your bill, the House Republican bill, repeals the estate tax over six years and cuts the corporate rate to 20 percent right away. The Senate plan delays that corporate rate cut a year, and does not repeal the estate tax ever. But with the money that the Senate plan saves, while you eliminate the deductions for medical expenses and student loans, the Senate would allow people to keep taking those deductions. My question is, isn't the Senate plan better for the middle class taxpayer than your plan is? BRADY: Yes, I don't believe so. But here's the point. I think I know that everyone is stressing the differences. There are some. But there’s far more common ground. And in this regard, look, on the death tax, I’m just convinced this is the number one reason our family owned farms and businesses aren't passed down to the next generation. Having Washington swoop in and take almost half of what you've earned over your lifetime over certain amount is just wrong, and getting rid of it creates 140,000 new American jobs because our local businesses aren't hindered by it. And so, I’m convinced it needs to go, I also believe we delivered dramatic middle class tax relief all up and down that area, especially for suburbs and rural communities that I represent. WALLACE: But, Chairman Brady, I want to show you two independent analyses that seem to contradict what you just said. ""The New York Times"" says under your plan, about one-third of middle class families will get a tax increase, not a tax cut, next year. And the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, this is bipartisan, as I say, it says that 8.3 percent of all taxpayers will get a tax increase in 2019. In both cases, Chairman Brady, these analyses say that middle-class families under your plan, some of them, millions of them will get a tax increase, not a tax cut. BRADY: So, here is where I strongly disagree. I believe there is tax relief all up and down the income level for families, regardless of what they earn. And Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed every income bracket sees a tax relief. And as far as ""The New York Times"" analysis, look, they are describing an America that doesn't exist. One where the economy never grows, and one where your paycheck stay stagnant no matter what happens. We know that's not the real world, both from the John F. Kennedy proposed tax cuts and from the Reagan tax cuts as well. When you get the tax code right, where our local businesses can compete and win anywhere in world, when Washington takes less of what you earn, the economy does grow and paychecks do grow. And so, I strongly disagree with analysis by ""The New York Times"". WALLACE: But would you agree -- and you’re exactly right that in all of these analyses, if you take each tax bracket, there is a net tax cut. But would you agree that there are going to be a sizable number of middle-class families, families that for instance now get the state and local tax deductions, families that have big medical expenses they can deduct, families that are deducting the interest for their student loans, that there are a lot of those families that could actually be losers in this bill? BRADY: See, I don't, Chris, and here's why -- look, we are both taxing less, we are eliminating a lot of these deductions so we can lower the tax rates for every American, but we’re not just stopping there. We’re talking about an economy that grows paychecks in a way that we haven't seen for really almost two decades if you think about it. And that’s what helps families the most. They are keeping more of what they earn, their paychecks are finally growing. This economy is finally moving again. So, look, I firmly believe Americans are far better off under tax reform than they ever would sticking with this old messed up, outdated tax code. WALLACE: I want to turn to a different aspect of this, sir. I talked with a number of top financial analysts this week, none of them said that having a tax cut -- a lot of them supported the idea of a tax cut, but none of them said that having a tax cut, a lot of them supported the idea of a tax cut, but none of them said that having a tax cut that will add one and a half trillion dollars to the national debt, which is what your plan does, that that’s good for the economy. BRADY: Well, I tell you what, I disagree here. So, during the Obama administration, they would add one and a half trillion dollars of deficit every year. That was to grow Washington. We’re talking about the same amount spread out over a decade to grow the economy and grow jobs. This is a good investment and, in fact, if we just grow the economy slightly over the last decade, slow growth, you would recoup the trillion dollars easily, and if we really get this economy moving, you recoup all of it, plus more. So, I will tell you the surest way to guarantee more deficits and more debt is just stick with the current tax code, stick with the current economy. I guarantee it won't be a good ending. It's time to change and challenge the status quo in this tax code. WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the prospects for all of this, because that’s the bottom line. President Trump called into a meeting of Senate Democrats this week and he reportedly said this. He told them about the Senate plan: You’re going to like it, the Senate plan, a whole lot more than a House plan. I don't have to remind you, because you lived through it, that after the House passed Obamacare repeal and replace, the president later said that he thought the plan was a little bit mean. Aren't you asking some of your members to take what is a tough political vote when the president may, in the end, after they vote that and you pass it, walk away from the House plan and support the Senate plan? BRADY: So, I don't believe he will, and here's why. His regular conversations with me tell me he likes the direction we’re going in a big way. We are writing towards that framework that the president, the House and Senate came together on earlier this fall. He also know -- he also likes the fact not only are we delivering middle-class tax relief, for the first time, our local businesses are going to be able to compete and win anywhere in the world, and when they win, we will no longer tax them to bring their earnings back home to be reinvested in the United States of America. So, I’ll just tell you, I think we’re making significant changes in this tax code in a real positive way and this is what the president backs. WALLACE: So, how do you explain? What you make of the president saying to Senate Democrats, I think you’ll like the Senate plan a lot more? BRADY: Well, I know that's the Senate Democrats description of the call. All I can tell you is my conversation by telephone with the president are extremely positive and so, the House is going to take a major step, as it did this week in the Ways and Means Committee for the first time in 31 years to fix this messed up, broken tax code, and from there, it goes to the Senate. I have no doubt we’re going to find common ground and work out the differences. WALLACE: All right. Let's get to the bottom line, will the House pass your tax plan, or the tax plan by Thanksgiving, as now scheduled, which is just 11 days away? BRADY: I believe it will. I feel the strong support for this. We continue to make improvements every step of the way, but I will tell you what, our Republicans in the House know that it is time to deliver on this economy and grow these paychecks by getting rid of this current tax code, that's exactly what we’re going to do. And, by the way, the American people, they are starved. They are starved for a new tax code, one that’s so simple and fair. Most Americans will be able to file using a simple postcard style system, where they are eager for that simplicity and that fairness. WALLACE: Again, finally on that deadline, can you say that with 100 percent certainty, you’ll pass it before Thanksgiving? BRADY: Look, that's our goal and that's what we’re on schedule to do. At the end of the day, what I want to do is deliver it to the president's desk by the end of the year. Not for Republicans, but for the American people. WALLACE: Chairman Brady, thank you, and we will track progress on tax reform in the House next week. BRADY: Thank you, Chris. WALLACE: Up next, disturbing allegations against Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama in the wake of Democratic victories across the country on Election Day. We’ll talk with Senator Chris Van Hollen, the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, about his party's prospects to take back control of both the House and Senate in 2018. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: This week, allegations of sexual misconduct that date back decades surfaced against Alabama Senate candidate, Judge Roy Moore. Top Republicans took back endorsements and cut off fund-raising efforts for Moore. Alabama's special election is on December 12 and with the GOP now holding a slim two vote majority in the Senate, what happens in Alabama could determine the fate of tax reform and the rest of the Trump agenda. Joining us now, Senator Chris Van Hollen, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Congressman, Roy Moore has flatly denied any improper relationship with teenagers. Sean Hannity asked him about some of the specifics on Friday. Here it is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you remember dating girls that young at that time? ROY MOORE, R-ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE: Not generally, no. HANNITY: But you don't specifically remember having any girlfriend that was in her late teens even in that time? MOORE: No, I don't remember that, and I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother. (END AUDIO CLIP) WALLACE: Senator, your reaction? SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, D-MD, CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE: Well, Chris, I think Roy Moore is unfit for office, but this is going to be a decision obviously for the people of Alabama. And the good news for the people of Alabama is they have a clear alternative in Doug Jones, who grew up in Alabama. He became a prosecutor. He is focused on jobs. He's focused on increasing people's wages. He's focused on the things people in Alabama care about and he's running a good campaign. So, I’m not going to get into all these details because it's the people of Alabama who will decide. But those who have, people like Senator Bill Cassidy, obviously withdrew their endorsements. So, let’s let the people of Alabama decide. But the good news as I said is they have a great alternative in Doug Jones. WALLACE: Let me ask you, what do you think now? The polls have tightened considerably, what do you think are the chances that the Democratic candidate Doug Jones will actually win in the deep red state of Alabama? And what about the notion that is being discussed with these new revelations the governor of Alabama postponing, delaying the special election next month? VAN HOLLEN: Well, Chris, Doug Jones, again, is talking about all the issues that are important to people there in the state of Alabama. His focus has been on economic issues, kitchen table issues. So, look, we all know that Alabama is a very tough state politically for Democrats, but this is a special situation where we have a great candidate. On the other hand, you have a very, very flawed candidate in Roy Moore, which is why many people are calling upon him to step down. But I’m going to leave this to the people of Alabama. This is their decision. They are getting the facts now, and they need to make a decision based on the records of these two candidates. WALLACE: One more question on this subject. From the president to Senate Republican leaders, a number of them are saying that Moore should step down if the allegations are proven. Here is fellow Alabama Senator Richard Shelby. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD SHELBY, R-ALABAMA: This is a devastating, nasty story. If the revelations -- if that's true, I don't believe there would be any place for him in the U.S. Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Is that reasonable? I understand I don't want or expect you to get into the specific allegations, but is not reasonable when you have allegations that date back in some cases almost 40 years, let's see some proof? VAN HOLLEN: Well, again, people like Senator Bill Cassidy have looked at the facts and we know what conclusion he drew. My view, Chris, is that Roy Moore was really unfit for the Senate even before these recent revelations. For example, there is ample evidence, this was also reported in ""The Washington Post,"" very detailed reporting that he essentially cheated a charity that he was involved in for his personal, a private gain. So, again, there are lots of facts out there about these issues and the people of Alabama will make up their minds. But I hope they will look at the facts because you got a candidate in Doug Jones who has been sticking to the issues that people really care about -- issues about health care, issues about tax policy that’s going to impact the people of Alabama, educating the children in Alabama. Those are going to be the important issues and I think Doug Jones has shown is a candidate who has a record that can actually help Alabama. But that -- that’s up to the state to decide. WALLACE: Understood. Let's talk about this question of allegations, and allegations particularly of sexual misconduct, which often can't be proven one way or another. It’s going to end up being a he said/she said. Let’s take the case of Bill Clinton, for instance. As you well know, there were allegations of sexual misconduct, even rape against Bill Clinton. Democrats nominated him, elected him president. There was strong indication -- Bill Clinton basically admitted that he had lied to the country about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and yet Democrats fought his impeachment. Is there a double standard here? VAN HOLLEN: Chris, I don't think there’s any double standard here. You were also talking in this case, as you know, about allegations of child sexual abuse. We know what the allegations are, the people of Alabama will have to look at the facts, search their conscience and make a decision. So, I think that's always the case when you have revelations like this. But the bottom line is that Doug Jones is focusing on issues like health care and the fact that you saw a Republican Congress try to take away people's access to affordable health care, and he’s talking but having a tax code that actually works for working people instead of a giveaway to big corporations and the superrich. WALLACE: As long as we’re -- and this is, I promise, my final question in this regard, Senator. As long as we're talking about allegations, a jury in New Jersey is right now considering, not allegations, but charges of political corruption against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez. If that jury convicts him, convict him, not allegations, but a conviction, should he step down? VAN HOLLEN: Chris, he -- we’re going to leave this decision to the jury and I’m not going to get ahead of the game. People on the jury will look at the facts, just like people in Alabama will have to look at the facts, and they’ll have to render a decision. And I’m not going to speculate about what the outcome of that jury decision will be. WALLACE: You, as we pointed out, are the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Democrats had a very big night Tuesday with sweeping elections, the governor's race in New Jersey, the governor's race in Virginia, down ballot as well. Here was Virginia’s new governor-elect, Ralph Northam. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RALPH NORTHAM, D-VIRGINIA GOVERNOR-ELECT: Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness that we will not condone, hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Senator, is there a national message in the vote this week? VAN HOLLEN: There certainly is a message in the fact that you had a huge grassroots turnout in these elections and it's not just that the Democratic, you know, won in the Virginia, the governor's race, but the size of that margin and the scope of the victories. And victories across the country, including in Georgia, New Hampshire, Washington state, even some mayoral races in my state of Maryland. So, it's that scope that showed really huge motivation and turnout. The question, of course, is whether that will be sustained, and I can tell you, a lot of people were really upset that Donald Trump and Republicans tried to take away their access to affordable health care, and they’re going to be really mad when they -- if they try and pass this huge giveaway to big corporations that's going to be paid for by millions of middle-class families. So, those are the kinds of things that are going to keep people motivated to come out. WALLACE: Well, let's talk in the time we have left about the tax plan, and let’s talk first of all about the middle class. The vast majority of low and middle income Americans do not itemize their deductions, doesn't doubling the standard deduction, doesn't that benefit -- I mean, I certainly pointed out as you heard me with Chairman Brady that there are some people who are going to be hurt. But doesn't doubling the deduction dramatically help most low and middle income voters? VAN HOLLEN: As you know, Chris, while they doubled the standard deduction, they also took away with the other hand the ability of people to take their personal exemptions for themselves and dependents. And when you washed out all out, the reality is that many families, many middle-class families are going to end up paying more, especially when you take away people's ability to deduct their state and local taxes. And the folks in the suburbs are going to get clobbered. As you mentioned in your earlier segment, ""The New York Times"" analysis, and they used I believe software from a more conservative group, concluded that almost half of middle-class Americans would actually be paying more, and they look at the Senate bill and concluded about a third of middle-class taxpayers would be paying more under the Senate bill. So, that's why Paul Ryan, Speaker Ryan and Mitch McConnell this week both had to walk back their statements where they had earlier said that there wasn't going to be any impact on middle-class taxpayers. In fact, millions and millions of middle-class taxpayers are going to pay more so big corporations can pay less. And folks in the suburbs are going to be particularly clobbered. WALLACE: All right. Let me ask you, I’ve got one last question, and it has to do with this issue of corporations, and, you know, the Democratic line -- I’ve heard it from you, I’ve heard from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. This is a giveaway to big corporations. But you certainly have to agree that the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is 35 percent, which is, no question about it, the highest in the world. What’s wrong with lowering it to 20 percent, which puts it in line with other industrialized nations in the world? What's wrong with making us more competitive, won't that boost those corporations, boost growth, boost wages, boost jobs? VAN HOLLEN: So, a couple of things, Chris. First, you know that the effective U.S. corporate tax rate is much lower. Some people put it around 20 percent because corporations take a lot of these deductions. But we could do corporate tax reform, but we should do it a way that doesn't boost the national debt by 1.5 trillion, and still ask millions of middle-class taxpayers to pay for it. Did you know about a third of stockholders are foreigners, right? So, you’re now asking middle-class taxpayers to finance tax relief for people who are foreign stockholders. Corporations in America are making record profits. Wages are pretty flat. This notion that somehow we've got to give another tax break to corporations and it’s going to trickle down and lift wages is disproven by what we’re seeing right now. And in fact, as you know, the CEOs from around the country -- WALLACE: Right. VAN HOLLEN: -- have been reporting that they are going to use that extra money for stock buybacks in their shareholders. So, at the end of the day, this is a proposal where middle-class taxpayers in suburbs and all the places around the country are going to be paying for the tax cuts for big corporations. That's just not right. WALLACE: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. Thanks for your time this week and always good to talk with you, sir. VAN HOLLEN: Good to be with you. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the key takeaways from the Democrats' big wins on Tuesday night. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about Judge Roy Moore? What should the Republican Party do? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Coming up, Roy Moore hits back after allegations of sexual misconduct decades ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: These attacks involve a minor. They are completely false and untrue. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what it means for the Alabama Senate seat and the GOP, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: I've been investigated more than any other person in this country. To think that grown women would wait 40 years to come before -- right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: GOP Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore fighting back against allegations of sexual misconduct and making it clear he has no intention of dropping out of the special election in Alabama next month. And it's time now for our Sunday group. The head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham. Charles Lane of ""The Washington Post."" Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the ""Associated Press."" And former national security council staffer Gillian Turner. Well, Michael, the Republican Senate Campaign Committee has withdrawn from joint fundraising with Roy Moore, and the establishment camp of the GOP -- establishment camp of the GOP is saying, this is what happens when you have Steve Bannon looking for challengers to Republican incumbents. Your reaction? MICHAEL NEEDHAM, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Well, i think that would be rewriting history. I mean I think what happened in the Alabama Senate primary was most conservatives were supporting Mo Brooks down there. He's somebody who did very well on the Heritage Action scorecard, up (ph) for growth scorecard. Laura Ingraham (INAUDIBLE). Mark Levin also -- WALLACE: We don't need to (INAUDIBLE) attack (ph) Mo Brooks. Let's talk about Roy Moore. NEEDHAM: Well, but I think it gets do something about the party. If the party is going to say, we are going to always spend millions of dollars trying to defeat the legitimate conservative, the policy focused conservative, because we want the person who will be most loyal to the current Senate leadership. And the Senate leadership fund, Mitch McConnell's super PAC, spent millions of dollars taking Mo Brooks out because they thought that Luther Strange had a better chance of beating Roy Moore. WALLACE: Shouldn't Roy Moore step down? NEEDHAM: I think that if these allegations are true, Roy Moore should step down. I think that even -- even -- WALLACE: Well, (INAUDIBLE) -- why (ph) only (ph) if these allegations are true? I mean in the -- you're never -- you're never going to have proof. NEEDHAM: The Washington Post article -- sure, The Washington Post article is pretty compelling. When Roy Moore tells Sean Hannity -- Sean Hannity did a very hard-hitting interview on Friday -- WALLACE: Right. NEEDHAM: That he generally did not date teenagers when he was in his (ph) 1930s (ph). I think that Roy Moore is going to need to provide people more confidence that this isn't true, because the evidence is pretty overwhelming. And if not, frankly, I think he's going to have trouble being seated in the Senate even if he does win the election. WALLACE: I -- and he also said as part of his defense that he never asked girls out without asking permission for their mother, which is a first, I have to say. Julie -- GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Infuriating, that's why I was shaking my head. WALLACE: No, go ahead. TURNER: I mean it's -- that idea is infuriating that somehow had he asked the parents if he could go out with a 14-year-old and they had said yes, it would have been perfectly acceptable. I found that idea repugnant. WALLACE: Julie, on the record, President Trump is taking the position of most officials that if it's proven, then Moore should step down. Behind the scenes, what is the political team at the White House want to see? JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, both the political team at the White House and Republicans on The Hill are kind of at a loss right now because they don't have a good option. Absentee ballots have been printed. Roy Moore is going to be on the ballot no matter what even if he does drop out. That means he's going to get votes. So there are a couple of options being discussed right now. One, could you get a credible write-in candidate? That's a tricky thing for them to do, though, because it could potentially split the Republican vote that could lead Doug Jones, the Democrat, to sneak through if you do that. There's been some discussion about the governor pushing off the election. No one seems to think that that's a great idea. It's generally not advised that you have governors stepping in to push back elections because the political situation for their party isn't good. The repercussions of that could be pretty difficult. And then to Michael's point, the third option being discussed is, if Roy Moore does get through, should the Senate seat him? Again, it's a terrible option for Republicans. If this is the candidate who Alabama voters say they want in spite of these allegations, and in spite of everything else controversial that Roy Moore has done over the years, is it up to the Republican leadership here to say, no, we don't want him? So everyone I've talked to over the last couple of days in the Republican Party at the White House on this is really at a loss. They don't see a good way out on this. WALLACE: You talk about a Republican grassroots firestorm. You start not seating duly elected members -- PACE: (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE: That would create -- PACE: The precedent for -- for two of these options, one, pushing off the election, and, two, having Republican leaders decide that they don't want to seat somebody who was elected, it's really dangerous no matter what party you're talking about here. WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel, and we got this on FaceBook from Michael P. Mulhall. Has the mainstream media coverage been fair, or has Moore been unfairly prosecuted in the court of public opinion without the benefit of careful examination and due process? Chuck, you work for The Washington Post, which broke this story. How do you answer Michael? CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think the best answer to that is to look at the reaction of a number Republican senators who are not, you know, who you think of as people who uncritically read The Washington Post. We saw Richard Shelby, Bill Cassidy has been mentioned. They regard this story as -- or the information in the story as very credible information. In fact, subsequent to ""The Post"" story, other news organizations have gone and asked the women the questions and they've all repeated what they said. And independent corroboration from people who were told about these allegations simultaneously has come forward. I don't think this is a case of the mainstream media making up a story to get Roy Moore, although I would concede that will be an effective line of defense for Roy Moore among the Republican base in Alabama. WALLACE: Well, that's what (INAUDIBLE) -- LANE: And he is -- WALLACE: And so is Steve Bannon. LANE: Yes. And Steve Bannon, going to Julie's point, I think Steve Bannon must be loving this because what Steve Bannon is about is destroying Mitch McConnell and the quote/unquote Republican establishment. And in a weird way, if Doug Jones wins, that's a -- that too is a win for Steve Bannon because it just complicates Mitch McConnell's life and makes things more difficult. This is a guy who compared himself once to Lennon and said he wanted to destroy the state. And in that respect I'd say he's making a little progress here. WALLACE: All of this, of course, happens in the wake of the shellacking that Republicans took around the country in last Tuesday's elections. Gillian, in the Fox News voter analysis of the Virginia governor's race, women, let's put it up on the screen, voted for the Democrat, Northam, over the Republican, Gillespie, women, by a margin of 19 points. If Roy Moore wins the special election next month and is seated in the Senate, won't that just add to Republican problems heading into the 2018 midterms? TURNER: I think it will. And when it comes to Moore's conduct, I think whether or not he's ultimately exonerated or proven guilty, the whole episode bodes very poorly for the Republican Party at large, both in terms of their ability to legislate over the coming year and then win elections next year because the party's effectively now, this past week, arguing amongst itself about allegations of assault of minors. It's a very serious and sort of horrible thing to have to hammer out in a few days before an election. But I think more broadly speaking, looking beyond this special election, I think the party is going to have to come to terms with, is this something that we are willing to prioritize over and above policy? Meaning, are we willing to put our principles aside in order to get to policy solutions that we can all agree on. And that's a question that I think the Republican Party has been grappling with since the 2016 general election. Unfortunately, the assault of women was a theme common during that time also. WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to take a break here. When we come back, President Trump wrapping up his long trip to Asia. What did he accomplish? And the latest controversy over Russian meddling in the 2016 election. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can't continue to allow China to rape our country. And that's what they're doing. I do not blame China or any other country, of which there are many, for taking advantage of the United States on trade. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: A dramatic shift in Donald Trump's attitude towards China from the tough talk during the campaign to the much more conciliatory attitude these days. And we're back now with the panel. Gillian, we -- we did see a big shift in President Trump's rhetoric towards China, especially on the issue of trade. Did he get played by the Chinese, or do you think that there's a strategy there? TURNER: I think there's -- well, those two questions are not mutually exclusive, I don't think. He could have strategized. I'm sure he did with his advance team every moment of this trip, especially the portion that was in China. To a certain extent, he could also get played by the Chinese government and that Trump as a -- his presidential persona aside, seems to be somebody who is very committed to the idea of interpersonal relationships. He puts a lot -- a lot of sort of heart and soul and a large stake into how we interacts person to person with other world leaders. And he seems to measure the bilateral relationship in accordance with that. Do the Chinese look at the bilateral relationship with the United States in the same way? Absolutely not. So whether or not he was played remains to be seen. But I think overall there was a -- there was a sort of coming to terms with the personality on the -- at the top level of the relationship. WALLACE: There was also, Chuck, a dramatic contrast between President Trump and Chinese President Xi when it came to the speeches they made at the Pacific Summit in Vietnam. Trump was talking about bilateral trade with individual countries, while Xi was talking in a way that the U.S. used to about major regional multilateral deals. Is President Trump creating, in a sense, a power vacuum that the Chinese are all too happy to fill? LANE: This has been going on for a while. Xi, in Europe, gave a similar speech after Donald Trump's election. I think it's even bigger than that, Chris. I think the withdrawal of the United States from the TPP -- when this period is written about later on, it will be seen as a real watershed in the power balance in East Asia generally. The Asia-Pacific region generally. Because, as you know, this last week the remaining countries that would have been in the TPP have decided to form a deal among themselves and, in effect, kind of deal with China and the United States separately. But let's not forget, rejection of TPP was basically bipartisan in this country. 2016, the American people pretty much voted pretty enthusiastically for two candidates, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, who were against TPP. This is not just -- this is one of those things that's not just about Trump. There's been a real sea change in the attitude of the American public about trade. WALLACE: Then there is Russia. After meeting with Vladimir Putin at that Pacific Summit in Vietnam, the president first seemed to suggest that he believed Putin's denial of any meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and later, as we showed you at the top of the show, Kevin Corke's (ph) piece, he, at a news conference, had to go to considerable lengths to say, no, he agreed with U.S. intelligence that there was meddling, not with Putin. Julie, let me bring you in on this. Do White House officials think that with the press conference, that he got himself on the hook on the question of Putin and believing or not believing in Russian meddling? PACE: I think they feel better about that answer. But the mere fact that he had to do cleanup duty for a second day on this question, it remains confounding to people in the national security establishment, including people in the administration, that he can't get this answer right. Every time that Trump gets asked about this, particularly when he is discussing this matter with Putin, either on the phone or in person, his instinct always just seems to be a little bit off and it turns what could be a simple question into a two-day story in the middle of this big foreign trip. And, of course, it feeds the notion among his opponents that there's some reason why he always seems to be a little more generous to Putin, why he always seems to be at least willing to tolerate Putin saying, we didn't interfere in the election, when we know that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded otherwise. And there was a slight dig still at the intelligence community in his answer today where he said he sides with them, particularly under this leadership. Well, this leadership, which is his leadership, was not the leadership that came to that conclusion at the end of the Obama administration. WALLACE: Well, he trashed the old leadership, the Obama leadership, Clapper and Comey and John Brennan. He called them all political hacks. So -- PACE: And none of that goes over well with the intelligence community, which really views itself as kind of outside of politics, despite the fact that they have politically appointed leaders. They view themselves as people who are making independent assessments regardless of who's in the Oval Office. WALLACE: Let's turn to what was at the beginning of the trip supposed to be the big issue, and was a big part of the trip, and that's North Korea. The president repeatedly urged Pacific nations to rally together to oppose the Kim regime. Here he has. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Michael, do you see anything specific that the president accomplished? He made a bunch of speeches calling out the regime. Sometimes he was kind of bad cop, sometimes good cop. But he was always saying, we've got to stop the nuclear relation of North Korea. Did you see anything specific, though, that indicates that he may have made some progress in this area? NEEDHAM: Sure. I think he went over and, first of all, continued to emphasize and strengthen our relationship, both with Japan and Korea. In his speech in South Korea, he said that South Korea will always be an ally of the United States for a long time. And we should say, reciprocally, the United States will be an ally of South Korea for a long time. So I think it's important as we deal with the North Koreans to solidify those two relationships. I think he made it clear that America is not looking to preemptively go into North Korea to do anything. That -- that Kim Jong-un should know that. And put that into his calculations. But that we're also going to be strong. And that our policy towards North Korea is going to rely on ballistic missile defense, on strong sanctions, and on keeping pressure on the Kim regime. So I thought, you know, did he make groundbreaking progress that will go down in the history books? But, obviously not. But I thought on each of those things he may the important incremental progress that's necessary to keep pressure up and to get to a better outcome. WALLACE: Gillian is our foreign policy expert on this panel, and I don't mean to insult the rest of you, but she was on the National Security Council staff. Where do you think the Trump trip leaves U.S. relations in the Pacific, and particularly on the questions of China and North Korea? TURNER: Well, I -- the way I looked at the trip was it was really a trip in two parts. And -- and the first part of the trip had this -- as Michael alluded to -- this emphasis on multilateralism, on projecting American strength and military prowess. That was why the president chose to do his first stop at Pacific Command. I think that was a direct message campaign for Kim Jong-un. The second part of the trip, unfortunately, it was all about the Trump doctrine, America first, that goes to the trade point. But the specter hanging over that ended up being Putin. And I think if the president had actually had a bilateral meeting with him at APEC, it would have helped put a lot of this to bed. If he had had an hour with the president and was able to actually take him to task on meddling, rather than just asking him in an offhanded way about the 2016 general election, we might have something that would enable us to move forward. The -- us, the American people, the American voters. But, unfortunately, we didn't have that opportunity. It was a -- it was a missed opportunity. WALLACE: All right, thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" A new museum dedicated to the bestselling book of all time. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: There are more Bibles in circulation in this country than ever before. An average of 2.2 per family. But how much does each of us know about the Bible? And how can we learn more? Here is our ""Power Player of the Week."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARY SUMMERS, PRESIDENT, MUSEUM OF THE BIBLE: Children's museums, dinosaur museums, science museums, art museums. There wasn't a museum for the Bible. And that's the reason we built it. WALLACE (voice-over): Welcome to Washington's newest attraction. And it's like nothing you've ever seen. The Museum of the Bible, inspiring, informative, and downright entertaining. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, can you see the photos? Oh. WALLACE: Cary Summers is the museum's president. SUMMERS: Is where we are as a world right now. If it's not engaging, interesting, interactive, than many people just walk right by it no matter how good it is. WALLACE: So, yes, there are 3,100 items on display, many of them remarkable. From fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, to the handwritten poem Julia Ward Howe wrote in 1861 that became the words to the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic."" But there's also a recreation of the roads Jesus walked in Nazareth. SUMMERS: They have a perspective they've never had before until they see, wow, now I see why he talked the way he talked about all of us, about the synagogue, about ritual baths, and it takes on a whole new meaning for them. WALLACE: There is even a ride. What's called a fly board, that lets you soar over Washington looking for biblical inscriptions. But what may be even more surprising is the attitude of the museum. SUMMERS: We're non-sectarian, which is -- it means, we don't try to promote any faith or denomination, and our goal is to get people engaged in the Bible, to get them to at least open it up and take a look at it. WALLACE: Still, there's some controversy about the museum. The Green family that owns Hobby Lobby and the National Christian Foundation are the two biggest donors. SUMMERS: They are what it says. They are a donor. Their -- they have not tried to direct the project. They have not tried to interject their personal points of view at all. WALLACE (on camera): Some critics say this museum is really an evangelical outpost to Congress. SUMMERS: Yes, that's a fun one because all you have to do is come in. And if you're here an hour, you realize it's not. WALLACE (voice-over): It's a sight to behold, from the huge bronze doors that recreate the Gutenberg Bible's printing plate of the first page of Genesis, to the soaring entry hall with its religious images, to unique artifacts and immersive technology. One quarter of American families identify as evangelical. WALLACE (on camera): You think there's going to be a big draw, don't you? SUMMERS: There's going to be a big draw. We know that. It's going to be very large. WALLACE (voice-over): And once people come here, Summers is confidence of their reaction. SUMMERS: The Bible is, love it or hate it, it's just one of the great reads of all time. Our goal is, when you walk in that front door, is that your jaw hits the ground and you say, wow. And when you leave, you say, this may be the greatest museum, or certainly one of them, that I've ever been in. That's what we're after. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: The Museum of the Bible opens to the public this coming Saturday. You won't want to miss it. And that's it for today.

444,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/07/orlando-shooting-pulse-nightclub-police-officer-omar-delgado,"Last modified on Thu 7 Dec 2017 19.09 GMT A Florida police officer who suffered post-traumatic stress after witnessing the horror of the Pulse nightclub shooting has been abruptly fired, just months before he would have secured a pension bonus for 10 years’ service.  Omar Delgado was one of the first officers to respond to the June 2016 massacre and helped wounded survivors to safety from inside the Orlando nightclub as the gunman, Omar Mateen, continued a killing spree that claimed 49 lives. He suffered significant psychological trauma from the incident, then America’s deadliest mass shooting, and has been confined to desk duty and light administrative tasks since returning to work eight months ago. Now, in a decision that Pulse co-founder Ron Legler has branded an injustice, the Eatonville police department is terminating Delgado’s contract from the end of this year. It means he will fall six months short of the 10 years’ service required for an annual pension of 64% of his $38,500 salary for life and, as an employee for less than a decade, he will receive only 42%. Eddie Cole, the Eatonville mayor, was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but at a town council meeting on Tuesday night said he could not discuss the reason for Delgado’s termination because of employee privacy. “This town, as well as me, cares about people. But some pictures are bigger than we all know,” the Orlando Sentinel reported Cole as saying. However, Delgado, 45, claims a superior officer told him the department needed an officer on patrol rather than at a desk, and that the PTSD for which he is still receiving counselling was a factor in the decision. “It’s a small town and we’re like a family,” Delgado told USA Today. “You don’t just throw a family member to the street. They’re acting like a Fortune 500 company and saying since you can’t do your job we’re going to replace you. Even if the world saw me as a hero, that was yesterday.” Legler, who founded the Pulse club in 2004 with his friend Barbara Poma after her brother’s death from HIV, said he would fight to have the decision overturned. “Know that you have a community of passionate people that will not rest until this wrong is made right,” Legler, president of Baltimore’s France-Merrick performing arts centre, wrote in a post on a GoFundMe account set up by a friend of Delgado to help his family with medical bills and the upcoming salary loss. “We will not let this injustice stand. We will all work as hard for you as you did for us that horrible night.” One of the injured victims that Delgado saved also came to his defence. Angel Colon, who was shot six times by Mateen and who became a close friend and supporter of the officer who helped him escape in the months afterwards, told WFTV: “For them to just do what they’re doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well. “He did his job that night … so they should have his back 100% totally and just be there for whatever he needs.”",2017-12-07 13:59:32,Orlando police officer who saved Pulse shooting victims fired from force,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Do you ever feel extremely sad or even depressed after reading or hearing the news? What sorts of stories make you feel bad, and why? What happens to you when you are exposed to too much bad news? In “Earthquakes! Fires! Shootings! Storms! How Tech Can Help Ease ‘Disaster Fatigue’,” Jennifer Jolly writes: One of the first things I do every morning when I wake up is check the latest news on my smartphone. In the last few weeks alone, that means — like so many other people — I’ve started the day with some of the most horrific news imaginable: a mass shooting, devastating storms, terrible wildfires. It’s taken a toll on my overall well-being — and very likely yours, too. “We’re seeing more ‘disaster fatigue,’” says Dr. Mary McNaughton-Cassill, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at San Antonio who has studied the connection between media consumption and stress. “In the digital age where studies show some three out of four people check their smartphone before going to bed and shortly after waking up in the morning, it’s getting harder not to feel overwhelmed.” I’ve been calling it “the bad news blues,” which is just a general feeling of “how much more of this can we all take” whenever I see a stream of tragic news alerts hit my smartphone or social media feeds. Sure, it makes me want to help, but it also makes me sad. And overwhelmed. Dr. McNaughton-Cassill says that’s a normal reaction when bad things are happening away from our own community, where we can do little to aid those in need. She said people might also experience an increase in stress, depression, exhaustion, sleep problems, anger and growing cynicism. For some people already prone to anxiety or clinical depression the toll can be even worse. “There are clear increases in anxiety disorders, including cutting and self-harm, and suicide rates,” says Dr. Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. “The barrage of ever-present ‘bad news’ — and, for young people, the barrage of social-media-related permanent records of negative social interchanges — is a factor.” Experts say there are steps you can take to help fight the sadness and anxiety that all this bad news may be causing. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — Have you ever experienced “disaster fatigue,” otherwise known as the “bad news blues”? If so, when? If not, why not? — What do you do when you feel overwhelmed by the overload of bad news you come across? What works for you to reduce the stress, sadness or depression you experience from too much bad news? — Which, if any, of the suggestions in the article would you try to fight the “bad news blues”? — Do you have any tips or advice of your own? If so, what do you suggest, and why do you think your ideas will help? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

448,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/style/hamed-sinno-mashrou-leila-gay-rainbow-flags.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by Encounters By Michael Schulman Hamed Sinno, the 29-year-old Lebanese rocker, showed up at Christopher Street in Manhattan looking agitated. He had gone to the wrong location of Maison Kayser, the French boulangerie, and by the time his cab got to the West Village he was an hour late. Wearing a headband and a loose black shirt, he had forgotten he had to have his photo taken, and apologized for his “bad hair.” Rock-star problems, right? But Mr. Sinno’s are more complicated than most. As one of the only openly gay celebrities in the Arab world, he has become a de facto mouthpiece and lightning rod, becoming embroiled in international human-rights issues when all he really wants to do is play music. His indie band, Mashrou’ Leila, has acquired a young, progressive fan base over the past few years. In the group’s home country, Lebanon, boho crowds flock to see Mr. Sinno, in sequins and muscle T-shirts, sing songs that are alternately brooding and buoyant, sensual and bitingly satirical. But trouble seems to follow him everywhere. On Sept. 22, the group played a concert to 35,000 people in Cairo, where a few spectators waved rainbow flags. Within days, seven people were arrested for “promoting sexual deviancy,” part of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s crackdown on homosexuality. The number grew to at least 65 by the end of October. Arrestees were subject to anal exams to test them for gay sex. Mashrou’ Leila was banned from Egypt, and homophobic rumors swirled online, including that the concert had been a 35,000-person orgy — “which, even if you try to entertain the idea, seems really, really difficult to organize,” Mr. Sinno said with a bitter laugh. “It’s not like we’re going around burning holy books and peeing on national monuments,” he said, after ordering a skim milk latte and a tartine poulet. Outside the window, rainbow flags were as commonplace as stop signs. “It was just a piece of fabric. Those are people saying that they exist, and someone had a problem with that.” He added, wearily, “I love what I do. But it is frightening.” At times, the band has courted controversy, as when it canceled a 2012 gig opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to show solidarity with BDS, the movement calling for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. But most often Mr. Sinno’s sexuality is provocation enough. The group has been banned from Jordan, twice. “And the second time they were much less polite about it,” Mr. Sinno said. “They were just flat out, ‘We don’t want them because he’s gay.’” He rolled his eyes. “Really nice government.” The band is spending the fall in the United States, teaching a graduate course at New York University on the intersection of music and politics. Mr. Sinno, a self-described “pretentious writing snob” (his lyrics teem with allusions to Sappho and Sylvia Plath), described the students as “all extremely woke,” and outlined a syllabus that includes Bertolt Brecht, Judith Butler and the French rap duo the Blaze. On days off from teaching, the group is performing in cities including Philadelphia and Minneapolis. “My mother really doesn’t want me to go back to Beirut,” Mr. Sinno said. “She’s like, ‘Stay in the states!’ ‘I can’t afford a house here, woman!’ She’s like, ‘I’ll buy you a house!’” But Mr. Sinno, who has dual Lebanese and United States citizenship, doesn’t feel much more at ease in America than he does in the Middle East, saying that the “in your face” racism he encounters here is at least as bad as the homophobia back home. Last year, Mr. Sinno was at Le Bain, the nightclub in the meatpacking district, when a guy getting into an elevator shouted, “Build the wall!” “It took me a second to understand that he was talking to me, and that he thought I was Latino,” he said. That same trip, Mr. Sinno found himself torn after the mass shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Fla., wanting to stand with the gay and lesbian community even as online trolls called him a “terrorist.” “It’s literally disillusioning to have to do away with the romanticized narrative of the U.S. that I had,” he said. He picked the chicken off his tartine. “This is stuff that only pretty people are allowed to eat,” he said of the leftover bread. “I met this boy in San Francisco and he’s, like, way out of my league.” While growing up in Beirut, Mr. Sinno found Western pop culture to be a lifeline. With few representations of gay people in Lebanese culture, he sought refuge in “Will & Grace” and Oscar Wilde. He discovered Allan Ginsberg during his freshman year at the American University of Beirut, where his mother teaches English. He idolized grunge rockers like Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain (the “love of my life”) and went through “a bit of a riot-grrrl moment.” Though Mr. Sinno is often compared to Freddie Mercury, in part because of his bushy mustache, he doesn’t see the resemblance. Mashrou’ Leila, which roughly translates as “An Overnight Project,” began in 2008, when someone in the university’s design department put up a sign for a musical workshop. By 2012, the band had released two albums and was headlining Lebanese music festivals, and Mr. Sinno quit his job at an advertising firm. Though he grew up speaking mostly English, he studied Arabic to write lyrics, with the goal of “bringing poetry into Arabic pop music.” One song, “Shim El Yasmine,” or “Smell the Jasmine” (“I would have liked to keep you near me, / Introduce you to my parents”) has been described as Arab pop’s first gay love song. The band’s most recent album, “Ibn El Leil” (“Son of the Night”), was inspired in part by Mr. Sinno’s period of escapism in Beirut nightclubs after the death of his father, a urologist. “I was where the booze was for quite some time,” he said. (He has been sober for almost a year.) But, he added, “clubs are necessarily political.” As he finished lunch, his phone began to blow up with texts from his bandmates, and he got a look of panic. Another international incident? No, nothing urgent, he said with both annoyance and relief. When the bandmates return to Lebanon, they will face an uncertain future. “In the past two years, we’ve lost our two biggest markets, Jordan and Egypt,” Mr. Sinno said glumly. And will their fans still wave rainbow flags? “I think people are more likely to do that now than they were before.” Advertisement",2017-11-10 12:05:11,Encounters: A Lebanese Rocker Caught in a Human Rights Incident Over Rainbow Flags,,1,http://nytimes.com

Shots fired. @KOLO8 pic.twitter.com/zhvxCG9XZ3 — Thomas J Riddle (@thomasjriddle) November 29, 2017 Cops stopped a gunman in downtown Reno on Tuesday, after announcing they were hunting an active shooter and sparking fears of another Las Vegas-style attack. Reno police tweeted at 7:50 p.m. PST that they were dealing with a “possible active shooter” and urged everyone to steer clear of the area. SWAT cops later stormed the luxury apartment tower where the shooter was holed up and he was killed, officials said. It wasn’t immediately clear if he was killed by police or committed suicide.  No one else was hurt, cops said. Las Vegas resident Mike Pavicich, in Reno for business, was walking in downtown when he heard shots – and immediately thought of last month’s mass shooting that killed 58. “When you heard it’s coming from above it reminds you of the guy shooting from Mandalay Bay … it’s scary you know? This is the same kind of town,” Pavicich told the Reno Gazette Journal. Back on Oct. 1, Stephen Paddock opened fire from his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay, killing dozens of fans below attending a country music concert.

On Apple TV+, Where A Couple Has Their Love Tested In A Strange Musical Town I do not like the Punisher. I’ve been a Marvel Comics devotee for 25 years. I’ve never gone a month without buying at least a half dozen Marvel comics. I’ve seen every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie on opening night and binged every Netflix series the weekend it dropped (okay, except Iron Fist). I love Marvel. I love the X-Men. I love Daredevil. I love She-Hulk. I love everything from ’90s Avengers to Ultimate Spider-Man and NextWave. I have, at one point or another, been a regular reader of pretty much every single major Marvel hero (and a metric ton of the minor ones). But, I do not like the Punisher. The Punisher is not for me. To me, the Punisher has always been, since the moment I first saw him on a Marvel Universe trading card in 1992, the character that bullies liked–the loud, mean, aggressive boys that tormented me verbally and physically on the playground and in the cafeteria. I remember my cousin explaining the Punisher to me like this: “He shoots people just for jaywalking.” Cool! No thanks! I don’t sympathize with a gun-toting lunatic with an insatiable bloodlust where his humanity should be! Considering that I wrote the Punisher off as a kid and never second guessed that decision (I feel as if I have missed out on exactly zero comics that I would love), I was incredibly nervous about the character joining the cast of Marvel’s Daredevil for Season 2. I love Daredevil, a character that’s overwhelmed by his way-too-human weaknesses. Depression, guilt, those are things I can relate to in my 30s! Daredevil, in the comics and on his Netflix show, is my guy. I didn’t want the Punisher stealing the spotlight and making Matt Murdock seem like a lame-ass. I mean, Matt is a lame-ass, but on his own terms, and that’s why I love him. Imagine my surprise when Jon Bernthal’s Punisher was finally a Punisher I could get behind. Not root for. Not empathize with. I just found that his presence and what Daredevil had to say about his tactics fascinating and well-executed. Bernthal gave a lot of depth to a character I have never been interested in. The show contrasted Matt and Frank’s morals smartly, and the show still came down on Matt’s side. Good job! You rehabilitated the Punisher for me, Netflix! And then the trailer for the spinoff series Marvel’s The Punisher dropped and, ugh.  Good lord, no. This trailer was crafted with all of the subtlety of a cobbled together fan project. “Yeah, there’s a an acoustic guitar thing to start, because Frank Castle’s got a manly sensitive side, but then his wife gets her head blown off and then the Metallica starts and then there’s blood and bullets and more blood and bullets and the Punisher is so angry and he blows up more heads and…” We get it. The Punisher’s all about violence, but it’s revenge for the murder of his family so that allows him to wrap himself in a cloak of manpain. He’s just so angry, and the only solution is guns! Do I need to point out where the problem is there? Why we, as a country, really don’t need another case of macho manpain that depicts violence as the only solution? And do we really need that solution to involve guns? Bernthal himself has said that America has a gun problem, and that problem has not gotten any better as Netflix has tried to find the right time to release this series. The show’s panel at New York Comic Con was canceled out of respect to the victims of the largest mass shooting in American history in Las Vegas in October. The show was given a November 17 release date, and then another mass shooting happened in Texas where the shooter wore a face mask with a white skull on it! America doesn’t need Marvel’s The Punisher because America already is Marvel’s The Punisher. Hell, there was another mass shooting this week in California, meaning there’s been at least two widely-covered killing sprees just in the few weeks between Netflix announcing this show’s release date and it hitting the streaming service. I’m sick of guns, I’m sick of murder, and I’m sick of The Punisher before it’s even debuted. If there’s an upside, it’s that at least The Punisher seemingly knows what it is and where/when it’s taking place. As Decider’s review points out, the gun violence in the show takes a backseat (after a blistering opening sequence) to a truly complicated discussion about gun violence, PTSD, and the problems our veterans face upon returning from war. It sounds like The Punisher isn’t a remorseless orgy of bullets and blood, but I’m also mad that there are Frank Castle fans that will be upset that the show isn’t that. Maybe Marvel’s The Punisher will make people think about gun violence. Maybe it will make men question the way society has dictated they deal with trauma. Maybe it will provide language for veterans struggling to articulate how they feel. Maybe viewers will get some or all of that, or maybe viewers will just tune in for the bloodbath and zone out for the rest. All I really know is that when it comes to The Punisher, I’m just going to not. Where to stream Marvel's The Punisher Share Selection This story has been shared 2,554 times.

News By Associated Press Submit December 1, 2017 | 2:17am				| Updated December 1, 2017 | 4:39pm LAS VEGAS — Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip saw a 6 percent drop in revenue in October compared with the same month last year, but state’s gambling regulatory agency did not attribute the decrease exclusively to the mass shooting that took place in the city that month. Data released Thursday by the Nevada Gaming Control Board show casinos on the Strip took in almost $528.7 million from gamblers last month. That’s about $34 million less than what they won in October 2016. Casinos statewide faced a difficult comparison going into October since it had one fewer weekend day than the same month last year. In addition, the establishments on the Strip had seen a 14 percent revenue increase in October 2016. “I’m sure it played a part of it. I’m sure it played into the decrease, but it’s really difficult to quantify,” Michael Lawton, senior research analyst for the board, said. “What I can quantify, I can tell you that it was a difficult comparison.” On Oct. 1, a high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered windows of his hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at a country music festival below before killing himself. The city’s tourism officials also on Thursday reported that visitation to the gambling oasis last month fell 4.2 percent to 3.6 million tourists. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority blamed the drop to trip cancellations and postponements following the shooting. Statewide, casinos in Nevada won about $988.8 million last month. The revenue remained practically flat over the year. In southern Nevada, casinos in the Boulder Strip saw the highest increase in revenue with almost $78.7 million, a 17.1 percent jump compared with the previous year. Winnings in downtown Las Vegas were up 10 percent to about $63.6 million. Meanwhile, revenues at casinos in Washoe County were up 3.3 percent to about $71.9 million. The revenue report also shows that gamblers enthusiastically wagered at Nevada’s sports books. For the second month in a row, they broke the state’s all-time record for sports betting. People bet $566.4 million, of which the sports books took in $31.5 million, a decrease of 25.7 percent over the year. Baseball fans put down $101.5 million on their favorite teams, setting a record for betting on that sport for the month of October. “So, that can pretty much safely assume that the World Series was the most-heavily bet World Series ever,” Lawton said. The state benefited with almost $59.7 million in percentage fees based on the taxable revenues generated in October. That’s an increase of almost $79,000 or .13 percent from a year earlier.

On Apple TV+, Where A Couple Has Their Love Tested In A Strange Musical Town The Dark Army’s plan may have worked, but for the first time this season, Mr. Robot’s plan failed. This week’s episode, “eps3.6_fredrick+tanya.chk,” follows all of the major players — including a few we haven’t seen since last year — in the hours immediately following the 71 simultaneous bombings of E Corp storage facilities that constitute the dreaded Stage 2. Yet the soul-crushing dread and despair you’d expect, particularly if you remember weathering similar tragedies, is missing in action. Usually surefooted even when traveling the most treacherous and tricky narrative paths, Mr. Robot’s storytelling seems to have stumbled the second it got past the finish line. Much of the problem lies with the protagonist, or more accurately the lack thereof. Mr. Robot is Elliot Alderson’s story, and the catastrophic success of Stage 2 is something he’s spent the entire season trying to prevent. The past two episodes in particular chronicled Elliot’s attempts to physically put a stop to the operation in practically real-time detail. Yet now that the trigger has been pulled, we cut away from Elliot almost immediately: No sooner does he make it to the office of his therapist, Krista, than he’s subsumed by his sardonic Mr. Robot persona before he can mutter more than a few broken sentences about his role in the attacks. The show pushes him aside at the exact moment he should be front and center. Hell, he’s not even our gateway into the episode itself. That would be Leon, the sociopathic sitcom fan who serves as the Dark Army’s main American assassin. The hour’s cold open depicts him with Trenton and Mobley, the fsociety members last seen living under assumed names until Leon approaches them in the parking lot of the big-box electronics store where they work in the post-credits stinger for the Season 2 finale. While the country reels from what incessant news reports describe as the deadliest attack in its history, Leon does a deadpan comedy routine about how Frasier Crane’s success with women strains credulity, paling in comparison to the prophetic realism of (drumroll please) Knight Rider. Indeed, the familiar synth-pop theme song for that old-school techno-thriller about a talking car and its Hasselhoffian driver plays over the opening credits. I get the ironic effect the show is going for here, and both the theme song and Joey Bada$$’s performance as Leon are as big a hoot as ever. But with the success of Stage 2, Mr. Robot had the chance to examine the trauma, terror, and grief of its own personal 9/11. Dropping that ball feels like more than just a missed opportunity — it’s almost a dereliction of duty. Throughout the episode, in fact, there’s an odd disconnect between the magnitude of the unfolding atrocity and the affect of the characters left to deal with it. Within the FBI, Agents DiPierro and Santiago seem more pissed off that they didn’t get their man than devastated by the loss of 4,000 civilians on their watch. Santiago, of course, was in on the plan, but he should still at least act distraught; Dom has no such excuse, making her pissing matches with both Santiago and Tyrell Wellick’s callous lawyer an even weirder substitute for the horror you’d expect her, or anyone, to feel. Elsewhere, Mobley and Trenton respond both to the bombings and their own captivity by a cold-blooded killer with gallows-humor understatement that rings false throughout their scenes. It’s one thing to psychologically downplay the severity of the situation as a survival mechanism; it’s quite another for Trenton to argue about whether or not Mobley should be using Jdate, or for Mobley to complain that he’s missing out on the evening plans he’d made through the service. Obviously life must go on, even on the darkest of days, and plenty of people went about their business on 9/11 since there was so little else they could do, but none of those people were directly implicated in the attacks or at risk of being executed by their real architects, you know? To an extent, the whole and-the-band-played-on vibe is a deliberate choice on the show’s part. As Irving tells Mr. Robot when they arrive at a fancy party that the Dark Army’s chief fixer where there’s been an overdose the Dark Army’s fixer has been tasked to clean up, “Literally nothing can stop these shindigs.” There’s an element of that in the scenes set in the purple-hued dining room at Mar-a-Lago, where Whiterose, Phillip Price, and the rest of the rich and powerful continue eating and drinking while Rome burns around them. But even there, Price’s reaction feels wildly inappropriate. Shouldn’t he be concerned with appearances at the very least and seclude himself someplace, or at the very least look concerned and busy handling the fallout from the execution of thousands of his employees and untold billions of dollars in information, rather than swan around with a drink in hand, shouting obscenities at the Chinese defense minister? Actor (and playwright) Michael Cristofer is dynamite as Price during that big blow-up at Whiterose, don’t get me wrong — watching his veneer crack is glorious — and B.D. Wong seems to be having an absolute ball delivering Whiterose’s gleefully supervillainous dialogue about punishment, world domination, and relocating her secretive suburban New York nuclear power plant to the Congo (?!?), but the context is all wrong. Even Angela Moss’s total breakdown, which should be a moment of series-defining pathos, falls flat. It’s not the fault of actor Portia Doubleday, who makes Angela’s regression into something between childhood and psychosis awful to behold. (And cleverly staged, too, as she winds up watching news footage of a building collapse from the floor directly in front of her television, the way she watched Saturday morning cartoons during her dying mother’s preemptive wake.) But since she’s the only character shown to be that shattered by the attacks, at least once Elliot is shuffled aside in Mr. Robot’s favor, her state of shock sticks out like a sore thumb, drawing attention to the artifice of her psychological state on a show that has long prided itself on its ability to depict unhappiness as it’s truly lived by young people in the real world. But in the absence of a wide-scale societal meltdown, individual ones must serve as a sort of emotional substitute. Price’s anger, Angela’s juvenile magical thinking, Santiago’s guilt during a phone call with his frightened mother, and especially Tyrell Wellick’s sobbing, screaming agony upon learning that his wife has been murdered and his infant son has been placed in a foster home where his enemies can hurt him at will — add them all up and you can at least get an approximation of a more realistic reaction to a massive slaughter like Stage 2. And once the comedy routines are over, you get this from Mobley and Trenton as well, as they slowly realize that they’re being set up as the fall guys for the whole scheme, linked to an even more horrific (if ultimately illusory) assault on the air-traffic control system, and forced to shoot themselves in a staged double-suicide. Sunita Mani in particular is so effective at conveying Trenton’s misery and fear that she becomes hard to even look at toward the end. If there’s a theory that could explain why Mr. Robot chose not to lean hard on the impact of the Stage 2 bloodbath, it too lies with Trenton and Mobley. When the FBI comes bursting into their fake HQ (in an operation overseen not by the President and the Joint Chiefs or even the Director, but plain-old DiPierro and Santiago, like it’s a buy-and-bust instead of a takedown of the world’s most wanted people), they find both fsociety paraphernalia and an Iranian flag. The Dark Army is linking both the 5/9 hack and its own violent follow-up actions with a hated foreign nation and framing people of Indian and Persian descent (one of whom wears a headscarf, both of whom have Scary Foreign Names) as the culprits to fan the flames of xenophobia, nationalism, and war fever that will sweep Whiterose’s hand-picked presidential candidate Donald Trump into power. We managed to do that without the Dark Army’s help IRL, of course, but that’s not the point. If you dread finding out the name and nationality of the perpetrator of the latest mass shooting, or lie awake at night wondering what kind of Reichstag-fire madness will be unleashed if there’s ever another major terrorist attack on U.S. soil, this is a horror of greater magnitude, because it will compound those 4,000 corpses here with untold death and destruction abroad, once our military-intelligence murder machine starts retaliating. For every action, there is an unequal and opposite overreaction; Mr. Robot understands better than most shows that as bad as we have it, we’ll make goddamn sure someone else has it worse. Sean T.

455,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/pastor-frank-pomeroy-sutherland-springs.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Serge F. Kovaleski On any other Sunday, Frank Pomeroy, the pastor at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Tex., would have been in the pulpit. He would have seen the gunman, his steely gaze familiar, barge in mid-sermon. He would have heard the gunfire break out. But he was hundreds of miles away. And so Mr. Pomeroy, reflecting in his first extensive interview on the mass shooting that took place inside his church, can only imagine the awfulness of it. And ponder whether he could have made a difference had he been preaching that day. Instead, Mr. Pomeroy was attending a class in Oklahoma City on the morning of Nov. 5. A three-word text message came across his cellphone. “Shooting at church,” it said. He thought the sender, who was the church’s videographer, was kidding. “I hope you are joking,” he wrote back. The reply came seconds later: “No.” Mr. Pomeroy frantically tried to call parishioners who were at the service, but no one picked up. “By then, it was too late,” he recalled. “They had been shot.” He finally reached a friend, who was 10 minutes away from the church. The friend rushed to the scene and soon confirmed the unimaginable. Bodies were sprawled everywhere. Among the dead was the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle. “I am trying to follow the Bible, which says you should not let the sun set on your anger because anger only makes it worse,” Mr. Pomeroy said. He is attempting to live by the advice he typically gives to parishioners in mourning. Good versus evil. God’s plan. The importance of faith. “We are supposed to find that peaceful place and to pray about it and accept what it is,” he said. But finding that spiritual refuge has hardly been easy. The carnage that Devin P. Kelley wreaked in what became the worst mass shooting in Texas history left 25 people dead, including a pregnant woman whose fetus was declared fatality No. 26, and 20 others injured. The trauma affected thousands more, certainly everyone in the tiny rural community of Sutherland Springs. Amid the collective grieving, Mr. Pomeroy, 51, has found himself in an unfamiliar situation for a pastor. While presiding over funerals and counseling bereaved families are cornerstones of his calling, he now requires consoling himself. “What is different here is that the comforting is mutual,” he said through his cellphone this week from outside a hospital where he was visiting a wounded survivor of the shooting. “We are all leaning on each other because this is surreal and beyond the scope of anything we have had to deal with. We are a tightknit group anyway. If nothing else, this has made us closer.” Mr. Pomeroy’s own pain and the suffering of his wife of three decades, Sherri, have not hindered him from carrying out his pastoral duties — as grim as they have been. When he is not attending funerals or making hospital visits, he has spent hours in meetings with insurance companies, lawyers and a committee put together to make decisions on the future of the church. “In a word, life has been tumultuous, and it feels like the days are running together because they have been extremely busy,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I feel that I am not grieving as adequately as I should. I feel pretty weak right now, a bit shaky.” He added: “It is hard to be strong for everyone else when I have my own heartache. But each day I am able to function a little better.” He said that news reports stating he had decided to demolish the church because it would be too painful to continue using it were inaccurate and that a decision on what to do with the small house of worship had not yet been made. “Those reports hurt a lot of people who needed the church to grieve,” Mr. Pomeroy said. For the time being, he added, the sanctuary where the attack occurred will no longer be used for services and will remain a memorial to the victims. Mr. Pomeroy had met Mr. Kelley, 26, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Over the past three years or so, Mr. Kelley came to the church once or twice a year and sat in the back, out of sight from the camera that recorded the services for wider online viewing, Mr. Pomeroy said. “I tried to talk to him a few times, but he wouldn’t listen or engage,” he recounted. “He acted entitled and spoke often in a harsh and ugly way. He seemed like an angry person who had never been taught to treat people the right way.” Mr. Kelley made it clear to him that he “despised” the church, the pastor said, and that he wanted him to know he was an atheist. “He would throw these snide remarks in there when I was talking to his wife,” the pastor said of Danielle Shields, Mr. Kelley’s second wife. He added that after Mr. Kelley married Ms. Shields, she, too, was rarely seen at the church. “Once Danielle got married to him, she was pretty much gone,” Mr. Pomeroy said. By the time of the attack, the couple were estranged, and law enforcement authorities have said the shooting might have stemmed from a dispute between Mr. Kelley and his mother-in-law. She and several others from that side of the family were regulars at the church. As Mr. Pomeroy put it, “Pretty much every time the church door was open, the mother-in-law was there.” But on the morning of the shooting, Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law was at home with her grandson. Once she realized that she was late for church, the pastor said, she opted not to go. Among the dead, though, was Lula Woicinski White, the grandmother of the gunman’s estranged wife and one of Ms. Pomeroy’s closest friends. “My opinion is that he was going to the church to find the mother-in-law and was planning to shoot everybody on that side of the family,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I think he came there for them but intended to do something much bigger.” The pastor saw Mr. Kelley at the church’s fall festival on Oct. 31, just days before the shooting. “He just seemed like he was glaring at everybody he walked by,” Mr. Pomeroy recalled. The pastor said that even though Mr. Kelley had such an unsettling presence, he never imagined that he would have “the guts or courage” to kill and wound so many innocent people. “He was a mean and hateful person, but I would not have dreamed that he had this magnitude of darkness in him,” Mr. Pomeroy said. Law enforcement officials and friends of Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law have said that he had been sending her threatening text messages. Mr. Pomeroy said he was not aware of the texts, but knew that she and others on that side of the family clashed with Mr. Kelley. On the morning of the shooting, Mr. Pomeroy was taking a gun class so that he could get licensed to give instruction at a youth camp next summer on handling old-fashioned single-shot rifles and pistols. The pastor, who said he carries a concealed firearm when he preaches, does not believe that anyone in the church was armed that morning. Outside the church, Mr. Kelley was injured by a bystander who shot him twice after the attack. “In a way, I think that if I were there I could have done more,” he said. “But who is to say?” After learning that his daughter had been killed in the rampage, he struggled to tell his wife. Ms. Pomeroy was in Florida at the time doing contract work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I didn’t want her to be alone when she heard that,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I ended up having to tell her over the phone.” He said she was “coping but having a hard time” dealing with a shooting in which she lost her two closest friends. The couple have five other children, as well as one they have helped raise. The outpouring of support the couple have received from around the world has left them feeling uplifted. “It is encouraging that although there was one bad guy who tried to steal the day,” Mr. Pomeroy said, “thousands of good people have stood up in support.” Advertisement",2017-11-22 05:00:20,The Day the Pastor Was Away and Evil Came Barging Into His Church,,1,http://nytimes.com
456,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicole-lovell-murder-smartphone-predator-stranger-danger-killer-app/,"""48 Hours"" investigates the murder of Nicole Lovell,13, and the hidden dangers of connecting online with strangers Produced by Josh Yager [This story first aired on Sept. 24, 2016. It was updated on June 3, 2017.] BLACKSBURG, Va. -- ""Every morning … I come out here, sit with her for an hour,"" Tammy Weeks said while visiting her daughter's grave. ""It's just been a nightmare … I still hope that she would come around the corner when she gets off the bus … or she'll come out of her room,"" Weeks said in tears. The nightmare for Nicole Lovell's mother began on the morning of Jan. 27, 2016. ""I pushed the door open, and the nightstand was up against the door,"" Weeks told ""48 Hours"" correspondent Peter Van Sant. ""That night … I was gonna knock on the wall and tell her to come in … and sleep with me like she usually does … and I didn't do it,"" she said tearfully. Sometime in the middle of the night, the 13-year-old had climbed out of her bedroom window taking along her phone and her favorite blue cartoon blanket. ""Did you call her cell phone?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Oh yeah, a bunch of times,"" she replied. ""And what would happen?"" ""It'd go -- straight to voicemail.  I text-messaged her, everybody was calling her.  Texting her,"" said Weeks. Weeks called police and began scouring the area. Before long, a neighborhood mother gave her some chilling news. ""Nicole had been playing with her … daughters and said that Nicole had said she was goin' out on a date,"" said Weeks. Like millions of teens, Nicole spent a lot of her social time online. So Weeks feared she might have left to see someone she'd met on the internet. ""You must be a bit panicked at this point?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah,"" she replied. Local News Report: The FBI has now joined regional and state law enforcement in the search.  This afternoon they canvassed from neighborhood… Nicole's disappearance also sent shockwaves through her hometown of Blacksburg, Virginia, the scene of that infamous 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. Blacksburg Police press conference:  This community is known for stepping up and we need them to do that at this time as we pray for the return of a beautiful young girl. By midday, Blacksburg was stepping up again. WDBJ News report: More than 1,200 searchers are on a mission to find the 13-year-old. Volunteers even brought an infrared drone to aid in the search for Nicole. ""I know she wouldn't go nowhere for that many hours without her medicine,"" said Weeks. Nicole was born with a damaged liver and needed a transplant before her first birthday. Now a teenager, she still needed her anti-rejection medication every day to survive.  Her illness and surgical treatment had left Nicole with scars on her stomach and neck. Weeks says Nicole had emotional scars as well. ""So she was being bullied?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. She hated going to school,"" Weeks replied. ""She would always make me write her a note for gym because they would pick on her about her scar."" Nicole's social media posts reveal a sadly typical teenage story: so lonely she'd had suicidal thoughts, longing for love and convinced nobody cared about her. Weeks says Nicole not only had trouble fitting in, she also had a difficult relationship with her father, David Lovell. He did prison time on a drug charge and he's had other problems with the law. ""She wanted his attention,"" Weeks said. ""She wanted his love."" ""I have regrets that I wasn't there. I feel … you know, what did I do wrong, why wasn't I there for her more often,"" said Lovell. He'd left Tammy before Nicole was born. The two were never married. ""When you would go to work, was there anyone supervising her?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah, my parents,"" she replied. ""Your parents, did they live at the house?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes."" ""So she never went unsupervised?"" ""No,"" said Weeks. But Nicole was leading an unsupervised life online through the social media apps on her smartphone. ""It's like a loaded gun,"" said Pamela Casey, a district attorney in Blount County, Ala., who is on a national crusade warning people about the dangers of social media. ""This is the new crime of our time,"" she said. Pamela Casey PSA: If you pick up your child's phone and you don't know the password, that's a problem.  If you don't know… Casey began speaking out long before Nicole Lovell disappeared in Virginia. Her online safety videos have been seen by millions across the country. Pamela Casey PSA: I can actually go live on Periscope and post updates to you guys… if I can do that live sitting in my office, then your child can do that live in their bedroom. ""Years ago, you had to worry about your kid getting snatched.  Parents don't realize that essentially your kid could get snatched -- their life taken by somebody they meet in their own bedroom,"" said Casey. By late on the day Nicole Lovell vanished, her parents' hope was fading with the winter light. ""I didn't sleep at all that night, I waited…"" said Weeks. But it would be three days before Nicole's parents had to face the horrifying news that her body had been found. ""Your whole world just comes tumbling down,"" Weeks cried, ""because she was my everything."" ""Coley had a passion for pandas, music, dancing ... Nicole touched many people throughout her short life,"" Weeks said at a press conference the day she got the news, referring to Nicole by her nickname. Weeks was quickly was overcome by emotion and left the podium. Shock and sadness were everywhere, but investigators had gotten a big break. And it came from Nicole Lovell herself. She'd left behind virtual evidence of a real-life murder. Nicole's dad, David Lovell, says even before her body was found, investigators had found a solid lead -- she had handwritten the usernames and passwords to all her accounts on her bedroom wall. FBI computer forensics experts traced Nicole's account information and quickly established that she'd regularly used Kik – a popular chat app attractive to teens, in part, because they can communicate anonymously without their parents knowing. ""When you had her phone, did you ever click on the Kik app just to see what was inside?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""No,"" she replied.""I just made her delete it, uninstall it."" ""Do you believe she reinstalled it? ""Yeah,"" said Weeks. So the FBI put in what they call an emergency disclosure request to Kik. They wanted to see Nicole's personal account, and they make a startling discovery.  It turns out that in the last two days of her life, she'd been messaging with a person who had a chilling username: ""Dr_Tombstone."" Using an IP address provided by Kik, investigators traced the Dr_Tombstone screen name to David Eisenhauser, 18, a freshman engineering student at Virginia Tech. David Eisenhauer seemed the last person in the world capable of killing a 13-year-old girl.  He'd been a high school track star. Former classmate Dorothy Callahan says his brains and charisma were as strong as his strides. ""He was a very celebrated student, he always had straight A's,"" Callahan said. ""And he was sort of cocky, and he was like, 'Yeah I'm David Eisenhauer, I was just on the local news. I'm a big deal.'"" Three days after Nicole went missing, Eisenhauer was picked up by police at his dorm and taken in for questioning. His roommate, Jeremy Basdeo, walked in on the startling aftermath. ""I went to my room and I saw the door open,"" he said. ""And I got turned around by the Virginia State Police and the FBI."" ""And what did they say?"" Van Sant asked. ""They said, 'Don't worry.  It's not about you.  It's about your roommate,'"" he replied. Basdeo told ""48 Hours"" that Eisenhauer's behavior the night Nicole Lovell vanished was really odd. ""He put on boots. But it wasn't raining that hard for boots. But, you know, I just let it go. And then -- he came back at 2:00 in the morning,"" Basdeo continued. ""Did you ever see a knife in the room?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""He usually leaves[s] it on his desk."" ""Was it on his desk when the cops showed up?"" Van Sant asked. ""No. They couldn't find it,"" said Basdeo. Eisenhauer soon admitted to police he'd talked to Nicole outside her house that night. He was arrested and charged with abduction. Eisenhauer's statements led them to another young woman, Natalie Keepers. She was brought in for questioning, too. What did 19-year-old Natalie Keepers know about what happened to Nicole Lovell? Keepers -- another Virginia Tech freshman and another unlikely person of interest. ""She wanted to study engineering and be like her father who worked for NASA,"" Mark Jenkins, a former boyfriend, told ""48 Hours."" Investigators strongly suspected Keepers was involved.  She too was arrested. With  two people in custody, police made a grisly discovery. Nicole Lovell's nude body was located 90 miles away in North Carolina. ""What kind of wounds were on her body?"" Van Sant asked Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson. ""She was stabbed… her throat was cut,"" he replied. ""…and then the thoughts turn to, 'who are the animals who could have done something like this to her?'"" District Attorney Pamela Casey said Eisenhauer and Keepers may represent a new kind of predator. ""Sometimes it's usually the people we least expect,"" Casey warned. ""They could be your next door neighbor,"" she said. ""…they can stay behind their phone and hide behind their phone -- just like your child is doin'."" Casey said criminals often use apps like Kik. Why? Because it's where kids hang out online. In fact, Kik -- a Canadian company -- claims that millions of American teens use their app every month. ""You can be anybody…"" said a convicted predator we'll call ""Steve."" He should know. ""Steve,"" 38, said he used the Internet to groom kids and spent 10 years in prison for molestation. He told ""48 Hours"" he now feels a new urge to sound the alarm about anonymous chat apps like Kik. ""Kik … is a predator's paradise,"" he said. ""Pedophiles, do they go on Kik, pose as a 13, 14, 15-year-old in order to hopefully strike up a relationship with a child?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes, that's quite common on there,"" ""Steve"" replied. ""Steve"" demonstrated just how easy it is for an adult to use the Kik app to begin a conversation with a child. We created -- and later deleted -- a Kik account for the demonstration. ""Steve"" showed how us how the app could be used to target children. ""My message is: 'I'm sad and lonely,'"" said ""Steve"". After hitting send, it took just 44 seconds for the first response to arrive.  Another girl, apparently a teenager, responded less than three minutes later. ""In two days max, I could have her sending me nude pictures,"" ""Steve"" said. ""Once you make 'em happy, you got their heart, once you got their heart, everything else follows."" Three months had passed since Nicole Lovell's murder. With David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers still behind bars, investigators had discovered text messages that led them to the door of Bryce Dustin. ""I almost felt like he was like a little brother, Dustin said of Eisenhauer. It was on a gaming site that Dustin first chatted with Eisenhauer. And though they never met in person, they began a six-year-long internet friendship. ""David, you know, kept coming back to me for advice on everything,"" said Dustin. ""What kind of problems would he ask you for advice about?"" Van Sant asked. ""Girls was a big one,"" Dustin replied. Dustin told ""48 Hours"" he remembers Eisenhauer talking last winter about a problem he had with one girl in particular, a girl Dustin now believes was Nicole Lovell. ""He told me that he had found out she was underage and that … she wanted to be with him. And that she was going to expose him if he wasn't with her,"" he recalled. He said Eisenhauer was worried about being outed in a relationship with an underage girl. So he offered some big brother kind of advice. ""If she wants to be your girlfriend, you know, let her, but don't be the greatest boyfriend, just like don't text her, just ignore her,"" Dustin advised. ""…she'll go away."" Another family was about to have one of their daughters go away as well -- in the car of an online predator in Spokane, Washington. ""Her last moments, is what flashes through my mind. That's my nightmare,"" said Nicole's father, David Lovell. Lovell says he wishes he had done better in protecting Nicole. ""If it can happen to my family, it can happen to anybody. I mean, flat out anybody,"" he said. It can happen to any family, including one in Spokane, Washington, about 2,500 miles away from Virginia. The parents here got a tip that their 15-year-old daughter was being targeted by a 30-year-old man. And what's worse? The two were planning to run away that very night. ""She was gonna leave her iPad, hop in the car … with a man she doesn't really even know,"" said Detective Elise Robertson. It was June 7, 2013, when Detective Robertson of the Spokane Police Department's Special Victims Unit got the kind of call cops all over the country have come to expect. ""A father was saying that his daughter was having an Internet relationship with a 30-year-old man and he had just found out…"" she said. ""And that's when everything broke loose,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Until that moment, Brandy, and her husband, Branden Syrotchen, seemed to have the quintessential American family. She, teaching at a local church, he studying for a PhD in Psychology. They'd been hands-on parents, raising their sons, Joshua and Josiah, and daughters Ariel and Elizabeth. They shared a love of God, country, sports and each other. ""My parents were pretty strict,"" said Elizabeth Syrotchen. Elizabeth, now over 18, says it wasn't always easy reconciling her upbringing with a growing lust for life. ""I felt like my parents were holding me back from what the average kid gets to experience,"" she said. ""And how much did your parents monitor your life?"" Van Sant asked. ""I would say that they thought that they were monitoring me … they didn't understand that they actually weren't monitoring me,"" she explained. ""They probably had no clue about Kik and those dating sites."" But her parents did become suspicious when Elizabeth, then 15, suddenly started acting strangely. ""She would be going to bed earlier than normal,"" her father said. Elizabeth seemed distracted -- less interested in family activities, in church, and even in friends.  Her parents took her smartphone away and asked to see her social media accounts. She refused. ""At that point you're like, 'OK, something's really wrong here,'"" said Brandy Syrotchen. They were stunned to learn just how wrong.  It all started with a phone call from Elizabeth's best friend's mother … a call that turned their world upside down. ""Elizabeth is dating a 30-year-old …And he plans on coming down and … getting her at 3 o'clock in the morning,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""That very day?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. And we're like, ""W—what???"" Brandy replied. Elizabeth was angry and evasive, but her parents finally got her passwords and soon discovered the truth. She had been communicating with a stranger: a 30-year-old Seattle-area man named Jason. ""Jason Richards says, 'When I see you, baby, I am grabbing you. Pulling you close to me. And holding you tightly,'"" Brandy Syrotchen tearfully read aloud from her daughter's correspondence with the man. ""And what does Elizabeth say?"" Van Sant asked. ""'No kiss?' And Jason says, 'Baby, I'm gonna kiss you deeply,'"" Brandy continued. ""This guy's evil. She's fooled. She's lured in,"" said Branden Syrotchen. The communications show that initially, Elizabeth told Jason she was 18, but later admitted her real age: 15.  The Syrotchens were stunned to learn that the pair had already met in person and been intimate. They were even discussing leaving the country. The two had used apps including Facebook and Kik. ""This is playing out in some ways like your own personal family horror film,"" Van Sant commented to Elizabeth's parents. ""Yeah,"" they replied. The horror continued as the Syrotchens realized that within hours, Jason would be driving the 280 miles from Seattle to Spokane to pick up their daughter. They locked Elizabeth in her room with no phone or Internet access and called police. ""'This guy wants to kidnap my daughter tonight. He's planning to kidnap my daughter tonight,'"" said Branden Syrotchen. ""Were your hands kind of tied?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""What do you do at that moment? You have a 15-year-old girl who's your only witness who's denying everything,"" the detective said. Detective Robertson says that without hard evidence of an actual crime, police had to stay on the sidelines. ""So there's nothing they can do for you?"" Van Sant asked the Syrotchens. ""There's absolutely nothing they can do for me,"" Branden replied. ""And when you hear that you feel totally helpless. And it's, like, 'OK, well, what are you gonna do now?'"" said Brandy. What they did was hatch their own plan to turn the tables on the man who was about to lure their daughter away. ""This is my daughter and nobody's gonna mess with her and nobody's gonna get her.  And I'm gonna do what it takes,"" said Brandy. Jason had already messaged from the car. ""I needed to communicate with him to get him to our house,"" Brandy explained. Gritting her teeth, Brandy Syrotchen went online -- impersonating her own daughter. ""For seven hours, I sat there and listened to him, 'Oh baby I can't wait to see you … I can't wait to get you in my arms …lay in the same bed together, wake up in the morning,'"" she said in tears. ""And for seven hours I communicated back, 'Oh baby, I love you too …I can't wait.'"" ""In the pit of your stomach that must have made you …"" Van Sant began. ""It made me sick!"" she said. ""Jason is getting ever closer to your house, ever closer to your daughter,"" Van Sant noted. Standing in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, Branden told Van Sant, ""My wife was up there and she was on the iPad."" ""She's communicating with him. Posing as your daughter,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Exactly. Yes"" Branden recalled that Brandy kept the conversation with Jason Richards going, in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, he and his friends had set up a sting operation like something out of an action movie. As Branden waited in his car on one side of the alley getting updates from his wife on the phone, his friend, Damon, waited in his car on the other side of the street. ""So the idea is like a pincer, right, you're gonna trap.  It's like a bear trap that's gonna close,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" Branden affirmed. Branden's friend, Phil, brought his 12-gauge shotgun. He'd been trained in Special Forces and had no idea how Jason would react. It was 3 a.m. in Spokane, Washington, but could just as easily been high noon. As Branden Syrotchen and his team lay in wait, headlights appeared at one end of the alley.  A 30-year-old man's sexual road trip to take a 15-year-old girl from her family was about to come to a shocking end. ""He pulls in. At this time, we go ahead and we call Damon down here. And Damon-- just books it,"" Branden explained. ""I'm pulling in here … Jason pulls in right there."" Branden's friend, Phil, quickly approached the vehicle, shotgun raised. ""I said …'Driver … Put your hands on the steering wheel. Do not move or I will shoot you. …Couple of times he moved his hands and I said, 'What part of do not move do you not understand?'"" Phil demonstrated. ""If Jason makes some sort of move, are you prepared to pull that trigger?"" Van Sant asked. ""If he exited the car abruptly, I would've shot him,"" Phil replied. They called police, who arrived minutes later and arrested Jason. In his SUV, they found cell phones and a pair of hunting knives. They would later discover he also owned a handgun. ""He was caught but it wasn't over,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Ninety minutes later, Jason came face-to-face with Spokane Det. Elise Robertson in a videotaped interrogation: Det. Robertson: So Jason, tell me a little bit about yourself. Jason Richards: I work for Royal Cup Coffee. Detective Robertson learned Jason was actually Jason Richards, a 30-year-old, divorced coffee distributer from the Seattle area. Like David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers in the Lovell case, Jason Richards seemed nice and successful on the surface. ""Who is this guy?"" Van Sant asked the detective. ""Jason is the guy next door,"" she replied. He tried to turn his crime into a love story: Jason Richards: I pretty much fell for her very quickly … we said ""I love you"" pretty quickly, about a week and a half into really talking with each other. At first, Richards insisted he had no idea Elizabeth was only 15 until a policeman told him at the time of his arrest. Jason Richards: He told me that she wasn't 18. Det. Robertson: OK. Jason Richards: I responded, ""Come again?"" And I'm like, ""She's, no she's 18."" ""He was lying, the whole time he was lying. The whole time, over, and over, and over, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,"" Det. Robertson told Van Sant. To see if her instincts were right, Detective Robertson asked to see Richards' Facebook page. There were literally hundreds of exchanges between him and Elizabeth. ""And I start looking at it and I realize, 'Oh, he knew, he knew before he ever came over here she was 15,'"" Det. Robertson remembered. ""I looked right at him and I said … 'So are you gonna tell me the truth now?"" Det. Robertson: Wanna tell me the truth now? Jason Richards: I fell in love with her. And I didn't know what to do. Det. Robertson: And she told you that she was 15 and still in school? Jason Richards: Eventually. Det. Robertson: Right. Elizabeth told her parents she was going jogging, but instead came to a parking lot near her house. ""This is our first meeting spot,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant at the lot. ""When you actually saw him face-to-face, what did you think?"" he asked. ""'Holy crap,' like, I think it became a reality to me that it's not just somebody that I'm talking to over the Internet!"" she replied. Elizabeth says Jason took her to a hotel, got down on one knee and proposed marriage -- and then they got in bed.  In the following weeks, he came to town again. ""On those visits you did have sex with him each time?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah, we did,"" Elizabeth replied. ""For you, Jason is what?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""He's a sexual predator,"" she replied. Jason Richards: I've completely just f----d up my life. ""My life was destroyed,"" said Elizabeth. The events of that chaotic day still seem to haunt the Syrotchens, too. ""This hits you right now like a punch across the face,"" Van Sant commented to Branden. ""It's just absolutely unbelievable,"" he replied in tears. ""This guy found out that she was a minor and that's --and then after that's when he decided to sleep with her,"" Branden continued. Richards pleaded guilty to child rape and communication with a minor for immoral purposes.  His lawyer argued Richards has autism, which can be a mitigating factor for several crimes in Washington State. He got a light sentence: three years. ""When you learned that Jason was in jail?"" Van San ""It broke me,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant. Inexperienced at love, Elizabeth says her online connection with Jason had been instant. ""Everything progresses faster online because you're just more comfortable,"" she explained. ""...you don't have to talk to that person in person."" District Attorney Pamela Casey says far too many internet predators are turning to apps like Kik, and their alleged crimes are making headlines across the U.S.—more crimes than Facebook and Instagram users combined. In May, disgraced ex-N.Y. congressman Anthony Weiner pleaded guilty to a federal obscenity charge for sexting with a 15-year-old girl, using social media believed to include Kik. Back in Spokane, Van Sant asked Elizabeth, ""Did you fall in love with Jason?"" ""Yeah, I did,"" she replied. ""I hate to say it, but part of me still loves him."" But Elizabeth didn't really have the whole story about Jason Richards. In fact, she may not have been his one true love. On Richards' phone, Det. Robertson had discovered graphic photos of young women and men. ""What's your reaction to all that?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. Stunned, and in tears, she stood up and left the interview room. About 10 minutes later, she returned. ""Do you want to say anything?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. ""I just feel so fooled. Like, for three years I've been defending him and it's not right, it's not right,"" she replied. Seeing some of Jason's graphic photo collection for herself drives home the point. ""That's a lot of pictures though, of a lot of different women …oh…and a man,"" she said looking at the photos on a computer. ""Honestly, if anything, it makes me feel better. …It's going to be easier for me to move on."" Looking back, Elizabeth's mother, Brandy Syrotchen, says she wishes the judge had given Jason Richards as much as life in prison. But back in Virginia, Nicole Lovell's mother says there is no punishment severe enough for the accused predators. ""I want both of 'em to suffer,"" said Tammy Weeks. And she says Eisenhauer and Keepers aren't the only ones who should have to answer for her daughter's murder.  She blames Kik, too. ""They need to shut Kik down,"" she said. ""It's just disgusting."" Kik is now a billion-dollar company and the CEO declined ""48 Hours""' request for an on-camera interview. ""It's ironic when the head of a social media company won't talk to us, so we're heading off to a technology conference in Brooklyn, New York, in hopes of catching up, with the CEO of Kik,"" said Van Sant. Evidence suggests Nicole Lovell was lured to her death over the Kik chat app – one of the same apps Elizabeth Syrotchen used to communicate with the man who almost lured her away. As Kik's CEO Ted Livingston left the stage at the conference, ""48 Hours"" found him … on his smartphone. ""Mr. Livingston, Peter Van Sant, how are you?"" Van Sant said. ""With CBS News … I just want to ask you a quick question … What personal responsibility do you have to make sure that children are safe who use the Kik app?"" ""Yeah, I think I have a huge responsibility,"" Livingston replied. ""I'm sure you're familiar with Nicole Lovell, a 13-year-old girl in Virginia,"" Van Sant continued. ""What would you say to Nicole's parents?"" ""Like, when we heard about that case, that hit the office. That hit me super hard, like, it's just, like, hard to hear about something and I grew up with a brother with disabilities..."" said Livingston. Like many social media companies, Kik posts an online guide for parents and, in a statement, told ""48 Hours"" the company cooperates with law enforcement. Ted Livingston claims his app is as safe as the competition. ""I think it's no different than Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. You know, you have bad people going -- "" he said. ""As a parent, I disagree. I can check my child's Facebook account and Twitter account, I friend them. But with Kik I can't,"" Van Sant pointed out. ""Yeah, I think that's no different than Instagram. You have a private mode. You can have private messaging, all that exists there,"" Livingston replied. That's true, but Kik's design is attracting millions of teens, in part, because many believe its parentproof -- the best app to keep their social lives secret. Sadly, predators also can keep secrets on Kik. ""Kids are going to use a messenger. If we were to shut down Kik tomorrow, there'll be 10 right behind it,"" said Livingston. Back in Spokane, Elizabeth Syrotchen is still struggling to make sense of what happened to her.  Things with her parents are still tough … mostly because, at 18, she met a new boyfriend at the gym. He was 35. ""Would I like to see some things change?  Of course,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""We'd all love to see that,"" Branden Syrotchen added. ""You have to compromise. You can't just be your way or the highway,"" Elizabeth told her father on camera. Jason Richards got out of prison in May, and the case against him is closed. But in Blacksburg, Virginia, Nicole Lovell's murder case has yet to be resolved. At a joint hearing for David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers, no cameras were allowed inside as police presented new details of Nicole's murder -- details they say were provided by Keepers herself. News report: Investigators testified Eisenhauer covered Lovell's mouth and cut her throat.  Keepers later helped Eisenhauer load Lovell's body into his car, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. A detective testified that Keepers admitted to helping Eisenhauer plan the murder and then dispose of Nicole's body. And that Keepers was excited to be part of something secretive. News report: She said he was a sociopath and she was ""a sociopath in training."" It's all too much for Nicole's mom, Tammy Weeks, who comes to court, but can't force herself to sit through the day. ""I didn't know he had stripped her naked and poured bleach on her,"" she said. There is no evidence that Nicole was sexually assaulted, though Eisenhauer is formally charged with first-degree murder and abduction -- Keepers as an accessory to murder. Both also are charged with transporting or concealing a dead body. Eisenhauer has reportedly told investigators, ""I believe the truth can set me free."" ""Is there any doubt who is responsible for the death of your daughter?"" Van Sant asked David Lovell, Nicole's father. ""No,"" he declared. Eisenhauer's former internet buddy, Bryce Dustin, doesn't have much doubt either, especially after a final exchange he had with Eisenhauer around the time Nicole disappeared. ""I without a doubt believe that he did it,"" said Dustin. ""He texted me and said, you know, 'The original plan's failed.'  And he was like, he's like, 'Do you know where I can hide a body?'"" Dustin continued. At the time, Dustin thought Eisenhauer was kidding.  He, along with so many in the shell-shocked community of Blacksburg, still want to know how two intelligent college kids with their lives in front of them might wind up involved in taking the life of a 13-year-old girl. ""I wish he would've done it to me instead of her,"" Weeks cried. ""I would trade places with her in a heartbeat. 'Cause she deserved to live."" Nicole Lovell's death is a dark reminder of how social media has profoundly changed society. ""I hope … everybody learns from this.  Hold their kids tight. 'Cause it can happen to you,"" said Weeks. Today, our children have a host of new ways to live… and new ways to die as well. David Eisenhauer is scheduled to be tried in November 2017.  Natalie Keepers is scheduled to be tried in February 2018 . If convicted, both could face life in prison with no parole.

457,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/columbine-texas-mass-shooting.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Astor When two students shot up Columbine High School on a sunny Tuesday in 1999, it felt like an earthquake. There had been school shootings before in the country, including at least six the previous year. But this was the deadliest on record, with 13 people killed, and — perhaps more important psychologically — millions of people across the United States watched it happen on live television. Though it took place in a small town in Colorado, it was experienced as a national calamity. To this day, Columbine endures as an emblem of random, senseless murder. But as of this week, it is no longer one of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in postwar America. When it happened, Columbine was the nation’s fifth-deadliest mass shooting since World War II, surpassed only by attacks at a Luby’s restaurant in Killeen, Tex., in 1991 (23 deaths); at a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, Calif., in 1984 (21); at the University of Texas at Austin in 1966 (15); and at a post office in Edmond, Okla., in 1986 (14). Yet today, not one of those shootings is among the five deadliest. That category, which previously covered more than 30 years, is now occupied entirely by shootings from the past decade — all but one from the past five years. Fifty-eight people were killed in the Las Vegas shooting. The Orlando nightclub shooting last year, 49. The 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, 32. The 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, 27. As of Sunday, the fifth-deadliest mass shooting since World War II is the attack on a Baptist church in tiny Sutherland Springs, Tex., which killed 26 people. Columbine was the first mass shooting in nearly eight years that killed 10 or more people — and after 1999, seven years would pass without one. Today, such gaps are unthinkable. Five of the past six years have included at least one shooting with 10 or more casualties. The American Psychological Association’s 2017 “Stress in America” survey found that “violence and crime” was one of the five most common sources of stress in the United States. And people interviewed after mass shootings frequently express a sense that nowhere is safe anymore: not school, not work, not church, not clubs, not concerts, not movie theaters or malls or Walmarts. But amid the horror and fear, a central emotion seen after Columbine seems to be missing: surprise. Arthur Evans, chief executive of the American Psychological Association, emphasized that there was no scientific literature on whether public attitudes and reactions to mass shootings had changed. But “anecdotally,” he said, “it appears that the public is reacting differently than we did when the events first started happening.” At some point, “How could this happen?” gave way to “Here we go again.” The mood is seen in interviews and even in satire: The Onion has published the same article, headlined “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens,” after six mass shootings. This is not surprising, Dr. Evans said, given what scientists know about how we react to repeated stimuli. Studies have shown that when people are exposed to continuous light or sound, “they become less sensitive to that stimuli,” he said. “It would be expected that if people are exposed to these kinds of events in the news all the time, that they’re going to be less reactive. That wouldn’t be surprising at all.” In April 2009, almost exactly 10 years after Columbine, a shooting at an immigrant center in Binghamton, N.Y., killed the same number of people: 13. It came on the heels of a shooting rampage that killed 10 people in rural Alabama in March. But unlike Columbine, it was followed seven months later by yet another mass shooting: this one at Fort Hood, Tex., where a gunman again killed 13 people. And the next eight years brought at least seven shootings with similar or greater death tolls. Today, the shootings in Binghamton and Alabama are rarely mentioned.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. People visit a makeshift memorial on Oct. 16 for victims of the mass shooting in Las Vegas. (AP) Lawsuits related to the Las Vegas massacre are mounting, as 14 more concertgoers have initiated legal action -- including one victim who was so traumatized after the attack she said she's mistaken the sound of rain for Stephen Paddock’s deadly gunfire. The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino -- the perch from where Paddock fired -- organizers of the country concert Paddock fired on and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled Paddock to rapidly shoot are all named as defendants in the lawsuits filed in Las Vegas state court Wednesday on behalf of the 14 concertgoers. Tucker_0830 ""I don't sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,"" Elisha Seng, a 46-year-old from Bartlett, Ill., told The Associated Press. She said she even jumped up from her bed once as it was raining. ""I thought it was gunshots,” she said, adding she can’t erase the mental images of bullets landing around her on the concert grounds -- and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. Seng, who wasn't physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. JASON ALDEAN DETAILS EARLY MOMENTS OF THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME Michelle Simpson Tuegel, an attorney representing victim Paige Gasper, a 21-year-old college student who was left with shattered ribs and a lacerated liver after being shot in the massacre, told Fox News it “is going to be a long road for all of these survivors, both physically and emotionally."" “I think that’s hard for these survivors…and the people [killed in the recent church shooting] in Texas will have some of the same roads to deal with, with their trauma,” she said. Tuegel told Fox News in October that Gasper’s family “wants answers” from festival organizers and hotel management. A lead attorney in the lawsuits, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, echoed that call Wednesday. ""We want to get access to documents and discovery that either MGM or Live Nation has in their possession so we can determine how these events can be prevented."" ""These people need answers and are looking for closure and the only way we can get closure is by filing lawsuits and getting information,"" Romanucci told FOX5 Las Vegas. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI, who are handling the investigation, have been unusually tight-lipped since the attack, barely speaking to the media in recent weeks. The 14 civil complaints follow at least three others, one of which is Gasper’s, filed since Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others. The lawsuits seeks unspecific compensation for both ""physical and mental injuries,” The Associated Press reported. The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags on for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to no money, according to The Associated Press. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings for the plaintiffs, which include several people from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday's filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. 'VEGAS STRONG' F-15 FIGHTER JET DEBUTS AT NEVADA AIR SHOW Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite without notice, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over several days, the filings say. Lawyers argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock's bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings also name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. Romanucci said it wasn't yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but the idea was to hold ""the entire supply chain"" responsible. Messages from The Associated Press seeking comment from Slide Fire weren't returned. ""We want to get access to documents and discovery that either MGM or Live Nation has in their possession so we can determine how these events can be prevented, specifically this one,"" Romanucci told FOX5 Las Vegas. Airmen paint fighter jet to commemorate Las Vegas shooting victims, debuts at air show MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting ""a meticulously planned, evil...act"" in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press and added it would respond to any allegations only through ""the appropriate legal channels."" Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but noted the company remains ""heartbroken for the victims."" Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can't fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn't notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. ""They can catch a person counting cards,"" she said. ""But they can't catch someone carrying bags of guns."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), a major gun manufacturer which owns the Smith & Wesson brand, reported a 90% drop in quarterly profit when compared to the same period last year. Profits went from $32 million last year to $3.2 million. The company also reported a 36% drop in sales year-to-year. ""Total revenue for the quarter faced a challenging comparison to last year, when we believe strong consumer demand was driven by personal safety concerns and pre-election fears of increased firearm legislation,"" said CEO James Debney, in a statement. Last year marked a record year for gun sales. The surge was driven by fears that then-President Obama and candidate Hillary Clinton would implement gun controls amid a series of deadly mass shootings. Sales dropped industry-wide after the unexpected victory of Donald Trump, a Republican endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Related: Vista Outdoor's gun and ammo sales tank under Trump American Outdoor Brands has seen a 30% decline in its stock in 2017. ""The firearms industry is still suffering from continued malaise in retail sell-through due to the Trump slump,"" said Rommel Dionisio, a gun industry analyst for Aegis Capital Corp. He said manufacturers and retailers are still dealing with an inventory backlog, because they stocked up prior to the election expecting stronger sales. The stock price for American Outdoor Brands did rise 5% on Thursday after the House passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act earlier this week. That act, if it passes the Senate, would create a nationwide system for concealed carry permits. Dionisio said that might eventually help the industry recover. But stocks plummeted over night after American Outdoor Brands reported its dismal earnings. Debney said that among the few bright spots for the company were the relatively strong sales of compact M&P brand handguns designed for concealed carry. The M&P line of guns also includes AR-15-style rifles. Related: Black Friday was huge for gun sales The company's quarter ended on October 31. This report includes a month of gun sales activity after the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history. But it does not include figures for November, which saw a month-to-month uptick for background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which serve as a proxy for gun sales.

But before the church held its first service since the attack, they were serene.  “It’s just not a problem to us,” said Holcombe, 86, adding that he and 84-year-old Claryce believed their dead family members were now alive again in heaven. “We know exactly where the family is, and it’s not going to be long until we’ll both be there,” he said. “And we’re really sort of looking forward to it.” The Holcombes were upbeat and full of good humor in a telephone interview, and they were not an exception in a deeply evangelical part of Texas. Relatives and friends of the 25 victims in tiny Sutherland Springs believe good will come from evil and that their loved ones are safe for eternity, and breathing again, with God. The gunman was shot twice by a local man as he left the church. Investigators said the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot after crashing his car. On Sunday the First Baptist church held its first service since the shooting at a local baseball field, with folding chairs set up under a large white tent. The front three rows were reserved for church members and their families. Steady rain fell on the tarp roof while people slowly filed in. Some hugged. Others prayed or sat quietly. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of the First Baptist church, was absent last week. His 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was killed. He told the service on Sunday evil was responsible for the worst mass shooting in Texas history. He said he wanted to be sure everyone who walked in to the service “knows that those who died lived for their Lord and savior”. Rather than chose darkness as the gunman did seven days ago, he said, “we choose life”. Pomeroy’s voice cracked as he paused, and described the victims as “my best friends and my daughter”. Then he wiped his eyes before saying: “I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today.” The crowd stood, clapped and raised their hands to heaven. Psychologists say such deep faith can help families deal with such a ghastly event. Even so, they warn that leaning too heavily on religious beliefs can stunt natural grieving and result in post-traumatic stress. “I can see potentially it could be some form of denial, a delayed traumatic reaction, and if you don’t have some kind of negative feelings, it can catch up with you,” said Bethany Brand, a clinical psychologist and trauma expert. Gina Hassan, a psychologist in northern California, said Sutherland Spring’s faith was invaluable, “but if it’s relied upon in a rigid way, then it’s going to be a problem down the line and come back to bite you later on”. Local veterinarian George Hill, a relative of the Holcombes, said an evangelical belief in Christ was the only way to deal with such a tragedy. “We haven’t lost hope,” he said. “They are not gone. They are just gone ahead. And we know we’ll see them again. It looks like evil won but it didn’t. Good is going to win.” Pastor Mike Clements of the First Baptist church in Floresville, a small city 14 miles from Sutherland Springs, will officiate over the funeral services for the extended Holcombe family on Wednesday. The dead include Bryan Holcombe, Joe and Claryce Holcombe’s son, and his wife Karla. Their son Danny Holcombe was killed, with his 18-month-old daughter, Noah. Crystal Holcombe, who was 18 weeks pregnant, was Bryan and Karla Holcombe’s daughter-in-law. Emily, Megan and Greg Hill, three children from Karla’s first marriage, were also shot and killed. Under Texas law, Crystal Holcombe’s unborn child is counted as a victim, making a death toll of nine for the family. People in Sutherland Springs are truly grieving, Clements said. But he added: “It doesn’t get any better than this. There is nothing better than heaven when you are a believer.”",2017-11-12 14:42:29,'Not a problem to us': Texas family who lost eight in shooting find hope in faith,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Not signed up yet? Click here. Developing now, Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017: THE LEAD STORY: Revelations about anti-Trump views of an FBI agent who played a key role in Michael Flynn's questioning and in the Hillary Clinton email probe has cast doubt on the credibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe and the integrity of agency ... Peter Strzok, who was removed from Mueller’s investigation because he sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague, oversaw the FBI’s interviews with ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Fox News confirmed. Strzok, a former deputy to the assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, also changed former FBI Director James Comey’s early draft language about Hillary Clinton’s actions regarding her private email server from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless,” Fox News confirmed. The language being edited was important because classified material that’s been mishandled for “gross negligence” calls for criminal consequences, analysts point out. Strzok is under review by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General for the role he played in the Clinton email investigation. The reports about Strzok prompted President Trump to suggest over the weekend that the handling and closure of the Clinton email probe without criminal charges allegedly was driven by partisan politics. MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR CONYERS?: Another woman has accused embattled Rep. John Conyers of sexual misconduct as he is expected to make an announcement about his political future today ... Elisa Grubbs, who says she worked for Conyers for more than a decade, reportedly said in an affidavit that he slid his hand up her skirt and rubbed her thighs while she was sitting next to him in the front row of a church. Grubbs is the cousin of another accuser, Marion Brown, who reached a confidential settlement with Conyers over sexual harassment allegations. The new allegations emerged as Conyers, 88, is expected to speak on a Detroit radio show today about his political future, according to his attorney, Arnold Reed. Conyers is the longest-serving current House member and has already stepped aside from his position as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. MOORE BACKING: The Republican National Committee is once again supporting embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore after President Trump formally endorsed him, a senior RNC official told Fox News ...  Despite losing the backing of many top Republicans, Moore was praised by Trump who said that Republicans would need his vote ""on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more."" The RNC's reversal comes three weeks after it announced it had severed its fundraising ties to Moore following allegations that he'd molested two teenagers when he was in his 30s. GAY RIGHTS VERSUS RELIGION IN HIGH COURT: The encounter between a same-sex couple and a Colorado baker lasted just a few seconds -- but the legal, political and social impact could extend for decades after the Supreme Court takes up their case today ... The justices will hear oral arguments in perhaps the most closely watched appeal so far this term, pitting religious conviction against anti-discrimination laws.  At issue is a July 2012 encounter, when Charlie Craig and David Mullins of Denver visited Masterpiece Cakeshop to buy a custom-made wedding cake. Owner Jack Phillips refused his services when told it was for a same-sex couple. A state civil rights commission sanctioned Phillips after a formal complaint from the gay couple. ANOTHER STEP CLOSER TO TAX REFORM: The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has voted to go to conference on tax legislation with the Senate, moving Congress another step closer to a final bill ... The House voted 222-192 to go to conference with the Senate, setting up formal negotiations on the legislation that could take weeks to complete. Seven Republicans voted ""no."" The Republican-led Senate was expected to hold a similar conference vote later this week.

464,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/15/congress-complicity-gun-lobby-legislation-domestic-violence,"Communities across the US want action to prevent yet more senseless deaths. The commonsense legislation I have proposed would do just that Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST The Sunday before last, a convicted domestic abuser used an illegally obtained AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to murder 25 parishioners worshipping at the First Baptist church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The Sutherland Springs shooter was far from the first killer to have a history of domestic violence. According to a July report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than half of female homicide victims are murdered by their intimate partners. Women are five times more likely to die as a result of domestic violence when there is a gun in the home.  The correlation between the presence of a gun and the loss of a life in domestic disputes is undeniable. Guns turn dangerous disputes into deadly ones, and there are commonsense steps Congress can take today to save lives. The federal background check program can prevent the sale of firearms to people who are a danger to themselves or others. But the program is only as good as the information that is provided to it – a tragic truth we have seen far too many times, including in my own state of Connecticut. The Sutherland Springs shooter had been convicted in military court of assaulting his then wife and her child. He had served a year in a military prison. And, although current federal law prohibits convicted domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing a firearm, Devin Patrick Kelley was able to purchase at least four guns from federally licensed dealers before carrying out his horrific crime. The reason: the military failed to notify the background check database of the killer’s domestic violence assault. In 2014, Connecticut mother Lori Jackson was shot and killed by her estranged husband, who had legally obtained a handgun while subject to a temporary restraining order. In that moment when Lori Jackson was most vulnerable, laws protecting her were the weakest. The very next day, that temporary order would have become permanent and he would have been barred from purchasing that gun. In October, I introduced the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act to close the gaping loophole that permits intimate partners to retain access to firearms, even when they are under court restraining orders. There is no reason we should fail to protect women when they are protected by a temporary restraining order preceding a permanent restraining order. Extending that ban to include temporary restraining orders could be the difference between life and death. This bill is a narrowly crafted, commonsense measure that would be a step toward preventing another death like Lori Jackson’s, or another community torn apart, like Sutherland Springs. I am frequently asked how I can continue to hope for passage of any gun control measure, when Congress seems paralyzed by inaction, in the grip of the gun lobby. But Congress has acted before. Twelve years after James Brady was shot and crippled, and Ronald Reagan was almost assassinated, Congress passed the Brady Bill. In the end, voices of millions of Americans in support of commonsense solutions outweighed the millions of dollars spent by the gun lobby. Now, I believe, America is reaching a similar tipping point. Communities across the country are calling on Congress to cease its complicity in the continued, senseless deaths of Americans. Enough is enough. It is time to honor victims of gun violence with action – focused not on the last mass shooting or individual tragedies, but on preventing future deaths.",2017-11-15 08:26:52,Congress  must end its complicity with the gun lobby | Senator Richard Blumenthal,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Shear President Trump appeared to offer his condolences for the wrong mass shooting on Tuesday in a late-night Twitter post, which was later deleted. “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post at 11:34 p.m., soon after arriving back in the United States from his 12-day trip through Asia. That attack occurred more than a week ago, on Nov. 5, when a gunman opened fire at a church, killing 26 and wounding 20 others. Another mass shooting took place early Tuesday, as a gunman in California opened fire at an elementary school and other locations, killing at least four people and injuring several others before he was fatally shot by the police. It was not immediately clear whether the error was caused by a sloppy cut-and-paste job by a jet-lagged president or some other issue. A spokesman for the White House did not respond to emails seeking an explanation. But Tuesday’s tweet was very similar to a Twitter post by Mr. Trump on the day of the Texas shooting. Critics on Twitter pointed out that the F.B.I. and law enforcement were in fact needed in California. Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California was the 17th mass shooting this month, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.

THE SENATE ON ROY MOORE… -- “Moore expulsion idea splits Senate Republicans,” by Seung Min Kim and John Bresnahan: “Senate Republicans are escalating their demands for embattled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to leave the race, including a growing faction calling for him to be expelled if he wins next month. But some senior Republicans are wary that the chorus of anti-Moore sentiment from Washington will only embolden Moore and his supporters. ... Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the [NRSC], raised the specter of expulsion in a Monday statement. Later, retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona told reporters he would support Democrat Doug Jones over Moore and that expelling Moore should remain on the table. “But other top party leaders weren’t as quick to embrace the idea of expelling Moore from the chamber, which has been attempted but not completed in well more than a century and could raise serious questions about the Senate defying the will of voters. Other Republicans fear the precedent of booting a senator who hasn’t violated any Senate rules or is not facing criminal charges.” http://politi.co/2yZiIlK **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh -- THE WHITE HOUSE … NYT’s Jonathan Martin and Sheryl Gay Stolberg: “Publicly, Mr. McConnell, appearing at a news conference in Louisville, said he was ‘looking at’ drafting a write-in candidate for the Dec. 12 special election. Privately, Mr. McConnell was doing more than merely looking. One idea being discussed, first brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would be for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to run as either a write-in candidate or to be appointed to what was his seat should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office. “Mr. McConnell is supportive of the idea and discussed it on Monday in a telephone call with Vice President Mike Pence that was chiefly about the Republican tax overhaul proposal, according to party officials briefed on the call. Mr. Sessions remains popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has frayed since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s presidential campaign.” http://nyti.ms/2morPqi -- THE PARTY COMMITTEE … “The Republican National Committee Hasn’t Yet Dumped Roy Moore,” by BuzzFeed’s Henry J. Gomez: “About a dozen national party staffers are on the ground in Alabama, handling field organizing duties for next month’s special election between Moore and Democratic nominee Doug Jones, an RNC official told BuzzFeed News. A spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the RNC’s investment was being reevaluated in light of another woman coming forward to accuse Moore of sexually assaulting her in 1977, when she was 16.” http://bzfd.it/2yZk2VU -- THE MOST RECENT ALLEGATIONS, from Gabe Debenedetti in New York. http://politi.co/2htQmER NOTES ON MOORE … -- SOME COMPLICATING FACTORS WITH PUSHING MOORE OUT: Early votes and absentee ballots that have already been counted are irreversible. So if you’ve voted for Roy Moore, you can’t change your vote. -- HOW MUCH WOULD A WRITE-IN CAMPAIGN COST REPUBLICANS? A write-in campaign is tricky. The GOP will have to run some ads or spread the message somehow that voters should write in someone -- perhaps Jeff Sessions -- instead of voting for Moore. But it runs the risk of splitting the Republican vote, and handing the election to Doug Jones, the Democrat. -- WHY JEFF SESSIONS MAKES SENSE. Air time is cheap in Alabama, and Sessions has high name ID. If Trump gets behind him, that could make a big difference. -- IF SESSIONS TAKES THE LEAP, WHO DOES TRUMP CHOOSE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL? Trump has a very aggressive legislative agenda, and if he needs to choose a new attorney general, that will take time and political capital. To get a new attorney general confirmed with minimal pain, Trump would have to listen to McConnell’s suggestions about who can get through the chamber easily. -- EXPULSION IS HARD -- BUT CAN IT BE WORTH IT POLITICALLY? Expulsion takes a while. It’s tricky. The Senate hasn’t expelled a member in more than a century. But is there an argument to be made that Republicans would be better off electing Moore, expelling him and getting Alabama’s Republican governor to appoint another GOP senator? That way two Republicans don’t split the vote. And Republicans get to actually take action to expel someone whose behavior they say they find abhorrent. -- … BUT, BUT, BUT: If the Senate has to expel Moore, it could tear the party apart even further and embolden Steve Bannon in his war against incumbents. And it could look like the Senate is subverting the will of the voters. BY THE WAY … REMEMBER -- NOVEMBER was supposed to be all about tax reform. Republicans don't want to be talking about whether their Senate candidate in Alabama had an unusual interest in high school girls. CARL HULSE’S “ON WASHINGTON” -- “Past Sex Scandals Show McConnell Is Willing to Take a Tough Line”: “Senator Mitch McConnell has a well-documented history of showing little tolerance for sex scandals that he fears could tarnish the image of the Senate and his party. He was a major force behind the effort to push out Larry E. Craig, the Idaho Republican arrested at the Minneapolis airport in 2007 in an undercover sex sting. And he was the chairman of the ethics committee when Senator Bob Packwood, the powerful Oregon Republican, resigned in 1995 under threat of expulsion after he was accused of sexual harassment.” http://nyti.ms/2iT6ikk EDITORIAL ON AL.COM -- WEBSITE FOR THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS, PRESS-REGISTER (MOBILE) and THE HUNTSVILLE TIMES -- “Our view: Roy Moore grossly unfit for office”: “Roy Moore simply cannot be a U.S. Senator.

The poll — which was conducted prior to the most recent allegations against Moore leveled by Beverly Young Nelson, who said Monday that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old — found 59 percent of voters say they considered the original allegations against Moore outlined in a Washington Post article last week very or somewhat credible. Just 17 percent say the allegations are not too credible or not credible at all. The remaining 23 percent don’t know or have no opinion. “There are partisan differences in national views of the Moore allegations, but even among Republican voters, more find the allegations credible than not. Nearly half of GOP voters, 49 percent, say the accusations against Moore are at least somewhat credible; just three-in-10 say they are not too credible or not credible at all.” http://politi.co/2jpLc0Q A message from Google: Google’s AI-driven security protects billions of people.

[Blake] Usry, who was a teenager at the time, remembers seeing Moore at the mall often. ‘He would go and flirt with all the young girls,’ he said. ‘It’d seem like every Friday or Saturday night (you’d see him) walking around the mall, like the kids did.’ “Jason Nelms, who now lives in Tennessee but grew up in nearby Southside, was a regular at the mall when he was a teenager. He recalled being told by a mall employee that they kept watch for an older guy who was known to pick up younger girls. ... [Greg] Legat, now 59, said an off-duty Gadsden police officer named J.D. Thomas told him about various people he should look out for when he was working. This was around 1981, and Thomas worked security at the mall. One of the people was a pickpocket, he said, while another was someone prone to pick fights.

It’s a hugely significant race.’” http://politi.co/2zXmn3B CONGRESS POLICING THEMSELVES -- “Congress yet to act on flawed anti-harassment system,” by Elana Schor: “Senators in both parties are touting their move last week to require sexual harassment training for all members and aides. What they don’t mention is that many Senate offices already required training or were moving toward it — and that their vote did nothing to reform a system for handling complaints that critics say deters victims from coming forward. Now, some lawmakers are fighting to ensure that the Senate’s unanimous approval of mandatory training doesn’t make further reforms harder by offering political cover to members who would prefer to move on. Bipartisan talks on an overhaul of the Capitol’s harassment policy, which critics in and out of Congress say is stacked against victims, remain in their early stages.” http://politi.co/2iTo2wh ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL? -- “Sessions raises specter of special counsel on Clinton and uranium,” by Josh Gerstein: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions is raising the possibility of naming a new special counsel to investigate potential wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation, according to a letter the Justice Department sent Monday to House Republicans. … ‘The Attorney General has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,’ Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said in the letter obtained by POLITICO and sent to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), among others. “‘These senior prosecutors will report directly to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation, require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,’ Boyd added.” http://politi.co/2AJABSL ...

For anyone to infer anything otherwise is wrong.’ The public pronouncement comes about a month after Adelson met with Bannon in Washington. ... “The former White House chief strategist appeared before the Zionist Organization of America's annual dinner on Sunday night. ZOA is heavily funded by Adelson. ... Bannon had been slated to introduce Adelson and his spouse, Miriam, at the event, according to a copy of the program.

We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?’ (The site, which has since become a joint project with Mother Jones, was founded by Rob Glaser, a tech entrepreneur, and was funded by Progress for USA Political Action Committee.) “The next morning, about 12 hours later, Trump Jr. responded to WikiLeaks. ‘Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around,’ he wrote on September 21, 2016. ‘Thanks.’ The messages, obtained by The Atlantic, were also turned over by Trump Jr.’s lawyers to congressional investigators. They are part of a long—and largely one-sided—correspondence between WikiLeaks and the president’s son that continued until at least July 2017. … ‘Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us,’ WikiLeaks [messaged Don Jr. on Oct. 12, 2016], pointing Trump Jr. to the link wlsearch.tk, which it said would help Trump’s followers dig through the trove of stolen documents and find stories. “‘There’s many great stories the press are missing and we’re sure some of your follows [sic] will find it,’ WikiLeaks went on. ‘Btw we just released Podesta Emails Part 4.’ Trump Jr. did not respond to this message.

468,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/arts/dance/shelter-alvin-ailey-jawole-willa-jo-zollar.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Brian Seibert In the big, light-filled studios of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s luxurious Midtown home, many of the company’s women have been playing games. A dancer falls, and everyone else has to catch her: a trust-building exercise, common in acting classes and corporate retreats. At a rehearsal last week, the raucously laughing dancers were having such a good time that anyone outside the studio might have been surprised to learn that they were preparing “Shelter,” a work that frankly addresses the pain and isolation of homelessness. Created in 1988 by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar for her company, Urban Bush Women, “Shelter” was first performed by the Ailey troupe in 1992 and remained a popular work in its repertory for much of the next decade. After a 15-year break, the company is bringing it back on Dec. 12. That’s right in the middle of the five-week Ailey season at City Center (Nov. 29 to Dec. 31), which, as usual, boasts a few world premieres: “Victoria” by the Spanish choreographer Gustavo Ramírez Sansano; and “Members Don’t Get Weary,” the first piece for the company by one of its star dancers, Jamar Roberts. But for a repertory company like Ailey, revivals can be as important as attention-grabbing debuts. The decades-old “Shelter” may be the work that speaks most strongly to the anxieties of the moment. As Ms. Zollar recalled after coaching the Ailey dancers last week, the original Urban Bush Women production of “Shelter,” half of a larger work called “Heat,” arose from her shock at the prevalence of homelessness in New York City — and more, from her shock at losing that sense of shock. “I realized that as a coping mechanism I had stopped seeing the people who were homeless,” she said. “That was more dangerous, because it was a loss of humanity.” “Shelter” was a way of directing attention, and not just to the problem and the pain. “I would look at the same people for years, surviving,” Ms. Zollar said. “I started to see a resilience.” And so “Shelter,” set to the sound of drums and poetry, became about that strength, too. It begins with six women in a pile, thrown together and yet isolated, and builds to explosions of power and solidarity. But for the piece to be effective, the extremely successful Ailey company, with its fancy headquarters and glamorous galas, has to create a credible sense of “there but for the grace of God go I.” If audiences are to feel that “it could happen to you” — as the work’s recorded text insists while the dancers point implicating fingers at viewers — then the strong Ailey dancers must be believably beaten down. That’s where the acting exercises come in. They weren’t part of the process for the first Ailey production in 1992, though it was greeted as a brave and welcome departure for the troupe. Along with the difficult subject matter, critics at the time noted the rawness of the aesthetic — the unbound hair, the absence of makeup, the emotional exposure. Ailey dancers past and present are also quick to characterize the work as “raw.” Danni Gee, a member of the first Ailey cast, remembered how she and her fellow dancers labored to “take the Ailey sheen off” and how they cried after every performance. That didn’t mean sacrificing Ailey projection and impact. On the wall of the childhood bedroom of Camille A. Brown, there was a photo of Toni Pierce in that first Ailey production of “Shelter,” leaping with legs split and toes pointed with nothing but air beneath her. “When I grow up, I want to be like that,” Ms. Brown remembered thinking. These days, Ms. Brown is a leading choreographer who has made work for the Ailey company. And these days Ms. Zollar is a revered dance matriarch, honored for lifetime achievement at this year’s New York Dance and Performance Awards, also known as the Bessies. But in 1992, her company was young and no other troupe had yet danced any of her works. The invitation from Ailey was a huge break. “I was so intimidated,” Ms. Zollar recalled. “I just gave the steps, and I didn’t really know how to coach. It prompted me to figure out what the Urban Bush Women methodology is.” Now she has a method: “I call it an actor’s process through a dancer’s physicality with a community organizer’s analysis.” The actor games are a crucial part of the approach, she said. “That’s how we get to an authenticity, a truth, which is the most important thing for me.” At the rehearsal last week, it was easy to see what Ms. Zollar meant. Like anyone else, she was impressed by the Ailey dancers’ power. When Jacqueline Green marched with her long legs and flexed feet scything instantly to the level of her head, over and over, even the air seemed to rush out of her way. Ms. Zollar greeted the sight with incredulous awe. But she wanted to push the dancers past their comfort and control; firmly and warmly, she did. The fall-and-catch sequences, which are in the choreography as well as in the preparatory exercises, should not become rote, she said. The dancers must forget that the falls are coming. Even more important, she urged the dancers to use their own exhaustion, rather than hide it or “indicate” it. “I ask the dancers to go beyond their endurance,” she explained later. “We are exhausted by the forces that try to crush us, but we push through. The exhaustion is very important.” The work is certainly demanding. Linda Celeste Sims, a member of the current cast and the kind of dancer who seems incapable of fatigue, said, “It seems simple at first, but I’m tired all the way through.” She continued, “You get exhausted from being exhausted.” For Robert Battle, Ailey’s artistic director and the person responsible for choosing the repertory, “Shelter” has taken on new meaning. “It’s hard to watch the news lately,” he said last week. “I watch and I feel afraid.” In this context, Ms. Zollar’s dance isn’t only about homelessness. “It’s about the shelters that are disappearing,” he explained. “There used to be an expectation that people could come together after a disaster or a mass shooting, but I feel less of that now.” By giving expression to this fear and a resistance to it, Mr. Battle says he hopes “Shelter” can provide audiences with “a shelter in the theater.” Over the years, Ms. Zollar has occasionally altered the dance. After Hurricane Katrina, she substituted a text to address that disaster. But the work doesn’t really require such updating, she said: homelessness seems as pervasive and intractable to her now as it did in 1988. Yet the current Ailey production finishes with a new poem listing the recent onslaught of hurricanes and raising the alarm about how climate change threatens shelter for everyone. In one sense, the production is returning to its original form. In the past, the Ailey company has cast the piece with men and women, but this time, it’s being performed by women only — a choice that pleased all the women interviewed for this article. “Especially with what we’re going through now,” Ms. Sims said, alluding as much to sexual harassment scandals and women speaking out as to homelessness and climate change, “it feels good for us women to come together as a powerful force. This is the right moment for ‘Shelter.’” Advertisement",2017-11-28 11:25:56,"It Could Happen to You: A Raw, Pointed Revival at Alvin Ailey",,1,http://nytimes.com

By JOHN BRESNAHAN 12/03/2017 04:03 PM EST Updated 12/03/2017 11:00 PM EST Speaker Paul Ryan is short of the GOP votes he needs to pass a continuing resolution, though top Republicans believe they will get there by week's end. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congress faces another frantic week as GOP leaders and President Donald Trump wrestle with a possible government shutdown; immigration, tax and gun policies; multiple allegations of sexual harassment against lawmakers; and the probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Funding for federal agencies is set to run out on Friday, but lawmakers don't really think there will be a shutdown — at least not yet. Still, a pile-up of contentious policy fights coupled with frequent distractions as Trump's frustration grows with the Russia investigation has many Republicans anxious about the next few weeks. House GOP leaders have proposed a two-week “continuing resolution” to keep the government open until Dec. 22, arguing they need the funding extension to make progress in bipartisan talks to boost both defense and non-defense spending. They expect they’ll need a second two-week funding bill in late December to get past the holidays, though the odds of a shutdown would drastically increase during that time if a budget deal isn’t close. Right now, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is short of the GOP votes he needs to pass a CR, though top Republicans believe they will get there by week's end. But Senate Democrats, who can block any funding bill, could be key to keeping the government open. Both House and Senate Democrats are demanding that Trump, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reach an agreement to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented people known as Dreamers who will lose work permits and deportation protections starting early next year unless an Obama-era program that gave them some security is revived in some form. So far, Trump and Republican leaders don’t want to tie a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to a budget deal. This deadlock raises the possibility of a potential shutdown, although the likelihood is low that it happens on Friday, according to multiple House and Senate sources.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refused to meet with Trump last week after the president said on Twitter they ""want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes."" Trump added: ""I don’t see a deal!"" Following that high-profile debacle, Schumer and McConnell spoke privately on the Senate floor in a bid to get the budget discussions moving again. The White House has also been working to try to reschedule a meeting between Trump and the “Big Four,” as the top congressional leaders from both parties are nicknamed. Such a meeting could happen in the coming days, according to GOP and Democratic aides. There have been discussions between Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) on a possible DACA deal. Senate insiders said there “other lines of discussion” on DACA as well. In the House, Ryan and his leadership team have vowed for weeks to keep DACA and year-end spending negotiations separate — at least publicly. Ryan, however, now is getting squeezed by both ends of his conference, with a group of more than two dozen moderate Republicans from swing districts siding with Democrats and pushing Ryan to fix DACA by 2018. McConnell lashed out at Democrats on Sunday for tying Dreamers to the funding bill. McConnell noted that Trump has until March to make any decision on deportations for Dreamers, and he clearly wants to decouple the issue from the budget negotiations. “That's a ridiculous idea. There is no crisis,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.” ""The president has given us until March to address the issue of undocumented children who came into the country … and are in a kind of difficult spot. But there's no emergency.” McConnell added: “I don't think the Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March. That's a very untenable position."" By KEVIN ROBILLARD Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also downplayed the possibility of a shutdown, but he noted that certain blocs of lawmakers could derail a short-term CR. “You know, it's funny to see now that the Republicans are in charge, I think there's a group of right-wingers in the House who say they want to shut the government down,” Mulvaney said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “There's a group of Democrats who want to shut the government down over DACA. And there's a group of lawmakers from some of the hurricane states who want to shut the government down until they get what they want.” When he was in the House, Mulvaney supported the 2013 government shutdown, which Republicans forced in hopes of getting Congress to defund Obamacare, and he played a key role in a 2011 crisis in which some conservatives balked at raising the federal debt ceiling. Matt House, Schumer’s communications director, said the burden of keeping the government open is on the Republicans, as they control the White House, House and Senate. “Everyone knows the Republicans are in charge. If the government shuts down, it will be squarely on their back,” House said. Even as they wrestle with a potential shutdown, Ryan and McConnell will try to quickly reach a deal on a tax package following the Senate’s passage of a $1.5 trillion tax bill on a party line vote late Friday night. Discussions have already begun between House and Senate tax writers, and GOP aides said a potential agreement could emerge as early as this week. The two chambers have passed bills that diverge on key issues, including amending the popular mortgage-interest deduction, taxing small businesses and keeping the alternative minimum tax, which Republicans have long promised to kill. Ryan and McConnell will formally name conferees for the House-Senate tax talks this week. Russia will also be on the agenda as FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Trump launched a broad Twitter attack Sunday on the FBI. ""After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness."" Trump added: ""Tainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI ‘agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.’ Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge."" Trump was referring to media reports that a lead agent on the FBI’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s private email server sent text messages to another agent critical of the president. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI, a huge blow to the president and a major step for special counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe. Flynn’s plea deal is a sign Mueller's investigation is intensifying, with a focus on coordination between Flynn and other Trump aides and their interactions with Russian officials during and after the presidential campaign. The furor over sexual harassment will continue to roil Capitol Hill as well. Longtime Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan is supposed to announce his plans following allegations from three women that he harassed them when they worked in his office. Pelosi and other top Democrats have called for Conyers to resign, but so far he has not done so. Elections By ELENA SCHNEIDER Reps. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) also have come under fire for harassment allegations, while Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) faces an ethics probe over claims that he improperly touched six women. The House Administration Committee will hold a hearing on the issue Thursday. The heads of the House Employment Counsel and Office of Compliance — who have been involved in secret settlements with harassment victims — will testify at that session. As if that’s not enough, the House will also take up a controversial bill to expand the use of “concealed carry” permits. The “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act,” authored by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), allows concealed carry permit holders to take their weapons into other states that allow such permits. The bill is a top priority for the powerful National Rifle Association, but it is vehemently opposed by gun-control groups and some law-enforcement associations. The Hudson bill will be paired with a proposal to “fix” the National Instant Criminal Background Check System after it was revealed that a mass shooter in Texas was able to a purchase a gun despite a domestic violence charge. A third piece of the GOP gun package includes language seeking guidance from Attorney General Jeff Sessions on whether there can be criminal penalties imposed for using a “bump stock” during a crime. Those devices dramatically increase the fire for semi-automatic rifles and were used by the shooter in the Oct. 1 tragedy in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. There have been calls to ban bump stocks, but so far Republicans in Congress have waited to see whether the Trump administration can handle the issue through new regulations.

Want to receive this as a daily email in your inbox? Subscribe here. The allegations against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have risen to the rate of one per day. A week after the Washington Post broke the story about Mooreâs alleged history of sexual misconduct, eight women have now said publicly they were harassed or assaulted by Moore. A new poll released by Republicans shows Moore trailing his Democrat opponent Doug Jones in the Alabama Senate race by double-digits. The GOP establishment has essentially abandoned Moore, pulling all resources for and high-profile endorsements of his race. Theyâre even looking for ways to stall the special election. Mooreâs attorney Wednesday blasted the account of one of Mooreâs latest accusers. Yet local Republican leaders continue to stand by Moore. After Moore wrote him an open letter, Sean Hannity backed off his threat to abandon Moore. And several Republicans running against incumbent Senate Democrats in 2018 are notably not commenting on Moore, despite the outcry from GOP senators in Washington. The special Senate election in Alabama is a little less than a month away. But a week after these allegations surfaced, itâs important to understand exactly what Moore is being accused of. Here are summaries of all eight women who have publicly accused Moore of sexual misconduct or harassment. 1. The first Post story> detailed accounts from four women. Leigh Corfman said that when she was 14, Moore drove her to a remote cabin, kissed her, touched her over her underwear and brought her hand to touch his groin. âI wanted it over with â I wanted out,â she said. 2. Gloria Thacker Deason said she went on dates with Moore when she was 18 and Moore was 32. Those included drinking bottles of wine when the legal drinking age in Alabama was 19. 3. Wendy Miller said that when she was 16, Moore attempted to take her on dates. This included pursuing her at a mall. Miller says Moore asked her on a date in front of her mother. 4. In 1981, a couple years after Miller said Moore pursued her, he reportedly had relationship with Debbie Wesson Gibson over the course of a few months. There was a 17-year age difference between Moore and Gibson, who says Moore kissed her multiple times that summer. 5. On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson held a press conference, where she accused Moore of molesting her outside a restaurant where she worked and where he was a frequent patron in the late 1970s. 6. By Wednesday, three more women came forward. Gena Richardson told the Post that Moore forced her to kiss him in a Sears parking lot on a dark night in 1977. She was 18 and he was 30. Her account and others detail predatory behavior by Moore in a local mall. 7. Tina Johnson told Al.com that in 1991, Moore allegedly groped her buttocks while she was in his law office with her mother. âHe didnât pinch it; he grabbed it,â she said. Johnson was 28, while all but one of the other accusers were under 18 when Moore allegedly harassed or assaulted them. 8. Kelly Harrison Thorp also told Al.com that Moore repeatedly asked her on dates when she was 17. âI just kind of said, âDo you know how old I am?ââ Thorp said. âAnd he said, âYeah. I go out with girls your age all the time.ââ Moore was in his 30s. Todayâs question: Do you believe Republicans have handled the situation with Roy Moore as they should? Please email us your thoughts at trumpsamerica@mic.com. Tax reform: House Republicans will vote Thursday to advance their tax reform legislation. Passage is expected to be easy in the House. The Senate will be much more difficult. Some GOP senators are concerned about repealing the Affordable Care Actâs individual mandate as part of the tax package. Others believe it is too stilted to favor corporations. One Republican senator has already announced his opposition to the Senate tax plan. Other key Republicans, like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona, have also voiced concerns. Politico has a breakdown of the differences between the two bills. Cordray stepping down: The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced he will step down from leading the agency that targets predatory banking practices. Richard Cordray is planning to run for governor of Ohio. Trump is not expected to fill the position, one Republicans have loathed since Democrats created it. Gun control: A top Senate Republican and a Democratic senator leading the gun control argument are teaming up to enhance the U.S. background check database in the wake of a mass shooting in Texas where the gunman should not have been able to purchase the gun. Fox News: As Sean Hannity has peddled conspiracy theories, Fox Newsâ Shepard Smith has become a voice of reason at the network. Sexual assault: 50 current and former people Capitol Hill workers detailed stories of sexual assault and harassment to CNN. Hate speech: Twitter has removed its blue badge of verification from several prominent white nationalists following a revision to its policies. Media: The Koch brothers, known for spending hundreds of millions of dollars to finance conservative political causes, are reportedly backing a purchase of Time Inc. with more than $500 million. Trump admin: The government is allowing hunters to bring elephant trophies back to the country, reversing an Obama-era rule meant to deter poaching. Stories you may miss elsewhere. Trumpâs taxes: The outgoing IRS commissioner told Politico his agency is building a safe for Trumpâs tax returns. Blue wave in 2018? The GOP may not be ready for it, say former Republican campaign officials. Net neutrality: The Federal Communications Commission is planning a vote in December to roll back Obama-era rules that mandated fair treatment of online traffic. Climate change: 15,000 scientists from 184 countries say the globe is failing to respond to environmental threats. The choice Alabama voters have to make. Tap or click the video below to watch.

After the Sandy Hook mass shooting, a commenter on a University of Alabama sports fan message board who later identified himself as Brett Talley wrote, ""My solution would be to stop being a society of pansies and man up.""

        Zoe Tillman Reporting From Washington, DC Reporting From Washington, DC Last updated on November 13, 2017, at 7:10 p.m. ET Posted on November 13, 2017, at 6:34 p.m. ET Brett Talley One of President Donald Trump's federal court nominees appears to have written posts for years on a University of Alabama sports fan website — including posts about gun control and immigration — and didn't disclose the writings on his Senate questionnaire. The messages on TideFans.com were posted by the user ""BamainBoston."" In a Dec. 8, 2014, post, the user identified himself as Brett Talley, linking to a Washington Post article about Talley under the subject line ""Washington Post Did A Feature On Me."" Talley has been nominated for a seat on the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, and is already facing criticism this week for a disclosure-related issue: The New York Times reported on Monday that Talley failed to include in his Senate questionnaire that he is married to a lawyer in the White House counsel's office, Ann Donaldson. The questionnaire asks nominees to disclose family members who are “likely to present potential conflicts of interest."" The questionnaire also asks nominees to list ""published material you have written or edited, including material published only on the Internet."" Talley listed posts he wrote for the blog Government in Exile and noted that he had also blogged on his personal website about horror writing. His posts on Government in Exile included pieces about the US political response to mass shootings — he called gun control efforts at the time ""wrongheaded"" — and pledging support to the National Rifle Association. There are no entries about posts on TideFans.com. In an email to BuzzFeed News, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley disputed that posts on a message board had to be disclosed to the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""The Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire asks for published writings and public statements — not everything that's ever been typed on a keyboard. Alabama football fans' internet message board conversations are not deemed 'published writings', 'public statements', or 'published material;' nor are they deemed the equivalent of 'books', 'articles', or 'reports,'"" Gidley wrote. Talley is a senior official in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Talley's behalf. A White House spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. Many of BamainBoston's posts are about sports. But some address politics and other nonsports subjects. On Dec. 17, 2012, a few days after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, BamainBoston posted, ""My solution would be to stop being a society of pansies and man up."" BamainBoston continued: ""We shouldn't depend on the government to protect us. We should be ready to protect ourselves. Everyone should know that part of their social responsibility is to learn how to use a firearm effectively and carry one with them at all times. I know some of you will freak out at that suggestion, but the only law I can imagine that would have stopped what happened in Connecticut is if every one of the teachers was armed with a gun and trained in how to use it."" BamainBoston appears to have edited at least two posts this year. On Jan. 24, 2012, BamainBoston published a post about a book the user had written being nominated for a Bram Stoker Award. That year, Talley was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for one of his novels. The Jan. 24, 2012, post, and another one published by BamainBoston in the same thread two days later, were edited on June 28, 2017, by BamainBoston, according to the website — the same day Talley indicated in his Senate questionnaire that he met with Alabama Sens. Richard Shelby and Luther Strange about his potential nomination to the federal court. According to TideFans.com, user BamainBoston joined the site in March 2005, and has published 16,381 posts. The user's most recent activity was on Monday at 2:58 p.m. The user indicated on a profile page that they were born in 1981, graduated from the University of Alabama, and were located in Boston. Talley was born in 1981, earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama, and got his law degree from Harvard Law School in Boston. In 2012, Talley worked in Beverly, Massachusetts, about an hour's drive from Boston, for Mitt Romney's campaign. Although the page says that BamainBoston's location is Boston, it also lists the zip code 36117, which is in Montgomery, Alabama. From 2015 until he joined the Justice Department in January, Talley worked in Montgomery in the Alabama attorney general's office as the deputy solicitor general. In 2011, BamainBoston posted in a thread about immigration. Responding to another poster who wrote, ""can we all agree that wasserman is a complete moron, even if you agree with the overall agenda she is peddling?"" — an apparent reference to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee — BamainBoston wrote, ""Agreed. It is hard to reform something if we can't even agree on what it is."" Later in the thread, BamainBoston wrote on the subject of how the US government should handle undocumented immigrants: ""As for those people who are already here, yes, they violated the law. Great. That tells us nothing. The debate is how to punish that violation of the law. Go ahead. Punish them. Fine them. Whatever. Then give them a path to citizenship. The last thing we want here is a permanent underclass of people. And the thought of the police breaking down the doors of otherwise law abiding citizens and dragging them out to be deported is horrible and un-American. The crime most of these people committed is wanting a better life."" The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Nov. 9 to approve Talley's nomination and send him to the full Senate for consideration. Democrats have criticized Talley for his professional record, saying he lacks experience and pointing to the rare ""not qualified"" rating that he received from the American Bar Association. Talley indicated in his questionnaire that although he had worked at a private law firm and in the Alabama attorney general's office in the years since he earned his law degree in 2007, he had never tried a case in court. He did clerk for a federal district judge as well as a federal appeals court judge. This post has been updated with a comment from White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.

They also believe her death was likely the start of the rampage. Neal reportedly killed four people and wounded 10 others during the shooting. He was shot and killed by police. After talking Chinese president Xi Jinping into allowing LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hall to return to the states after their shoplifting debacle, Trump took to Twitter to toot his own horn. “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump?” he tweeted on Wednesday. “They were headed for 10 years in jail!” He then took to Twitter on Thursday morning to tweet them directly, telling them to “HAVE A GREAT LIFE!” and reminding them that there are “many pitfalls” throughout this “long and winding road.” Quinta B. has a new show hitting the internet, according to her social media pages. The cost to watch is free. “In Quinta Vs. Everything, Quinta Brunson steps into the metaphorical ring with her issues, taking every roadblock in her life— from self-care to family life— as head-to-head combat,” according to the show’s Facebook page. “There’s no telling how things will go.” Catch Quinta Vs.

476,http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/21/clint-eastwood-1517-to-paris-first-look/,"The Hollywood legend talks about his decision to cast the real-life people involved in the Thalys train attack Clint Eastwood’s The 15:17 to Paris depicts how passengers on a French train in August 2015 overwhelmed an armed terrorist, preventing a probable mass shooting. It’s also a grand experiment for the 87-year-old filmmaker, who cast many of the real people involved in the incident to play themselves, including three young Americans (Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone). Did anyone suggest he think twice about that decision? “Oh, yeah,” he says. “A lot of people suggested that.” Above, see an exclusive image of Eastwood on set with Stone and Sadler, and below, read more from the Oscar-winning filmmaker about shooting in the actual locations, why it became important to include those involved, and whether we’ll ever see him in front of the camera again. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What attracted you to this story?CLINT EASTWOOD: It was a tribute to the common man. These were just young men going on a trip, and when this terrorist got on the train, they jumped into action and potentially saved a lot of lives. The terrorist happened to have two guns, an AK-47 with almost 300 rounds of ammunition, and a Luger. He obviously wasn’t up to any good. How did you come to cast the actual people as the film’s leads?I looked at a lot of very good actors who could possibly have done the job. But I kept looking at the faces of these young men — “boys,” I call them. I thought these faces were unique. It just struck me that it would be an interesting experiment. It could be bold or reckless, depending on how it comes out. [Laughs] Anyway, they were enthusiastic about trying it, so we went with them, and I think people will be a little surprised. But as we got going, I started looking at other people who were involved. I thought, I wonder if they’d all like to come back? One thing led to another. You shot at the locations where the events happened?We shot at the exact locations. One couple, Mark and Isabelle [Moogalian] — he had been shot in the neck and almost died. I think it was a catharsis [for them] to come back and revisit it with all the people. It probably was a catharsis for everybody. The gunman, Ayoub El-Khazzani, originally said he planned on robbing passengers but has since been linked to an Islamic State terrorist cell. How much does the film detail his background?Well, you don’t find out anything about him. It wasn’t his story. You’re not in this film yourself.

""Where was your God?"" Gene Valaitis asked rhetorically, if not mockingly. I felt compelled to address it during my call-in segment on his ""Roundhouse Radio"" early morning show. I relayed what I've learned from devout believers through the years. The question has been asked for centuries by skeptics and nonbelievers. It's one I also asked in my younger days after, say, tragic killings, a baby's death, or other ungodly incidents in our unfair world. Still, Valaitis' question sounded harsh on the air so soon after the Texas church massacre. It was because of its timing, but also because the victims were gunned down while worshiping their Lord. In His holy house. After my radio show interview, I posed a similar question to my social media readers, not to mock their beliefs, but to better define or explain them. I've always been intrigued about people's otherworldly beliefs and how they stand up in our mortal world. Some readers educated me. Other responses were cliché and predictable. A few amused me, claiming they had all the answers. If there's one lesson I've learned regarding religion, spirituality and an afterlife, it's this: Those who insist they have all the answers are those who need to ask themselves more questions. Here is a sampling of responses. ""What happened (at that Texas church) had nothing to do with God!"" said Dan L. ""God was there, but the devil and sin are real,"" countered Destiny T. ""God sent a God-fearing man to stop pure evil. A good guy with a gun stopped a bad, evil murderer with a gun,"" added Shawn S. ""Satan is on this earth seeking whom he shall devour,"" insisted Liz H. ""A true believer would say that life is just life,"" concluded Joe W. ""The glory comes after, so essentially what is a horrible event on earth was actually a glorious new beginning for 25 people."" The social media exchanges got very heated at times, not surprising with such a sensitive topic and an antagonistic query. People can be very passionate yet defensive about their beliefs. I learned this the hard way decades ago through more in-your-face conversations, without the keyboard shields of our digital world. I once wore a hand-printed black shirt with two words in large white letters: GOD WHO? As you might expect, and as I welcomed at the time, it sparked a lot of verbal arguments and intense debates with people who took offense. Or with those who also wondered about such things and enjoyed a stimulating conversation. I've since grown tired of such time-wasting discussions, typically hearing the same regurgitated responses. My challenge these days is to evoke fresh or authentic answers to such questions. This is why I also asked ""Where was God?"" to several church officials, who offered a depth of understanding that's needed for such thought-provoking topics. ""This was the question the Egyptians asked after enslaving the entire Jewish nation. This was the question the Nazis asked when they gassed six million Jews in the Holocaust,"" said Mike Hendon, pastor of City Point Church in Portage. ""It is taunting and haunting, meant to challenge faith in God. ""My answer? He is where He's always been. On His throne, watching the world He created move farther and farther from Him in anti-God sentiment,"" Hendon said. ""He was at the altar in a little church in Texas, weeping in sorrow for martyrs whose lives were taken simply because they chose to worship."" Father Jon Plavcan, from the Catholic Diocese of Gary, said God created humanity with the dignity of free will. This gift comes with the choice of a relationship with God, or not. ""God could prevent anything, but there would be no longer freedom to choose,"" he said. ""It is at times like this that a Christian places their hope and trust in heavens that have been promised. If you are not a believer, then it does not make sense."" Greg Lee, pastor of Suncrest Christian Church in St. John, said God was aware such a massacre would happen. Yet it's consistent with the evil that existed in Jesus' day. ""God was allowing the shooter to make his own choices – evil, awful choices,"" he said. ""God is relational, not robotic. Therefore, God consistently allows things that He doesn't want. In fact, many times He allows more suffering to his own people as a witness to the world. ""He was comforting those who wanted His comfort, giving peace and courage to those who want His peace and courage. And He was hoping more people would want it."" Gary Nagy, pastor of Resurrection Lutheran Church in Crown Point, first admitted everything isn't all sorted out nice and tidy. ""God was right there with them, just like He was right there at the crucifixion of His son,"" he said. Like me, Nagy has as many questions as answers. ""Why don't people ask the question of where's God when one baby is stillborn? Or when my dad died at 90 with complications from pneumonia, which is treatable? Is the difference the greater number or the greater horror and cruelty?"" The response I respected most came from, of all people, the pastor of Sutherland Springs' First Baptist Church, when he was asked about his 14-year-old daughter's death in the mass shooting. ""I don't understand,"" Frank Pomeroy said. ""But I know my God does."" jdavich@post-trib.com Twitter@jdavich CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-11-11 03:00:00,Texas shootings test religious beliefs,,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/
478,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Y-2vsY5y3jI/,"Thursday, November 16 marked 300 days since President Donald Trump took office on January 20. The third 100 days were even more tumultuous than the first 100 and second 100. And much remains undone. There are still jobs to fill, promises to keep, and bills to sign. Trump has yet to notch a major legislative achievement (thanks, in part, to infighting and incompetence in Congress). But the Trump administration seems, at last, to have found a rhythm. If the first 100 days were defined by Trump’s executive orders, and the second 100 days by the controversy over James Comey and the Russia investigation, the third 100 days were largely defined by foreign policy. In early August — day 201 — Trump offered North Korea his infamous warning of “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” By day 295, he was mocking Kim Jong-un as “short and fat,” which probably represents a sort of progress. At the same time, Trump announced the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, breaking with his own rhetoric on the campaign trail and risking the support of his political base, which worried that he had given in to advisers from the Beltway “swamp.” (Conversely, Washington praised Trump’s decision.) The major difference between Trump’s “surge” and that of his predecessor was that Trump declined to give a date for withdrawal. Perhaps the greatest challenge of the third 100 days was the Charlottesville controversy. White supremacists, neo-Nazis, and KKK members descended on the town to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate general Robert E. Lee. At a Saturday demonstration following a Friday night torchlight parade, they clashed violently with left-wing Antifa activists. A right-wing extremist drove his car into the Antifa procession, killing a young woman. Trump condemned the violence on all sides, but was criticized for not singling out the right-wing extremists (as if he had a special duty to dissociate himself from them). He issued a second, sharper statement, then clashed with reporters at Trump Tower, adding that there were “fine people” even among those protesting to preserve the statue. He was correct — as even the New York Times reported — but the controversy shook the White House for weeks. But if Charlottesville created new concerns about America’s political and racial divisions, Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, showed “neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger,” in Trump’s words. He received high marks for his response to Harvey, and to Hurricane Irma in Florida. Hurricane Maria, which ripped Puerto Rico, was a bigger challenge — but largely because of conditions unique to the island. Trump also played the role of comforter-in-chief after dozens were killed in a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, where a killer fired on the crowd from his hotel room. A few weeks later, New York suffered its worst terror attack since 9/11 when a Muslim immigrant from Uzbekistan killed pedestrians and bicyclists with a pickup truck in lower Manhattan. Trump called for an end to the diversity visa program that had admitted the killer. Throughout the third 100 days, Trump made a number of important policy decisions in fulfillment of his campaign promises. The most important was his decision to end Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the so-called “Dream Act by fiat” — on constitutional grounds. But Trump gave Congress a chance to legalize it, worrying supporters that he would cave, though the new border wall prototypes offered some solace. In addition, Trump chipped away at the architecture of Obamacare, which the Senate had failed to repeal earlier in the year. He rescinded the mandate that had required insurers to provide contraceptives, including abortifacient drugs. He also issued an executive order allowing health insurance companies to offer cheap, short-term policies, and also announced an end to the unconstitutional subsidies to insurance companies, pending a congressional fix. The president also de-certified the Iran deal, demanding that Congress find a way to strengthen it against Iran’s development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and its support for terrorist groups. The administration ended the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which critics said was not only unconstitutional but would also be devastating for the coal industry. And Trump declared the abuse of opioids a national public health emergency. Remarkably, Trump’s victory in the fight over his “travel ban” went largely unheralded. In October, the Supreme Court tossed out the case against his executive order limiting travel from several terror-prone countries, noting that the ban had been changed significantly. Effectively, the Court’s delay earlier in the year gave time for the Trump administration to complete the terms of the original order and revise it. Challenges continued, but with little impact. Meanwhile, the Russia investigation faltered. Though Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted one of Trump’s former campaign managers, Paul Manafort, the charges had nothing to do with “collusion.” Junior foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, but that was all. The tables were turned as the public learned that the Clinton campaign and the Democrats had funded the Russian “dossier” through Fusion GPS. The third 100 days were also marked by political turmoil, as chief strategist Steve Bannon left the White House and returned to Breitbart. Trump clashed openly with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other establishment figures, several of whom announced their retirements. In Alabama, insurgent Judge Roy Moore defeated Trump-endorsed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange — an outcome that is still rocking the political world. In Hollywood, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault over decades, setting off a tidal wave of allegations against other stars and power players. The wave soon crashed over Washington, DC, as the Washington Post reported allegations that Roy Moore had improper relationships with young women several decades before — and members of Congress began to come forward about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, the economy boomed, with growth surging to 3.1% in the third quarter. The stock markets soared, hitting constant new records. Trump’s overall approval was dismally low, but economic confidence at its highest level in decades, with tax reform potentially on the horizon. It was a performance Trump touted on his visit to Asia, the longest by a U.S. president since the early 1990s. After 300 days, it seemed he had finally found his groove. Joel B.

The additional database lapses that have so far been found have been corrected, the Air Force said. The announcement comes as the family of victims of the church shooting are starting to file civil claims against the Air Force, the San Antonio Express-News reported Tuesday. Former airman Devin Kelley killed 26 people in a mass shooting at the First Baptist Church Nov. 5. Kelley was convicted in 2012 of beating his then-wife and stepson and jailed for a year. His conviction should have barred him from ever buying guns again. However, Holloman Air Force Base’s Office of Special Investigations and security forces failed to report Kelly’s conviction to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center database, which gun sellers would have checked and would likely have blocked his attempt to legally purchase guns. The Air Force has launched a review of how it handled the Sutherland Springs church shooter's criminal records after finding it didn't submit domestic violence records that should have barred him from owning guns. After the shooting, the Air Force and the Pentagon began reviewing how it handled Kelley’s case, and other similar cases dating back to 2002, to make sure they were properly reported to the appropriate databases. The Air Force inspector general’s preliminary findings found “similar reporting lapses” happened at other bases in addition to Holloman, the Air Force said in a release. The preliminary findings also confirmed the reporting failures in Kelly’s case.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Navy Times Daily News Roundup. There were policies and procedures in place requiring cases like Kelley’s to be reported, the Air Force said. But training and compliance measures to make sure this happened fell short. In a follow-up email, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the service “has reported and corrected several dozen records since the review began and is reviewing approximately 60,000 cases involving serious offenses over the 15-year period to ensure full compliance.” The gunman who killed more than 20 people in a Texas church shooting Sunday morning was a former airman who was court-martialed and dishonorably discharged, according to a CBS News report. The Air Force said the Office of Special Investigations and the service’s security forces have either already taken, or are about to take, corrective actions to make sure these cases are properly reported to civilian law enforcement agencies. For example, the Air Force said it has begun requiring leaders at the field, regional and headquarters levels to make sure cases are properly reported to the FBI database’s Interstate Identification Index. The Air Force has also updated its software, checklist and training to support the new procedures. The DoD IG found in 2014 that the Air Force and all the other services were not reporting criminal incident data in all cases to the FBI as required by law. The Air Force assembled two task forces of 30 members each — one for OSI and one for security forces — to make sure all cases are in full compliance with reporting requirements. The Air Force said it’s working to identify and correct reporting shortfalls as the review continues, and that the review will be finished in the next few months. “The Air Force IG is closely monitoring all corrective actions and the ongoing review of records to assess progress and report to Air Force leadership,” the release said. On Tuesday, the San Antonio Express-News reported that a lawyer for Joe and Claryce Holcombe — whose son, Associate Pastor Bryan Holcombe, and eight other family members were killed in the shooting — has filed an administrative claim accusing the Air Force of negligence. The Holcombes are looking for information on why the Air Force failed to report Kelley’s conviction information. Another lawyer representing two brothers whose family members were killed is about to announce a similar claim, the Express-News reported.

Officials have identified Devin Kelley, of New Braunfels, as the suspect in the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017. A short time after the shooting, Kelley was found dead in his vehicle. Authorities provided additional information, including a rough timeline of what happened at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, in a press conference Sunday evening. Devin Kelley was spotted at a gas station across the street from the church, wearing all black, around 11:20 a.m. From there he crossed the street and opened fire outside the church. Texas Rangers investigating the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs have served a search warrant on Silicon Valley giant Apple Inc. and are seeking digital photos, messages, documents and other types of data that might have been stored by gunman Devin Patrick Kelley, who was found with an iPhone after he killed himself. Court records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News show Texas Ranger Kevin Wright obtained search warrants on Nov. 9 for files stored on Kelley’s iPhone, a second mobile phone found near his body and for files stored in Kelley’s iCloud account — Apple’s digital archive that can sync iPhone files. The iCloud feature is an optional service. Obtaining such records, if they exist, directly from Apple could aid authorities investigating the worst mass shooting in modern Texas history. Apple’s policy regarding iCloud content states that material may be provided to law enforcement agencies if they obtain search warrants. For iPhones, Apple has clashed with the FBI in the past to protect the privacy of its customers. In the case of the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting in 2015, which killed 14 people, the FBI tried to force Apple to create software that would unlock an iPhone owned by one of the attackers. The court dispute was finally resolved when the FBI announced it found a way to access the phone. An Apple spokesman said the company does not comment on law enforcement matters. The court records don’t show whether authorities have obtained the files from Kelley’s phones. Christopher Combs, the FBI special agent in charge in San Antonio whose office is helping Texas Rangers, complained last week that the FBI was unable to access the files on Kelley’s phone. Combs declined to say at the time what kind of mobile phone Kelley was carrying. “I’m not going to describe what phone it is, because I don’t want to tell every bad guy out there what phone to buy,” Combs said. Court records show Kelley was found with an iPhone SE, and he also had a second phone that has gone unmentioned by authorities — a low-tech LG 328BG. A photo included in the application for the search warrant shows Kelley’s silver and white iPhone was spattered with blood. Investigators want access to Kelley’s phone and iCloud account to dig into his messages, calls, social media applications passwords, address books, photos, videos and data since Jan. 1, 2016. Four email addresses belonging to Kelley have been discovered: thelifeofdevin@gmail.com, devinkelley1991@gmail.com, sevenup555@yahoo.com and kelleydevin1991@gmail.com. Dressed in black tactical gear and body armor, Kelley was armed with a Ruger AR-556 military-style rifle when he opened fire on the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. During the Nov. 5 rampage, he killed 26 people and injured 20 others — many of them children. A neighbor and former gun instructor for the National Rifle Association, Stephen Willeford, heard the gunfire, grabbed his AR-15 rifle and raced to the church. Kelley, armed with a handgun when he saw Willeford, exchanged gunfire and was shot twice — once in the torso and once in the leg. Kelley drove away in a Ford Expedition. Willeford flagged down motorist Johnnie Langendorff and the pair chased the gunman. Authorities believe Kelley killed himself during the high-speed pursuit. According to the court records obtained Thursday, authorities found Kelley’s body lying outside the driver door of his Ford Expedition, with his head in the dirt. A bullet had entered Kelley’s head above his right ear and exited through the back left side of his head. At least one pistol magazine was found in a holder on Kelley’s belt and his black body armor looked partly stripped off. A medication prescribed to Kelley was found in the Exhibition’s console. Investigators discovered a pistol under his feet, and his silver and white iPhone SE was sitting on the vehicle’s front floorboard. Two days after the shooting, a second phone, the black LG model, was found in a pocket in the driver’s side door, and officials want access to the device to forensically search for evidence of capital murder.  jtedesco@express-news.net   Kelsey Bradshaw is a digital reporter for mySA.

On Monday morning, President Donald Trump made his first public remarks after two mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger — not the gun,"" Trump said, arguing that the US must reform mental health laws. Trump also suggested that mental illness is to blame for the killings that happened at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs in Texas in November 2017. But scientists say the real problem is that violent, impulsive, and angry men are getting their hands on guns. Many of the shooters behind the deadliest mass shootings in modern America (listed below) committed violence against women, threatened violence against women, or disparaged women.

On Monday morning, President Donald Trump made his first public remarks after two mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger — not the gun,"" Trump said, arguing that the US must reform mental health laws. Trump also suggested that mental illness is to blame for the killings that happened at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs in Texas in November 2017. But scientists say the real problem is that violent, impulsive, and angry men are getting their hands on guns. Many of the shooters behind the deadliest mass shootings in modern America (listed below) committed violence against women, threatened violence against women, or disparaged women. A former classmate of Connor Betts, the shooter behind the Dayton, Ohio, shooting told CNN that Betts kept a ""rape list"" for girls and a ""kill list"" for boys.

491,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-testify-house-judiciary-committee-face-questions/story?id=51125849,"The attorney general said he recalled a meeting with George Papadopoulos. 5 key moments from Jeff Sessions' testimony before House Judiciary Committee — -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions denied suggestions Tuesday that he misled Congress in previous appearances before Senate committees in which he was asked about Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials. Questions about Sessions' prior answers to Congress came during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Lawmakers asked about the latest developments in the investigations into Russian interference in last year's U.S. presidential election — including a guilty plea by Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to a charge of misleading investigators. The questions focused on Papadopoulos' attempts to coordinate a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and Papadopoulos' presence at a March 2016 gathering also attended by Sessions. The attorney general's responses to questions about communication with Russia drew scrutiny from Democrats who believed that he may have known more than he previously disclosed. Sessions said that he now recalled the 2016 meeting, after recent news reports on the matter, and that he ""always told the truth"" in his appearances on Capitol Hill. He added that he ""wanted to make clear to [Papadopoulos] that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government."" ""But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago,"" he said. Here's a look at five key moments from Sessions' testimony Tuesday: In his opening statement, the attorney general told the committee he has ""always told the truth,"" referring to his criticized appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October. On the subject of meetings attended by Papadopoulos and campaign aide Carter Page, Sessions said he ""had no recollection"" of the meetings until he saw recent news reports. He previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was ""not aware"" of attempts by the campaign to communicate with Russia. ""I do now recall the March 2016 meeting at the Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said at that meeting,"" Sessions said. ""After reading his account, and to the best of my recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government or any other foreign government, for that matter."" He continued that he ""gladly would have reported it,"" had he remembered it. Sessions said he ""pushed back"" against what he thought was an improper suggestion by Papadopoulos — that Trump meet with Putin. Though he said he believes he should not be involved in the race for his former U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama, Sessions said he has ""no reason to doubt"" the women accusing Republican candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct. Moore is accused of pursuing relationships with teenage girls in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including attempting to engage in sexual activity with one girl as young as 14. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asked Sessions whether he would push for a Justice Department investigation into the alleged actions should Moore win the election. Sessions would not comment on the hypothetical situation but pledged of his department, ""We will do our duty."" After the committee's ranking member, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., showed Sessions several of Trump's tweets suggesting the Justice Department investigate former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, the attorney general was asked whether it was ""common"" for a country's leader to ""retaliate against his political opponents."" ""The Department of Justice can never be used to retaliate politically against opponents, and that would be wrong,"" Sessions said. He added, after additional questioning, that the president should ""take great care"" not to influence a pending investigation. Sessions admitted, however, he could not entirely control Trump's seemingly off-the-cuff remarks. ""The president speaks his mind,"" Sessions said. After Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, ran through a timeline of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server and the related actions of then–FBI Director James Comey and then–Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Sessions explained that the matter did not automatically warrant a special counsel, as Jordan suggested was necessary. ""It would take a factual basis that meets the standards of the appointment of a special counsel,"" Sessions said, an answer that did not appear to quell Jordan's concerns. In a letter to the committee Monday, Sessions said he authorized Justice Department prosecutors to look into whether the sale of a uranium company during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state warranted investigation by a special counsel. Republicans have raised alarm over donations to the Clinton Foundation made by people related to the deal. Sessions cautioned Tuesday that the step outlined in his letter did not guarantee an independent investigator would be appointed. ""You can have your idea, but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it … meets the standard required for a special counsel,"" he said. After telling the Senate Judiciary Committee in October that the U.S. was not prepared to prevent interference in its elections, Sessions admitted he has ""not followed through to see where we are on that."" ""I will personally take action to do so,"" he said. ""A lot of things have been happening. We are working on a lot of great agenda items. But this one is important, and I acknowledge that."" ""I should be able to give you better information today than I am,"" Sessions conceded. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. asked Sessions last month about preparations for upcoming elections. Sessions said it would require a ""specific review"" but that no such efforts were underway at the time.

Substitute teacher barricaded door with couch to protect kids during deadly shooting — -- A 74-year-old substitute teacher and a custodian jumped into action and helped save lives during a shooting at a New Mexico high school Thursday that killed two students, authorities said today. Substitute teacher Kathleen Potter had 16 students in a classroom with her at Aztec High School in Aztec, about 180 miles northwest of Albuquerque, when she heard the shooting, according to police. She didn't have a key to lock the door so she put all of the students in a storage area and the barricaded the door with a couch, authorities said. The shooter -- a former Aztec High School student -- came in and started screaming and fired multiple rounds through the walls, hitting no one, authorities said. When Thomas Hill, a custodian, heard the shots, he saw the shooter and followed him and shouted at him authorities said. The custodian also warned others and yelled at teachers to lock down, police said. The suspect, identified as 21-year-old William Atchison, died after the shooting. A law enforcement source told ABC News that officers found the suspected gunman dead, a gun and multiple loaded magazines near him. Authorities today said the shooting was a ""planned event,"" with the suspect allegedly writing out a schedule for the morning, including ""die"" at 8 a.m. Police said the suspect disguised himself as a student and went to the school as buses were letting people in. Authorities said he wanted to create ""as much carnage as he possibly could."" The 21-year-old went to a bathroom and was preparing to confront students, police said, and in that bathroom is where victim Francisco Fernandez was shot and killed; authorities said Fernandez had no chance to survive. The suspect then went to the hallway, where he encountered Casey Marquez and fatally shot her, police said. He then allegedly fired multiple rounds through the hallway. Authorities called Atchison -- who lived in Aztec with his parents and worked at a local gas station -- a ""coward"" and ""evil."" In March 2016, federal authorities interviewed Atchison regarding a threatening post he allegedly made on an online gaming forum; investigators say he asked, ""if you’re going to commit a mass shooting, does anyone know about assault rifles?” The FBI said Atchison was cooperative when they interviewed him and that Atchison explained he was simply “trolling” the internet. The investigation was closed because no crime was committed, authorities said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-12-08 13:43:43, Substitute teacher barricaded door with couch to protect kids during deadly shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
495,http://abcnews.go.com/US/members-liberal-gun-club-left-leaning-support-gun/story?id=51312686,"""I voted for Hilary Clinton. But I’m a strong Second Amendment supporter."" In the Liberal Gun Club, these members support both the left and gun rights — -- Two of the biggest mass shootings in modern American history have taken place within just the past 50 days. And in the aftermath, there seems to be no real, reasoned gun debate face-to-face or online -- just a deepening division between Americans on the left and on the right. But there is a growing group of people doing the unexpected. They’re called the Liberal Gun Club, just one of a number of left-leaning gun clubs now in operation, who seem to support less gun restrictions and agree with the NRA on some points. “I’m Lara. I’m a liberal. I voted for Hilary Clinton. But I’m a strong Second Amendment supporter,” Lara Smith, a lawyer and the president of the California chapter of the Liberal Gun Club, told ABC News’ “Nightline.” The club was founded in 2008, and they hold conventions, advise politicians, stage so-called “Meet in the Middle” events, educate and train. “The mission of the Liberal Gun Club is education,” said Smith. Smith said she was anti-gun and started shooting only four years ago. After giving it a try, researching the issue and having too many arguments with her gun-loving, former Marine husband, Ed Smith, she changed her views. Lara Smith is an instructor to Shemira Fermon, a veterinarian nurse and new member of the Liberal Gun Club. “I’ve always been into guns but I’ve never found anyone that made me feel comfortable learning how to use them as tools not toys,” Shemira Fermon told “Nightline.” “I see everybody else’s views as inconsistent. Abortion and gun rights are the flip side of the same issue. If you’re for banning one and not the other there’s a real inherent inconsistency in there. My view is that neither of them should be banned,” said Lara Smith. “I’m arguing that I’m more liberal than even my liberal friends. The liberal view on most things is, I might not like it, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to ban it.” Smith said she’s experienced mixed reactions from people with different political views at the gun range. “Some places the reaction is, ‘The Liberal Gun Club, what’s that? That’s great!’ Some places it’s like, ‘Are you one of those libtards?’” Smith said. Members of the Liberal Gun Club say they also face some flak from liberal friends and coworkers. “Who to talk to about it and who not to,” Ed Smith told “Nightline.” “There are definitely people you can tell you don’t want to bring up the topic.” The Liberal Gun Club says it now has 7,500 members nationwide. They agree with their more right-wing brothers and sisters on some points. “The government says, ‘Hey we’re going to change this so everybody has to give up their guns.’ What else is going to be next?” said Fermon. However, there are some points they disagree with. “Particularly under this administration, I don’t want to give up any of my constitutional rights,” said Lara Smith. “I have an issue, and trust issues in general with law enforcement,” Fermon said. “Now you’re telling me what little slim chance of protection I had is now gone, and is given to people that I don’t trust at all. How is that fair?” The NRA has a reported 5 million members, but only a reported 19 percent of gun owners in America are actually NRA members too. According to the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Republicans and right-leaning independents own guns. And 20 percent of Democrats or left-leaning independents own guns. “I think a lot more people have guns here that are liberal than we know about,” said Ed Smith. When it comes to mass shootings, Lara Smith says she doesn’t think banning guns is the answer. “The only suggestions we’re getting are, ‘Out of my cold, dead hands. We’re doing nothing’ or, ‘Ban this kind of gun!’ Those aren’t solutions,” Lara Smith said. “I don’t think bans are the answer. I think there are these huge societal issues that we have to look at.” Lara Smith said she agrees with President Donald Trump, who, after the Sutherland Springs church shooting, said, “This is a mental health issue at the highest level.” She also said she believes people shouldn’t have a gun if they’re not trained to use it: “Oh my god, you should not be carrying a gun in public unless you are trained.” Lara and Ed Smith said they think it makes sense to have background checks when you purchase your first firearm. “These guns existed way before this increase in mass shooting,” Lara Smith said. She added, “Everybody wants this to stop. Everybody wants to stop these mass shootings, right? I think we just disagree on....” “... How to do it right,” said Fermon. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-11-22 13:41:55, Liberal Gun Club members say they are both left-leaning and support gun rights,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Air Force review finds 'several dozen' more cases like Texas church shooter — -- An Air Force review has found “several dozen” cases where the service failed to provide information about criminal convictions to the FBI database used in the background checks for gun purchases. The review by the Air Force’s Inspector General was prompted by the service’s failure to provide, as required, the details of Devin Kelley’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI’s databases. An Air Force statement released today said that following a review of 60,000 serious cases as far back as 2002 it has determined that Kelley’s case  was “not an isolated incident”. An Air Force official said the review is ongoing, but that so far several dozen records have been “corrected”. If Kelley’s conviction had been passed to the FBI’s databases, as required by law, the Texas church shooter would not have been able to purchase some of the weapons he used in the deadly attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, earlier this month. The mass shooting left 26 dead, according to police, who have included an unborn child in the death count. In 2012 Kelley plead guilty to assault charges on his then wife and her stepson while was stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. “Preliminary findings by the Air Force Inspector General confirmed the OSI and Security Forces personnel then assigned at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, did not report required information to civilian law enforcement in the Kelley case,” said an Air Force statement. “The review also found the error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” it added.  “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” The Air Force will continue reviewing criminal cases to determine what additional corrective actions may need to be taken. The service says the Air Force Office of Special Investigations has already implemented corrective measures to ensure that reporting requirements to civilian law enforcement are being followed through. . They include new procedures where printed documents or screen grabs verify to leadership at regional and headquarters levels that applicable cases have been registered with the FBI's National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index. The Air Force review is expected to continue its review for several more months, an official said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-11-28 15:57:59, Air Force review finds 'several dozen' more cases like Texas church shooter,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Pulse nightclub hero to be dismissed by police department — -- A Florida police officer who was hailed a hero for swiftly rescuing a victim in the Pulse nightclub shooting last year will be dismissed from the force at the end of the month. Omar Delgado, a member of the Eatonville Police Department, was among the first officers to respond to the attack at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, on June 12, 2016. He was credited with pulling victim Angel Colon to safety after gunman Omar Mateen opened fire on clubgoers, killing 49 people. Colon, who was shot multiple times, told ABC News in an interview last year that he would have ""bled to death"" if not for Delgado, who rescued him roughly 25 minutes after gunfire erupted, allowing Colon to get lifesaving treatment. Delgado told ABC affiliate WFTV in Orlando that he has been on light duty since the massacre because he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. He said the Eatonville Police Department has deemed him unfit for duty and he was told Monday that his last day on the job will be Dec. 31, six months before he qualifies for a pension from the town. He has been a member of the department for over nine years. ""They can't find it in their hearts to find six more months, just so I can be vested and then just move on with my life,"" Delgado told WFTV. ""I needed help, and I guess I'm being punished because I asked for help."" Eatonville Police Chief Joseph Jenkins confirmed Delgado's dismissal for ABC News but wouldn't provide details on the reasons for it. ""We have reached an agreement with Officer Delgado, and we will be terminating his employment on Dec. 31. There are circumstances I can't go into because of protected information,"" Jenkins said via telephone today. The Eatonville Town Council voted Tuesday night to pay some of Delgado's accrued sick time before he's out of a job. Eatonville Mayor Eddie Cole refused to answer WFTV's questions about Delgado's termination. ""There are some things that I'm not privileged to say,"" Cole said. Colon attended Tuesday's council meeting to speak out against Delgado's dismissal. ""He was my hero,"" Colon told WFTV. ""He saved my life, and for them to just do what they're doing in front of my face, it's a slap to my face as well."" ""God sent him, and he was my hero that night,"" Colon added. ""Without him, who knows if I would have stayed inside that club and not made it out?"" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-12-06 12:45:49, Pulse nightclub hero to be dismissed by police department,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The man who opened fire inside at New Mexico high school on Thursday had disguised himself as a student and had previously been investigated by the FBI for making comments about plotting a mass shooting, authorities said. The shooter fatally shot two students before killing himself at the high school in Aztec, New Mexico, state police said. The San Juan County Sheriff's Office on Friday identified the shooter as William Atchison, 21, a former Aztec High School student who did not graduate. Authorities said they had found plans for the shooting in Atchison's home that included a detailed timeline, along with the line, ""If all goes according to plan, today is the day I die."" Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez, the shooter's first victim. An FBI spokesperson said the agency had investigated Atchison in March 2016 for comments he made on a gaming website that were ""generally along the lines of 'If you're going to conduct a mass shooting, does anyone know about cheap assault rifles?'"" The FBI interviewed Atchison and his family at the time, but he told investigators he had no plans for an attack and did not own any guns. According to the FBI, Atchison was fond of making trolling comments online to get a rise out of people. On the day of the shooting, sheriff's officials said Atchison disguised himself as a student and even mingled with other students as they got off school buses to enter campus. He was carrying one pistol, a 9-mm Glock that he had purchased one month ago, as well as ""several magazines."" Casey Jordan Marquez, the shooter's second victim. Shortly after 8 a.m. as first period was beginning, Atchison was loading his weapon in a second-floor bathroom when he was discovered by the first victim, Francisco ""Paco"" Fernandez, an eleventh-grade student, who had excused himself from class, officials said. Atchison shot Fernandez and then walked into the hallway, where he encountered the second victim, Casey Jordan Marquez, 17, and killed her. He then began firing randomly, San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen. Four officers responded to the school ""within one minute"" of the dispatcher's call. The officers entered Aztec High by shooting out a window to confront the shooter because it was on lockdown, according to the sheriff's office. Shortly after officers entered, Atchison took his own life. According to New Mexico officials, no other students or faculty were injured in the shooting. 2 Students Killed in Aztec, N.M.

          / CBS News President Trump on Tuesday said he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to draft regulations that would ban any devices that would turn legal, semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons, after studying the issue of bump stocks in light of the Las Vegas shooting in October. The president made the remarks from the White House East Room, as he hosted the Public Safety Medal of Valor Awards Ceremony. The comments marked the president's first public appearance in Washington since his brief speech Thursday after the Parkland shooting, and his remarks on bump stocks are the first he has made definitively proposing a policy solution related to gun control. Mr. Trump said his memo to Sessions directing the change came after months of reviewing the issue. The president has also indicated he would be open to universal background checks, which have wide public approval. The suspect in the Parkland massacre, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, did not use a bump stock device. The NRA said in a statement Tuesday night it ""cannot comment until an actual rule is published with specifics that we can review. The NRA's stance on this issue has not changed. Fully-automatic weapons have been heavily regulated since the 1930s, but banning semi-automatic firearms and accessories has been shown time and again to not prevent criminal activity and simply punishes the law-abiding for the criminal acts of others."" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday night that ""whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must focus on strengthening background checks!"" Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! The president said he is ""grieving for the community of Parkland in the great state of Florida."" ""We're working very hard to make sense of these events,"" the president told members of law enforcement and first responders there Tuesday. The president, echoing something Vice President Mike Pence said over the weekend, said school security will be a top priority for his administration. ""We cannot imagine the depth of their anguish, but we can pledge the strength of our resolve,"" he said of the victims and their families. ""And we must to do more to protect our children. We have to do more to protect our children."" The Justice Department did not give a timeline on when such regulations will be completed. ""The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,"" the DOJ said in a statement. ""We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed."" The president also called for better physical protection of schools, and for better coordination between federal and state law enforcement in order to take ""swift action"" when there are warning signs. The FBI admitted last week it failed to follow up on a January tip about the suspect in the Florida shooting, who had been expelled from the high school. Bump stocks were used by Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter believed to be responsible for the most deadly mass shooting in modern American history, to kill dozens and injure hundreds in October. The Department of Justice began reviewing the matter, and Mr. Trump's announcement was the result of that review. The event Tuesday was intended to recognize those who have earned the highest possible valor award for public safety. Last year, Mr. Trump granted the award to the agents who risked their lives to protect members of Congress in the June congressional baseball practice shooting. The last time the president had appeared publicly in Washington was Friday, to commemorate the victims of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., that took 17 lives. On Friday night, he visited the hospital where some of those injured in the shooting are recovering, and spoke with local members of law enforcement who intervened.

501,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1717066,"Hardly a week goes by without news of a mass shooting somewhere in the United States. But a mass shooting five years ago still leaves a hole in our hearts and anger in our souls. It was Dec. 14, 2012, when Adam Lanza used an assault rifle and a semi-automatic handgun to kill 20 6- and 7-year-olds and six adult staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. He had shot his mother to death earlier, and he killed himself after the shooting. We all remember the horror of that day. We wept along with President Obama, both immediately afterward and during his poignant and heartfelt remarks to the Newtown community. We waited for lawmakers to do the right thing and pass common-sense gun laws. We’re still waiting. Even while the details of Sandy Hook fade as our attention turns to other acts of gun violence, it will forever remain fresh in the minds of those affected in Newtown, Connecticut. They started Newtown Action Alliance, a national grassroots organization formed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings and based in Newtown itself. Newtown Foundation is the charitable arm of Newtown Action Alliance. The group’s mission, as described on its website, is “to achieve the steady and continuous reduction of gun violence through legislative and cultural changes.” We haven’t seen that gun violence reduction or those legislative changes. So Newtown Action is joining with many of the nation’s gun safety groups by inviting people nationwide to participate in peace vigils and to keep demanding action. Many had hopes that the death of 20 first- and second-graders would be enough to move lawmakers to pass common-sense gun laws that are favored by a large majority of Americans. Public support for gun safety always rises immediately after a mass shooting, then fades somewhat. Just as in this recent poll by Politico, taken after the Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1 that killed 58 people, there always remains a big percentage in favor of: The list goes on and on. Yet lawmakers still resist passing even a minimum piece of legislation, fearing retribution from the National Rifle Association. But in response to the shooting at a Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which killed 26 people, there are two new attempts. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson of Texas introduced a bill called the “Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act.” It would require “a 7-day waiting period before a semiautomatic firearm, a silencer, armor piercing ammunition, or a large capacity ammunition magazine may be purchased or transferred ownership.” As Jackson said in describing her bill: The “Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act” will not abridge the Second Amendment, take away gun rights, nor impose greater restrictions on gun ownership, BUT it would significantly reduce gun homicides. According to an October 2017 Harvard University study, the adoption of a national waiting period, from 1994 to 1998 under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, led to a 17 percent drop in gun homicides. Handgun purchase waiting periods in 17 states, Texas not being one of them, prevent about 750 gun deaths each year in the United States. An estimated 910 gun deaths could also be avoided if those policies were adopted nationwide. On the Senate side, a bipartisan group of four senators—Democrats Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republicans John Cornyn of Texas and Tim Scott of South Carolina—introduced their own bill to strengthen reporting to the national background check system. The bill, which has four co-sponsors, two Democrats and two Republicans, “would require states and agencies to produce plans for sending records to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) that would show if an individual is prohibited from buying a gun and verifying that the information is accurate,” according to a story in The Hill. As Cornyn said in introducing the bill: For years agencies and states haven’t complied with the law, failing to upload these critical records without consequence. ... This bill aims to help fix what’s become a nationwide, systemic problem so we can better prevent criminals and domestic abusers from obtaining firearms. It’s clear that this bill to strengthen background checks is needed. The NICS lacks information on more than 25 percent of all felony convictions, according to a 2013 report by the nonprofit National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics, because too many states don’t turn in reports. Even the NRA admits that about 7 million records aren’t in the system. There’s always a call for action after every mass shooting. After Columbine. After Virginia Tech. After the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. After Sandy Hook. After Orlando. After Las Vegas. After Sutherland Springs. There is a never-ending litany of names of towns and people affected by gun violence. Yet it never stops. There will be a national vigil in Washington, D.C., at St. Marks Episcopal Church near Capitol Hill on Dec. 6 to mark the fifth anniversary of Sandy Hook. Among the organizations joining the Newtown Foundation and taking part in the Dec. 6 event in Washington: The organizers of the Washington event originally invited family members who have lost loved ones to gun violence and survivors to attend. They even offered travel assistance and hotel rooms. But 500,000 people have been killed or injured by gun violence since December 2012. Each year, more than 30,000 people die through gun violence. That’s an awful lot of people for one church. So Newtown Action Alliance is asking others around the country to hold their own candlelight vigils. Communities across America are invited to hold their own events anytime between Dec. 6 and Dec. 17. Newtown Action is calling these vigils the Nationwide Vigils to #EndGunViolence. Last year, on the fourth anniversary of Sandy Hook, there were 330 such events in 43 states. Newtown Action is hoping for more than 500 vigils this year in all 50 states. To host a vigil or event, Newtown Action offers a tool kit to facilitate planning and to coordinate a collective gun violence prevention message. You can find more information on the Newtown website. To find an event near you, visit Newtown Action’s Facebook page describing the events or the still-growing list of the many vigils planned. They are spread throughout the dates of Dec. 6-17 and in all areas of the country, although many are planned for the anniversary date of Dec. 14. Besides the candlelight vigils, at many of these events, participants will receive educational materials on gun violence prevention. Some will collect materials for care packages for the families of gun violence victims. Others will invite attendees to participate in social media campaigns and sign pledge cards. On Dec. 14, churches nationwide are invited to ring church bells in remembrance of the 26 Sandy Hook victims at 9:35 a.m., the time the deadly attack in Newtown started. Maybe the sound of church bells ringing will remind lawmakers that we haven’t moved on from the issue of gun violence, even if some of them have. Let’s not let legislators off the hook. Do it for these children and the brave adults who died trying to save them. And for the 150,000 people who have died from gun violence ever since.

502,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1720114,"A jury has acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of murder and involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco two years ago. Garcia Zarate, who is an undocumented immigrant, was found guilty of illegal firearms possession and could face a prison sentence of up to three years. Steinle’s killing was a horrible tragedy compounded by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who, ignoring her family’s objections, bastardized her death into a political opportunity to ramp up his anti-immigrant agenda. Following the jury’s verdict, the tweeter in chief stayed true to form. “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case,” he fumed, using her death to call for his wall. “No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration”:  The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!  A lie. “Garcia Zarate did have a history of drug charges,” noted Splinter, “but didn’t have a violent criminal record and spent most of his life in prison.” Trump and other anti-immigrant critics continually misrepresented Garcia Zarate as shooting Steinle in malice, when in fact the defense successfully argued the shooting was most likely accidental, since the bullet from the gun he had found actually ricocheted off the ground and then struck Steinle. “The defense also presented evidence regarding the SIG Sauer’s propensity to accidentally fire,” noted a surprisingly sober read from RedState. A tragedy nonetheless, but certainly not the cold-blooded killing Trump attempted to portray in order to further foment hate. Not that Trump really cared anyway. He only seems speak out when it’s one kind of gunshot victim—“For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed,” Steinle’s mom Liz Sullivan said last year, “beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda. We were the perfect storm for that man”—and one kind of person pulling the trigger. Meanwhile, what’s he done about the mass shooting in Las Vegas? What’s he done about all the black men and women shot dead, in front of their loved ones and on camera, by police? Unless it fits his agenda, Donald Trump doesn’t care. Steinle’s death is one tragedy, and the Trump administration’s continued exploitation of her death to demonize immigrants for political gain is the second. Already, Fox and Friends is urging regular viewer Trump to “take advantage” of the jury’s verdict to build his fucking wall. The White House later issued a statement calling for more border resources and saying that “had San Francisco enforced our Nation’s immigration laws, the Steinle family would be celebrating this holiday with all of their loved ones.” But in 2015, the family was deeply upset their personal tragedy was thrust into a national political debate by Trump and his campaign and later declined opportunities to meet with him: “All of a sudden now we’re against sanctuary cities,” [father Jim] Steinle said. “Well we never said that. What else are we going to get involved in?” Sullivan went on Greta Van Susteren’s TV show to praise Hispanic families who are in this country without documentation. Someone else asked Steinle if he thought such people working in the Central Valley should be deported, he scoffed. “If you deport them, what are you going to eat? Rocks?” he said. “I mean, they feed the United States.” “We just want to get this over with and move on with our lives, and think about Kate on our terms,” Steinle said following the verdict this week. “Nothing’s been on our terms. It’s been on everyone else’s terms.” ",2017-12-01 13:22:24,A seething Trump uses Steinle verdict to call for his border wall,"immigration and refugees,murders and attempted murders",115,http://www.dailykos.com
503,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1721711,"Update: The combined bill explained below passed the House this afternoon on a vote of 231-198. Six Democrats voted for it. Fourteen Republicans voted against it. The legislation now moves to the Senate where it most probably will face a filibuster unless Republicans can persuade eight Democrats to vote yes. •••   ••• Last week, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill which would force each state to recognize as valid permits from residents of other states to carry concealed, loaded firearms across state lines. This would apply even when the concealed-carry laws in those other states are much weaker. Republicans hope that by combining this bill with a bipartisan bill to improve the federal background-check system, they can collect enough votes to get both passed in the Senate. But some Democrats say combining the two will kill them both. The reciprocity bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, has 210 Republican and three Democratic co-sponsors, and is slated for a floor vote today. He said the combining of the two bills wasn’t his idea. Here’s The New York Times editorial board trashing Hudson’s bill: The measure fits well with the fantasies of vigilante justice peddled by President Trump in last year’s campaign and enthusiastically embraced by the N.R.A. Mr. Trump, who once favored strong gun controls, reduced the mass shooting epidemic to a Marvel comics scenario in which justice is done and deliverance achieved by heroic gunplay. “If I’m in that room, and let’s say we have two or five or 40 people with guns,” he hypothesized to voters, “we’re going to do a lot better because there’s going to be a shootout.” Genuine self-defense episodes, however, are scarce. Deaths caused by concealed-carry gun owners are not. Research shows that far from stopping mayhem, concealed-carry gun owners have been doing more harm to themselves, their family members and other innocent victims. Since May 2007, they have been responsible for at least 1,119 deaths not involving self-defense, including in 31 mass shootings and the killing of 21 law enforcement officers, according to the Violence Policy Center, a gun safety group. You can get a fuller picture about the dangers of the reciprocity bill here. The measure has been on the National Rifle Association’s wish list in some form for several years. But there is worse to come already in the pipeline. Back in 1986, soon after the gun lobby began its campaign to make it easier for Americans everywhere to carry concealed firearms, the majority of states issued permits for this purpose in very small numbers, if at all. Since then, all the states have made it at least somewhat easier to get a permit. So what’s worse than lots of permits? As you can see from the two maps below showing the situation in 1986 and now, another NRA campaign has been gaining ground—concealed carry without a permit. In 2001, only one state—Vermont—maintained this arrangement. Since colonial days, anybody in Vermont could carry concealed without getting permission, and unlike other states, it never tightened the law. Alaska became the second no-permit-needed state in 2003. Then, in 2013, the NRA began quietly working in the legislatures on this. Consequently, a dozen states do not now require concealed-carry permits. And while some state legislatures have rejected no-permit bills, or, as in Montana, passed bills that a Democratic governor has vetoed, the gun lobby is relentless. Thus, we can expect more states to join the parade over the next few years.  So, what happens when no-permit-needed meets reciprocity? Will residents of Missouri or Arizona, where no permit is required, be allowed to carry their hidden firearms in California where concealed permits in the mostly heavily populated counties are still issued parsimoniously? That’s the way critics interpret Hudson’s bill. This terrible legislation needs to be flat-lined by the Senate.

That number is ghastly and should be totally unacceptable, especially because it is absolutely within our power to change it. Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Captain Mark Kelly are determined to do something about it. Through their organization, Giffords, they have worked with elected officials, law enforcement communities, companies and grassroots activists to advocate for stronger gun laws. They have also endorsed candidates for office that have a track record demonstrating a commitment to policies which keep people safe and reduce gun violence. On Thursday, Giffords endorsed Stacey Abrams in her run for governor of Georgia. Abrams, a Democrat, was endorsed in October by Daily Kos. Giffords had this to say about supporting Abrams: “Georgia needs a leader with courage to take on gun violence and push solutions that will make our communities safer. [...] [Stacey] is committed to protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens while taking action to stop an epidemic that is ravaging the state. Stacey understands the importance of keeping guns out of the hands of violent felons, domestic abusers, and other dangerous people. As Governor, Stacey Abrams will work to build support for commonsense measures that stop individuals who are in danger of hurting themselves or others from possessing firearms and strengthen the background check system.” Abrams stance on gun restrictions poses a marked contrast to her Republican opponents. They are all against banning bump stocks—a device used in the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, which when attached to a semiautomatic rifle, allows it to fire rounds of bullets (up to 500 per minute) as fast as a machine gun. Not only do they want bump stocks to remain legal, they also have called for loosening gun restrictions. Please donate $3 today to help elect Stacey Abrams as Georgia’s next governor and turn the state blue. In an Atlanta Journal Constitution article about Giffords endorsement of Abrams, she is quoted as saying this about her position on gun control: “My family hunts, and I know how to shoot a pistol, fire a rifle and respect the power of firearms,” she added. “Because of my respect for weapons and the Constitution, I will consistently support gun safety policies that prevent violence.” Stacey Abrams is committed to fighting for safer gun laws. And in a country that had 486 mass shootings in 2016, ensuring that guns stay out of the hands of dangerous people should be a priority. Republicans have shown over and over again that they cannot be trusted to lead on this issue. Let's make sure that Stacey Abrams is the next governor of Georgia. This is a critical election that can lead Georgia into a promising, progressive future.

505,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1716001,"For the period of perhaps one or two days after the nation's newest, largest mass shooting, it looked like even Republican leaders were willing to contemplate banning the sale of ""bump stocks,"" attachments that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire as rapidly as fully automatic versions. The attempt at showing a spine was short-lived, even by our new post-Sandy Hook standards, but there may yet be trouble ahead for the makers of the shoot-people-faster attachments. ""Bump stocks"" skirt laws against owning automatic weapons because they're only weapon attachments, after all, not actual guns—but that very distinction means they're not protected by the gun industry's congressionally-approved “get out of lawsuits free” card. It’s normally difficult to win lawsuits against the gun industry for making or selling products that are used to commit crimes. That’s because, in 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which gives firearms and ammunition manufacturers and retailers broad immunities from civil liability. In this instance though, the suit isn’t against a gun manufacturer. In fact, Slide Fire’s founder Jeremiah Cottle took pains to assure his product was not classified as a gun or an integral gun part. In 2010, he sent a prototype of his bump stock design to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, asking them to affirm that his device is not subject to the same laws that regulate firearms. The ATF agreed. And that means that the manufacturers of these murder-people-quicker attachments can be sued for selling a dangerous product to dangerous people, just like any other non-gun business in America. So have fun with that, assholes.

507,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/republican-house-vote-concealed-carry-gun-background-checks/547454/?utm_source=feed,"GOP leaders want to pass a bill that would treat concealed-carry permits like driver’s or marriage licenses. But to do so, they’re tacking on a bipartisan bill to tighten up the federal background-check system. House Republicans plan to vote this week on a bipartisan proposal to tighten up the federal background-check system following the massacre last month of 25 Texas churchgoers by a man whose history of domestic violence should have stopped him from buying a gun. That vote would represent a breakthrough for advocates of gun control after years of congressional inaction in the wake of mass shootings—except for one enormous catch: Republicans are attaching the bipartisan bill to a separate measure that dramatically expands gun rights across the country. The second proposal, known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, is a top priority of the National Rifle Association; it makes permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in most other states as well. The bill would also allow people to carry concealed weapons into national parks and other federally-owned lands. Many states have strong background-check requirements or force applicants to undergo hours of gun-safety training before getting a concealed-carry permit. But many other states have weaker standards, and 12 states allow residents to carry handguns with no permit at all. “This will force states with strong laws to honor the requirements of the states with the weakest, and it’s really just not right,” Mark Kelly told reporters on a conference call. He’s the retired astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was shot at a constituent event in 2011. Democrats accused Republicans of using the modest bipartisan reform of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, as a legislative sweetener to win votes for a much more radical loosening of gun laws. The so-called Fix NICS Act adds a combination of incentives and penalties to ensure that state and federal agencies submit records to the background-check database. After last month’s church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the Air Force acknowledged that it failed to enter the shooter’s court martial for domestic violence into the NICS database, which could have prevented him from buying the rifle he used in the killing spree. “What we do in response to that horrific mass shooting should not be held hostage to the gun lobby’s No. 1 priority,” Kelly said. The Fix NICS Act also requires the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to report to Congress data on the use of bump stocks in gun crimes. That was the device used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more at a Las Vegas country-music concert in October. Democrats and some Republicans have called for an outright ban on bump stocks, which enable a gun to fire bullets at a much higher frequency, but the legislation does not go that far. The chief sponsor of the concealed-carry legislation is Representative Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina. In an interview on Monday, he told me it was not his decision to combine the two gun proposals into a single bill. He defended the reciprocity act as one that would force states to treat gun permits the same way as driver’s or marriage licenses. Hudson pointed out that while states would have to recognize permits issued by another, gun owners would still have to abide by each individual state’s laws on when and where they can carry a loaded weapon. He cited the example of Shaneen Allen, a single mother with a concealed-carry permit issued by Pennsylvania. In 2013, she spent 50 days in jail in New Jersey, which doesn’t have a reciprocity law, after she alerted police to her gun during a traffic stop. (Governor Chris Christie pardoned her.) “You’re not going to see mobs of people carrying concealed [weapons] into Times Square,” Hudson told me. “But,” he continued, “law-abiding citizens who may be passing through one state to get to grandma’s house in the next state aren’t automatically going to become a criminal.” A number of law-enforcement groups have come out against the bill, saying it would add to dangers faced by police officers on the beat. “This isn’t the Wild West,” said Kevin Davis, the Baltimore police commissioner. “The reality of it all is that police officers in Baltimore and elsewhere may be completely unable to confirm whether a person is indeed carrying legally.” A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said an “overwhelming majority” of Democrats are expected to oppose the combined concealed-carry and background-check bill. Republicans might still be able to pass it on their own, but the bigger question will be the measure’s fate in the Senate, where at least eight Democratic votes would be needed to overcome a filibuster. Hudson’s office noted that seven Democrats currently serving in the Senate voted for a different concealed-carry reciprocity bill that was offered as an amendment in 2013. But Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the lead Democratic sponsor of the bipartisan Fix NICS bill, said he was confident that the GOP’s gambit wouldn’t work. “My impression is that if they combine the two, the bill is dead in the Senate,” Murphy told me. “So this is just theater this week in the House. This isn’t lawmaking.” Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican, told reporters last week that while he supported both bills, he didn’t think they should be combined. “Combining them, I think, is to risk doing nothing,” he said, according to the Daily Caller. Murphy did see a bit of a silver lining for advocates of stricter gun laws, however. “It is interesting to me that Republicans in the House decided they couldn’t move the concealed-carry reciprocity by itself and that for PR reasons they felt they had to dress it up with the Fix NICS Act,” he said. “That tells you that there’s a political exposure for Republicans on the NRA agenda that simply was not there 10 years ago.” By combining the bills, Republicans are trying to entice Democrats to support them, or risk looking overly political by opposing efforts to improve the background-check system that they’ve vocally backed. “It’s a pretty clumsy, transparent effort at trying to look reasonable,” Murphy said of the Republican maneuver. But that itself was a shift. In the past, he continued, “Republicans didn’t try to look reasonable.”",2017-12-05 09:26:38,A New Republican Strategy to Dramatically Expand Gun Rights,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,gun control,firearms",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
508,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/second-life-leslie-jamison/544149/?utm_source=feed,"Second Life was supposed to be the future of the internet, but then Facebook came along. Yet many people still spend hours each day inhabiting this virtual realm. Their stories—and the world they’ve built—illuminate the promise and limitations of online life. Gidge Uriza lives in an elegant wooden house with large glass windows overlooking a glittering creek, fringed by weeping willows and meadows twinkling with fireflies. She keeps buying new swimming pools because she keeps falling in love with different ones. The current specimen is a teal lozenge with a waterfall cascading from its archway of stones. Gidge spends her days lounging in a swimsuit on her poolside patio, or else tucked under a lacy comforter, wearing nothing but a bra and bathrobe, with a chocolate-glazed donut perched on the pile of books beside her. “Good morning girls,” she writes on her blog one day. “I’m slow moving, trying to get out of bed this morning, but when I’m surrounded by my pretty pink bed it’s difficult to get out and away like I should.” In another life, the one most people would call “real,” Gidge Uriza is Bridgette McNeal, an Atlanta mother who works eight-hour days at a call center and is raising a 14-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter, and severely autistic twins, now 13. Her days are full of the selflessness and endless mundanity of raising children with special needs: giving her twins baths after they have soiled themselves (they still wear diapers, and most likely always will), baking applesauce bread with one to calm him down after a tantrum, asking the other to stop playing “the Barney theme song slowed down to sound like some demonic dirge.” One day, she takes all four kids to a nature center for an idyllic afternoon that gets interrupted by the reality of changing an adolescent’s diaper in a musty bathroom. But each morning, before all that—before getting the kids ready for school and putting in eight hours at the call center, before getting dinner on the table or keeping peace during the meal, before giving baths and collapsing into bed—Bridgette spends an hour and a half on the online platform Second Life, where she lives in a sleek paradise of her own devising. Good morning girls. I’m slow moving, trying to get out of bed this morning. She wakes up at 5:30 to inhabit a life in which she has the luxury of never getting out of bed at all. What is Second Life? The short answer is that it’s a virtual world that launched in 2003 and was hailed by some as the future of the internet. The longer answer is that it’s a landscape full of goth cities and preciously tattered beach shanties, vampire castles and tropical islands and rainforest temples and dinosaur stomping grounds, disco-ball-glittering nightclubs and trippy giant chess games. In 2013, in honor of Second Life’s tenth birthday, Linden Lab—the company that created it—released an infographic charting its progress: 36 million accounts had been created, and their users had spent 217,266 cumulative years online, inhabiting an ever-expanding territory that comprised almost 700 square miles. Many are tempted to call Second Life a game, but two years after its launch, Linden Lab circulated a memo to employees insisting that no one refer to it as that. It was a platform. This was meant to suggest something more holistic, more immersive, and more encompassing. Second Life has no specific goals. Its vast landscape consists entirely of user-generated content, which means that everything you see has been built by someone else—an avatar controlled by a live human user. These avatars build and buy homes, form friendships, hook up, get married, and make money. They celebrate their “rez day,” the online equivalent of a birthday: the anniversary of the day they joined. At church, they cannot take physical communion—the corporeality of that ritual is impossible—but they can bring the stories of their faith to life. At their cathedral on Epiphany Island, the Anglicans of Second Life summon rolling thunder on Good Friday, or a sudden sunrise at the moment in the Easter service when the pastor pronounces, “He is risen.” As one Second Life handbook puts it: “From your point of view, SL works as if you were a god.” In truth, in the years since its peak in the mid‑2000s, Second Life has become something more like a magnet for mockery. When I told friends that I was working on a story about it, their faces almost always followed the same trajectory of reactions: a blank expression, a brief flash of recognition, and then a mildly bemused look. Is that still around? Second Life is no longer the thing you joke about; it’s the thing you haven’t bothered to joke about for years. Many observers expected monthly user numbers to keep rising after they hit 1 million in 2007, but instead they peaked—and have, in the years since, stalled at about 800,000. An estimated 20 to 30 percent are first-time users who never return. Just a few years after declaring Second Life the future of the internet, the tech world moved on. As a 2011 piece in Slate proclaimed, joining a chorus of disenchantment: “Looking back, the future didn’t last long.” Check out the full table of contents and find your next story to read. But if Second Life promised a future in which people would spend hours each day inhabiting their online identity, haven’t we found ourselves inside it? Only it’s come to pass on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter instead. As I learned more about Second Life, and spent more time exploring it, it started to seem less like an obsolete relic and more like a distorted mirror reflecting the world many of us live in. Perhaps Second Life inspires an urge to ridicule not because it’s unrecognizable, but because it takes a recognizable impulse and carries it past the bounds of comfort, into a kind of uncanny valley: not just the promise of an online voice, but an online body; not just checking Twitter on your phone, but forgetting to eat because you’re dancing at an online club; not just a curated version of your real life, but a separate existence entirely. It crystallizes the simultaneous siren call and shame of wanting an alternate life. It raises questions about where unfettered fantasy leads, as well as about how we navigate the boundary between the virtual and the real. As virtual-reality technology grows more advanced, it promises to deliver a more fully realized version of what many believed Second Life would offer: total immersion in another world. And as our actual world keeps delivering weekly horrors—another mass shooting, another hurricane, another tweet from the president threatening nuclear war—the appeal of that alternate world keeps deepening, along with our doubts about what it means to find ourselves drawn to it. From 2004 to 2007, an anthropologist named Tom Boellstorff inhabited Second Life as an embedded ethnographer, naming his avatar Tom Bukowski and building himself a home and office called Ethnographia. His immersive approach was anchored by the premise that the world of Second Life is just as “real” as any other, and that he was justified in studying Second Life on “its own terms” rather than feeling obligated to understand people’s virtual identities primarily in terms of their offline lives. His book Coming of Age in Second Life, titled in homage to Margaret Mead’s classic, documents the texture of the platform’s digital culture. He finds that making “small talk about lag [streaming delays in SL] is like talking about the weather in RL,” and interviews an avatar named Wendy, whose creator always makes her go to sleep before she logs out. “So the actual world is Wendy’s dream, until she wakes up again in Second Life?,” Boellstorff recalls asking her, and then: “I could have sworn a smile passed across Wendy’s … face as she said, ‘Yup. Indeed.’ ” In Hinduism, the concept of an avatar refers to the incarnation of a deity on Earth, among mortals. In Second Life, it’s your body—an ongoing act of self-expression. One woman described her avatar to Boellstorff like this: “If I take a zipper and pull her out of me, that’s who I am.” Female avatars tend to be thin and impossibly busty; male avatars are young and muscular; almost all avatars are vaguely cartoonish in their beauty. These avatars communicate through chat windows, or by using voice technology to actually speak with one another. They move by walking, flying, teleporting, and clicking on “poseballs,” literal floating orbs that animate avatars into various actions: dancing, karate, pretty much every sexual act you can imagine. Not surprisingly, many users come to Second Life for the possibilities of digital sex—sex without corporeal bodies, without real names, without the constraints of gravity, often with elaborate textual commentary. The local currency in Second Life is the Linden Dollar, and recent exchange rates put the Linden at just less than half a cent. In the 10 years following its launch, Second Life users spent $3.2 billion of real money on in‑world transactions. The first Second Life millionaire, a digital-real-estate tycoon who goes by Anshe Chung, graced the cover of Businessweek in 2006, and by 2007, the GDP of Second Life was larger than that of several small countries. In the vast digital Marketplace, you can buy a wedding gown for 4,000 Lindens (just over $16) or a ruby-colored corset with fur wings for just under 350 Lindens (about $1.50). You can even buy another body entirely: different skin, different hair, a pair of horns, genitalia of all shapes and sizes. A private island currently costs almost 150,000 Lindens (the price is fixed at $600), while the Millennium II Super Yacht costs 20,000 Lindens (just over $80) and comes with more than 300 animations attached to its beds and trio of hot tubs, designed to allow avatars to enact a vast range of sexual fantasies. The number of Second Life users peaked just as Facebook started to explode. The rise of Facebook wasn’t the problem of a competing brand so much as the problem of a competing model: It seemed that people wanted a curated version of real life more than they wanted another life entirely—that they wanted to become their most flattering profile picture more than they wanted to become a wholly separate avatar. But maybe Facebook and Second Life aren’t so different in their appeal. Both find traction in the allure of inhabiting a selective self, whether built from the materials of lived experience (camping-trip photos and witty observations about brunch) or from the impossibilities that lived experience precludes: an ideal body, an ideal romance, an ideal home. Bridgette McNeal, the Atlanta mother of four, has been on Second Life for just over a decade. She named her avatar Gidge after what bullies called her in high school. While Bridgette is middle-aged, her avatar is a lithe 20-something whom she describes as “perfect me—if I’d never eaten sugar or had children.” During her early days on Second Life, Bridgette’s husband created an avatar as well, and the two of them would go on Second Life dates together, a blond Amazon and a squat silver robot, while sitting at their laptops in their study at home. It was often the only way they could go on dates, because their kids’ special needs made finding babysitters difficult. When we spoke, Bridgette described her Second Life home as a refuge that grants permission. “When I step into that space, I’m afforded the luxury of being selfish.” She invoked Virginia Woolf: “It’s like a room of my own.” Her virtual home is full of objects she could never keep in her real home because her kids might break or eat them—jewelry on dishes, knickknacks on tables, makeup on the counter. In addition to the blog that documents her digital existence, with its marble pools and frilly, spearmint-green bikinis, Bridgette keeps a blog devoted to her daily life as a parent. It’s honest and hilarious and full of heartbreaking candor. Recounting the afternoon spent with her kids at the nature center, she describes looking at a bald eagle: “Some asshole shot this bald eagle with an arrow. He lost most of one wing because of it and can’t fly. He’s kept safe here at this retreat we visited a few days ago. Sometimes I think the husband and I feel a little bit like him. Trapped. Nothing really wrong, we’ve got food and shelter and what we need. But we are trapped for the rest of our lives by autism. We’ll never be free.” When I asked Bridgette about the allure of Second Life, she said it can be easy to succumb to the temptation to pour yourself into it when you should be tending to real life. I asked whether she had ever slipped close to that, and she said she’d certainly felt the pull at times. “You’re thin and beautiful. No one’s asking you to change a diaper,” she told me. “But you can burn out on that. You don’t want to leave, but you don’t want to do it anymore, either.” Second Life was invented by a man named Philip Rosedale, the son of a U.S. Navy carrier pilot and an English teacher. As a boy, he was driven by an outsize sense of ambition. He can remember standing near the woodpile in his family’s backyard and thinking, “Why am I here, and how am I different from everybody else?” As a teenager in the mid‑’80s, he used an early-model PC to zoom in on a graphic representation of a Mandelbrot set, an infinitely recursive fractal image that just kept getting more and more detailed as he got closer and closer. At a certain point, he told me, he realized he was looking at a graphic larger than the Earth: “We could walk along the surface our whole lives, and never even begin to see everything.” That’s when he realized that “the coolest thing you could do with a computer would be to build a world.” In 1999, just as Rosedale was starting Linden Lab, he attended Burning Man, the annual festival of performance art, sculptural installations, and hallucinogenic hedonism in the middle of the Nevada desert. While he was there, he told me, something “inexplicable” happened to his personality. “You feel like you’re high, without any drugs or anything. You just feel connected to people in a way that you don’t normally.” He went to a rave in an Airstream trailer, watched trapeze artists swing across the desert, and lay in a hookah lounge piled with hundreds of Persian rugs. Burning Man didn’t give Rosedale the idea for Second Life—he’d been imagining a digital world for years—but it helped him understand the energy he wanted to summon: a place where people could make the world whatever they wanted it to be. This was the dream, but it was a hard sell for early investors. Linden Lab was proposing a world built by amateurs, and sustained by a different kind of revenue model—based not on paid subscriptions, but on commerce generated in-world. One of Second Life’s designers recalled investors’ skepticism: “Creativity was supposed to be a dark art that only Spielberg and Lucas could do.” As part of selling Second Life as a world, rather than a game, Linden Lab hired a writer to work as an “embedded journalist.” This was Wagner James Au, who ended up chronicling the early years of Second Life on a blog (still running) called “New World Notes,” and then, after his employment with Linden Lab ended, in a book called The Making of Second Life. In the book, Au profiles some of Second Life’s most important early builders: an avatar named Spider Mandala (who was managing a Midwestern gas station offline) and another named Catherine Omega, who was a “punky brunette … with a utility belt” in Second Life, but offline was squatting in a condemned apartment building in Vancouver, a building that had no running water and was populated mainly by addicts, where she used a soup can to catch a wireless signal from nearby office buildings so she could run Second Life on her laptop. Rosedale told me about the thrill of those early days, when Second Life’s potential felt unbridled. No one else was doing what he and his team were doing, he remembered: “We used to say that our only competition was real life.” He said there was a period in 2007 when more than 500 articles a day were written about Linden Lab’s work. Rosedale loved to explore Second Life as an avatar named Philip Linden. “I was like a god,” he told me. He envisioned a future in which his grandchildren would see the real world as a kind of “museum or theater,” while most work and relationships happened in virtual realms like Second Life. “In some sense,” he told Au in 2007, “I think we will see the entire physical world as being kind of left behind.” Alice Krueger first started noticing the symptoms of her illness when she was 20 years old. During fieldwork for a college biology class, crouching down to watch bugs eating leaves, she felt overwhelmed by heat. Standing in the grocery store, she noticed that it felt as if her entire left leg had disappeared—not just gone numb, but disappeared. Whenever she went to a doctor, she was told it was all in her head. “And it was all in my head,” she told me, 47 years later. “But in a different way than how they meant.” Alice was finally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 50. By then she could barely walk. Her neighborhood association in Colorado prohibited her from building a ramp at the front of her house, so it was difficult for her to go anywhere. Her three children were 11, 13, and 15. She didn’t get to see her younger son’s high-school graduation, or his college campus. She started suffering intense pain in her lower back and eventually had to have surgery to repair spinal vertebrae that had fused together, then ended up getting multidrug-resistant staph from her time in the hospital. Her pain persisted, and she was diagnosed with a misalignment caused by the surgery itself, during which she had been suspended “like a rotisserie chicken” above the operating table. At the age of 57, Alice found herself housebound and unemployed, often in excruciating pain, largely cared for by her daughter. “I was looking at my four walls,” she told me, “and wondering if there could be more.” That’s when she found Second Life. She created an avatar named Gentle Heron, and loved seeking out waterslides—excited by the sheer thrill of doing what her body could not. As she kept exploring, she started inviting people she’d met online in disability chat rooms to join her. But that also meant she started to feel responsible for their experience, and eventually she founded a “cross-disability virtual community” in Second Life, now known as Virtual Ability, a group that occupies an archipelago of virtual islands and welcomes people with a wide range of disabilities—everything from Down syndrome to PTSD to manic depression. What unites its members, Alice told me, is their sense of not being fully included in the world. While she was starting Virtual Ability, Alice also embarked on a real-life move: to the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee from Colorado, where she’d outlived her long-term disability benefits. (“I didn’t know you could do that,” I told her, and she replied, “Neither did I!”) When I asked her whether she felt like a different version of herself in Second Life, she rejected the proposition strenuously. Alice doesn’t particularly like the terms real and virtual. To her, they imply a hierarchical distinction, suggesting that one part of her life is more “real” than the other, when her sense of self feels fully expressed in both. After our first conversation, she sent me 15 peer-reviewed scientific articles about digital avatars and embodiment. She doesn’t want Second Life misunderstood as a trivial diversion. Alice told me about a man with Down syndrome who has become an important member of the Virtual Ability community. In real life, his disability is omnipresent, but on Second Life people can talk to him without even realizing he has Down’s. In the offline world, he lives with his parents—who were surprised to see he was capable of controlling his own avatar. After they eat dinner each night, as his parents are washing the dishes, he sits expectantly by the computer, waiting to return to Second Life, where he rents a duplex on an island called Cape Heron, part of the Virtual Ability archipelago. He has turned the entire upper level into a massive aquarium, so he can walk among the fish, and the lower level into a garden, where he keeps a pet reindeer and feeds it Cheerios. Alice says he doesn’t draw a firm boundary between Second Life and “reality,” and others in the community have been inspired by his approach, citing him when they talk about collapsing the border in their own minds. When I initially envisioned writing this essay, I imagined falling under the thrall of Second Life: a wide-eyed observer seduced by the culture she had been dispatched to analyze. But being “in world” made me queasy from the start. I had pictured myself defending Second Life against the ways it had been dismissed as little more than a consolation prize for when “first life” doesn’t quite deliver. But instead I found myself wanting to write, Second Life makes me want to take a shower. Intellectually, my respect deepened by the day, when I learned about a Middle Eastern woman who could move through the world of Second Life without a hijab, and when I talked with a legally blind woman whose avatar has a rooftop balcony and who could see the view from it (thanks to screen magnification) more clearly than the world beyond her screen. I heard about a veteran with PTSD who gave biweekly Italian cooking classes in an open-air gazebo, and I visited an online version of Yosemite created by a woman who had joined Second Life in the wake of several severe depressive episodes and hospitalizations. She uses an avatar named Jadyn Firehawk and spends up to 12 hours a day on Second Life, many of them devoted to refining her bespoke wonderland—full of waterfalls, sequoias, and horses named after important people in John Muir’s life—grateful that Second Life doesn’t ask her to inhabit an identity entirely contoured by her illness, unlike internet chat rooms focused on bipolar disorder that are all about being sick. “I live a well-rounded life on SL,” she told me. “It feeds all my other selves.” But despite my growing appreciation, and my fantasies of enchantment, a certain visceral distaste for Second Life endured—for the emptiness of its graphics, its nightclubs and mansions and pools and castles, their refusal of all the grit and imperfection that make the world feel like the world. Whenever I tried to describe Second Life, I found it nearly impossible—or at least impossible to make interesting—because description finds its traction in flaws and fissures, and exploring the world of Second Life was more like moving through postcards. Second Life was a world of visual clichés. Nothing was ragged or broken or dilapidated—or if it was dilapidated, it was because that particular aesthetic had been chosen from a series of prefab choices. Of course, my aversion to Second Life—as well as my embrace of flaw and imperfection in the physical world—testified to my own good fortune as much as anything. When I move through the real world, I am buffered by my (relative) youth, my (relative) health, and my (relative) freedom. Who am I to begrudge those who have found in the reaches of Second Life what they couldn’t find offline? One day when Alice and I met up as avatars, she took me to a beach on one of the Virtual Ability islands and invited me to practice tai chi. All I needed to do was click on one of the poseballs levitating in the middle of a grassy circle, and it would automatically animate my avatar. But I did not feel that I was doing tai chi. I felt that I was sitting at my laptop, watching my two-dimensional avatar do tai chi. I thought of Bridgette in Atlanta, waking up early to sit beside a virtual pool. She doesn’t get to smell the chlorine or the sunscreen, to feel the sun melt across her back or char her skin to peeling crisps. And yet Bridgette must get something powerful from sitting beside a virtual pool—pleasure that dwells not in the physical experience itself but in the anticipation, the documentation, the recollection, and the contrast to her daily obligations. Otherwise she wouldn’t wake up at 5:30 in the morning to do it. From the beginning, I was terrible at navigating Second Life. Body part failed to download, my interface kept saying. Second Life was supposed to give you the opportunity to perfect your body, but I couldn’t even summon a complete one. For my avatar, I’d chosen a punk-looking woman with cutoff shorts, a partially shaved head, and a ferret on her shoulder. On my first day in-world, I wandered around Orientation Island like a drunk person trying to find a bathroom. The island was full of marble columns and trim greenery, with a faint soundtrack of gurgling water, but it looked less like a Delphic temple and more like a corporate retreat center inspired by a Delphic temple. The graphics seemed incomplete and uncompelling, the motion full of glitches and lags. This wasn’t the grit and struggle of reality; it was more like a stage set with the rickety scaffolding of its facade exposed. I tried to talk to someone named Del Agnos, but got nothing. I felt surprisingly ashamed by his rebuff, transported back to the paralyzing shyness of my junior-high-school days. At my first Second Life concert, I arrived excited for actual music in a virtual world: Many SL concerts are genuinely “live” insofar as they involve real musicians playing real music on instruments or singing into microphones hooked up to their computers. But I was trying to do too many things at once that afternoon: reply to 16 dangling work emails, make my stepdaughter a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich before her final rehearsal for a production of Peter Pan. With my jam-sticky fingers, I clicked on a dance poseball and started a conga line—except no one joined my conga line; it just got me stuck between a potted plant and the stage, trying to conga and going nowhere. My embarrassment—more than any sense of having fun—was what made me feel implicated and engaged, aware that I was sharing the world with others. Each time I signed off Second Life, I was eager to plunge back into the obligations of my ordinary life: Pick up my stepdaughter from drama class? Check! Reply to my department chair about hiring a replacement for the faculty member taking an unexpected leave? I was on it! These obligations felt real in a way that Second Life did not, and they allowed me to inhabit a particular version of myself as someone capable and necessary. It felt like returning to the air after struggling to find my breath underwater. I came up gasping, desperate, ready for entanglement and contact, ready to say: Yes! This is the real world! In all its vexed logistical glory! When I interviewed Philip Rosedale, he readily admitted that Second Life has always presented intrinsic difficulties to users—that it is hard for people to get comfortable moving, communicating, and building; that there is an “irreducible level of difficulty associated with mouse and keyboard” that Second Life “could never make easier.” Peter Gray, Linden Lab’s senior director of global communications, told me about what he called the “white-space problem”—having so much freedom that you can’t be entirely sure what you want to do—and admitted that entering Second Life can be like “getting dropped off in the middle of a foreign country.” When I spoke with users, however, the stubborn inaccessibility of Second Life seemed to have become a crucial part of their narratives as Second Life residents. They looked back on their early embarrassment with nostalgia. Gidge told me about the time someone had convinced her that she needed to buy a vagina, and she’d ended up wearing it on the outside of her pants. (She called this a classic #SecondLifeProblem.) A Swedish musician named Malin Östh—one of the performers at the concert where I’d started my abortive conga line—told me about attending her first Second Life concert, and her story wasn’t so different from mine: When she’d tried to get to the front of the crowd, she’d ended up accidentally flying onto the stage. Beforehand, she’d been sure the whole event would seem fake, but she was surprised by how mortified she felt, and this made her realize that she actually felt like she was among other people. I knew what she meant. If it feels like you are back in junior high school, then at least it feels like you are somewhere. One woman put it like this: “Second Life doesn’t open itself up to you. It doesn’t hand you everything on a silver platter and tell you where to go next. It presents you with a world, and it lets you to your own devices, tutorial be damned.” But once you’ve figured it out, you can buy a thousand silver platters if you want to—or buy the yacht of your dreams, or build a virtual Yosemite. Rosedale believed that if a user could survive that initial purgatory, then her bond with the world of Second Life would be sealed for good: “If they stay more than four hours, they stay forever.” Neal Stephenson’s 1992 cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash, featuring a virtual “Metaverse,” is often cited as Second Life’s primary literary ancestor. But Rosedale assured me that by the time he read the novel he’d already been imagining Second Life for years (“Just ask my wife”). The hero of Snow Crash, aptly named Hiro Protagonist, lives with his roommate in a U-Stor-It unit, but in the Metaverse he is a sword-fighting prince and a legendary hacker. No surprise he spends so much time there: “It beats the shit out of the U-Stor-It.” Hiro’s double life gets at one of the core fantasies of Second Life: that it could invert all the metrics of real-world success, or render them obsolete; that it could create a radically democratic space because no one has any idea what anyone else’s position in the real world is. Many residents of Second Life understand it as a utopia connecting people from all over the world—across income levels, across disparate vocations and geographies and disabilities, a place where the ill can live in healthy bodies and the immobilized can move freely. Seraphina Brennan—a transgender woman who grew up in a small coal-mining community in Pennsylvania and could not afford to begin medically transitioning until her mid-20s—told me that Second Life had given her “the opportunity to appear as I truly felt inside,” because it was the first place where she could inhabit a female body. In The Making of Second Life, Wagner James Au tells the story of an avatar named Bel Muse, a classic “California blonde” who is played by an African American woman. She led an early team of builders working on Nexus Prime, one of the first Second Life cities, and told Au that it was the first time she hadn’t encountered the prejudices she was accustomed to. In the real world, she said, “I have to make a good impression right away—I have to come off nice and articulate, right away. In Second Life, I didn’t have to. Because for once, I can pass.” But this anecdote—the fact that Bel Muse found respect more readily when she passed as white—confirms the persistence of racism more than it offers any proof of liberation from it. Many Second Life users see it as offering an equal playing field, free from the strictures of class and race, but its preponderance of slender white bodies, most of them outfitted with the props of the leisure class, simply re-inscribe the same skewed ideals—and the same sense of “whiteness” as invisible default—that sustain the unequal playing field in the first place. Sara Skinner, an African American woman who has always given her avatars skin tones similar to her own, told me the story of trying to build a digital black-history museum in a seaside town called Bay City. Another avatar (playing a cop) immediately built walls and, eventually, a courthouse that blocked the museum from view. The cop avatar claims it was a misunderstanding, but so much racism refuses to confess itself as such—and it’s certainly no misunderstanding when white men on Second Life tell Sara that she looks like a primate after she rejects their advances; or when someone calls her “tampon nose” because of her wide nostrils; or when someone else tells her that her experience with bias is invalid because she is a “mixed breed.” Au told me that initially he was deeply excited by the premise of Second Life, particularly the possibilities of its user-generated content, but that most people turned out to be less interested in exercising the limits of their creative potential than in becoming consumers of a young, sexy, rich world, clubbing like 20-somethings with infinite money. Rosedale told me he thought the landscape of Second Life would be hyper-fantastic, artistic and insane, full of spaceships and bizarre topographies, but what ended up emerging looked more like Malibu. People were building mansions and Ferraris. “We first build in a place what we most covet,” he told me, and cited an early study by Linden Lab that found the vast majority of Second Life users lived in rural rather than urban areas in real life. They came to Second Life for what their physical lives lacked: the concentration, density, and connective potential of urban spaces; the sense of things happening all around them; the possibility of being part of that happening. Jonas Tancred first joined Second Life in 2007, after his corporate-headhunting company folded during the recession. Jonas, who lives in Sweden, was graying and middle-aged, a bit paunchy, while his avatar, Bara Jonson, was young and muscled, with spiky hair and a soulful vibe. But what Jonas found most compelling about Second Life was not that it let him role-play a more attractive alter ego; it was that Second Life gave him the chance to play music, a lifelong dream he’d never followed. (He would eventually pair up with Malin Östh to form the duo Bara Jonson and Free.) Jonas started playing virtual gigs. In real life he stood in front of a kitchen table covered with a checkered oilcloth, playing an acoustic guitar connected to his computer, while in Second Life Bara was rocking out in front of a crowd. Before a performance one night, a woman showed up early and asked him, “Are you any good?” He said, “Yes, of course,” and played one of his best gigs yet, just to back it up. This woman was Nickel Borrelly; she would become his (Second Life) wife and eventually, a couple of years later, the mother of his (real life) child. Offline, Nickel was a younger woman named Susie who lived in Missouri. After a surreal courtship full of hot-air-balloon rides, romantic moonlit dances, and tandem biking on the Great Wall of China, the pair had a Second Life wedding on Twin Hearts Island—at “12pm SLT,” the electronic invitations said, which meant noon Standard Linden Time. During their vows, Bara called it the most important day of his life. But which life did he mean? Bara’s Second Life musical career started to take off, and eventually he was offered the chance to come to New York to make a record, one of the first times a Second Life musician had been offered a real-life record deal. It was on that trip that Jonas first met Susie in the real world. When their relationship was featured in a documentary a few years later, she described her first impression: Man, he looks kinda old. But she said that getting to know him in person felt like “falling in love twice.” How did she end up getting pregnant? “I can tell you how it happened,” she said in the documentary. “A lot of vodka.” Susie and Jonas’s son, Arvid, was born in 2009. (Both Susie’s and Arvid’s names have been changed.) By then, Jonas was back in Sweden because his visa had run out. While Susie was in the delivery room, he was in his club on Second Life—at first waiting for news, and then smoking a virtual cigar. For Susie, the hardest part was the day after Arvid’s birth, when the hospital was full of other fathers visiting their babies. What could Susie and Jonas do? Bring their avatars together to cook a virtual breakfast in a romantic enclave by the sea, holding steaming mugs of coffee they couldn’t drink, looking at actual videos of their actual baby on a virtual television, while they reclined on a virtual couch. Susie and Jonas are no longer romantically involved, but Jonas is still part of Arvid’s life, Skyping frequently and visiting the States when he can. Jonas believes that part of the reason he and Susie have been able to maintain a strong parenting relationship in the aftermath of their separation is that they got to know each other so well online before they met in real life—that Second Life wasn’t an illusion but a conduit that allowed them to understand each other better than real-life courtship would have. Jonas describes Second Life as a rarefied version of reality, rather than a shallow substitute for it. As a musician, he feels that Second Life hasn’t changed his music but “amplified” it, enabling a more direct connection with his audience, and he loves the way fans can type their own lyrics to his songs. He remembers everyone “singing along” to a cover he performed of “Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm,” by the Crash Test Dummies, when so many people typed the lyrics that their “mmm”s eventually filled his entire screen. For Jonas, the reality and beauty of his creations—the songs, the baby—have transcended and overpowered the vestiges of their virtual construction. Of the 36 million Second Life accounts that had been created by 2013—the most recent data Linden Lab will provide—only an estimated 600,000 people still regularly use the platform. That’s a lot of users who turned away. What happened? Au sees the simultaneous rise of Facebook and the plateau in Second Life users as proof that Linden Lab misread public desires. “Second Life launched with the premise that everyone would want a second life,” Au told me, “but the market proved otherwise.” But when I spoke with Peter Gray, Linden Lab’s global communications director, and Bjorn Laurin, its vice president of product, they insisted that the problem doesn’t lie in the concept, but in the challenge of perfecting its execution. The user plateau simply testifies to interface difficulties, they told me, and to the fact that the technology hasn’t yet advanced enough to deliver fully on what the media hype suggested Second Life might become: an utterly immersive virtual world. They are hoping virtual reality can change that. In July, Linden Lab launched a beta version of a new platform called Sansar, billed as the next frontier: a three-dimensional world designed for use with a virtual-reality headset such as Oculus Rift. The company’s faith, along with the recent popularity of VR in the tech world (a trend that Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR attests to), raises a larger question. If advances in virtual reality solve the problem of a cumbersome interface, will they ultimately reveal a widespread desire to plunge more fully into virtual worlds unfettered by glitches, lags, and keyboards? Rosedale stepped down as CEO of Linden Lab in 2008. He told me he thinks of himself as more of an inventor, and he felt that the company needed a better manager. He isn’t disappointed in what Second Life has become, but he, too, sees the horizon of future possibility elsewhere: in full-fledged virtual reality, where he can “build planets and new economies.” His current company, High Fidelity, is working on creating VR technology so immersive that you actually feel like you are present in the room with someone else. Au told me that he has noticed a recurrent hubris in the tech world. Instead of learning from mistakes, people and companies do the same thing over and over again. Is this the story of Second Life—the persistence of a tech-world delusion? Or is the delusion something more like prophecy? Is Second Life the prescient forerunner of our future digital existence? When I asked Rosedale whether he stood behind the predictions he’d made during the early years of Second Life—that the locus of our lives would become virtual, and that the physical world would start to seem like a museum—he didn’t recant. Just the opposite: He said that at a certain point we would come to regard the real world as an “archaic, lovable place” that was no longer crucial. “What will we do with our offices when we no longer use them?” he wondered. “Will we play racquetball in them?” I pressed him on this. Did he really think that certain parts of the physical world—the homes we share with our families, for example, or the meals we enjoy with our friends, our bodies leaning close across tables—would someday cease to matter? Did he really believe that our corporeal selves weren’t fundamental to our humanity? I was surprised by how rapidly he conceded. The sphere of family would never become obsolete, he said—the physical home, where we choose to spend time with the people we love. “That has a more durable existence,” he said. “As I think you’d agree.” Alicia Chenaux lives on an island called Bluebonnet, a quaint forested enclave, with her husband, Aldwyn (Al), to whom she has been married for six years, and their two daughters: Abby, who is 8, and Brianna, who is 3, although she used to be 5, and before that she was 8. As a family, they live their days as a parade of idyllic memories, often captured as digital snapshots on Alicia’s blog: scouting for jack-o’-lantern candidates at the pumpkin patch, heading to Greece for days of swimming in a pixelated sea. It’s like a digital Norman Rockwell painting, an ideal of upper-middle-class American domesticity—an utterly unremarkable fantasy, except that Abby and Brianna are both child avatars played by adults. When Alicia discovered in her early 30s that she couldn’t have biological children, she fell into a lengthy depression. But Second Life offered her a chance to be a parent. Her virtual daughter Abby endured a serious trauma in real life at the age of 8 (the specifics of which Alicia doesn’t feel the need to know), so she plays that age to give herself the chance to live it better. Brianna was raised by nannies in real life—her parents weren’t particularly involved in her upbringing—and she wanted to be part of a family in which she’d get more hands-on parenting. Perhaps that’s why she kept wanting to get younger. Alicia and her family are part of a larger family-role-play community on Second Life, facilitated by adoption agencies where children and potential parents post profiles and embark on “trials,” during which they live together to see whether they are a good match. Sara Skinner, the would-be founder of the Second Life black-history museum, told me about parenting a 4-year-old son played by a man in the armed services deployed overseas: He often logged on with a patchy connection, just to hang out with Sara for a few hours while his service flickered in and out. Sometimes adoptive parents will go through a virtual pregnancy, using “birth clinics” or accessories called “tummy talkers”—kits that deliver everything you need: a due date and body modifications (both adjustable), including the choice to make the growing fetus visible or not; play-by-play announcements (“Your baby is doing flips!”); and the simulation of a “realistic delivery,” along with a newborn-baby accessory. For Second Life parents who go through pregnancy after adopting in-world, it’s understood that the baby they are having is the child they have already adopted—the process is meant to give both parent and child the bond of a live birth. “Really get morning sickness,” one product promises. “Get aches.” Which means being informed that a body-that-is-not-your-corporeal-body is getting sick. “You have full control over your pregnancy, have it EXACTLY how you want,” this product advertises, which—as I write this essay, six months into my own pregnancy—does seem to miss something central to the experience: that it doesn’t happen exactly how you want; that it subjects you to a process beyond your control. In real life, Alicia lives with her boyfriend, and when I ask whether he knows about her Second Life family, she says, “Of course.” Keeping it a secret would be hard, because she hangs out with the three of them on Second Life nearly every night of the week except Wednesday. (Wednesday is what she calls “real-life night,” and she spends it watching reality television with her best friend.) When I ask Alicia whether she gets different things from her two romantic relationships, she says, “Absolutely.” Her boyfriend is brilliant but he works all the time; Al listens to her ramble endlessly about her day. She and Al knew each other for two years before they got married (she says his “patience and persistence” were a major part of his appeal), and she confesses that she was a “total control freak” about their huge Second Life wedding. In real life, the man who plays Al is a bit older than Alicia—51 to her 39, with a wife and family—and she appreciates that he has a “whole lifetime of experiences” and can offer a “more conservative, more settled” perspective. After their Second Life wedding, everyone started asking whether Alicia and Al planned to have kids. (Some things remain constant across virtual and actual worlds.) They adopted Abby four years ago, and Brianna a year later, and these days their family dynamic weaves in and out of role-play. When Brianna joined their family, she said she wanted more than “just a story,” and sometimes the girls will interrupt role-play to say something about their real adult lives: guy trouble or job stress. But it’s important to Alicia that both of her daughters are “committed children,” which means that they don’t have alternate adult avatars. While Alicia and Al share real-life photos with each other, Alicia told me, “the girls generally don’t share photos of themselves, preferring to keep themselves more childlike in our minds.” For Christmas in 2015, Al gave Alicia a “pose stand,” which allows her to customize and save poses for her family: she and Al embracing on a bench, or him giving her a piggyback ride. Many of Alicia’s blog posts show a photograph of her family looking happy, often accompanied by a note at the bottom. One such note reads: “Btw, if you want to buy the pose I used for this picture of us, I put it up on Marketplace.” In one post, beneath a photograph of her and Al sitting on a bench, surrounded by snowy trees, cuddling in their cozy winter finery, she admits that she took the photo after Al had gone to bed. She had logged his avatar back on and posed him to get the photo just as she wanted. To me, posing illuminates both the appeal and the limits of family role-play on Second Life: It can be endlessly sculpted into something idyllic, but it can never be sculpted into something that you have not purposely sculpted. Though Alicia’s family dynamic looks seamless—a parade of photogenic moments—a deep part of its pleasure, as Alicia described it to me, seems to involve its moments of difficulty: when she has to stop the girls from bickering about costumes or throwing tantrums about coming home from vacation. In a blog post, Alicia confesses that her favorite time each evening is the “few minutes” she gets alone with Al, but even invoking this economy of scarcity—appealing for its suggestion of obligation and sacrifice—feels like another pose lifted from real-world parenting. Last year, Alicia and Al adopted two more children, but found it problematic that the new kids wanted “so much, so fast.” They wanted to call Alicia and Al Mom and Dad right away, and started saying “I love you so much” from the very beginning. They had a desire for intense, unrelenting parenting, rather than wanting to weave in and out of role-play, and constantly did things that demanded attention, like losing their shoes, jumping off the roof, climbing trees they couldn’t get down from, and starting projects they couldn’t finish. Basically, they behaved more like actual kids than like adults pretending to be kids. The adoption lasted only five months.  There’s something stubbornly beautiful about Alicia’s Second Life family, all four of these people wanting to live inside the same dream. And there’s something irrefutably meaningful about the ways Alicia and her children have forged their own version of the intimacies they’ve been denied by circumstances. But their moments of staged friction (the squabbling, the meltdowns) also illuminate the claustrophobia of their family’s perfection. Perhaps Second Life families court the ideals of domesticity too easily, effectively short-circuiting much of the difficulty that constitutes family life. Your virtual family will never fully reach beyond your wildest imagining, because it’s built only of what you could imagine. One evening during the earliest days of my Second Life exploration, I stood with my husband outside a barbecue joint in (offline) Lower Manhattan and asked him: “I mean, why isn’t Second Life just as real as ‘real life’?” He reached over and pinched my arm, then said, “That’s why it’s not as real.” His point wasn’t just about physicality—the ways our experiences are bound to our bodies—but about surprise and disruption. So much of lived experience is composed of what lies beyond our agency and prediction, beyond our grasp, beyond our imagining. In the perfected landscapes of Second Life, I kept remembering what a friend had once told me about his experience of incarceration: Having his freedom taken from him meant not only losing access to the full range of the world’s possible pleasure, but also losing access to the full range of his own possible mistakes. Maybe the price of a perfected world, or a world where you can ostensibly control everything, is that much of what strikes us as “experience” comes from what we cannot forge ourselves, and what we cannot ultimately abandon. Alice and Bridgette already know this, of course. They live it every day. In Second Life, as elsewhere online, afk stands for “away from keyboard,” and during the course of his ethnographic research, Tom Boellstorff sometimes heard residents saying that “they wished they could ‘go afk’ in the actual world to escape uncomfortable situations, but knew this was not possible; ‘no one ever says “afk” in real life.’ ” This sentiment inspired what Boellstorff calls the “afk test”: “If you can go ‘afk’ from something, that something is a virtual world.” Perhaps the inverse of the afk test is a decent definition of what constitutes reality: something you can’t go afk from—not forever, at least. Philip Rosedale predicted that the physical world would become a kind of museum, but how could it? It’s too integral to our humanity to ever become obsolete, too necessary to our imperfect, aching bodies moving through it. Did I find wonder in Second Life? Absolutely. When I sat in a wicker chair on a rooftop balcony, chatting with the legally blind woman who had built herself this house overlooking the crashing waves of Cape Serenity, I found it moving that she could see the world of Second Life better than our own. When I rode horses through the virtual Yosemite, I thought of how the woman leading me through the pines had spent years on disability, isolated from the world, before she found a place where she no longer felt sidelined. That’s what ultimately feels liberating about Second Life—not its repudiation of the physical world, but its entwinement with that world, their fierce exchange. Second Life recognizes the ways that we often feel more plural and less coherent than the world allows us to be. Some people call Second Life escapist, and often its residents argue against that. But for me, the question isn’t whether or not Second Life involves escape. The more important point is that the impulse to escape our lives is universal, and hardly worth vilifying. Inhabiting any life always involves reckoning with the urge to abandon it—through daydreaming; through storytelling; through the ecstasies of art and music, or hard drugs, or adultery, or a smartphone screen. These forms of “leaving” aren’t the opposite of authentic presence. They are simply one of its symptoms—the way love contains conflict, intimacy contains distance, and faith contains doubt.",2017-11-10 10:30:50,The Digital Ruins of a Forgotten Future,computers and the internet,1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

It has only been five days since a gunman walked into a place of worship in Texas and opened fire, killing 26 people. But America is already moving on. If you look at the online pages of most major national news outlets, the mass shooting at the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church is no longer anywhere close to the top news. On Google Trends, it’s no longer among the top 50 topics that people are searching for. We’ve seen this before — just a bit over a month ago, in fact. In October, a gunman killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas. The shooting drew national attention for a few days, and then the country moved on. Within a week, searches for information about the shooting dropped to a fraction of what they were before. This, it seems, is just how the US deals with the worst shootings now. Some thoughts and prayers for the first couple of days. Some big media coverage for a few more days. And then people move on to the next news cycle, even as nothing changes. Part of it may be that the news has been even faster-paced, particularly under the current White House. There’s been a wave of scandals involving sexual misconduct or harassment of women by men, from one of the country’s most famous comedians to big-time Hollywood executives. Allegations of potential pedophilia came out against a Republican candidate for the US Senate on Thursday. There were elections on Tuesday. Still, the way Americans have essentially shrugged off this mass shooting is not normal by international standards. When a man walked into a cafe in Port Arthur, Australia, and shot and killed 35 people in 1996, the tragedy engulfed that country — leading it to pass a comprehensive set of gun restrictions that led to the confiscation of 650,000 firearms. After a gunman killed 16 children and their teacher in Scotland in 1996, the UK banned most types of handguns. Mass shootings have led other countries, including Canada, Germany, and New Zealand, to take similar action. This is how countries typically react to tragedies: horror, a real sense that such a thing must be stopped, and then some kind of action to try to stop it from happening again. In the US, we used to at least feign interest in action. After a mass shooting, politicians would propose sweeping new restrictions on guns. They would debate them for a few weeks or months. The restrictions would ultimately be watered down or fail, in part due to heavy opposition from the National Rifle Association — but at least there was a discussion. (The only major piece of gun legislation since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado followed the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, when the federal government took steps to boost the reporting of criminal and mental health records to the background check database.) So far, the Las Vegas and Texas shootings have only led to talk of incredibly mild bills that would hopefully get federal agencies to report more criminal records to the FBI’s background check system and ban a specific type of gun modification. These bills wouldn’t go nearly as far as experts and research suggest is necessary, but even their chances of passing Congress seem remote. Is that because US gun laws have proved adequate? Certainly not. Recent shootings have, if anything, exposed holes in how existing laws are enforced: In the case of the Texas shooting, the Air Force failed to report a domestic abuse conviction that would have barred the shooter from purchasing firearms. And in the case of the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting in 2015, the FBI failed to complete a background check that the shooter, Dylann Roof, should have failed because he previously admitted to illegally possessing controlled substances. And America still has the laxest gun laws in the industrialized world, along with way more guns — and way more gun violence — than any other developed nation. But even after yet another atrocity exposed the country’s vulnerabilities here, we have already begun to move on. Again, it’s worth emphasizing that America is not normal. The US has by far the highest death toll from gun violence of any developed nation, and research has linked that to the country’s abundance of and easy access to firearms. America has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) At the same time, the US has by far the highest number of guns in the world. According to a 2007 estimate, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state now torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people. Max Fisher/Washington Post The research shows these two statistics are connected. Regularly updated reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center have consistently found that when controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. Here is the correlation in international terms, showing that the number of guns closely tracks with the number of gun deaths — and that the US is a big outlier: This applies at the state level. This chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, shows a correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates: A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. Other studies have backed this up. As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” Other research backs this up. Based on international crime victim survey data put together by Duke University sociologist Jeffrey Swanson, the US is not particularly bad off in terms of overall crime and violence: Where the US is way worse is homicide — which, as Zimring and Hawkins explained, is largely due to its unusual gun problem: Stricter gun laws can help prevent such deaths. Last year, researchers from around the country reviewed more than 130 studies from 10 countries on gun control for Epidemiologic Reviews. This is, for now, the most current, extensive review of the research on the effects of gun control. The findings were clear: “The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths.” The study did not look at one specific intervention, but rather a variety of kinds of gun control, from licensing measures to buyback programs. Time and time again, they found the same line of evidence: Reduced access to guns was followed by a drop in deaths related to guns. And while non-gun homicides also decreased, the drop wasn’t as quick as the one seen in gun-related homicides — indicating that access to guns was a potential causal factor. This is the kind of data and research that pushed other countries to act after they saw horrific killings. But in the US, five days after a mass shooting, we’re already moving on.

The Punisher is easily the most violent Netflix series that Marvel has produced to date. Thousands of bullets are fired, hundreds of ounces blood are spilled, and dozens of people are killed throughout the show’s 13 episodes; it’s as brutal as its titular character, Frank Castle, a man made of equal parts mud, blood, black coffee, and bourbon. Marvel’s other Netflix heroes have all maintained a distinct boundary between committing violence and killing people; sometimes they’ve explicitly adopted a “no-kill” policy, as is the case with Daredevil. The difference with The Punisher, created by former Hannibal executive producer Steve Lightfoot, is that Frank Castle is a real-deal murderer. Castle sees the world in absolute terms, and if he knows that someone is committing evil, he has no problem ending them. As a result, The Punisher forces us to philosophically question our own personal relationships with power, abuse, sadism, and terror. The series, drenched in shadows and hazy grays, explores what happens when vigilantism goes unchecked. Fans who have been following Castle’s story from the second season of Daredevil know that he’s killing because his family was killed; The Punisher, through its excessive violence, wants to test whether there’s a limit. It wants to ponder what could happen if everyone who’s ever been wronged started acting like Castle. And it does so in a heavy, bracingly vicious way. However, in the aftermath of the October mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed more than 50 people and injured hundreds, and the more recent mass shooting at a church in Sutherland, Texas, some of The Punisher’s action sequences can feel more like deceptively simple approximations of what true depravity and terror look like. This isn’t a knock on Marvel, but rather my inability to shake such tragic real-life news combined with the way reviews work; The Punisher will be released on November 17, but its 13-episode first season has been available to critics since last month, and I first watched it right after Vegas. Rating: 4 out of 5 If the show had been released months ago, or if I’d been able to watch it when the pain of a real mass shooting wasn’t so fresh, I know I’d feel differently about its exploration of hyper-violence. But currently, The Punisher’s gun porn and luscious brutality — which the show is clearly banking on as a draw — feel like an exercise in numbness and exhaustion rather than shock and awe. The upside is that, in my aversion to The Punisher’s gun-happy nature, I found myself drawn to some truly fascinating details that might have otherwise been lost beneath its barbaric skin. The Punisher picks up after Daredevil’s second season. Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal) a.k.a. the Punisher is trying to disappear into a normal life, now that everyone New York City thinks he’s dead. For Castle, that means trying to find a low-key job and blending into his surroundings — a task more difficult than it sounds, because Castle suffers from PTSD that haunts every moment of his life. The series functions as an origin story for the character (as told through flashbacks) while also moving Castle forward from when we last saw him: offering Daredevil one last helping hand in finishing off members of the Hand, and then disappearing. Castle is still in contact with Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), now a premier reporter, but several new characters have entered his orbit, including the mystery-cracking Homeland Security special agent Dinah Madani (Amber Rose Revah) and Castle’s undercut-sporting, wartime compatriot Billy Russo (Ben Barnes). Living a low-key life is difficult for Castle because of how corrupt New York has become. Beginning with police officers and then tracing its way up to the heads of government, evil has its fingers wrapped around the spine of every institution in both the city and, it seems, America at large. Castle can’t help one person without triggering this sinister web to commit more evil. So when certain characters in his life — from both past and present — cross paths with each other and him, Castle is presented with an opportunity he can’t refuse to get back into his violent, vigilante ways. Bernthal is asked to do a lot with his role in portraying many different sides of Castle and bringing emotional depth to the character without coming off as ghoulish or campy. He delivers possibly the best grizzly antihero performance among all of Marvel’s Netflix series to date. He speaks at an octave that lives somewhere on the ocean floor. It’s gruff, rigid in the middle, not unlike the voice that Christian Bale uses when he dons Batman’s cape and cowl. He sounds as if he’s been swallowing smoke and razors, growling out pithy sentences. Add in Bernthal’s threatening physique (he looks as big as Marvel movie counterparts) and the firearm training he’s clearly had, and he’s as intimidating as any character on television. But what’s more impressive are the moments when Bernthal softens Castle and allows us a glimpse into the character’s vulnerability — especially in his moments with Karen. In Daredevil’s second season, Bernthal and Moll showed off a fine chemistry, and The Punisher taps into the special bond they have: She reflects his compassion, while he reflects her fearlessness. Meanwhile, Revah’s Dinah becomes Castle’s mirror of justice. The two don’t often share scenes, but their character arcs run parallel to one another. They both want to take out evil, but have wildly different views of what evil really looks like. And through the introduction of Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s character (which I won’t spoil here), both Castle and the series are able to explore what masculinity and fatherhood mean. Castle wasn’t always rough and damaged; war changed him. Bernthal understands this, making Castle’s prewar life seem idyllic and his post-war trauma suffocating. Seeing a man who was previously a violent, vengeful brute involuntary crumple into a messy heap of emotions is a downright uncomfortable sight, but somehow Bernthal manages to find the humanity in such a moment. The Punisher is bleak and uncompromising, but Bernthal infuses its title character with the dignity the show needs to pull off its antihero story. Beneath The Punisher’s scrim of bullets, guns, and blood is a raw look at what violence means to men. Castle’s story, of course, is at the forefront. But we’re also introduced to Lewis Walcott (Daniel Webber) — a vet who, like Castle, returns from war and struggles with civilian life due to his PTSD — and Billy Russo, Castle’s best friend from the Marines, who masks his violent tendencies with a sleek haircut and well-cut suits. There are also higher-ups, the men calling the shots in the armed forces, who we learn have engaged in deadly cover-ups during Castle’s time in the armed forces who are now sitting in powerful positions. All of these men happen to be white. In particular, Walcott’s storyline feels like it easily could exist in reality, and Webber is fantastically frightening in the role. Walcott is confused and trapped in his own mind. Downtrodden and frustrated by a government that he believes has forgotten him, he lashes out at everyone with violence — hoping that people will see these acts, join him, and help reset the institutions and government that he feels have gone so awry. He can’t find a job and his country won’t take care of him, so he falls back on what he knows he’s good at: violence, brutality, and an eternal readiness to kill. The Punisher also explores how we perceive terror. Without giving too much away, the show plays with the idea of what we think our “enemies” look like — suggesting that we’ve been taught they’ll always be brown, Muslim, Middle Eastern — and then introduces white, male characters who are more than happy to manipulate this stereotype and abuse it for their own benefit. These men are more than happy to play up the idea that brown skin equals bad guys, casting nations of people as faceless, dehumanized monsters who are to blame for every ill. Violence against those people, the men believe, is what turns Americans into heroes. Consequently, The Punisher doubles as a fascinating, cynical exploration of authoritarian violence. The fiery gun fights and head-smashing barbarism were a major part of how the series was promoted, but the way those elements intersect with power, race, and Walcott’s crystallized white anger is a curious, welcome wrinkle. In that sense, The Punisher feels more in line with and supplemental to a couple of its Netflix cousins — namely Jessica Jones, which waded into darker topics of sex and abuse, and Luke Cage, which became an examination of the fragility of black life in America — than the gratuitously violent show it’s been marketed as. Despite its name and Bernthal’s intense performance, The Punisher is about more than just its ruthless antihero, and proves much more incisive than it may initially seem to be. The show earns its despondent and bleak tone, not just by leaning into its boiling savagery but by addressing and illuminating its characters’ relationship to violence, and specifically how its male characters use violence as a way to communicate, to be understood, to right perceived wrongs. Even when its stylized viciousness is undercut by real-world tragedy, The Punisher, like Marvel’s very best Netflix series, gives its title character a bloody good introduction.

This time, it’s for comments she made in defense of a man accused of sexual assault. On November 17, the Wrap reported that actress Aurora Perrineau had filed sexual assault charges against former Girls writer Murray Miller, saying that he had raped her in 2012, when she was 17 years old. In response, Dunham and her Girls co-showrunner Jenni Konner sent a statement to the Hollywood Reporter defending Miller. “While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story,” they said, “our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year.” “I believe in a lot of things but the first tenet of my politics is to hold up the people who have held me up, who have filled my world with love,” Dunham added on Twitter. For a self-proclaimed feminist, Dunham’s actions were not a good look, to say the least. The structure of our society and legal system is so stacked against victims of sexual assault that believing the victims is a basic pillar of feminism: If we live in a world where the standard response to sexual assault is to find a way to demonstrate that the victim was somehow asking for it, the basic argument goes, the least feminists can do is tip the balance the other way by giving victims their support as a default. As a vocal feminist and someone who has made allegations of sexual assault herself, Dunham knows the importance of believing women; as a celebrity who has made feminism part of her brand, she has profited from taking the stance that one should believe women. In fact, shortly after the first accusations surfaced against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, she wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in which she discussed a director who had sexually harassed her. In no uncertain terms, Dunham condemned “the response by the powers that be,” which she summarized as: “defend [the harassing director], question the women ferociously and take ages before letting [the director] go from the network” in “a move based less on his skill than on some ancient loyalty.” This, she concluded, was the “kind of behavior that normalizes this abuse of power.” So Dunham’s defense of Miller looked like the worst kind of hypocrisy. She was apparently willing to publicly state that it’s terrible when people refuse to believe that their friends and colleagues might be capable of hurting women, but if it’s her friend and colleague in question, then everyone should just be cool. Things women do lie about: what they ate for lunch. Things women don't lie about: rape. To make matters worse, Perrineau is a woman of color, and Dunham is a powerful, wealthy white feminist using her position to discredit Perrineau’s allegations. In response, writer Zinzi Clemmons declared that she would no longer be writing for Dunham’s email newsletter, Lenny Letter, and encouraged other women of color to do the same. “She cannot have our words if she cannot respect us,” Clemmons wrote, going on to add that she knew Dunham in college and believed her to have a history of racism. Dunham has since apologized for her statement, but the damage is already done. Her reputation has most likely taken a permanent hit. And that’s because this controversy is not an isolated incident. Since 2012, when Girls first catapulted Dunham into her current cultural status as a walking think piece topic, she has been plagued by accusations of fake feminism, white feminism, and outright racism. For many, her statement on Perrineau is a last straw of sorts, and Clemmons’s allegations about her past are all too believable. Here’s an overview of Lena Dunham’s troubled history with feminism and race. When Girls premiered in 2012, it was greeted by legions of positive reviews from critics, outrage from viewers who were disgusted that Dunham so often appeared naked on camera even though she only had a normal person’s body, and acclaim from feminists who saw Dunham’s nudity as a subversive act. And very quickly, that first wave of criticism was greeted by a second wave, composed primarily of think pieces about the show’s whiteness. Girls’ very title suggested an attempt at universality — not just “privileged white girls,” but all girls. The show positioned itself as progressive. And yet, critics noted, it was overwhelmingly white. One of the first whiteness critiques to take hold was from Jenna Wortham via the Hairpin. In an essay titled “Where (My) Girls At?” Wortham emphasized the disconnect between Girls’ skilled portrayal of the lived experiences of its characters and its simultaneous exclusion of so many of their peers: The problem with Girls is that while the show reaches  —  and succeeds, in many ways  —  to show female characters that are not caricatures, it feels alienating, a party of four engineered to appeal to a very specific subset of the television viewing audience, when the show has the potential to be so much bigger than that. And that is a huge fucking disappointment. It wasn’t that Wortham thought the show was bad. On the contrary: “It gets So. Many. Things. Right. It’s on point again and again, hitting at the high and low notes about being in your twenties, about being on your own and still so far from grown,” she wrote. But for Wortham, the fact that Girls was good made its overwhelming whiteness even worse, especially since it was set in Brooklyn, one of the most diverse places in the country. “For a show so sharply cognizant of the shortcomings of its characters,” she explained, “it is shocking that the only drops of a black girl is a contestant on a reality show (not pictured, by the way) who spends $1,000 on her weave and describes it as ‘un-be-weavable.’” “I take that criticism very seriously,” Dunham said on NPR’s Fresh Air as Girls’ first season drew to a close. She added, “Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like — not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. … I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately."" It was a mostly graceful response that had the benefit of being mostly true. After all, few people would assume that Lena Dunham would excel at writing a main character of color, much less want to see her try. But Dunham’s response also ignored a central element of the critique against Girls: Not only were the four main characters white, but so were nearly all of the show’s supporting characters. When people of color did emerge in the background, they were treated as flat stereotypes. And Dunham’s writers’ room was mostly white, meaning that she largely wasn’t hiring people who did have the ability to bring that much-sought “specificity” of experience to the table. In Girls’ second season, Dunham cast Donald Glover as a love interest for her character, Hannah Horvath. He appeared in two episodes, in what was widely read as a response to the whiteness critique (although, according to the Hollywood Reporter, he was cast before the controversy really took off). Glover’s central purpose was to give the show a lens through which to explore the selfishness and myopia of Dunham’s Hannah, a move many critics at the time treated as a sublimely subversive bit of cleverness. “[Series creators Dunham and Konner] accompanied their tacit apology with a moment that challenged not only their own and their characters' privilege, but, in its deconstruction of what has come to be known as ‘hipster racism,’ that of the show's core audience,” wrote Judy Berman at the Atlantic, referring to the ironic I’m-not-really-racist-but-maybe-I-am rhetoric that’s common among young, college-educated millennials. But as the show progressed and continued to fail to integrate characters of color in any meaningful way, Glover’s appearance began to seem less like a mea culpa on Dunham’s part and more like an attempt to have her cake and eat it too: To many, she appeared to be congratulating herself on being progressive enough to critique millennial racism, while simultaneously refusing to do the work necessary to incorporate people of color into her fictional world. “Such figures [like Glover’s character] aren’t really characters after all,” argued Tomi Obaro at BuzzFeed; “they’re archetypes, symbols, soundboards for the white characters’ verbal processing.” Dunham’s failure to meaningfully incorporate people of color into Girls spurred a widespread belief that she was, in some vague way, bad at racial issues. But that reputation might not have become quite so entrenched if it weren’t for what was happening offscreen. In August 2012, Dunham posted a picture of herself on Instagram and Twitter wearing a shawl wrapped around her head. “I had a real goth/fundamentalist attitude when I woke up from my nap,” read the caption. “Think you meant ignorant/racist,” writer Ayesha A. Siddiqi tweeted in response. “The tweet and pic are not obviously racist to most people, but should be annoying,” Feministing opined. “It’s more like casual racism — or when someone reinforces something that’s inherently racist and rather than question it, they just goes with the flow.” (To make matters worse, Dunham posted the picture just hours after a mass shooting that targeted a Sikh temple, spurring her to apologize and delete it.) Over the next few years, Dunham continued to have public moments of what Feministing called “casual racism”: no racial slurs, nothing exactly blatant, but always something just a little troubling. At the Daily Beast, Samantha Allen developed a catalog: Dunham kicked off 2013 by reportedly telling Rolling Stone that she held more sympathy for India’s “stray dogs” than she did for the “poverty-stricken people.” That same year, she joked that she was “thin for Detroit,” a comment with racist undertones that did not go unnoticed by residents of the Motor City. And earlier this fall, Dunham announced she would be touring for [her book] Not That Kind of Girl with a band of “special weirdos who [she] found on the Internet” who would provide warm-up acts without receiving compensation, despite the fact that she made $6 million in 2013. After a stern media backlash, Dunham decided to pay her opening acts and, predictably, all was forgiven. By 2016, patience with Dunham’s I-am-always-learning-about-racism syndrome was running low. So when she claimed that football player Odell Beckham Jr. ignored her at the Met Ball because “I was not the shape of a woman by his standards” — apparently projecting a sexualized and misogynistic attitude onto a black man when all he did was sit quietly and mind his own business — few were willing to pull their punches in response. “Lena Dunham finally did it,” wrote Peter Coffin. “She said something so absurd and offensively ‘White Feminist’ (read: racist, but in a feminist way) that everyone noticed.” “This feeds into a plethora of black male sexual stereotypes and white women as desired objects — even when they are ignored,” wrote Stephen A. Crockett Jr at the Root. “The way Lena Dunham talks about black men Is peak white entitlement,” wrote Zeba Blay at the Huffington Post. “Lena Dunham is probably not a bad person,” Blay added, continuing: There’s nothing wrong with acknowledging the reality of white entitlement, even if it complicates a carefully cultivated narrative of oppression which revolves largely around being an average-bodied white woman. This reality doesn’t mean Dunham hasn’t dealt with misogyny, and it doesn’t negate her insecurities and fears. But by her own admission, her lack of self-awareness, coupled with her privilege and platform, can lead to the sort of tone-deaf characterizations of black men that are ultimately more harmful than they may seem. Dunham, as is her practice, delivered a seemingly heartfelt apology, writing on Instagram, “I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies — as well as false accusations by white women towards black men.” But by now she had well and truly established a pattern of “casual racism” — and every time she returned to that pattern, critics grew less and less likely to accept her apology. And in the meantime, she was beginning to face new criticism: not just over the question of whether she was racist, but whether she was a child molester. In 2014, Dunham published her memoir Not That Kind of Girl. Shortly thereafter, conservative columnist Kevin D. Williamson wrote a long takedown of Dunham in which, almost as an afterthought, he accused her of sexually molesting her little sister. Dunham’s parents were, Williamson writes, “enablers of some very disturbing behavior that would be considered child abuse in many jurisdictions — Lena Dunham’s sexual abuse, specifically, of her younger sister, Grace, the sort of thing that gets children taken away from non-millionaire families without Andover pedigrees and Manhattanite social connections.” Here, Williamson is referring to a series of passages in Not That Kind of Girl in which Dunham describes masturbating next to her sister, bribing her in exchange for kisses, and, at age 7, prying open the toddler Grace’s vagina only to find a stash of pebbles inside. Related The right-wing outlet TruthRevolt aggregated Williamson’s claims with the full passages from Dunham’s memoir, and the story exploded. Gawker picked it up, and multiple prominent feminists wrote articles in Dunham’s defense. As they pointed out, Williamson was hardly an unbiased source: He’s most famous for declaring transgender actress Laverne Cox “not a woman” and calling for the execution of women who get abortions. And there is certainly room to argue that Dunham’s actions were not inherently sexual. “People who are attaching sex to these stories seem to equate the genitals with sex, but that's not how young children see their genitals,” Kinsey Institute writer Debby Herbenick told Jezebel. “Dunham's story is not an uncommon one.” But even people who weren’t accusing Dunham of child molestation were describing her account as weird. The passage was “to me non-predatory but certainly odd behavior very oddly described,” wrote Jia Tolentino, adding, “Oh yeah, that's some weird shit.” “Kids do creepy things but do those children turn around as adults to write about those moments like fond memories?” wrote Luvvie Ajayi. “Especially when those moments involve someone else’s private parts that you ‘spread apart.’ Is it normal to compare what you did to something a sexual predator would as a full grown person? If you’re Lena Dunham the Weird, I guess so.” And many other progressive writers and thinkers saw something much more sinister in Dunham’s actions — particularly people of color. “Do I think what Lena Dunham did to her sister was sexual assault? Yes,” wrote Lachrista Greco at Guerrilla Feminism. “And to those of you who have defended her heinous actions, YOUR voice is silencing to many commenters who openly discussed their own experiences of incest, sexual assault, etc.” “The gap between the attitudes that let R. Kelly prosper & the ones that excuse Dunham is incredibly thin,” Mikki Kendall observed in response. “Nonexistent to be honest.” “The next time Lena Dunham defenders wonder why it's so hard to destroy rape culture, all they need to do is look in the mirror,” wrote Yukio Strachan‏. At the Daily Beast, Samantha Allen argued that Dunham’s privilege was allowing her to ride out the scandal, and that it shouldn’t. “As activists, particularly women of color, question Dunham’s institutional ties to the feminist movement, the well-worn racial fault lines that have long characterized U.S. feminism are coming to the fore once again,” she wrote. “While white feminists continue to defend Dunham, seemingly out of reflex at this point, non-white feminists are tired of Dunham getting a free pass for behavior that people of color would be excoriated over.” By the time Dunham made her statement in defense of Miller this past weekend, there were several asterisks attached to her public feminist label: white feminist, often casually racist feminist, feminist who has not embraced intersectionality, feminist who potentially molested her little sister, feminist who gets more passes than she maybe deserves. Given that history, many people are no longer willing to give Dunham the benefit of the doubt for her actions. Zinzi Clemmons’s newly shared account of Dunham’s college-era racism, meanwhile, contains a ring of truth. My statement on why I will no longer write for @lennyletter, and the behavior I witnessed firsthand from @lenadunham's friends.It is time for women of color--black women in particular--to divest from Lena Dunham. pic.twitter.com/dxOWCLhTpA “She and I ran in the same circles in college,” Clemmons writes. She adds, “I avoided those people [Dunham and her friends] like the plague because of their well-known racism. I’d call their strain ‘hipster racism,’ which typically uses sarcasm as cover, and in the end, it looks a lot like gaslighting — ‘It’s just a joke. Why are you overreacting?’ is a common response to these kinds of statements.” Casual, semi-ironic hipster racism would certainly fit the pattern that Dunham has established for herself. It would also suggest that her chronic scandal problem isn’t just an unfortunate byproduct of her tendency to put her foot in her mouth, but a consequence of a more deeply entrenched worldview. And Dunham’s knee-jerk reaction to the accusations against Miller would seem to suggest that her feminism is less a philosophy to which she is committed than a brand from which she is willing to profit when it is convenient to her and abandon when it is not. No one’s feminism is ever going to be completely pure — but Dunham’s keeps revealing more and more flaws. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Meanwhile, in response to accusations of sexual misconduct against the comedian Louis C. K., distributors canceled the release of his new film, I Love You, Daddy—whose plotline illustrates the ubiquitous pop-culture trope of sexualizing young girls. International Intrigue: The leaked financial documents known as the Paradise Papers reveal that the Russian businessman Yuri Milner invested in Facebook and Twitter with funds from two banks controlled by the Kremlin—and help tell the story of how Russia’s plans to manipulate the internet have evolved. And in Spain, members of the Russian Mafia have developed powerful networks in politics and business. Here’s the story of the mob, and how investigators have tried to stop it. Tech Developments: Businesses often fail to account for the needs of aging consumers, assuming they don’t want much more than leisure or medical products—but new technologies such as “hearables” could be changing how innovators approach older people. The history of the road trains of the Australian outback sheds some light on how self-driving trucks might transform the transportation industry. And the parent company of Snapchat must dispose of hundreds of thousands of their Spectacles product after the video-recording sunglasses failed to sell. Leslie Jamison on Second Life, the immersive virtual realm once hailed as the future of the internet: Perhaps Second Life inspires an urge to ridicule not because it’s unrecognizable, but because it takes a recognizable impulse and carries it past the bounds of comfort, into a kind of uncanny valley: not just the promise of an online voice, but an online body; not just checking Twitter on your phone, but forgetting to eat because you’re dancing at an online club; not just a curated version of your real life, but a separate existence entirely. It crystallizes the simultaneous siren call and shame of wanting an alternate life. It raises questions about where unfettered fantasy leads, as well as about how we navigate the boundary between the virtual and the real. As virtual-reality technology grows more advanced, it promises to deliver a more fully realized version of what many believed Second Life would offer: total immersion in another world. And as our actual world keeps delivering weekly horrors—another mass shooting, another hurricane, another tweet from the president threatening nuclear war—the appeal of that alternate world keeps deepening, along with our doubts about what it means to find ourselves drawn to it. Keep reading here for stories of some of the people who spend hours each day in Second Life’s virtual world. The past week’s entertainment writing has shown a wide range of ways in which the makers of films and TV shows respond to the news. The director Ridley Scott is removing Kevin Spacey from his upcoming—and already completed—movie after sexual-harassment claims against the actor came to light. The debut of a new documentary series about mass shootings coincided with the Las Vegas massacre, prompting Sophie Gilbert to examine how Hollywood should respond to these types of events. And Disney retaliated against the Los Angeles Times’s coverage of the company’s relationship with local government by briefly banning the paper from advance screenings of Disney movies, resulting in extreme backlash from film critics across the country.

514,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-punisher-review-netflix/546182/?utm_source=feed,"The Netflix show, more than any other Marvel product, explores the idea that the country’s systems are fundamentally broken. The Punisher, Netflix and Marvel’s new 13-episode drama about a superhero whose superpower is killing people with guns, is debuting in a very different environment to the one the character was conceived in. When the vigilante Frank Castle first appeared in an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man in 1974, the American psyche was more preoccupied with serial killers and mob violence than with mass shooters. Punisher, a former Marine Corps sniper, turned the merciless tactics of organized criminals against them, displaying no qualms about executing gangsters. He employed what amounted to an arsenal of military-grade weapons. His accoutrements were guns, guns, and more guns. In 2017, a dizzying number of disturbed gunmen have given the imagery and mythology of Punisher an even darker resonance. In October, a mass shooting in Las Vegas left 58 people dead, excluding the perpetrator. A month later, a 26-year-old former member of the U.S. Air Force killed 26 people in a church in Texas. It’s a discomfiting news landscape in which to absorb The Punisher, whose opening credits caress silhouetted weaponry as brazenly as James Bond title sequences undulate around women’s bodies. But the show seems to have anticipated this line of criticism. Compared to the first appearance of Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle/Punisher in Season 2 of Daredevil—where he executed mob bosses and underlings with brutal, surgical revenge, and tried to provoke Daredevil into committing murder—The Punisher mostly resists fetishizing gun violence. Steve Lightfoot, its creator (and a veteran of the NBC show Hannibal), clearly wants to add shades of gray to his hero’s black-and-white worldview. Frank is a ruthless vigilante who imposes his own, bloody justice on the world, but the show twists itself into knots trying to both critique and justify his moral code. Hardcore fans of the comic-book Punisher, who include a large number of veterans and cops, love him because he’s simple. He takes no prisoners; he embodies eye-for-an-eye vengeance. The Punisher, though, wants to emphasize that it’s more complicated—that Frank’s bleak agenda springs directly from the fact that all the systems he encounters are fundamentally broken. So it largely eschews the institutions of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to root itself much more doggedly in the real world, focusing on the American military, defense contractors, and the CIA. It often feels like a grittier Homeland, with a new character, Dinah Madani (Amber Rose Revah), an ambitious Iranian American DHS agent recently returned from Kandahar, and a hacker-turned-whistleblower (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) who’s in hiding. Frank’s closest ally is Curtis (Jason R. Moore), who served alongside him in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who runs a therapy group for veterans. The first few episodes go deep on the sense of isolation and alienation these returning soldiers feel. “I just know that I fought for this country and it’s got no place for me,” one man says. “I don’t know what the rules are anymore.” It’s a fascinating indictment of the American government, which, the show argues, trains young men as killers and then casts them aside. Without reliable institutions to believe in, The Punisher suggests, people create their own, and the series emphasizes that nothing should be beyond scrutiny. Dinah’s mother, Farah (Shohreh Aghdashloo), tells her that her father’s belief in God doesn’t mean he can’t see the flaws in his religion. Hackers leak information in the hope of exposing officially sanctioned criminal acts and coverups. And Frank, whose family was murdered in a three-way mob fight organized by his own commanding officer, avenges them by bypassing the justice system, seeking out and eliminating organized criminals wherever he finds them. “The system let Frank down in a big way,” Curtis explains at one point. “So he did what he was trained to do.” What makes The Punisher most interesting, though, is that it’s clear Frank finds pleasure in killing. It’s the logical extension of all his years of training, the manifestation of his id, and it makes the most violent scenes more disturbing than heroic. The show’s most gripping set pieces resemble first-person shooter games, where Frank ducks and dives through dark rooms and wooded landscapes. It’s a lot like the John Wick franchise, where the thrill of watching is experiencing the action almost first-hand, and like John Wick, Frank is an eminently skilled professional with a very simple mission: revenge. But where John Wick invented a superhero, crafted his universe, and detailed the entirety of his mission in a tightly paced 90 minutes, The Punisher has upwards of 11 hours to do the same thing, and all too often it’s a plodding slog. Bernthal’s performance somehow finds energy in Frank’s pain—there aren’t too many actors who could make a character with such a one-note emotional range feel compelling. Still, the narrative progression of the first six episodes could easily be condensed into two hours of television without excising anything more than extraneous shots of people looking at things. You’d still have Frank beating bullies into mulch with Chekhov’s sledgehammer, Frank pulling off a daring weapons heist to the soundtrack of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love,” Frank scowling and reading F. Scott Fitzgerald in his dank studio apartment. All of the good stuff, in other words. Because The Punisher is, in fleeting moments, extremely entertaining. Frank is ferocious, tragic, and the butt of the series’s best jokes, like when the only weapon available to him is a neon-pink shotgun intended for a gangster heiress’s Sweet 16, or when a diner waitress sees his misery-beard and assumes he’s a hipster. These moments are endearing, and they add further texture to a character whose show rests on viewers finding him sympathetic. Lightfoot’s breadth of storytelling is gratifying—he wants to do more than give the cultural landscape another killing machine to idolize. It makes The Punisher less uncomfortable to watch than it could be amid so many outbreaks of extreme gun violence. But it isn’t an easy ride.",2017-11-19 09:00:49,<i>The Punisher</i> Is Rooted in American Trauma,"motion pictures,reviews,murders and attempted murders",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
515,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/11/gun-sales-havent-spiked-after-vegas-massacre-because-there-is-no-hope-of-passing-gun-safety-laws/,"In the world of firearms, it's relatively common knowledge that gun sales go up after mass shootings. But after the Las Vegas attack that left 58 dead and hundreds others injured, the owners of gun companies noted that sales haven't spiked the way they normally do. A report by The Intercept shows that in a recent earnings call, a partner at firearm accessory company Compass Diversified Holdings noted that they haven't seen the typical spike after the Vegas mass shooting because there's been substantially less threat of gun regulation in the aftermath. When asked by an analyst if the recent ""fairly significant firearms incidents"" had any effect on ""demand,"" Compass partner Elias Sabo offered a surprising explanation. ""There was a different tone being discussed surrounding gun control, and that doesn’t appear to be the case right now,"" Sabo said on the November 9 call. ""I think it’s more likely attributable to the lack of discussion surrounding change in gun laws, which I think really spurred a lot of demand post the incidents,"" he later explained. Sturm, Ruger & Company, one of the country's biggest gun manufacturers, noticed a similar lack in increased gun sales on their November 1 earnings call, The Intercept notes. Fox News hosts on Sunday promoted the idea that ""childless"" Americans should not be allowed to participate in society by voting. The idea was recently floated by Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance.            In a no-holds-barred analysis of Donald Trump's 100-minute speech on Saturday before adoring supporters in Arizona, CNN's Stephen Collinson leveled the ex-president for his ""incoherent"" ranting about unproven election fraud. Getting right to the point, the CNN analyst called out the former president as a ""sore loser"" before summing up what Americans who watched Trump on-line saw from the man who used to occupy the Oval Office before being forced out after one term.       During a CNN segment on Americans who are refusing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 at a time when cases are exploding due to a new variant, the network's media expert was asked about rival Fox News which has done an about-face and is imploring viewers to get the shots. Speaking with hosts Christi Paul and Boris Sanchez, CNN host Brian Stelter explained why the conservative media outlet has suddenly ""changed its tune"" and has been running public service announcements about vaccinations.

517,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/hero-cop-who-saved-lives-in-pulse-nightclub-massacre-is-losing-his-job-and-pension-due-to-ptsd/,"One of the first police officers to arrive on the scene at the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, FL is losing his job thanks to the after-effects of the mass shooting, said USA Today. The Eatonville Police Department (EPD) is terminating Corporal Omar Delgado, 45, just months shy of him becoming eligible for his pension thanks to his ongoing struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In six months, Delgado would reach his 10-year anniversary with the force and become vested in his pension. However, the EPD says it needs to hire a new officer right away for patrol duty, which Delgado can no longer perform after the night he spent in June of 2016 checking bodies in the dark club for signs of life and helping injured people to safety. ""The department is terminating Delgado from the force at the end of the month, Eatonville council members confirmed at a meeting late Tuesday,"" wrote Christal Hayes. ""His last day on his $38,500-a-year job is scheduled for Dec. 31."" She continued, ""An extra six months on the job would have allowed Delgado to receive 64% of his salary with benefits for life, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Since he will leave the force before making it to 10 years, he will receive 42% of his earnings, the paper noted."" Gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people and injured dozens of others on the night of June 12, 2016. Officer Delgado says that a year and a half later, he is tormented by the same nightmare each night. In it, he and fellow officers are struggling to help injured people escape from the club when Mateen begins to shoot again. Delgado and the officers around him dive for the ground, unable to tell where the shots are coming from or at whom they're being fired. He wakes up screaming, he said, in a cold sweat. “I never thought I would have gotten to this point. I thought I’d shake it off and everything would be fine,” he told USA Today. “But that hasn’t happened. Nothing has been right since that day.” Delgado says he doesn't understand the department's decision to terminate him without his full benefits. ""Just let me get vested and I will be more than happy to pack up my troubles and leave,” he said. “This is the thing I’ve been working toward for 10 years and to be six months shy then be fired, it’s like ‘wow!’” One of the people Delgado saved on the night of the mass shooting was Angel Colon, who had been shot six times. “He was my hero. He saved my life and for them to just do what they’re doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well,” said Colon to WFTV, a local ABC affiliate. “He did his job that night on June 12 so they should have his back 100% totally and just be there for whatever he needs.” Read the full report here.

518,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/11/elderly-man-accidentally-shoots-wife-at-tennessee-church-during-talk-about-church-shooting/,"A Tennessee man accidentally shot himself and his wife at church during a discussion about the recent massacre at a Texas church. Elder members of First United Methodist Church in Tellico Plains were meeting Thursday afternoon to eat a Thanksgiving dinner when the mass shooting came up, and one of them asked if anyone brought their gun to church, reported WATE-TV. Police said a man in his 80s pulled out a .380 caliber Ruger handgun and boasted, ""I carry my handgun everywhere. The man removed the magazine, cleared the chamber and showed the weapon to some other men, then put the magazine back in, evidently loaded a round into the chamber and returned the gun to his holster, police said. Someone else walked up and asked to see the gun, police said, and the man took out the weapon again. He pulled it back out and said, 'With this loaded indicator, I can tell that it’s not loaded,'"" according to Police Chief Russ Parks. He then pulled the trigger, apparently forgetting he had put a round in the chamber. The gun was lying on its side on a table, and the bullet sliced the man's palm and entered the left side of his wife's abdomen and exited the right. Both of them were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. No charges will be filed in the shooting, police said.

519,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/11/hundreds-of-las-vegas-shooting-victims-file-lawsuits-in-california-court/,"Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted and the killer's estate. The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who were either injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc, the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp, which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock's activities, train staff members and employ adequate security measures. The festival goers also alleged Live Nation was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed on Monday was brought by college student Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter's estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock's estate is set for Dec. 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting, but not in any of the suits filed on Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. ""We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun rights case,"" he said.

521,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/russias-election-meddling-is-another-american-intelligence-failure,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Dana Priest After American intelligence agencies failed to detect and stop Al Qaeda’s 9/11 attack, sixteen years ago, Congress more than doubled their budgets and gave them unprecedented secret authorities. As the
intelligence beat reporter for the Washington Post at the time, I
watched these agencies grow in size, as dozens of new buildings appeared
around the Washington region to house a ballooning workforce of over a
million people with top-secret security clearances. The National Security Agency obtained permission to collect and store
the private Internet correspondence and cell-phone data of millions of
Americans. The F.B.I. was granted the power to obtain citizens’ banking,
library, and phone records without court approval. The C.I.A. opened
secret prisons abroad where they tortured terrorist suspects. Local
police departments began employing military-grade weapons, armored
vehicles, and cell-phone-tracking devices. All these measures, and many more, were put in place in the name of
national security. And yet, last year, these vastly larger agencies
failed to defend, or even warn, the American public against the most
audacious Russian covert operation toward the United States since the
end of the Cold War. Only after the fact, when a Russian disinformation
campaign had already tainted the 2016 Presidential election, did the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence, another vast post-9/11
creation, disclose the Kremlin’s interference. The unclassified January,
2017, report, made public by the O.D.N.I., included only the thinnest of
evidence, leaving many people wondering if it were true. Whether the
Russian campaign actually changed the outcome of the election is
impossible to know, but it clearly succeeded at exacerbating political
divisions in the United States and undermining the credibility of the
results. Unlike 9/11, the Russian campaign did not occur without warning on a
quiet fall day. Rather, it unfolded over at least six months on
Americans’ social-media accounts—hardly the stuff of spy novels. Kremlin
leaders had signalled their plans years in advance. The Russian playbook
wasn’t a secret, either. It had been well documented by European
governments, researchers, and journalists after the Kremlin’s
information operations to destabilize Estonia, in 2007; Georgia, in
2008; Ukraine, in 2014; and Britain, in the leadup to the 2016 Brexit
vote. Facing one of the clearest domestic threats to the U.S. in a decade,
neither the F.B.I., which has the responsibility for conducting
counterintelligence inside the United States, nor the O.D.N.I. warned
Americans that platoons of Russian-backed automated “bots” and human
trolls were working online to amplify racial divisions and
anti-government conspiracy theories. The F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew
McCabe, admitted in a CNBC interview on October 4th that the U.S.
intelligence community “should have predicted” the attacks “with more
clarity, maybe, than we did.” “When you overlay these attacks onto what
we’ve known on our counterintelligence side about the Russians for many
years, it completely fits into their playbook,” he went on. “This
ability to insert themselves into our system, to sow discord and social
and political unrest, is right up their alley, and it’s something we
probably should have seen.” In a recent interview, a senior intelligence
official who was given permission to speak with me, agreed. “He’s
spot-on,” the official, who asked not to be named, said of McCabe. John Brennan, who served as the C.I.A. director from 2012 to 2016, has
said that there was no way for U.S. intelligence officials to have seen
such a Russian effort coming. “People have criticized us and the Obama
Administration for not coming out more forcefully in saying it,” he said
at a national-security forum in Aspen in July. “There was no playbook
for this.” Many members of the intelligence community, or I.C., as the collective
agencies are known, blame President Obama for being reluctant to
publicly criticize the Russian campaign during the 2016 election. But,
by law, the intelligence chiefs must also keep congressional
intelligence-committee members briefed on major threats to national
security—yet it doesn’t look as if they gave the representatives many
details either. Instead, members of Congress seemed as surprised as the
rest of us when they learned about Russia’s social-media presence from
recent testimony by Facebook and Twitter. Max Bergmann, who worked at
the State Department until 2017, and had access to classified
reports on the Russia activities, described the problem to me as “a
failure of imagination. Everyone was guilty of the same sin.” I don’t think even that sentiment captures the scope of the failure, and
neither do the foreign officials and experts who watched the Russian
effort unfold in the United States. A senior European diplomat, who
asked not to be identified, told me recently that the two years that
passed between Russia’s cyberattacks on the Ukrainian elections and the
2016 U.S. election “should have been enough to alert U.S. officials.” Among the first to document Russia’s online disinformation tactics was
Olga Yurkova, a thirty-two-year-old journalist who recently graduated
from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy School of
Journalism. On March 1, 2014, Yurkova watched on television and online
as armed men in unmarked uniforms occupied Crimea. Russian media named
them “polite people.” Yurkova and her university colleagues, steeped in
previous Russian disinformation operations in the Baltics and elsewhere,
knew better. “Their lies were so blatant that all Ukrainian journalists were
speechless with shock,” Yurkova told me from Kiev. “As responsible
journalists, we had to do something with this.” The following day,
Yurkova created a Web site called StopFake.org, which is dedicated to
debunking fake news and identifying Russian disinformation. The article
announcing the launch of the site, and its mission, was shared thirteen
thousand times on Twitter within two hours, Yurkova told me by e-mail.
Readers quickly began sending in bogus stories, and soon were even
trying to debunk articles themselves. Every day, StopFake’s team combed
Russian- and English-language media for suspicious content. They checked
the veracity of sources cited, the accuracy of translations, the
validity of numbers and statistics, and the authenticity of photos and
videos. Sometimes, they made phone calls to people quoted in a story, or
cross-checked facts with laws and regulations. It often took weeks to refute false articles with convincing evidence. “We have been working for three years to inform very
diverse people about why they should consider this problem, how they can
reduce the impact of propaganda, and what are the possible ways of
countering propaganda as a phenomenon,” Yurkova said. Although StopFake
now publishes in eleven languages and has thirty employees, the
organization still operates on a shoestring budget: two hundred and
twenty-five thousand dollars in 2016, compared to an over-all U.S.
intelligence budget of seventy billion dollars. StopFake doesn’t have an
office, and, to save money, all of its workers use their personal
computers and communicate via Facebook. Another research center whose work is public is the Strategic
Communications Centre of
Excellence, a NATO-affiliated
organization housed in a boxy white building, which I visited last
spring in Riga, Latvia. The center’s 2014 report on Russia’s campaign
against Ukraine identified the same themes that the Kremlin would use
against the United States two years later. “Russia media has
systematically cultivated a feeling of fear and anxiety,” the report
found. The Presidential Administration, a Kremlin office under the
direct authority of Vladimir Putin, “controls a large number of bloggers
and trolls in the social media to spread information supporting Russia’s
narrative and to silence opponents.” The report said that the bloggers
use false personas and identities to flood Facebook and Twitter
discussions. Another analyst who publicly identified Russian disinformation tactics
more than two years ago is the former journalist Ben Nimmo, now an
Edinburgh-based propaganda expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Nimmo first noticed
Kremlin-linked social media interfering in Western democratic processes
during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and he says that they
remain active in the U.S. today. “The structures that are in place are still operating,” Nimmo said. The
hundreds of fake accounts that Facebook and Twitter recently identified
as Russian-created, he warned, “are like cannon fodder. The Russians use
them and just throw them away and create new ones.” Yet the intelligence
community remains silent, as if the Russians had gone away. I found at least a dozen other institutes that appeared to be producing
groundbreaking work. Mark Laity, the director of strategic
communications at NATO military headquarters, lauded the work of
research groups. “They’ve very often done far better than officialdom,”
he told me. “They’re producing product that is superb.” None of the work of these non-government researchers is conducted using
surveillance systems, supercomputers, or subpoena power. Nothing the
public researchers do is classified. And that is precisely the problem.
Government analysts have always viewed open-source information, or
OSINT, as it is called in the intelligence world, as a poor substitute
for classified information. Intelligence officials often dismiss the
importance of public pronouncements by foreign leaders, actions recorded
by journalists, data collected by university professors, and discussions
at open conferences. It is a decades-old problem. In 2002, the practice
helped blind U.S. intelligence officials to the International Atomic
Energy Agency’s evidence that Iraq did not actually possess weapons of
mass destruction. In 2010, it blinded them again to the Arab Spring
revolutions brewing across the Middle East. Devaluing OSINT has become a
more significant problem as Russia and China use social media as an
arena to wage disinformation operations. Unless F.B.I. agents and American intelligence officers get over this bias,
they will continue asking for special powers to snoop on Internet users
in ways that should not be allowed. If they are denied their
surveillance requests, they will likely throw up their hands and say
that they then can’t help fix the problem. (The F.B.I. declined to
comment for this article.) Russian disinformation operations in the United States continue
unabated. Leaving a recent closed-door hearing on the Russian campaign,
the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican
from North Carolina, told reporters, “You can’t walk away from this and
believe that Russia’s not currently active.” The senior intelligence official I interviewed expressed the same
concern. “I don’t think we’ve seen a change at all in Russian activity,”
she told me. “They are still trying to use race, religion, Democrats,
Republicans, E.U., NATO issues as a division. They are still on social
media in every way. There’s no change.” The official expressed worry
because there has been no intense public debate in the United States, as
there has been in the Baltics and Ukraine, about how to respond to
Russian disinformation. “I don’t think we’ve been through the same
national conversation as Ukraine and other countries to say we will use
everything we can to defend against it,” she said. To see the ongoing Russia disinformation campaign for myself, one day in
late September, I went to the Alliance for Securing Democracy’s new
public dashboard of trending stories on six hundred Kremlin-oriented or
-influenced Twitter accounts. That day, they included claims that the
United States is helping ISIS in Syria, conspiracies about the Las Vegas
mass shooting, and an attack on the actor Morgan Freeman for launching
the Committee to Investigate Russia. The Freeman post—with the headline
“Morgan Freeman Psy-Op Proves How Desperate the Deep State Has
Become,”—was the most popular. The 9/11 attacks were followed by a cascade of investigative journalism,
congressional committees, and special panels that uncovered damning
evidence of the I.C.’s failure to detect the plot and warn the public
beforehand. This pattern could repeat itself soon in the Russian
debacle. It doesn’t matter that President Trump believes that the
allegations are a hoax perpetrated by the media and Democrats. It
doesn’t matter that he believes Putin when the Russian leader told him
this weekend that he did not meddle in the American elections. It
doesn’t matter because the press and Congress are still free to do what
they are empowered and protected by the Constitution to do—hold the
executive branch accountable. To avoid long drawn-out investigations and the wasting of even more
time, the I.C. should remember two of the most important lessons that
emerged after 9/11: it is unwise to conceal the truth and to pretend
that all is well. Instead, the director of National Intelligence, Daniel
Coats, one of the few members of the Trump Cabinet whose reputation for
independence is still intact, could quickly deliver to the public the
details of the Russian disinformation effort—minus only the most
perishable sources and methods. He could commission educational
materials, like those on StopFake’s Web site, that help the public spot
online disinformation. He could disclose to Congress the weaknesses in
the I.C.’s capabilities, and make the case for rearranging resources to
combat this not-so-new threat. Members of Congress should pay special
attention to the F.B.I., which conducts counterintelligence in the
United States but which, according to most insiders I interviewed
recently, is not up to the job of detecting and countering Russian
disinformation. If Coats doesn’t take these steps, then Congress should do so. There is
no time to waste. As the senior intelligence officer told me recently,

522,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/jordan-kleppers-comic-conspiracy,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Andrew Marantz Shortly before “The Colbert Report” premièred, in 2005, Stephen Colbert claimed that he would play a generic cable-news blowhard, a character drawn from a variety of sources—the “manliness” of NBC’s Stone Phillips, the “folksiness” of CNN’s Aaron Brown, the “commonsense” simplicity of MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. After a while, Colbert acknowledged the simpler truth: he was essentially doing a Bill O’Reilly impression. On air, Colbert started referring to O’Reilly as Papa Bear, and Papa Bear, though hardly known for easygoing self-effacement, seemed to take the ribbing relatively well. The two men formed a mutual-deprecation society, trading barbs and, eventually, guest appearances on each other’s shows. At the time, this felt transgressive—an infiltrator in enemy territory!—but, in retrospect, it seems almost inevitable. After all, Colbert and O’Reilly were in the same business. Both filmed basic-cable talk shows from studios in midtown Manhattan; both drew paychecks from multinational corporations; both, despite their political and stylistic differences, aspired to plausibility. These days, the spectrum of media weirdness extends well beyond cable news. Since September, Colbert’s former time slot has been occupied by Jordan Klepper, another tall, coiffed white guy with a perennially cocked eyebrow. He, too, plays a blowhard anchor named for himself; he, too, has invoked multiple influences. In an interview with Seth Meyers, Klepper said that the target of his show, “The Opposition,” would be “this alt-media landscape . . . this world of paranoid conspiracy that suddenly filters its way down into the mainstream and into the Oval Office.” He mentioned Breitbart News and The Blaze, Glenn Beck’s network. But Klepper has never been coy about his primary inspiration: Alex Jones, the founder and Cassandra-in-chief of the alternative-media network InfoWars. Jones, for anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock ceiling in a subterranean doomsday bunker, is America’s foremost conspiracy barker. (Or maybe I should modify that with “full-time,” to exclude such Twitter hobbyists as Louise Mensch and the President.) His show is taped at an undisclosed location in Austin, Texas. He sits at a wide desk covered with stacks of paper—articles printed out from the Internet—and, as he riffles through pages, he is sometimes filmed from above, his hands framed as if he were a concert pianist. (The camera doesn’t linger on the fine print, which Jones has a habit of misrepresenting.) And, whereas O’Reilly was a crotchety, old-school social conservative, Jones is something more unpredictable—a bug-eyed, perspiring insurrectionary who blows right past mansplaining into panicked incredulity. You’ve never heard of the FEMA death camps? Human-insect chimeras? No? Really? Well, look it up, folks, there’s no time to explain; the globalists are planning a coup, we’re on the brink of tyranny, and the only answer to 1984 is 1776. And so on, for several hours a day, six days a week. Jones treats facts the way cats treat small rodents, batting them around for a few minutes before butchering them for sport. And yet, if we’re being honest, his delivery is among the best in the business. His voice is a mellifluous yawp, at once abrasive and mesmerizing, with the dynamic range of a slain-in-the-Spirit preacher. Klepper doesn’t have Jones’s pipes, but his vocal performance strikes an analogous tone—unnecessarily loud and full of unearned bravado. Acting is an underrated skill in news satire—perhaps because Jon Stewart, the twenty-first-century standard-bearer, wasn’t all that good at it—but Klepper, who trained at Second City and the Upright Citizens Brigade, is as much a performer as he is a comedian. He has the dexterity to deliver absurdist one-liners—“Birds are smart; they’re nature’s dolphins”—while grounding his performance just enough to make it incredible in the “I can’t believe it!” sense, not in the “I don’t believe it” sense. “The Opposition” appears on Comedy Central, which has placed satirical ads in dozens of New York City subway stations (“THERE’S HYDROGEN IN THE WATER”). InfoWars doesn’t spend much money on traditional meatspace ads, but, if it did, it certainly wouldn’t put them in New York. “The Alex Jones Show” doesn’t appear on any TV channel; it streams on Periscope and on Jones’s Web site. Jones’s most inspired rants—a representative fan favorite builds to the line “I don’t like ’em putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin’ frogs gay!”—often go viral on YouTube, where he has more than two million subscribers. Jones calls his broadcasts “transmissions,” as in, “If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.” This is a dramatic way of announcing that he is, as Internet marketers say, platform agnostic. Jones has advertisers, but most of his revenue comes from his brand of dietary supplements, such as Anthroplex and Survival Shield X-2, which he hawks relentlessly. In one ad for a water filter, Jones said, “You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things, and kidnap people for funds. We promote, in the free market, the products we use that are about preparedness. That’s how we fund this revolution against the New World Order.” In other words, don’t expect Klepper and Jones to start appearing on each other’s shows. Unlike Colbert and O’Reilly, they aren’t really in the same business. Epistemologically speaking, one wonders whether they are in the same universe. In Klepper’s première episode, he fidgeted in his chair and beckoned urgently at the camera. “This is the first minute of the first episode of ‘The Opposition,’ and you’re already behind,” he said. People who watch too much Alex Jones—and I’m one of them—noticed many familiar visual tropes: glitches and static; Orwellian banks of TV screens; the wide desk covered with stacks of paper. “It’s 2017, and you don’t have to rely only on the Big News Industrial Complex for your facts anymore,” Klepper continued. “You get facts from your phone, your computer, your intracranial chip implant. My what? Exactly.” This air of manufactured dread is sometimes spot on, especially when Klepper pivots to advertising Emergency Panic Rations, available for sale at shopposition.com. At other times, the show’s approach can feel more generic. Most episodes start with Klepper, in front of a crazy-person vision board full of thumbtacks and red twine, saying some version of “I’ve finally figured it out,” before making an incongruous connection between, say, autumn leaves and Communism. This is the sort of thing that happens in conspiracy-theory movies, not on InfoWars. What Jones actually says is stranger and more interesting than any cliché, and when Klepper points this out his punches land clean. In a segment explaining the disconnect between his previous comedic persona, as a liberal, and his new one, as a constitutionalist patriot, Klepper said, “If you see me, in an interview or a deposition, say that I’m playing a character, that’s because in that moment I’m simply playing a character who, to throw them off the scent, would say that he’s playing a character.” In April, during a custody battle between Jones and his ex-wife, Jones’s lawyer argued that Jones is “a performance artist,” and that his outlandish behavior on InfoWars shouldn’t be construed as evidence that he is an unfit parent. On his show, Jones reported that his legal defense was fake news. “They play these semantical lawyer games, ladies and gentlemen—it’s ridiculous,” he said. “We’re defending the border, we’re defending the Second Amendment, we’re defending people’s right to not be forcibly infected with vaccines or be made to eat G.M.O.s. . . . People don’t know what satire is anymore.” The first episode of “The Colbert Report” included a monologue about “truthiness,” a coinage so timely that it became Merriam-Webster’s Word of the Year. We’re now in an even more confusing moment, and Klepper’s first-episode manifesto was slightly muddled. The mainstream-media “puppet masters,” he said, want to “smuggle their dangerous ideas across the open borders of your mind. I want to shut down those borders. I want to close your mind.” It was clever, but a bit off target. Twitter is full of sycophantic pundits who see each of Trump’s gaffes as a masterly move in a game of 4-D chess, but Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck, and Jones aren’t among them. For two decades, Jones’s shtick played equally well on the far left and the far right. Then Trump came along, and Jones’s brand shifted: less antiauthoritarianism, more Americana; less “Resist the police state,” more “Blue lives matter.” Jones’s problem is not that his mind is closed. If anything, his mind is far too open. It’s become a truism—with reality like ours, what’s a satirist to do? The answer is as simple as Strunk and White: be specific. Klepper is most likely to fall flat when he espouses a general Trump-is-bad attitude—a deep vein of material, but one that is already being mined by several besuited men every night at eleven-thirty—without finding something unique to say. Two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Klepper did a segment about how to shift the conversation away from gun control. It felt pedestrian, perhaps because it had little to do with the contemporary alt-media—mainstream conservatives have been steering discussions away from gun control for decades. By the end of the week, Klepper had found his angle. He mocked the right-wing tabloid Web site the Gateway Pundit for blaming the shooting on an innocent leftist and then taking too long to retract the story (“Hey, you can’t make an omelette without ruining someone’s life”); he caught Fox News anchors directing their viewers toward unvetted theories on Facebook; he played several boldly self-contradictory clips from InfoWars’ post-Vegas pontification. The shooter had connections to Islam; the shooter had connections to Antifa; there were multiple shooters; the shooting happened near a pyramid, so the Illuminati must have been involved. “What moral responsibility do we have when we inject these hasty explanations into the greater conversation so quickly?” Klepper said, turning to the camera. “These are big, challenging questions that could take a long time to answer.” He paused, but only briefly. “Or I could do it right now. It’s pyramids. It’s probably pyramids.” ♦ By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. By Ian Crouch Alex Susong Jones is definitely not Alex Emerick Jones.

Now, they've begun cropping up higher and higher in searches after major news events based on a weakness in Google's algorithm -- the inability to tell fact from fiction. ""In an ideal world,"" a Bloomberg Technology report notes, ""Google’s search algorithm should force these fake, pernicious creatures so low in search results that they are buried deep in the web where few can find them."" There's only one problem -- these ""evil unicorns"" are designed to come up as soon as massive news, like the Las Vegas attack on October 1, breaks. ""As soon as an event happens, everything is new,"" search specialist Nate Dame told Bloomberg. ""There's no system for the algorithm to filter out truth and reality."" As soon as the Vegas massacre occurred, there appeared to be a concerted effort to malign a man named Geary Danley who may have been married to Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of the actual attacker, Stephen Paddock. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings (in which, like most mass shooting and violent events, media gets a lot wrong), there was no declaration of Danley's innocence, so instead, ""in the absence of verified information, Google's algorithms rewarded the lies."" Fake news, in the form of tweets, videos and posts, flooded the top of searches. The same happened a month later, the report continued, in the Sutherland Springs church shooting just a month later as similar efforts were made to paint shooter Devin Kelley as ""antifa"" despite no corroborating evidence to support that assertion. Once again, those results were prominent in Google searches about him and the attack. ""The purveyors of misinformation are really using these methods to complicate our systems,” Pandu Nayak, a search senior executive at Google's parent company Alphabet Inc., told Bloomberg. ""It wasn't this huge problem,"" he continued. ""But we should have absolutely anticipated this, but didn't."" You can read more about Google's evil unicorn problem -- and their proposed solutions, which included hiring on of their biggest critics -- via Bloomberg.

525,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/11/most-mass-killers-are-men-who-have-also-controlled-abused-and-attacked-family/,"What do most mass killers have in common? As a researcher who studies coercive control in intimate relationships, I can point out a few key characteristics. First, they are men. Additionally, they have a history of controlling and abusing their wives and girlfriends – and sometimes other family members – before “graduating” to mass killings. Considering a few recent examples makes the pattern clearer. Devin P. Kelley, 26, who shot to death 26 people and injured 20 more at a Texas church on Nov. 5, had kicked, beaten and choked his first wife and infant stepson, fracturing the baby’s skull. In the following years, he was investigated for other charges of violence against women including sexual assault and rape. Since 1996, those convicted of domestic violence – even misdemeanor offenses – are supposed to be entered into the National Criminal Information Database and permanently barred from legally purchasing guns. However, Air Force officials neglected to register Kelley’s conviction, leaving him free to walk into a sporting goods store and purchase the rifle used to murder Texas churchgoers. A congressional report determined such registration failures happen at least 30 percent of the time. Esteban Santiago, charged with killing five travelers in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in January 2017, was previously accused of assaulting and strangling his girlfriend. Spencer Hight shot and killed his estranged wife and seven of her friends who had gathered to watch football on TV in Plano, Texas. These family-based mass shootings rarely gain the same kind of publicity as those conducted in public, perhaps because the average person mistakenly thinks they can avoid being victimized if the shooting occurs “in the family.”  From Jan. 1 to Nov. 5, 2017, the U.S. experienced 307 mass shootings, which the government defines as a shooting that kills or injures four or more people. However, not all domestic violence perpetrators who become mass killers use guns. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing along with his younger brother, had been arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who plowed a truck through a crowd in Nice, France in 2016, killing 82, and Khalid Masood, who killed five and injured 50 driving through a crowd in Westminster, London, both controlled and abused the women in their lives. An obvious question arises. If domestic violence laws were more effective, could perpetrators be caught earlier? Could they be deprived of their access to weapons, jailed when necessary and given the kinds of intensive intervention and supervision that would curb their behavior? In other words, could stronger domestic violence laws prevent some mass shootings? The laws in the U.S. that are currently used to address domestic violence were developed for attacks by unrelated people. They don’t work so well for what happens in families. A bar fight is over when the violence ends, but abusive violence in couples does not end. In as many as 40 percent of cases, the abuser assaults his partner several times a week and sometimes daily, often over many years. Most domestic violence incidents involve pushes, slaps, kicks, pulling hair and the like. If police wait for broken bones, they miss more than 95 percent of domestic violence incidents. As Evan Stark of Rutgers University points out, the seriousness of partner violence derives from the cumulative weight of all previous abuse, rather than the severity of a particular assault. U.S. law does not adequately address these “minor” violent incidents, nor the constant intimidation, harassment, monitoring and the limiting of a partner’s freedom that is so typical of violent control in couples. In 2015, England and Wales made controlling a current or former partner a serious crime. This new offense recognizes the harm that can result from an ongoing pattern of controlling behavior. A relative of Westminster car attacker Masood’s ex-wife is quoted in The Guardian describing their relationship: “He was very violent towards her, controlling in every aspect of her life – what she wore, where she went, everything.” Masood’s behavior is an example of coercive control. Coercive control combines tactics designed to instill fear, like violence and threats, with tactics that isolate a partner, degrade her and deprive her of basic rights. Eighty percent of abused women are being coercively controlled and not simply hit. In the U.K., police and prosecutors have undergone intensive training related to the criminalization of coercive control. Police have learned to use an incident of reported domestic violence as a window through which to examine the entire relationship. One of the earliest convictions for coercive control concerns a 30-year-old named Nigel Wolitter, who was arrested for vandalizing machinery belonging to his partner’s family to punish her for refusing to give him money for marijuana. As a result of their new training, police traced Wolitter’s vandalism to a 13-year pattern of dominating his girlfriend. The prosecution linked photos of injuries from his partner’s cellphone with her compelling testimony that he had “controlled every aspect of my life from where I went to what I wore, to what possessions he allowed me to own.” Wolitter received a 4.5-year sentence. It’s the pattern of enforced subordination that is the problem here, not one or two incidents. Changing the domestic violence laws to include coercive control will draw attention to serious cases of controlling behavior and obligate law enforcement to examine them more closely. According to the American nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of 50 women in the U.S. are shot to death each month by a current or former intimate partner. While most domestic abusers will not become mass murderers, early, consistent and effective domestic violence intervention might keep us all safer.

526,https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/new-mexico-school-gunman-was-ex-student-investigated-by-fbi/,"A gunman who killed two students at a New Mexico high school and then took his own life was a former student who was investigated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation last year after he asked online about buying weapons for a mass shooting, officials said on Friday. Authorities identified the shooter in Thursday's attack as 21-year-old William Atchison, who worked at a gas station in Aztec, New Mexico, and was an enthusiast of active shooter gaming websites. ""He was a single coward shooter,"" San Juan County Sheriff Ken Christesen said at a news conference by law enforcement. ""It's important to understand how focused he was, how deranged he was, in his intent."" The shooting occurred shortly after 8 a.m. on Thursday at the high school in Aztec, a town of 6,000 people about 200 miles (320 km) northwest of Santa Fe and 20 miles (32 km) from the Navajo Nation reservation. Atchison disguised himself as a student, entered the school as students got off buses, and was in a bathroom preparing for the shooting when Francisco Fernandez, a pupil at the school known for his computer skills, entered the restroom, officials said. Atchison shot Fernandez, then exited the bathroom and shot cheerleader Casey Jordan-Marquez in the hallway, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. Atchison fired randomly in the hallway before entering a computer lab and firing through a wall at students barricaded inside a closet, Kassetas said. Atchison likely shot himself shortly afterwards as police entered the school, he added. Police found a thumb drive on Atchison's body that contained a Dec. 7 message indicating he was unhappy with work and life, and he planned to attack a school. ""If things go according to plan, today would be when I die,"" the message read. In March 2016, Atchison was interviewed by the FBI, which had acted on a tip about a comment he made on an online gaming site. ""If you're going to conduct a mass shooting does anyone know about cheap assault rifles?"" FBI special agent Terry Wade said Atchison asked. The FBI closed its investigation after determining no crime was committed, Wade said. Atchison did not have any weapons when the FBI interviewed him, officials said. He purchased the 9mm pistol he used in the shooting locally and legally last month, officials said.

528,https://time.com/5011233/trump-texas-shooting-mental-health-guns/,"President Donald Trump said Sunday’s mass shooting at a church in South Texas, which left at least 26 people dead and 20 others injured, was the result of a “mental health problem,” and not because of gun laws. “I think that mental health is your problem here,” Trump told reporters at a press conference in Tokyo Monday. “This was a very based on preliminary reports very deranged individual a lot of problems over a long period of time.” Trump added that: “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation.” Earlier in the day Trump had struck a more conciliatory tone in a statement, calling the shooting a “horrible act of evil” and appealed to Americans to “do what they do best” and unite in the face of tragedy. Trump’s comments came after a reporter asked the President about gun control measures in the wake of the Texas shooting. At the joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump said it was “a little bit soon” to be discussing guns. “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it would have been as bad as it was … it would have been much worse,” Trump said referring to the armed citizen who confronted the suspect. The suspected gunman has been identified by two law enforcement officials as 26-year-old Devin Kelley. The gunman is now deceased, but it remains unclear how he died. The victims, one of whom was the 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor, are between 5 to 72 years old.

529,https://time.com/5010973/sutherland-springs-texas-mass-shootings-history/,"Violence erupted at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas Sunday when a gunman opened fire outside the building and then proceeded inside, killing at least 26 people and wounding at least 20 more. While the casualty count is still preliminary, these figures currently bring the toll of mass shootings in 2017 to 112 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database of massacres, which generally uses the federal definition in defining such incidents. That far surpasses any other year in the recorded history of modern mass shootings in the U.S. Sunday’s Sutherland Springs incident appears to be at least the fifth most deadly mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Dec. 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School claimed 27 lives. The deadliest shooting occurred in Las Vegas last month, when 58 people were killed at an outdoor music festival. Below is a graphic of every mass shooting since 1982.

          / CBS NEWS Since 1927, Time magazine has named a Person of the Year, a living symbol of the year that was. The title is not necessarily considered an honor or award; instead, Time has described its picks in terms of influence and importance. Here's every Time Person of the Year for the past quarter of a century. ""History may eventually decide that the key to Clinton's accomplishment lay in his temperament ... in his enthusiasm for people and curiosity about their lives,"" Time said of the then-president-elect. Two pairs of men shared the title in 1993 under the label ""The Peacemakers."" F. W. de Klerk, as the president of South Africa, worked to secure Nelson Mandela's release from prison. The two worked together to end the system of racial apartheid in South Africa. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accord, the first face-to-face agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The first non-Italian pope in nearly 500 years, John Paul II was known for his modernization of the papacy and his extensive foreign reach. ""His power rests in the word, not the sword,"" Time said in 1994. Citing his role in ending 40 years of Democratic Party domination in the House, Time named Newt Gingrich Man of the Year in 1995. ""Gingrich has changed the center of gravity,"" Time said. AIDS researcher David Ho made huge contributions to understanding and treating HIV. ""He's kind of a genius, you know,"" his mother told Time. ""I'm not supposed to say that, but it's true."" Intel co-founder Andrew Grove changed the way tech affects everyday Americans through his extensive work with semiconductors. Time called Grove ""the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and innovative potential of microchips."" Bill Clinton was once again named Time's Person of the Year in 1998, but this time, he shared the billing with Ken Starr, the special counsel investigating him for perjury during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Starr's investigation led to impeachment proceedings against Clinton. ""For rewriting the book on crime and punishment, for putting prices on values we didn't want to rank, for fighting past all reason a battle whose casualties will be counted for years to come, Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr are Time's 1998 Men of the Year,"" Time said. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos ""is a person who not only changed the way we do things but helped pave the way for the future,"" Time said. George W. Bush was named Time's Person of the Year after the closest presidential election in the nation's history. ""Bush campaigned for a year against partisan politics and that was before partisanship became so poisonous that it polluted every institution of government. The man who talked less about what he would do than how he would do it finds that his bet has been called,"" Time said. Rudy Giuliani was the mayor of New York during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life, taking on half a dozen critical roles and performing each masterfully,"" Time said. Coleen Rowley, Cynthia Cooper and Sherron Watkins were singled out by Time ""for believing — really believing — that the truth is one thing that must not be moved off the books, and for stepping in to make sure that it wasn't."" Rowley called out the FBI for ignoring early signs of a plan to attack the United States on 9/11. Auditor Cooper dug up $3.8 billion in accounting irregularities at Worldcom, forcing the company into bankruptcy. And Watkins warned her bosses at Enron that the company was in danger of collapse, which it did. Time's decision came nine months into the Iraq War in 2003. ""For uncommon skills and service, for the choices each one of them has made and the ones still ahead, for the challenge of defending not only our freedoms but those barely stirring half a world away, the American soldier is Time's Person of the Year,"" the article said. George W. Bush was named Time's Person of the Year for a second time in 2004, after winning reelection during the Iraq War. Bush was chosen ""for sticking to his guns (literally and figuratively),"" Time wrote, ""for reshaping the rules of politics to fit his ten-gallon-hat leadership style and for persuading a majority of voters that he deserved to be in the White House for another four years."" The good works of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Bono earned the trio acclaim in 2005. Bono, U2's frontman and a philanthropist, organized concerts to benefit impoverished nations. Bill and Melinda Gates founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and pledged a huge portion of their wealth. Time called the them ""three people on a global mission to end poverty, disease -- and indifference."" An explosion of individual content creators on the internet spurred Time's unusual 2006 decision. ""It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes,"" Time said. Putin landed on Time's cover in the final year of his first term as Russia's president. ""If Russia fails, all bets are off for the 21st century. And if Russia succeeds as a nation-state in the family of nations, it will owe much of that success to one man, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,"" the Time article said. ""He hit the American scene like a thunderclap, upended our politics, shattered decades of conventional wisdom and overcame centuries of the social pecking order,"" the article said of the then-president-elect. ""He didn't just reshape U.S. monetary policy,"" Time said of the Federal Reserve chair in 2009, a year after the devastating worldwide financial crisis. ""He led an effort to save the world economy. No wonder his eyes look tired."" ""In less than seven years,"" Time said of the Facebook founder, ""Zuckerberg wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network, thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the U.S. ""We have entered the Facebook age, and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here."" The Arab Spring and the Occupy movement jointly inspired Time's decision in 2011. ""In 2011, protesters didn't just voice their complaints; they changed the world,"" said the Time article. After defeating Mitt Romney to win his second term as president, Obama once again found himself named Person of the Year. ""He will take the oath on Jan. 20 as the first Democrat in more than 75 years to get a majority of the popular vote twice. Only five other Presidents have done that in all of U.S. history,"" Time noted. Time's 2013 choice had just been elevated to lead the Roman Catholic Church. ""John Paul II and Benedict XVI were professors of theology,"" Time noted. ""Francis is a former janitor, nightclub bouncer, chemical technician and literature teacher."" Health care workers, scientists, nurses, ambulance attendees and others who fought the devastating Ebola virus outbreak shared the title in 2014. Five Time covers featured Dr. Jerry Brown, a medical director in Monrovia, Liberia; Dr. Kent Brantly, the first American to be infected in the 2014 Ebola outbreak; Ella Watson-Stryker, a health promoter for Doctors Without Borders; Foday Gallah, an ambulance supervisor and Ebola survivor from Monrovia; and Salome Karwah, a trainee nurse from Liberia whose parents died of Ebola. The German chancellor got the nod from Time after playing a huge role in managing the Greek debt emergency and the European migrant crisis. As president-elect, Donald Trump was named Time's Person of the Year in 2016. The magazine explained: ""For reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow's political culture by demolishing yesterday's, Donald Trump is Time 2016 Person of the Year."" The ""silence breakers"" who ignited the anti-harassment #MeToo movement were named Time's Person of the Year in 2017. In the wake of sexual harassment and assault allegations made against Harvey Weinstein and other prominent men, millions of people shared stories of abuse as Hollywood, Congress, American businesses and universities reckoned with their responsibilities. The cover featured farm worker Isabel Pascual, lobbyist Adama Iwu, actress Ashley Judd, software engineer Susan Fowler, musician Taylor Swift and a hospital worker who chose to remain anonymous. In 2018, the magazine named ""the guardians"" as Time's Person of the Year. All are journalists who were violently attacked or slapped with criminal charges in an apparent effort to silence the free press worldwide. The magazine produced different cover images. One features Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. An alternate cover features the wives of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo holding their pictures; the journalists have been imprisoned since December 2017 in Myanmar after reporting on a massacre of Rohingya Muslims. Others singled out by the magazine are Maria Ressa — a journalist and CEO of a news site in the Philippines — and the staff of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland, where five journalists were killed in a mass shooting in June. In 2019, Time chose 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg as the Person of the Year. Thunberg made a splash in 2019 leading protests around the world, speaking at the U.N., meeting with the Pope, and sparring with the president of the United States on Twitter. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala are the first running mates to be chosen together as Time's Person of the Year. Time editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal writes that they were selected for their roles in ""changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world.""
