The resilient tree was dubbed the Survivor Tree after it was pulled severely damaged from the wreckage Ground Zero in New York when it was destroyed by hijacked jets flown into the buildings on September 11, 2001, killing almost 3,000 people.  The day after the 14th anniversary of the tragedy was marked in Lower Manhattan on Friday, leaders of the National September 11th Memorial and Museum that now occupies the site announced the recipients of the 2015 seedlings from the tree. This year one tree will be presented to Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where a mass shooting at the elementary school in December 2012 claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. Another will also make its way to Joplin, Missouri, where 158 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in 2011 by the most devastating tornado to hit the region for decades. And a third sapling is being given to the people of Spain’s capital Madrid to mark the deadly series of coordinated terrorist bombings of the city’s commuter train system in 2004 that killed 190 and wounded 1,800. The practice began in 2013 to pick communities each year that have endured tragedy in recent times and dispatch seedlings nurtured from the commemorative tree to be planted and cared for there. This is the first time that seedlings from the tree have been donated as an international gift – and the offering to Spain will actually be planted outside the Spanish embassy in Washington, DC. The extraordinary tree is an ordinary example of an ornamental callery pear tree, which bursts out into white blossom every spring and is a common sight in New York and many cities, known for its tall, straight growth and hardiness. “The Survivor Tree reminds us of our shared strength in the face of unimaginable tragedy. We hope these trees will serve as an inspiration to these communities and others who have suffered hardships and are working to recover,” said Joe Daniels, president of the 9/11 memorial. There were numerous such pear trees around the World Trade Center site in 2001. But the tree in question was very close to the twin towers and was buried in the rubble when the towers collapsed. Rescue workers and contractors clearing mountains of toxic debris known as “the pile” came across leaves protruding from the wreckage and pulled out the tree, which had suffered severe damage to its roots, branches and trunk. It was thought to have almost no chance of survival, but was extracted and taken to a plant nursery in the Bronx, where it gradually sprouted fresh growth and was able to return to Lower Manhattan. The tree now stands close to the 9/11 museum, the twin reflecting pools created as a memorial on the footprints of where the twin towers stood, and beneath One World Trade Center that is the flagship new skyscraper at the site. Seedlings are cultivated from seeds produced by the tree by high-schoolers in Queens, overseen by experts. Trees have previously been donated to communities including the Far Rockaways in Queens to mark the destruction wreaked by Superstorm Sandy; Prescott, Arizona, to commemorate the 19 firefighters of the Granite Mountain Hotshots killed in a wildfire; and Boston, in honor of those killed and injured when the marathon was bombed in 2013. And on September 10, the tree’s seedlings were donated to 28 fire houses spread across Long Island.",2015-09-12 13:07:33,9/11 Survivor Tree seeds to inspire resilience in areas visited by tragedy,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

But I’ve known him for years. Maybe, I thought, I could get them to listen. Chris Hurst spent the last two weeks trying not to cry on television while telling the world how beautiful his life with his girlfriend was before she was murdered for no reason. Chris was the boyfriend of Alison Parker, who was shot and killed on live television  in August by a mentally ill man who had an invented grudge and easy access to firearms. Chris is a friend from college. Chris and I hosted a radio show together. Or, according to millions of conspiracy theorists online, Chris Hurst is a part of my imagination. In the minds—and YouTube videos—of some conspiracy theorists, Chris is not a news anchor at WDBJ in Virginia. Chris, the videos say, is a “crisis actor"" invented less than a month ago by the United States government as part of a false flag operation that will eventually allow the New World Order to take away every American citizen’s guns and force them into a life of subjugation and tyranny. Every day now, Chris wakes up to find strangers’ hate on his Facebook wall that he has to personally delete. Or he’ll Google Alison to find the people he has to thank for donating to her scholarships and he’ll see, instead, another conspiracy theory YouTube video, viewed 800,000 times over, that says Alison was in on it all along, and that she’s been given a new life and maybe plastic surgery by the government. “It happened again about an hour ago,” Chris says. “It’s hard for me to manage that because I hit land mines when I do. They have all these details I don’t want to know.” The most recent one says Alison was dating someone else and that she and Chris were never together at all. That person is really Alison’s ex-boyfriend, who conspiracists found by looking through her old Facebook photos. Two weeks after he lost the love of his life in the most gruesome and devastating way imaginable, this is what he has to sit through when he turns on his computer each morning. “The hoax theories have taken a toll for sure,” he says. “I’ve definitely felt it more than anyone. I’m the one with the Facebook and Twitter page.” It is simply easier for some people to believe that the United States government has concocted a vast conspiracy to take away all of our guns than it is to believe that it is too easy for a mentally ill person to acquire one and shoot anyone they want. And now those same people are taking it out on the families of the victims of gun violence after a tragedy. The last decade has seen a boon for “crisis actor” conspiracies on the Web and—along with them—a new set of psychologists and philosophers are trying to understand how people get dragged so far away from reality. Many of these thinkers have settled on a basic premise—and it’s one that could help explain the mass-shooting-per-day epidemic in America, too. “Conspiracy theorists are, I submit, some of the last believers in an ordered universe,” Pitzer College philosophy professor Brian Keeley wrote in Of Conspiracy Theories. “By supposing that current events are under the control of nefarious agents, conspiracy theories entail that such events are capable of being controlled.” In other words, if nothing’s an accident and there are no lone wolf attacks or gunfights over petty grievances, then there is no gun problem. There is no mental health problem, either. For those who believe in crisis class theory, there are just big, theatrical attacks put on by the real problem: whoever is in charge. All you have to do is forget about the 2,567 people left dead by gun accidents, lone wolf attacks, and gunfights over petty grievances that weren't caught on camera between June’s mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the live-on-TV execution two weeks ago. All you have to do is refuse to admit, as Keeley’s same academic paper notes in its introduction, that ""shit happens.” Instead, every death—workplace death by gun, school death by gun, hunting accident death by gun—is part of a diabolical plan to control the United States, no matter what. For what purpose? The answer is unclear. But when I talk to “Thom,” a conspiracy theorist who has racked up millions of views on YouTube by telling people that Chris and Alison are crisis actors for the U.S. government, he has a much different explanation for all of it: “You’re being duped.” *** I saw the worst video by mistake. A newsroom coworker muttered, “Oh my God, is he Tweeting?” Then there was Vester Lee Flanagan’s shoddy GoPro footage autoplaying on a computer behind me, a monster walking towards Adam Ward and Alison Parker with a handgun. I couldn’t turn it off fast enough. I saw the whole thing. I wretched. I went outside to cry, like a child, like an idiot. This is the opposite of how Thom reacted. “The underground footage from the shooter’s perspective—that’s what really sparked my interest into the event,” says Thom, who refused to give his last name to The Daily Beast. “It seems odd to me that the shooter walked right up.” Thom says he was one of the first people on YouTube to bring up what he considers to be inconsistencies between Flanagan’s video of the shooting and the one that aired on WDBJ. He says that the shooter points his gun at Parker’s face for over 20 seconds. (This, by the way, is not true.) “You can count the 23 seconds he stands there with a gun in Alison Parker’s face. That sparked my interest from the get-go. You had that going on,” he says. Then Thom saw Chris mourn on television and he was convinced: These people are put up to it by the same actors who did the Sandy Hook shooting. “The reactions didn’t seem genuine to me. The lines seemed scripted. For instance, Chris Hurst would come out and say ‘We’re the cutest, newsiest, prettiest couple ever.’ Of course, he was reading from a photo diary or whatever,” he says. “You look at Chris Hurst, specifically, he would give the same answers to different reporters, word-for-word.” Thom believes it would be impossible to keep it together after the death of a loved one. It’s a reaction that Chris finds monstrous. He feels as if he’s being punished for his strength. “I cried for days, but tried to be strong on TV for her,” he says. “But because I [went on TV] and didn’t break down, now I’m all of a sudden an actor.” Still, that sentiment was enough to get 792,000 people to watch Thom’s video on YouTube under one of his channels, “PressResetUltimate.” When you Google Chris’s name, the video—“Crisis Actor REVEALED! Victim’s BF Chris Hurst”—appears on the first page of results. “I think, in the end, a lot of these groups are behind the scenes perpetrating these false-flag hoaxes in an effort to install a totalitarian government—not only in America but all over the globe,"" he says. Brian Keeley has heard Thom’s entire spiel before. In fact, he’s heard it for decades. In 1999, he wrote the book on it—well, the academic journal entry on it—that has grown prescient in the age of the crisis actor. At their core, he says, people like Thom fail to grasp a simple idea: Sometimes things just happen, often for no discernible reason whatsoever. “Just as with the physical world, where hurricanes, tornadoes, and other ‘acts of God’ just happen, the same is true of the social world,” he wrote. “Some people just do things. They assassinate world leaders, act on poorly thought out ideologies, and leave clues at the scene of the crime. Too strong a belief in the rationality of people in general, or of the world, will lead us to seek purposive explanations where none exists.” He says conspiracy theorists rely on what he calls “errant data,” or random minutiae within a terror attack or major event that can—and maybe should—go unexplained in reality. Those pushing conspiracies, however, seize on that unexplained info and attempt to explain it in full. It is an effort to connect every dot on the map—every blade of grass on the Grassy Knoll—even if some dots have nothing to with the larger event at all. “The crisis actor thing is interesting. These are people who are trying to be rational and they're presented with these grieving people. They need to make sense of that data, so their only rational explanation is, ‘Those people are lying. Those people are paid actors,’” Keeley tells The Daily Beast. “That’s the only way you can make sense of it with your own two eyes.” In other words, there's no real logic that can prove crisis-actor conspiracies wrong to people who really want them to be right. “‘Crisis’ class theory is first and foremost a phenomenon of the Internet Age, and is perfectly suited to the enormous amount of documentary evidence surrounding recent events,” writes Michael Wood. “While a false-flag scenario might have trouble explaining a particular apparent anomaly, a staged-hoax theory would have no trouble doing so.” Wood is a psychologist and lecturer at the University of Winchester and wrote extensively about crisis actors in 2013. He calls it the “future of Internet conspiracism.” And Wood’s thesis gets to the heart of why people like Thom likely believe what he does: Crisis class theory is a weirdly hopeful, terribly reductionist coping mechanism, a way to explain a world that can be unjust and needlessly cruel—but wouldn’t be if the “bad guys” controlling it all were vanquished. “There is surely some psychological comfort in believing that a horrific event like a mass murder of schoolchildren never really happened at all—that it was all fake,” he writes. Instead conspiracy theories often work to dispel bad press affecting the theorist’s own social groups. Gun owners, for example, work to implicate every other trait about mass shooters except their one common bond: access to a gun for long enough to kill several people. “We call it ‘social threat’ in psychology, and a lot of psychology is how we deal with these sorts of threats. It’s a tribal thing,” says Wood. “We see these sorts of mass shootings. If you’re a gun owner, you have a lot invested in this, yourself. You have a motivation to take this out of your wheelhouse. If all you know about somebody is that they own a gun, you’re automatically motivated to discount it.” Sure enough, Thom believes “one of the reasons why the American people have so much freedom and so much power is because of our right to bear arms that acts as a firewall or insurance policy against a tyrannical government.” Thom is nowhere near alone in this. He’s one of countless thousands who’ve descended in recent years into the weeds of false flags and crisis actors. It’s a “kind of explosion” of conspiracy theories that began popping up around 2009, according to professor Joe Uscinski. “This happens for every president. It’s not just birthers, with President Obama. In 2001, a building blows up, and some people think George W. Bush did it,” says Uscinski. “In fact, there are the same number of [9/11] truthers as there are birthers.” Uscinski wrote “Conspiracy Theories Are for Losers,” which posits that conspiracy theories pervade amongst members of parties who are out of power and feel helpless in a political tide moving in the opposite direction. Barack Obama’s election spurred countless new conspiracy theories around the 2008 election, and Thom fell into a lot of them. That year, he says he started reading up on conspiracies about the financial crisis as a freshman in college, while studying for his BA in business. “You see this scapegoating as a social phenomenon against some gun owners who stake a lot of their social identity on that,” says Wood. So they fight back. On the Internet, everything’s a false flag if you look hard enough. Now, semi-educated anonymous people believe they’re “telling the truth in a society of lies,” like Thom says. And if that’s all it was—if Thom and his co-conspirators were just spinning a comforting story for themselves—it might not be so bad. But Thom has been spending the last two weeks ruining my friend’s already broken life. Thom is crushing a victim for a second time, and he doesn’t know or care that the victim can see it. *** So then I come out with it. I tell Thom that I know Chris. I decide to make an appeal. I decide to try to stop Thom from doing all of this to my friend. I decide to tell Thom a story. Nervous, it comes out inelegantly, in pieces. It goes like this. One day, Chris and I forgot to bring headphones to our college radio show. I’ll repeat that: We didn’t bring headphones—the only thing a person truly needs to make sure he or she is on the air—to a radio show. By the end, we thought we’d pulled it off. We’d done an hour of radio without the second-most important piece of equipment! A genuine miracle! Of course, we didn’t pull it off. Since we didn’t have headphones, we didn’t realize that we hadn’t aired a thing. What we really did was turn off the whole radio station for an entire night. We pressed the wrong buttons at the wrong time. We left the studio, oblivious. The programming director brought us in a few days later to scream the words “literal radio silence!"" to us over and over again. The incompetence was staggering, and we were ashamed before it became a very funny memory. I bring up the radio show to Thom to say this: If Chris Hurst is a fake, he’s terrible at it. If Chris Hurst is a crisis actor working for the United States government in a long-term plot to strip U.S. citizens of their guns and freedom, he is the worst one in the world. I ask Thom, How would you respond to that? Then, silence. Seconds of strained, shifty quiet. “My response to that is either he’s being duped or you’re being duped. This woman, Alison, I don’t know where she is. It’s my suspicion that you’re being duped, if that’s the case. It looks like the guy is acting. It doesn’t seem like he’s being genuine,” says Thom. But what if you’re wrong? Have you considered that? Have you considered what it would be like to be Chris? I have been so respectful. I have been too respectful. I am trying, for some reason, to convince Thom that I’m not in on it, that I’m fallible enough but still professional. I’m trying not to appear to him to be part of a problem he is wholly dreaming up. I am trying not to yell. I’m trying to be the one person who says, You’re wrong, but I hear you. This way is supposed to work, the academics tell me. Listen to the lost people, and sometimes they will hear you out in return. I am being nice, still. I am trying to get him to see the life he is destroying again every morning. I’m trying not to say, How could you? I say, What if you’re wrong? “If I am indeed wrong then I feel bad for the guy. It’s a terrible tragedy. But that doesn’t mean I’m not gonna have my opinion. That’s just what I see,” he says. “If that happened to me—and it really did happen—and people were calling it a false flag or a hoax, I would disagree with them. But I would have to respect their freedom of speech.” But really, Thom, really, this is the worst thing that could happen to anyone. He watched his to-be fiancée die in an unrepeatable way. He almost evaded seeing a picture of her death until the morning after it happened, but he didn’t. He couldn’t. He saw it on the cover of the New York Daily News. He saw his soulmate shot in three frames, one alive, one bracing for a bullet, and one as she was dying, and he writes to me and he says, “I broke when I saw the Daily News.” And then he goes onto his Facebook wall one morning and someone says that she was an actor all along, or that she’s alive on an island somewhere, or that he was part of her death, or that he and the love of his life were never in love all along and this was you, Thom, and now this happens every morning, and this was you who started it, Thom, I mean, really, Thom, really. What if you’re wrong? “If I’m wrong, my heart goes out to Alison’s family and Chris Hurst, but it’s my opinion that it’s not obviously wrong.” Thom. That’s not enough.",2015-09-13 00:01:00,What Do You Say to a Roanoke Truther?,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
4,http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/criminal-justice-committees-pass-concealed-carry-on-campus-residential-gun/2245771,"TALLAHASSEE — Reigniting a contentious debate, Florida lawmakers pushed ahead Wednesday with a bill that would allow people to carry guns on college campuses. The campus concealed carry bill and another proposal backed by the National Rifle Association were the first two measures passed by any legislative committee in preparation for the 2016 session that begins in January. Supporters say the bill by Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, and Sen. Greg Evers, R-Baker, to allow concealed weapons at colleges and universities — which passed both the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee and Senate Criminal Justice Committee — is about public safety. Concealed carry permit holders, they say, could help keep campuses safe in the event of a mass shooting or other violent crime. Florida State University student Shayna Lopez-Rivas, a rape victim, said she would feel safer if allowed to carry her gun on campus. ""I resolved to never be a victim again,"" she said. ""I will not be a sitting duck for a rapist or a shooter."" But the bill (HB 4001, SB 68) has drawn ire from state university presidents and police chiefs and the State University System's Board of Governors, as well as gun control advocates. ""When I applied to UCF, I wasn't expecting to walk the halls and attend class wondering if the person next to me was trained to carry a firearm,"" said Adam Whitmer, a former Marine and instructor in the Corps' firearms training. College campuses are high-tension places. They're full of young people who are stressed and trying to learn about the world and themselves, bill opponents argue, not to mention the drug and alcohol use that's so prevalent in universities. ""Allow them to go to college in a place they can make mistakes,"" said Sean Pittman, lobbyist for the Florida State University Student Government Association. ""This is the place they become adults. Those mistakes shouldn't be deadly."" Currently, 20 states, including Florida, ban concealed weapons on all college campuses. Another 23 states allow each university or college to decide its own gun policies. An attempt to pass the bill last year stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. All but one Republican supported the latest measure as it passed out of committee, and every Democrat opposed. Supporters point out that concealed carry permit holders must undergo background checks. And they say that those who intend to commit a crime will do so regardless of whether it is legal. ""The plain truth is campuses are supposed to be gun-free zones,"" said Marion Hammer, a lobbyist with the National Rifle Association. ""They are gun-free zones where murderers, rapists and shooters can commit crimes without fear of being harmed by their victims."" Hammer was also key to negotiation on a bill (HB 41, SB 130) making it a misdemeanor to fire a weapon in densely populated neighborhood for recreation or celebration. It's also supported by the Florida Police Chiefs Association, which unanimously passed criminal justice panels in both the House and Senate. The bill was first filed by Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, last spring in response to a St. Petersburg man who set up a gun range in his yard, which neighbors feared would put them at risk of being accidentally shot. Police couldn't charge Joseph Carannante with a crime, because it was determined his intent to fire a gun wasn't illegal. Under the new proposal, sponsored by Rouson, Rep. Neil Combee, R-Polk County, and Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, he still wouldn't be prosecuted. Under the bill, people can only be prosecuted for a misdemeanor for firing a weapon if they either were not trying to protect themselves or they were acting in a way that could reasonably harm someone. One example of justified use, Richter suggested, could be ""a homeowner shooting a poisonous snake that has slithered into the neighborhood."" Contact Michael Auslen at mauslen@tampabay.com.

FSU student Shayna Lopez-Rivas, a victim of rape, said she would feel safer if she were allowed to carry her gun on campus. It’s the same argument made by Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, one of few Democrats in the Legislature who supported the bill last spring, who said she used a gun to stop a would-be attacker when she was a college student. “I resolved to never be a victim again,” Lopez-Rivas said. “I will not be a sitting duck for a rapist or a shooter. Rape and assault are illegal and yet they still happened to me.” Those who intend to commit a crime will do so regardless of it’s legal or not, they say. “The plain truth is campuses are supposed to be gun-free zones,” said Marion Hammer, a lobbyist with the National Rifle Association, which supports the concealed carry bill. “They are gun-free zones where murderers, rapists and shooters can commit crimes without fear of being harmed by their victims.” Hammer was also key to negotiation on a bill (HB 41, SB 130) making it a misdemeanor to fire a weapon in densely populated neighborhood for recreation or celebration.

Under the new proposal, sponsored by Rouson, Rep. Neil Combee, R-Polk County, in the House and Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, it still won’t be. The gun has to be fired and clear two exemptions — for personal protection or for something that wouldn’t reasonably put someone at risk, “like a homeowner shooting a poisonous snake that has slithered into the neighborhood,” said Richter.

Earl R. Casteel, 33, filed the lawsuit against Thaddeus Jimenez on Monday, according to court documents. The suit alleges that Jimenez shot Casteel in both legs in the 3500 block of West Belle Plaine Avenue on Aug. 17. Police previously said that Jimenez and another man, Jose Roman, confronted the victim, who was standing outside his car. Jimenez, a reputed leader of the Simon City Royals, apparently had tried to persuade the victim to rejoin his gang after several years of inactivity. When the man refused, Jimenez then pointed a gun at the victim's head and chest before firing into his legs, police said. Police said they spotted the pair speeding away in Jimenez's Mercedes before the car crashed about a half-mile from the shooting. Both men tried to flee on foot but were caught and arrested, authorities said. Police said they recovered a rifle and a handgun from the two men. Casteel's lawyers said he was shot while visiting a friend. The two-count suit asks for at least $50,000 in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount in punitive damages. ""When you look at the sheer amount of gun violence in the city, it shows that the criminal consequences are not a big enough disincentive for gun violence,"" attorney Judson Graham said in a statement. ""Maybe a few jaw-dropping jury verdicts for millions of dollars send the message that in addition to the criminal consequences, there can be financial repercussions, too."" Jimenez, 36, was just 13 years old when he was charged with fatally shooting an older boy in 1993. He was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison. He served 16 years before being exonerated and released in 2009. A federal jury awarded him the whopping settlement in 2012. In the wake of the August shooting, prosecutors have alleged that Jimenez has used that settlement to pay $50,000 in bonuses to bring new members into his gang. Jimenez and Roman, 22, were ordered held without bail. Jimenez also is facing federal charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm; the offense carries up to a 10-year prison sentence. Casteel himself has a lengthy criminal history and was charged with a misdemeanor for his involvement in a mass shooting case that sent his older brother to death row. Luther Casteel, now 57, was convicted and sentenced to die from lethal injection for shooting up JB's Pub in Elgin in April 2001. Luther Casteel had been kicked out of the local bar earlier in the night, and returned with his head shaved, four guns and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. Luther Casteel was convicted of killing a bartender and a local resident, and wounding 15 others. Hours after Luther Casteel was sentenced to death, authorities said, his twin brother Frank Casteel and Earl Casteel called the same bar nearly two dozen times and threatened to kill everyone inside. It is not clear from criminal records how those charges were resolved. Luther Casteel's death sentence was commuted to life in prison by Gov. George Ryan in 2003, part of Ryan's blanket clemency for death row inmates. cdrhodes@tribpub.com Twitter @rhodes_dawn CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2015-09-16 21:00:00,Victim sues alleged shooter; reputed gang leader who won $25M from city,,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

He was taken into custody while at work, his girlfriend Lindsey Fry told the State newspaper. Meek received a letter Aug. 6 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Columbia, South Carolina, informing him he was a “potential target” in the investigation of the Charleston shootings in June, in which Roof gunned down nine African-Americans at a historically black church. The letter stated Meek was under investigation for lying to law enforcement and for failing to report a crime. It also informed Meek of his constitutional right to an attorney and advised him of his right to remain silent. The letter gave him until Aug. 21 to a respond to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In this photo provided by the Charleston County Sheriff's Office Detention Center, Dylann Storm Roof is seen in his booking photo after he was apprehended as the main suspect in the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church that killed nine people on June 18, 2015, in Charleston, South Carolina.  Photo: Getty Images Roof stayed with Meek and his family in their mobile home in Red Bank, South Carolina, before the shootings. In an interview in June, Meek said Roof had complained about blacks when he was drunk and had said ""blacks were taking over the world"" and that ""someone needed to do something about it for the white race."" Meek also knew Roof had bought a gun and said that he had hidden the gun from Roof during his drunken rant until he had sobered up, the Associated Press reported. Meek reportedly told the state Tuesday that he did not believe he committed any crimes and said he called authorities after seeing Roof’s picture on TV in connection with the shootings. No one else in the mobile home that Roof stayed at before the shootings has received a ""target"" letter. Roof, 21, is facing federal hate crime charges and nine counts of murder in state court. The state has said it will seek the death penalty, but Roof's attorneys have said he is willing to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.",2015-09-17 19:02:56,Who Is Joey Meek?

My opinion is that nothing should be printed that indicates evil, cruel or false actions such as conveyed in this cartoon. No animal shelter would endorse this ... again, my opinion. Maybe a few kill shelters wouldn't even notice, but some of us who try desperately to educate the public about animal cruelty and beg for donations to save abused and abandoned animals care! DOROTHY A. DANIEL Hot Springs No humor to be found Animal abuse is not funny. Shame on you for including ""comic"" Wumo in your Sept. 12 edition. I see no humor in taking a helpless animal from a shelter to feed it to a snake. Disturbing, disgusting, and sick. ELIZABETH WINDSOR HENRY Little Rock Vote against same ol' Donald Trump announced he is running for president of the United States a little over three months ago. Well, since then, I have had someone from every major newspaper and TV news program telling me that Trump is not a serious candidate. He cannot survive his statement where he insulted the Hispanics or insulted women. Then he could not survive the comment about John McCain, then the insult to Megyn Kelly at the debates. The latest is the comment about Carly Fiorina's looks. It appears that these so-called experts don't know what they are talking about. Of course none of them have admitted that they did not know what they were talking about. Then the experts will tell you that The Donald's speeches are just rhetoric and rambling with no attention to policy or substance. Well, I watched his little rally in Dallas. I noticed he spoke to the problem with illegal immigrants (to be politically correct, I meant to say undocumented citizens). He then talked about the deal with Iran, then the trade deficit with China and Mexico. Then the tax laws that are tailored for the rich. He also mentioned what it might cost to buy a politician. Now it looked like he covered some issues that included domestic problems, the problems with our election process, foreign policy, immigration, jobs, and the trade deficit. Mr. Trump may not be the idea candidate. However, I think a vote for The Donald may be a vote against the same ol', same ol'. I think people are tired of voting for politicians that have sold their soul to the highest bidder. Politicians that tap dance around problems to be politically correct so they don't offend anyone and will tell you whatever they think you want to hear. It is truly sad that politics in this country has come to this point. FRED VERSER Little Rock Much prefer the dogs Well-behaved dogs in restaurants are much preferable to parents who let their offspring scream, climb over/under tables and throw food. Or the screeching conversations of rush-week sorority girls in their prescribed uniforms (long hair, short shorts, tank tops or T-shirts) who may believe their conversations are, like, really, really interesting to everybody else. Anybody ready for some divine intervention for folks who are inspired to use their Bibles as WMDs or crosses and fishies to to sell product or services or politics? SALLYE MARTIN Fayetteville His negative rhetoric Donald Trump needs to be stopped from all the negative rhetoric. Speaking politically correctly, Trump needs to stay away from the topic of immigration and immigrants. If he really wants to tell history which is his-story, we can go back to when people claimed that Christopher Columbus discovered America. The Indians discovered America, African people were in Africa, Chinese people were in China, and Mexican people were in Mexico. So, there is not anybody in America today who is a true American other than the American Indian people. Donald Trump needs to stop all the negative rhetoric with trying to send Mexican people back to Mexico. If he can get away with sending Mexican people back to Mexico, next he probably will try to become another Adolf Hitler and do total ethnic cleansing. As a result, the America that we know today would be lily-white. The media needs to call Donald Trump out for what he really is. Speaking politically correctly, he is a redneck, white trash, and hillbilly. I am just a lady who happens to be blind now. MARQUITA J. CORBIN Conway Ill-behaved kids worse Re Mr. Dale R. Jones' letter, I feel the need to clarify and respond. Mr. Jones states he would leave any restaurant where a dog was brought in. I think Mr. Philip Martin's review said they were outdoors on the patio/deck where it is the only place, I believe, they are allowed unless they are service animals. While most children are well-behaved and their parents have taught them well while out, many have not! I have suffered through poorly disciplined children that squalled or pitched a fit in nice eating establishments. Not only did they make it unpleasant for customers around the fiasco, they usually leave extra work to do for the wait staff, with food dropped on the table or on the floor. Given a choice, I will take a seating section with dogs over children, as the odds are much better to have a nice meal. BILL WOODS Little Rock Not very gentlemanly One of my pet peeves is hearing a news reporter covering a crime scene, a mass shooting, or something of that nature refer to the suspect as ""a gentleman."" I have heard several TV reporters do this in their reports. Here are two definitions I found for the word gentleman: (1) a civilized, educated, sensitive, or well-mannered man, and (2) a man who treats other people in a proper and polite way. Those men who murder, rob banks, or do other violent crimes do not fit the definition of a gentleman.

11,http://www.eurweb.com/2015/09/inside-broadway-a-conversation-with-broadway-veteran-chapman-roberts-3/,"Chapman Roberts (photo: Lisa Pacino) *In the fourth and final part series with Broadway veteran Chapman Roberts, composer, producer and the co-creator of “Black Stars of the Great White Way,” Roberts continues his discussion on race, politics and the New York City musician’s union (Local 802). Inside Broadway: What are you most optimistic about for today’s performing artists of color on Broadway? Chapman Roberts: I am not optimistic about it and I’m going to tell you why. You have a Hispanic man playing a man of African heritage, Alexander Hamilton.  Alexander Hamilton was not Hispanic, his mother was a black woman from the Island of Nevis in the Caribbean, and in the show, they said she was a whore. And no one is saying a word about it. It’s the biggest hit on Broadway, and I am not in the least bit optimistic about it. I am not optimistic because when a black show is produced, it is produced by white people to cater to their audiences. And the black people who have the money, have not done one thing to put that money into black communities to help reinstitute our musical heritage. They haven’t done one thing. The only people that reached out were Beyoncé and Jay-Z, when they joined with Will [Smith] and Jada [Pinkett Smith] to put money into Fela! And Alicia Keys put money into Stick Fly. I invested money in all those Broadway shows. I invested in Mountain Top with Angela Bassett and Samuel Jackson. I invested in The Trip to Bountiful with Cicely Tyson. I invested in Stick Fly. I created Five Guys Named Moe, Bubbling Brown Sugar, Eubie, Daddy Goodness, Your Arms Too Short to Box with God, Blues in the Night, Smokey Joe’s Café. And you are only the fourth black journalist I’ve ever talked to in my life. There’s a black woman [Thelma Pollard] who has been the head of makeup for The Phantom of the Opera for 26 years. She also did the makeup for Dreamgirls and Cats—she invented it. For 26 years she’s been traveling all over the world with The Phantom of the Opera, doing all of their make-up. She’s from Barbados, and ain’t nobody said nothing to her. IB: What advice would you give young African American performing artists interested in a career on Broadway? CR: I would tell them to study their craft. I have a problem with them too.  Everyone sends their kids to me.  And I say to them, “Where are you studying dance?” And they say, “Oh, I dance,” and I say, “I didn’t ask you what you do, I asked where do you study dance?” I say to them, “You go to Alvin Ailey and you study.” Then I say, “Who is your voice teacher?” And they say, “I can sing.” I say, “Perhaps you would like to sing better.  Where are you studying?”  They must study their craft and educate themselves because anytime you speak to a young African American person and they say, “Yo, you know what I’m saying,” I say “Well, I don’t know what role you’re going to audition for because they want a monologue.” Their response to me is “What is a monologue?” I say, “Do you know what stage right, stage left, upstage, or downstage are?” And they say, “No.”  Well, they need to know. We have been taught by this hip-hop industry that it’s luck and that’s also about your gentiles. We have denigrated ourselves to the point where these so-called men are walking around wiggling their asses in people’s faces. We have a problem because that’s what they think entertainment is. In the audition notices, do you know what these white people have done? In the audition notices, they put “no stylized singing.” They mean don’t come in here yodeling. Sing the song. Sing! Don’t come in here telling me how good you are going to do me in bed, they are not interested in that. That’s why they don’t have a future on Broadway. They can’t sing, they can’t dance, and they can’t act. They think because they can shake their behinds that’s going to make them a star. That’s why they are not going to get anywhere. IB: What advice do you have for young musicians interested in pursuing a career on Broadway and in musical theatre? How would you tell them to prepare? CR: They must study. Now, this is extremely difficult because the musician’s union is a gang industry. There’s an organization called the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra; and the Mellon Foundation recently gave them $400,000 to research and find qualified African American musicians who play classical music. With the last infusion of money from Norm Lewis, on Sunday, June 22nd [2014] at 10:00 in the morning, we put our contractor on the phone and we assembled a 65-piece all African American male symphony orchestra on twenty-four hours’ notice on that [Carnegie Hall] stage with two and half hours of rehearsal. And twenty minutes after the rehearsal started, an official from Carnegie Hall walked onto the stage in the middle of my rehearsal and said, “Local 802 [New York City’s musicians’ union] is downstairs and they want to talk with you.” And I said “I’m in the middle of a rehearsal. I’m not a member of Local 802.” She said that they wanted to talk with me. I said, “Well, excused me, you’re cutting into my time that I’m paying for. They can wait at the door.  I rented this hall, and it’s mine.” The next thing I knew, [a representative from Local 802] was on the stage; they had let him in. And he stood there on the stage and said to me, “We are shutting this down.” And I said, “You are shutting what down? This is not a union house. In fact, when I signed my contract, I made sure they told me that.” He said, “No it’s not a union house, but these are union musicians.” I turned to the orchestra and said, “Anybody here who is a member of Local 802 who wants to leave, you are welcome to leave right now.” The Local 802 representative said, “I am going to fix you. The stage hand union is going to picket you.” I said, “Good, I can use the publicity.” One musician left, the rest of the musicians sat there and said the union hasn’t given them a job in years. They [Local 802] pretend there are no jobs and they can’t find quality [African American musicians]. That’s a lie, there are plenty of them. The most famous and the best harpist in the world is a black woman name Ann Hobson. She is in her 70s and she plays with the Boston Symphony. I’m doing a concert [the Classical Pops Festival] with her, Earth, Wind & Fire, Audra McDonald and Norm Lewis in Barbados on December 10th, 11th and 12th. I’m doing another concert [The Color of Music Festival] in Charleston, South Carolina at a Symphony Hall, right across the street from the mass shooting that happened at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. I will be performing with 4,000 classical musicians from all over the world. They [Local 802] pretend they can’t find them.  I had fathers and sons in that symphony orchestra. I had fathers sitting next to their sons playing violins [at Carnegie Hall].  I had a father and son in Winston-Salem—the father was a trumpet player and the son was a drummer. [The musician’s union] blocked them out, and even the black musicians spread the word and say that you can’t find any classical musicians—and that’s a lie. I was in the musician’s union and I have had more hit Broadway shows than any black musician alive on the planet. When I retired, I went to the musician’s union regarding my pension. And they said to me, “What pension? Mr. Roberts your last show closed over five years ago.” I said, “So what?” They said, “You haven’t done a show on Broadway in the last five years. If you haven’t done a show within five years, then you lose your pension benefits.” I said, “When did that happen?” They responded, “We notified everybody.” I said, “No you didn’t. You didn’t notify me.” They said, “Well, we told everybody and you don’t have a pension.” That’s another challenge and there’s more to this story.

13,http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/329660101.html,"Now that Minneapolis park officials are planning to add a Dakota name to signs at Lake Calhoun and may be pressed to do more, the naming issue raises a new question: Which Dakota name? The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board directed this month that the Dakota name of Bde Maka Ska (White Earth Lake) be added to major signs at Calhoun. That adopts a name championed by a family descended from Cloud Man, the leader of a short-lived village at the lake. But others argue that the proper Dakota name for the lake is Mde Med’oza (Lake of the Loons), which the Park Board considered in the 19th century but never adopted. The conundrum illustrates the difficulty of interpreting history through a 21st-century lens. It also comes as President Obama renamed Alaska’s Mount McKinley by its traditional name, Denali, and a South Dakota board prompted statewide debate with a proposal to rename its tallest peak, which honors a general accused of massacring Indian women and children, with a native name. It failed. The growing debate surrounding the lake’s name has intensely divided Minneapolis residents. Some want to find a replacement for namesake John C. Calhoun, a passionate defender of slavery. The issue has consumed hours of public debate, even though it is not certain that any official with the power to initiate a name change will do so. Peter Bell, chairman of a committee looking at making park and trail improvements to lakes Calhoun and Harriet, resigned his leadership post, saying the panel — which has only an advisory role in the naming debate — has spent far too much time wrestling with the issue. Underneath the larger debate is the unresolved question about which name is most historically accurate, or at least appropriate. The U.S. Geographic Board lists Mde Maka Ska as a variant name for Calhoun, favoring a spelling used by early lexicographers of Dakota languages. But Warren Upham’s seminal “Minnesota Place Names,” published in 1920, favors Medoza, citing an 1881 publication, not citing a Dakota source. Medoza once appeared on at least one city map. More recently, the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District adopted the name of Medoza Ponds for stormwater settling ponds it built southwest of Calhoun in 1999. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, the nearest federally recognized tribe, took a diplomatic approach when consulted by the Star Tribune. It said in a statement it is not aware of reliable evidence that ancestors had a specific Dakota name for the lake. It noted that missionary Samuel Pond’s 1893 book claimed that the Dakota called it “the inland lake,” but acknowledged some sources use the loon and white earth names. The Calhoun name debate was joined initially by those who found Calhoun no longer worthy of commemoration. Aside from his connection to the slavery issue, the Dakota note that Calhoun devised the plan for the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of more than 50,000 Southeastern tribal members to Western territory. Those who want to keep the Calhoun name said it honors the man who, as secretary of war, authorized a chain of frontier forts, including Fort Snelling. In Minneapolis, Dakota advocates such as historian Kate Beane portray Bde Maka Ska as a name restoration rather than a name change. But others question the right of the Dakota to do so. They call the Dakota interlopers in the Twin Cities who established residence here only after a series of battles before white settlement that displaced the Iowa tribe. They say that the Dakota were pushed into the area by Ojibway pressure from the North. The main reason the village at Calhoun was abandoned was fear of retaliation after what Pond described as a massacre by warriors of an Ojibway party, mostly women and children. Beane, an Indian cultural liaison for the Minnesota Historical Society, is one of three Cloud Man descendants on the 26-member committee advising the Park Board on how to spend money to renovate parks at lakes Calhoun and Harriet, the same panel from which Bell resigned. Part of that group’s charge was to address historic and contemporary cultural concerns. The group’s straw poll last week found far more members favor a Dakota name than want to retain Calhoun. The panel could eventually recommend a name change to the Park Board, but it is something that would need to be done at the state level. The naming debate has flared periodically since 1997 but erupted anew this summer in the wake of national debate over symbols of the Confederacy and a mass shooting at a predominantly black church in Charleston, S.C. Syd Beane, father of Kate, is one of those who have been involved in efforts to commemorate Dakota presence at the lake. He said the name Bde Maka Ska resonates with a collective of researchers that examined Dakota history in the area. The Beane family returned to the area about a dozen years ago after exile from the state following the 1862 Dakota Conflict. Syd Beane grew up in South Dakota and describes his family as refugees returning to a homeland. “These names and these places are critical to this process,” he said.

16,http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/330264121.html,"Crime, courts and legal issues in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin By Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel The Wisconsin Court of Appeals on Thursday affirmed the convictions of a man responsible for killing four people at a Fourth of July street party in 2008. James Washington was one of three men charged with shooting into a crowd, fatally hitting four people. Killed were Kendrick L. Jackson, 34, Jacoby E. Claybrooks, 28, and  Theresa Raddle, 23, all of Milwaukee; and Marielle Fisher, 27, of  Glendale. One of the three men charged, Rosario Fuentez, pleaded guilty and testified that Washington had a rifle, and while Fuentez did not see him shooting directly, he saw shots coming from where Washington was standing between two houses, and that he later heard Washington say he was out of ammunition. As part of his appeal, Washington cited Fuentez's written recantation of his trial testimony. After the trial, Fuentez wrote that he only mentioned Washington to help himself escape worse punishment. He admits he fired weapons over the crowd, hoping to scare people into running away, but that Washington was not even present. The appellate opinion notes that, at a post trial motion hearing, the trial judge had determined the written recantation was not credible, and likely the result of intimidation. At that hearing, Fuentez invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, and said only, “if that’s what’s in there, if that’s what the affidavit says, you got the letters, the affidavit, it’s in my handwriting, I ain’t going to say no more.” The appeals court found, ""The circuit court’s finding that Fuentez’s recantation was not credible is supported by the evidence and is, therefore, not clearly erroneous."" The court also rejected Washington's claims that his lawyer was ineffective, and that the trial court judge had biased the jury when she told jurors Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. Fuentez agreed to plead guilty to four counts of first-degree reckless homicide in exchange for a 20-year sentence. He also testified against Antonio ""Cheem"" Williams, who, like Washington, was also convicted of four courts of first degree intentional homicide and sentenced to life in prison.

	Variety Staff Follow Us on Twitter At least 10 people have been killed in a shooting rampage at an Oregon college that sent TV news reporters scrambling to piece together sketchy information emanating from Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. The 26-year-old male gunman, who has been identified as Chris Harper Mercer, was killed after a confrontation with police, according to local law enforcement officials According to ABC affiliate KATU-TV Portland, Oregon State Police said that 20 people were injured in the attack. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown appeared shaken as she expressed “profound dismay and heartbreak at this tragedy. … We are holding the community of Douglas County in our hearts today.” The shootings began to unfold at 10:38 a.m. PT in a building that houses science facilities on the college’s large campus in the logging community situated in the south-central region of the state, about 179 miles south of Portland.  The campus was evacuated, with students and faculty taken by bus to nearby Douglas County Fairgrounds, and remained on lockdown Thursday afternoon. Umpqua is said to have about 3,000 full-time students. Within minutes of the attack there were horrifying first-hand accounts of the shooting streaming out via social media and Twitter — reports of students and teachers huddling together in classrooms in terror and students waving other students away from the campus as they tried to head to class. Students are running everywhere. Holy God. — Kayla Marie (@KP_KaylaMarie) October 1, 2015  The Oregon shootings join a long line of mass shootings that spark saturation media coverage. The rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech University in 2007 remains the worst mass shooting in the nation’s history, with 33 left dead. In December 2012, the nation was rattled by the slayings of 26 people, 20 of them children, at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Columbine, Colo., has become synonymous with the mass shootings carried out at a high school there by two students in 1999 that left 13 dead and more than 20 wounded. Movie theaters have also become the site of attacks. In July 2012, James Holmes opened fire at an Aurora, Colo., multiplex, killing 12 and wounding 70 during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.” In August he was sentenced to life in prison. In July, a gunman shot three people in a in Lafayette, La., theater that was screening the comedy “Trainwreck.” Gun violence came shockingly close to home for TV news reporters in August when two employees of CBS affiliate WDBJ-TV in Roanoke, Va., were shot to death during a live broadcast by a former station employee. The remote site of the Oregon shootings — far removed from the state’s urban center in Portland — made it harder for the national news networks to get immediate live coverage of the events. Even network affiliate stations with news operations in the larger town of Eugene were still 70 miles away from Roseburg. As such, TV news networks scrambled to contact students, law enforcement and others by phone and online to gather information. The news coverage on MSBNC and others followed a somber ritual of talking heads decrying the easy availability of guns and the lack of mental health services for those who might be identified as potential threats.  “To have a mass shooting of this magnitude in Oregon is positively unspeakable to us,” Oregon’s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, told MSNBC.

The 18-year-old woman said she stood by helpless, as she saw the man shoot her teacher in the head. Umpqua Community College Shooting Update - John Hanlin, Douglas County Sheriff, stated during a press conference that that the gunman in the Oregon shooting is deceased.

Second Amendment advocates were quick to point out that the Roseburg, Oregon school was a ""gun free zone"" and feel that perhaps some of the students could have survived if a staff member or student had been permitted to carry a handgun on campus.

The shooting took place at the western Oregon college campus on Thursday morning, with reports that as many as 15 people were killed in a mass shooting. Police said they have detained the shooting suspect and that the danger to students is over, but the death toll from the attack has continued to rise.At least 7 killed and 20 hurt, shooter 'down' and in custody. #UCCshooting live updates: https://t.co/aSJGmhXkVJ pic.twitter.com/dsgFzKE6Qr — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) October 1, 2015Now it appears that the Oregon community college shooter may have left an ominous warning. A posting from the image-sharing site 4chan appeared to predict Thursday's Oregon college shooting.  The post reads as follows.""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning so long space robots""The nature of 4chan is fluid and threads are not archived, but a screenshot of the 4chan posting was uploaded to Imgur, showing the exchange in its entirety. Some of the users on 4chan also appeared to egg on the person, though they may not have known if the threat was legitimate.""I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it is possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.""The person also promised to give more updates. ""Willl post again in am, 10 min countdown. Won't say much more to prepare."" If true, this would not be the first time that someone has left evidence of their crime on 4chan. In November, a man identified as David Kalac allegedly posted a picture of a dead and half-naked woman along with a confession that he had murdered her. ""Turns out it's way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks in the movies,"" the first post read. Though some doubted the authenticity, police in Port Orchard, Washington, later confirmed that the details fit a recent homicide. The Port Orchard Independent reported that police found the body of a woman in her early 30s who matched the pictures seen on 4chan. ""It's a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,"" Sheriff's Office spokesman Scott Wilson said. Kalac also stole the woman's vehicle, and appeared to promise more bloodshed.""I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough,"" the user wrote. ""When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the f****** news. I have to lose my phone now."" But Kalac was ultimately arrested without incident and charged in the woman's murder. The 4chan post that seemed to predict the Oregon community college shooting was shared on Reddit on Thursday afternoon, where it attracted hundreds of user upvotes. Some called out the users who seemed to egg the shooter on, but others noted that there was likely no way of stopping the massacre. ""This is what a lot of people fail to recognize with internet hate,"" one user wrote. ""People have been crying for attention for a long time, with thinly veiled threats of suicide and homicide. There's no point coddling and negotiating with these types because the real psychopaths will just see reward in making more threats."" There is no confirmation yet whether the 4chan post that appeared to predict the Oregon community college shooting is legitimate. Police said the suspect has been neutralized, but they have not yet said if the person is alive or dead.

ROSEBURG, Oregon — Hannah Miles went to Umpqua Community College to study nursing, considering to one day work in an emergency room. On Thursday, her classroom became an emergency room when 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured seven. “Not what I expected, my first year of college,” Miles told The Daily Beast. At about 10:30 a.m., Miles said she heard “a yardstick or ruler smacking against a chalkboard.” A fellow student joked that it sounded like a shotgun, she said. Then shots came “one after the other” as she heard people in the next room cry out. Teacher Amy Fair led the class to a nearby bookstore where all the students took refuge in a back room. Miles said she left everything—her phone, wallet, purse, and books—behind. “It was utter chaos, the fear and the panic,” Miles said of running for her life. Student Kortney Moore told the News Review that the gunman entered her classroom after firing a shot through the window. Moore said she saw her teacher get shot in the head. The gunman told everyone to get on the floor, according to Moore, then asked people to stand up and state their religion before opening fire. Douglas County Sherrif Douglas Hanlin said officers immediately responded and exchanged fire with the gunman, who is dead. Umpqua is the fourth shooting on a college campus since August and the deadliest since the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32. There have been at least 142 school shootings in the U.S. since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, according to Every Town for Gun Safety. This isn’t even the first school shooting in Roseburg: In 2006, a high school freshman shot another student in the back four times. Thursday was the fourth day of school at Umpqua, so Miles and her classmates were mostly strangers to each other. By the end of the day, they were hugging and crying in the book store’s back room. “Yes, [the shooting] was unthinkable,” she said, “but it is even more incredible that people can become supporters for one another.” Miles said the day makes her want to be a nurse “more than ever.” “I can tell you, I’m going back to UCC.” Scenes From the Oregon College Shooting (PHOTOS)",2015-10-01 15:10:00,Police: 13 Killed at Oregon College,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

Officials aren't allowing students to leave campus in their own vehicles, Andrews said, they are bussing them out. ""Everybody is in shock. Very very shocked,"" Andrews said. Umpqua Community College, located about three hours south of Portland, has a student body of almost 5,000 students, most part time. The school sits six miles outside Roseburg, a timber town where the downturn in the logging industry has hurt the finances of many families. Kristapher Yates, president of Umpqua Community College's student council last year, was in the student leadership center Thursday morning when an adviser notified he and his classmates the school was on lockdown. ""We were behind a door, and we shut the door, and we stayed in this room,"" said Yates, 35. He didn't hear or see the shooting himself, but said students he had spoken with told him the shots were fired at Snyder Hall. At least four English classes were meeting there at the time. Students and faculty are being bused from campus to the Douglas County Fairgrounds. ""It's a small community,"" said Yates, now the school's student life liaison, ""but it's very supportive. So we will get through it."" According to crowd-sourced accounts of violence in the United States, this would be the 294th mass shooting this year and the 45th school shooting. It's been a little more than a year since a student killed a classmate and injured a teacher at Reynolds High School outside Portland. Roseburg High School was the site of a school shooting in 2006.

	Ted Johnson Senior Editor President Obama, reacting to Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., said “somehow this has become routine,” but said change won’t happen until gun laws are strengthened. “Each time this happens, I am going to say, ‘We’re going to have to do something about it,’ but we have got to change our laws,” Obama, appearing angry and frustrated, said in making a statement at the White House. “Someone somewhere, will say ‘Obama politicized this issue,'” Obama said. “This is something we should politicize. This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America.” He called on voters to take a candidates’ position on gun laws into account when making their voting decisions.  “We’ve become numb to this,” he continued. Legislation to expand background checks and close the so-called “gun show” loophole has stalled out in Congress, and, in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012, proposals to strengthen gun laws never made it to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Obama also said that Congress also is blocking data collection “on how we can potentially reduce gun deaths.” According to CBS News’ Mark Knoller, this was the 15th time that Obama has made remarks following a shooting since he became president.

Obama pressured news outlets and networks to publicize the statistics of Americans ""who have been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence.""

""The notion that gun laws don't work or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, it's not borne out by the evidence,"" the president said. ""We know that other countries in response to one mass shooting have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours, Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.""

""What's also routine, of course, is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama declared.

""I would... have news organizations put up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side on your news reports,"" Obama wished.

37,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114756259/0/phoenix/nation~Obama-Our-thoughts-and-prayers-are-not-enough/,"WASHINGTON — A visibly frustrated President Obama offered condolences to the victims of the mass shooting at an Oregon college on Thursday, but he added that ""our thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" and voters should demand changes to the nation's gun laws. Having now spoken after more than a dozen senseless killings during his administration, Obama again called for ""common sense"" legislation aimed at preventing gun violence, and he mocked opponents of past initiatives he has pushed. USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war ""Each time this happens, I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said during emotional remarks in the White House press room. ""Each time this happens, I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" Obama noted that he has been to Roseburg, Ore., where the shooting took place, and ""there are really good people there"" who are the latest victims of gun violence. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" Throughout his presidency, especially after shootings, Obama has called for legislation to try to stop gun violence, including enhanced background checks, an assault weapons ban, and improved mental health programs. On this occasion, the president said, ""it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm to get his or her hands on a gun."" As he echoed those calls in the wake of the Oregon shooting, Obama predicted that statements of opposition from gun rights groups were already being written. Many of those opponents will accuse him politicizing tragic shootings, the president said. ""Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" He later said: ""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America."" Oregon officials said a 20-year-old man killed at least 10 people in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Obama visited the city during his 2008 presidential campaign. Obama has spoken in the wake of shooting tragedies on at least a dozen occasions, including the 2012 murders at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., and this past summer's killings at African-American church in Charleston, S.C. Other countries have mental health issues, but none have the kind of gun violence the United States does, Obama said. The president mocked opponents of gun control legislation, including those who say the solution is ""more guns"" or fewer safety laws. ""Does anybody really believe that?"" Obama said. Given the frequency of mass shootings, Obama said people should demand action at the federal and state levels, and make it an issue at election time. He also said lawful gun owners should question whether gun rights organizations are truly representing their views when it comes to efforts to prevent violence. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,"" Obama said. ""But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that — and that's terrible to say. And it can change.""

38,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/qVY_ryOk2tw/," On Thursday afternoon, President Obama held a press conference to address the mass shootings that took place on the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Ore. Obama addressed the media with a request for voters. He referenced prior mass shootings in America — the most recent being the theater shooting in Lafayette, La. — and he expressed his sadness at how these shootings (and his subsequent place on the podium) have become “routine”: “As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I say each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America … next week, or a couple of months from now.” Obama paid tribute to the families and loved ones whose lives have been changed forever” in Oregon. He also called for changes in gun laws: “We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ‘The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient, common sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings. And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.” Within his speech, Obama warned that his opponents would accuse him of using the Oregon tragedy to meet an agenda, and he’s okay with it: “This is something we should politicize. This is a political choice that we make.” (Via USA Today) ",2015-10-01 20:15:29,Obama Addresses The Oregon College Shootings: ‘Our Thoughts And Prayers Are Not Enough’,,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

Another shooter police say is ""deceased."" Another death toll that — no matter what the number — leaves you with a sick feeling in your gut. It's a painful story that's far too familiar — especially in 2015. The school year was off to an especially violent start even before Thursday’s senseless shooting at an Oregon community college: Just since August, there have been three shootings at college campuses across the nation. And as the details of the tragedy at Umpqua Community College emerge, that awful, familiar feeling of sadness and helplessness takes hold again and we ask ourselves — again — When will the killings end? Swiping is so yesterday Ready or not, it's time to chip in. So to speak. Thursday marked a milestone in the effort to shift the U.S. to the use of microchip-embedded credit cards, a more secure alternative to the old cards that require the swipe of a magnetic stripe. Don't have your fancy new card? Don't worry. The October deadline is more a call to action for retailers than a cutoff. Stephanie Ericksen, Visa's VP of risk product, explains: ""We know, based on experience in other countries, it takes several years to get to critical mass. So we're seeing Oct. 1 as more of a kickoff toward increasing the momentum toward chip. People will still be able to use their (cards with) magnetic stripes."" Good to know. Because many retailers don't have the chip-card readers. Whatcha gonna do, Joaquin?

The National Hurricane Center says Joaquin could graze the East Coast over the weekend — or it could go out to sea. Regardless of how close Joaquin comes, torrential rain from a separate weather system is forecast to drench much of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with catastrophic flooding possible in the Carolinas and Virginia.

44,http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/10/obama_on_oregon_school_shootin.html," Gallery: Oregon School Shooting - Obama Speaks President Barack Obama, in what he said has become ""routine,"" addressed the nation Thursday in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College and urged the American public and lawmakers around the country to take action. ""Somehow this has become routine,"" Obama said during a nearly 13 minute speech. ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."" ""We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,"" Obama said. ""It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun."" The shooting at the Roseburg campus left 10 people dead and seven wounded, officials confirmed during a late-afternoon news briefing. Obama already this year has given national statements in response to the movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana, and the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre. Obama this time said that the nation's grief isn't enough. ""But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we have one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel."" The president urged the Americans and Congress to take action on ""sufficient common sense gun safety laws."" He also directly addressed the gun lobby for what he predicted will draw comments that he is once again politicizing the issue. ""Well, this is something that we should politicize,"" Obama said. ""It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic."" He added: ""We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" Obama, who is nearing the end of his second term, said the nation is going to have to change its laws. ""That is not something I can do by myself,"" he said. He closed with a prayer for Roseburg family and friends and a somber note. ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I cannot guarantee that, and that is terrible to say."" He then took a long pause. ""And it can change."" Below is a full transcript of Obama's speech: There's been another mass shooting in America. This time in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families, or their children. I've been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there. I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today. Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we've offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs for as long as they need. In the coming days we'll learn about the victims. Young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard with their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who is grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America. Next week, or a couple of months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did. And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds. Regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. You know earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ""The United States of America is the only advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings."" And later that day, there was a mass shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day. Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press release is being cranked out. ""We need more guns,"" they'll argue. ""Fewer gun safety laws."" Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country, they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws, including the majority of responsible, law abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And of course what's also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, ""Obama politicized this issue."" Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic. I would ask news organizations, because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade, and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports. This won't be information coming from me, it will be coming from you. We spent over a $1 trillion and passed countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be? This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We, collectively, are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we worked to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them, to reduce auto fatalities. We have seat belt laws because we know it saves lives So the notion that gun violence is somehow difference, that our freedom and our constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and everything do everything that they do under such regulations, doesn't make sense. So tonight as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat, or a Republican, and an Independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. And I would particularly ask America's gun owners who are using those guns -- properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that suggests its speaking for you. And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up. Each time this happens I'm going to say we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress, and I've got to have state legislatures, and governors, who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out, again, during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that, and that is terrible to say. And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May he bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back, and may he give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.

They shared their cellphones to quickly call relatives. “She called the church line instead of my cellphone. That’s when I knew something was wrong,” said Hannah’s dad, Gary Miles, pastor at Christian Life Center United Pentecostal Church. He hadn’t heard about the shootings yet.

In addition to indoor and outdoor sirens, Beary said, students and staff receive text, email and automated phone alerts. UCF police also have their own 911 dispatch center. The alert system can be activated by most all campus supervisors and doesn't require approval from the chain of command. All campus police officers also carry tourniquets, quick-clot bandages and military-grade field dressings to treat gunshot wounds. In case of an emergency, UF students and staff receive alert text and email messages. Loudspeakers on campus also broadcast the alert, and any campus supervisor can activate the notification system. UF police Chief Linda Stump-Kurnick also likes to remind staff and students to always be aware of their surroundings. ""How would you get out (in an emergency), and what would you do?"" Stump-Kurnick said she asks students and staff. ""Nobody can make that decision for you."" In the event a gunman were to open fire on campus, alerts would be sent through text messages as sirens blared warnings to student and staff. Confirmed information also would be bannered across digital displays and featured prominently on the university website. ""As a police department on campus, we are fully sworn, trained and certified and capable of handling almost any situation,"" said Chris Daniel, USF's assistant police chief. One group meets annually to discuss safety measures at the urban campus near downtown Tampa. Another group meets weekly to discuss emergency response plans, particularly in an active shooter scenario. Emergency text messages and emails are sent to students and staff, and audio alerts are broadcast across public address systems that are in all but three residence halls. The UT campus does not have an outdoor PA system. Anyone connected to the university network also will see emergency notifications on their campus computers. They also may opt to receive the alert on personal laptops. ""For a campus like UT, we really welcome in the outside world,"" said Linda Devine, vice president for operations and planning. ""So, we're not immune from violence. We have in place a number of emergency communications tools.""",2015-10-01 22:21:09,Florida universities outline response to emergencies like Oregon mass shooting,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

Police have confirmed that 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer opened fire on the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Oregon. Multiple witnesses at the scene claim that Harper-Mercer made victims lay on the ground before having them stand up one-by-one and answer a question about their religious affiliation. The gunmen allegedly shot all followers of Christianity in the head while those who did not proclaim the Christian faith were shot in the leg. Police identified Chris Harper-Mercer as the gunman responsible for the mass shooting at an Oregon community college. The Blaze reports that victims of the Oregon shooting are proclaiming that Chris Harper-Mercer was specifically targeting people of Christian faith in his rampage on the Umpqua Community College campus. Bodhi Looney posted her grandmother's account of the shooting on Twitter which outlined that all Christians were shot in the head while those who denied being Christian or remained silent were shot in the leg.#UCCShooting pic.twitter.com/RVtzkWVSPu — Bodhi (@BodhiLooney) October 1, 2015The story was corroborated by another alleged witness to the horrifying shooting named Korney Moore. The 18-year-old student told the News Review that the shooter asked individuals to lay on the floor before having each of them stand and state their religion of choice. Moore noted that the gunman did not open fire until after the victims responded to the question. Though the motive of the Oregon community college shooting is currently unknown, it appears that Harper-Mercer had an infatuation with mass shootings. Just three days ago, the gunman downloaded This World Surviving Sandy Hook, a 2015 BBC Documentary documentary covering the horrifying elementary school shooting. In addition to watching the Sandy Hook movie, the deranged killer also proclaimed his admiration for Vester Flanagan, the ex-reporter who gunned down two of his former colleagues on live television. A dating profile of the deranged killer, Chris Harper-Mercer. It also appears that the gunman may have posted an anonymous 4chan thread about his intentions before the shooting took place. The 4chan thread, which appeared in an anonymous forum, notes that people living in the northwest should not go to school tomorrow as he had something planned. The thread began by noting that ""some of you guys are alright"" and not to go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. Many people on the forum encouraged the anonymous user and even gave him tips on how to pull of the shooting. Some even gave suggestions that sound eerily familiar to what witnesses described at the scene at the Oregon college shooting. Following news of the shooting, it seems that many on the message board believe that the anonymous user was actually Chris Harper-Mercer and that he actually followed through with his plan. Some even seemingly praised the OP for following through with his plan. Screenshot of the anonymous 4chan thread. Now, according to The Verge, the FBI is investigating the thread in an attempt to determine if Harper-Mercer was the poster in question. The 911 dispatcher recordings from the horrifying scene reveal that police exchanged gunfire with the shooter before he was eventually shot down. The dispatcher called the shooting a ""major trauma"" and police were heard in the recording saying it was a mass casualty event with upwards of 20 victims, with approximately 15 deceased.""I need all traffic to pause unless emergency. Please dispatch as many ambulances as possible to this incident, we have upwards of 20 victims. Upwards of 20 victims, approximately 15 are deceased.""Though the officers on the recording can be heard saying upwards of 20 victims with 15 deceased, there have only been 10 confirmed casualties with seven injuries.

Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin was one of hundreds of sheriffs around the country who in 2013 vowed to stand against new gun control legislation. In a letter to Vice President Joe Biden, he wrote that ""any actions against, or in disregard for our U.S. Constitution and 2nd Amendment . . . would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people."" USA TODAY Andy Parker: Oregon shooting shows we are at war Hanlin wrote the letter after the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six staff members dead. He wrote that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions ""offending the constitutional rights of my citizens."" ""It is my position as sheriff of Douglas County, Oregon, that I will refuse to participate in, nor tolerate enforcement actions against citizens that are deemed unconstitutional,"" he told Biden. Hanlin registered his opposition this year as state lawmakers considered requiring background checks on private, person-to-person gun sales. Hanlin told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate wouldn't prevent criminals from getting firearms. He said the state should combat gun violence by cracking down on convicted criminals found with guns, and by addressing people with unmanaged mental health issues. At an evening press conference following Thursday's shootings at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon, Hanlin told the media that he would never utter the name of the killer and he urged reporters not to publish the name of the gunman. A law enforcement official identified the killer to USA TODAY as Chris Mercer, 26. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,"" Hanlin said. ""You will never hear me mention his name. He in no way deserves"" any notoriety.

55,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114811469/0/phoenix/nation~Andy-Parker-Ore-shooting-shows-we-are-at-war/,"We are engaged in a war in this country. It is a war between rational, responsible people and self-interested zealots; a war between good and evil. It is a war to decide whether we will continue to let the senseless tragedy of gun violence continue. It is a war to put reasonable safeguards in place to prevent incidents like that which occurred in Oregon yesterday. On one side of that war is a group that is successfully fighting to ensure that a discussion to try to find solutions never takes place. Everyone knows of whom I'm talking: the National Rifle Association. An organization that had at its founding the core mission to teach firearm safety, now has set itself on a course to prevent any laws from being enacted to do just that. And some of our legislators are complicit in this crime. Is the support of a fringe element of the NRA so important that they are willing to accept our children as collateral damage? On the other side are the families and their circles of loved ones whose lives have been shattered by the devastation of gun violence. And every year, 30,000 new families and circles of loved ones are inducted into this fraternity. This is the fraternity my wife, Barbara and I joined almost exactly a month ago. USA TODAY Calculated killing of Christians in Roseburg? Column USA TODAY Ore. shooting: 'I don't even want to know the names yet. I'm not ready' On August 26th, a disturbed gunman shot my daughter Alison on live television. Yesterday another senseless act of gun violence took place in this country. This time ten individuals lost their lives and seven were wounded; 17 families and their circles of loved ones now enter a fraternity they did not choose to join. It is the fraternity of those whose lives have been permanently changed by the brutality of gun violence. I was a Reagan Republican years ago. I have slowly watched the party mutate into something Reagan wouldn't recognize today, with an agenda he would not have supported. Republican legislators across the country refuse to consider common sense measures to prevent the horrific gun violence that kills our loved ones each and every day. By refusing to act, they are aiding and abetting domestic terrorism. POLICING THE USA Policing the USA I am also from Texas and, like many from that state, I believe in the rights guaranteed in the Second Amendment. But with rights come responsibilities. It is not sufficient to say, ""There's nothing you can do to prevent someone, even someone who is mentally ill, from getting a gun if they want it."" Something can be done if we try hard enough. For example, following the tragic 2014 mass shooting in Isla Vista, California passed a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) policy GVRO, a life-saving reform that allows family members and/or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily remove firearms from a loved one in crisis. The parents of the gunman in that case, Elliot Rodger, had requested a welfare check on their son because they believed he was a potential threat. Law enforcement officers did the check, but had no authority to remove Rodgers' firearms from his home. The results were disastrous. Lives were taken for no good reason at all; certainly no reason our Founders would have supported. To California legislators' credit, they wasted no time in taking decisive action to prevent the next tragedy. USA TODAY Brothers in arms - Vester Flanagan, Dylann Roof & Ayoub El-Khazzani: Column Of course we have no way of knowing whether a bill like this would have made a difference in my daughter's case, in the incident yesterday, or in the cases of the almost daily occurrences of gun violence. We don't know if the family was aware of a problem. Nor do we know whether removing firearms would have just prompted him to use something else. But we do know that we must have an open and honest discussion in this country about what we can do as a people to reduce the number of victims of gun violence. Only through engagement in a meaningful and honest dialogue can we hope to find a solution. But I do not underestimate our enemy. We are at war in this country for the answers, and we must win – whatever it takes. Andy Parker lives in Virginia.

That’s become literally true; according to the Washington Post, the tragedy today in Roseburg, Ore., brings the total of mass shootings, in which four or more people are killed or injured, to 294. Thursday was the 274th day of the year. Whenever something like this happened, I used to drop what I was doing and monitor media coverage, looking for some kind of meaning. In retrospect, that probably wasn’t the best place to look. And not just because cable news goes into what-it-all-means mode, which quickly gives way to grandstanding and agenda pushing. No, ultimately it was a dead end because there is no meaning. You can’t be inside the head of every shooter. What’s more, you can’t rationally explain why we continue to allow this to happen. We can look to social media, which has supplanted traditional news coverage as the go-to way to experience big events, for clues. But like everything else about the coverage of these events, it’s become predictable, too. USA TODAY Up to 13 killed by shooter at Ore. community college First there is the report of what happened. Details are added as the story develops, some accurate, some not. Things sort out and then the fights begin. Gun-control opponents warn that it’s not a good time to debate laws, it’s too soon to talk about the politics of it all; let’s let the families mourn. That actually worked for a while, but soon gun-control advocates began saying that there is never a good time, so we might as well jump in now. This goes back and forth for a while, President Obama is mentioned — praised or vilified, again predictably depending on your political leanings — and … we move on. We move on. How strange is that? At one time, we might have said this was a coping mechanism. But that’s no longer true. Now it’s just routine. That sounds cold, heartless. But can you name the shooter in any of the more-recent tragedies? Or even where they took place? We aren’t numb to it, exactly. We’re numb to tragedies in the Middle East or Africa. In the United States, at least, we still bother to become outraged enough to tweet a thought or two before going back to whatever else is trending. STATESMAN JOURNAL Obama: 'Our thoughts and prayers are not enough' I’m not a social scientist, but I am an observer of human behavior and I would suggest that any possible scenario in which something like the shooting death of at least 10 people at a community college becomes routine means something is seriously wrong. How do we fix it? Stop making it so easy for disturbed people to get access to guns is a start. But it’s hardly the only solution. Something has to give. We can’t give up on outrage and heartbreak. Not as media, and not as a society. A story like today’s still has to shock us. It still has to move us. And it has to make us do something to stop this insanity. Events become newsworthy in part because they’re rare. They don’t happen every day. Mass shootings do. And that’s a story that has to change.

The letter was circulated by multiple Twitter users and also reported by Mother Jones.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQR7TT8WUAABlgY.jpg Hanlin said in a press conference on Thursday that he would not name the shooter who opened fire at the UCC. “I will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice,” he said.

Mercer killed at least nine people and wounded seven Thursday at the college in southwest Oregon. Mercer’s ex-neighbors at an apartment complex in Torrance, California, said they had seen him and his mother carry black cases that they suspected contained firearms. The residents of the Arlington Avenue complex recalled, after Thursday’s incident, that they had asked Mercer if he owned guns, but he often deflected. “It's hard to believe,” David Westly, one of the neighbors, told the Los Angeles Times. Another resident, Derrick McClendon, 42, said: ""I wouldn't have suspected him to be a troubled person … I'm surprised and shocked, I really am.” The Los Angeles Times also reported about a MySpace profile of Chris Harper Mercer from Torrance that showed a young man with a barrel of a rifle pointing up into the frame of his portrait. “Me, holding a rifle,” the caption reportedly read. “It was supposed to be all the way in the picture, but it didn't work out.” Mercer’s relative, who did not want to be named, reportedly said that he lived with his mother for “most of his life” in Torrance, and had recently moved to Oregon. The relative described Mercer as “quiet.” According to a law enforcement source, FBI agents in Los Angeles reportedly visited Torrance to interview the people Mercer knew when he lived there a few years ago. Investigators are working to build a profile of Mercer’s history, beliefs and prior behavior, to help determine the motive of the rampage. Religion may have been a motivating factor for Mercer’s actions, the New York Times reported. Mercer, who later died, reportedly asked about people's religion before opening fire at the community college, one witness said. He had four weapons -- three handguns and one rifle, according to reports. It was not clear if Mercer was killed by authorities or took his own life. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official told the New York Times. Residents gathered at a Roseburg, Oregon, park for a vigil for the victims of the deadly mass shooting, with many holding candles as the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" was played, the Associated Press reported late Thursday.",2015-10-02 02:15:24,Did Chris Harper Mercer Practice Target Shooting?

Mercer, 26, has been identified as the person responsible for shooting dead at least nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon Thursday. Mercer died during an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement officials on the campus. Soon after the news of the latest mass shooting emerged, people began highlighting a series of comments posted on an obscure forum called r9k of the notorious message board 4chan. The message, posted just after midnight Thursday, read: ""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. So long space robots."" The New York Times reported that federal law enforcement officials said they were examining a conversation on 4chan as well as other social media to try to determine if any of these were linked to Mercer. The message, which is archived here, immediately raised the possibility that the anonymous poster was Mercer. However, given the inherently anonymous nature of 4chan, it is impossible to quickly verify the identity of the person behind the post. Responses to the message encourage the person to carry out the attack with some even giving tips on how to carry out such an attack. ""I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun,"" one of the comments read. In the wake of the shooting, members of r9k forum, which is predominantly made up of people who identify as socially awkward and loners, began trolling media outlets by creating fake profiles to try and trick them into reporting them. The motive behind the shooting is unknown with investigators attempting to piece together any evidence from the people who knew Mercer, including his former neighbors who revealed that he enjoyed target shooting. A MySpace profile of Chris Harper Mercer shows a young man with a barrel of a rifle pointing up into the frame of his portrait with the caption: ""Me, holding a rifle. It was supposed to be all the way in the picture, but it didn't work out.” Following the shooting, President Barack Obama delivered a strong message to the pro-gun lobby, calling once again for more sensible gun laws and tasked the media with highlighting the number of deaths from gun violence compared to terrorism in recent years. ""As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough.

Investigators also discovered four rifles, two pistols, and a shotgun at the shooter’s home. Although Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin refused to say his name and “give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice,” the shooter was identified by multiple media outlets, citing anonymous law enforcement sources, as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Mercer was reclusive and introverted, according to descriptions based on his online presence and neighbors at the apartment complex where he apparently lived. At a press conference Friday, Hanlin and his team said that all the firearms were purchased legally, some by the shooter and others by a family member. Sheriff Hanlin said there were a total of ten fatalities, including the shooter. Among Mercer’s weapons were a 9mm Glock pistol and a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, according to the report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He also had a .40-caliber pistol that was traced to a different person in Portland. Investigators suspect he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the crime scene shows he purchased textbooks on campus two days before the shooting, according to the AP. Mercer was born in the U.K. before moving to the U.S. at a young age, Carmen Nesnick — whose mother married his father a few years ago — told CBS News Los Angeles. Although she had only met Mercer a few times and last spoke to him a year ago, Nesnick described her stepbrother as “caring and supportive.” Police on Thursday night surrounded the apartment building in nearby Winchester — four miles from the college — that is believed to be Mercer’s place of residence after he moved there from Torrance, Cal. “I just started noticing him the last 4-6 months, there’s a playground out behind the apartments, and we’re on the second story. I go outside to smoke and I watch for anyone,” Steven Fisher, a neighbor, told Reuters. “Around 5-5:30 in the evening I’d see him out there with a couple kids. He seemed skittish, always looking over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching,” Fisher said, adding that he had never spoken to Mercer. Both Fisher and another neighbor said they recognized the young assailant from circulated photographs that appeared on a profile purportedly belonging to him on social network MySpace. The photos show a man with a shaved head and glasses looking into the camera while holding a long-barrel gun. Several other photos on the profile depict masked gunmen and symbols of the Irish Republican Army, while another profile on dating website Spiritual Passions says he “Doesn’t Like Organized Religion” and is “shy at first, but warm up quickly.” The username on the dating profile, IRONCROSS45, is also part of an email address — ironcross45@gmail.com — that has been traced back to Mercer at his Winchester address. There are suspicions that the username may be a reference to a Nazi military symbol, and multiple reports said someone with the same handle had purchased Nazi memorabilia online. The email is also reportedly linked to the profile of one Lithium_Love on torrent-sharing website KickAssTorrents, where a linked blog post talks about Vester Flanagan — the man who gunned down two television journalists on camera in late August. “On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are,” the post reads. “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.” The latest activity on the torrent account was a video uploaded on Tuesday, a BBC documentary about the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 people — most of them children under the age of 10 — lost their lives. Former neighbors from Torrance, where Mercer lived before moving to Oregon, described him as a reserved young man who was almost inseparable from his mother and wore the same outfit (a white t-shirt with green army pants and combat boots) every day. “He always seemed anxious,” 51-year-old Rosario Lucumi, who remembers frequently riding the same bus as him, told the New York Times. “He always had earphones in, listening to music.” Others in the neighborhood said Mercer’s mother, Laurel Harper, would go door-to-door complaining about a variety of nuisances like pet dogs, children playing loudly and cockroaches. She reportedly claimed they bothered her son, who was apparently dealing with “some mental issues.” When Brian Clay, 18, once asked Mercer why he wore “military get-up” all the time, he says he didn’t get a straight answer. “He kind of just didn’t want to talk about it” and quickly changed the subject, Clay told the Times. “He didn’t say anything about himself.” Ian Mercer, the gunman’s father who reportedly divorced Harper in 2006 and now lives in Tarzana, Cal., told reporters outside his residence Thursday night there that he was “as shocked as anybody” at his son’s alleged crime. “I can’t answer any questions right now. I don’t want to answer any questions right now,” he said. “Obviously, it’s been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family.” Write to Rishi Iyengar at rishi.iyengar@timeasia.com.",2015-10-02 05:26:00,What We Know So Far About the Oregon Shooter,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

Records show Harper-Mercer lived in a ground-floor apartment on Arlington Avenue at 230th Street in Torrance with his mother, Laurel Harper, from 2011 to 2013. The owner of the building said he did not know them, and neighbors did not recall them. But current residents, who had reporters knocking at their doors late Thursday, were shocked to learn that the man suspected of committing the nation’s latest mass shooting had lived in their building. “It’s extremely surreal,” said resident Shannon Medrano. “I don’t remember him. If I could see a picture of his mom maybe it could jog some memory. I wonder what his experience was like here. This is not a big building. I’m sure we crossed paths at some point.” Lists of Daily Breeze graduates from 2009 showed Harper-Mercer graduated from the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance with four other students. Switzer teaches students with learning disabilities and emotional issues. Records showed they moved to Winchester, Ore., in 2013. Medrano said it was shocking to learn Harper-Mercer shot his victims after asking them if they were Christian. “I wonder what happened in his life that brought him to that point,” Medrano said. “It’s heartbreaking.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2015-10-01 02:00:00,Oregon massacre gunman formerly lived in Southern California,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

          / CBS News Heroes and survivors are emerging from Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon that killed 10, including the gunman, and critically injured seven others, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villareal. According to his family, Chris Mintz didn't run away from the gunfire. The army veteran charged towards the gunman instead, trying to protect his classmates. ""Tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming in, gets shot three times, hits the floor, looks up at gunman and says, 'it's my son's birthday today,' gets shot two more times,"" said his aunt, Wanta Mintz. Mintz survived the shooting -- but spent most of the day in surgery. ""His vital signs are okay. He's going to have to learn to walk again but he walked away with his life and that's more than so many other people did,"" said his cousin, Ariana Earnhardt. According to Army records, Mintz served from October 2004 to March 2007 in the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade and the 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis (Joint Base Lewis-McChord), Washington. Records show he earned numerous awards, including a National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and Army Service Ribbon. Student Anastasia Bboylan also survived the shooting but is in critical condition, after a bullet passed near her spine. Her family told CBS News she has movement in her legs. All shooting victims were initially brought to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. Three female patients were then tranposrted north to another hospital in Springfield. Students and community members of the small town gathered at a candlelight vigil for the victims Thursday night, and were still visibly shaken. ""I heard a couple loud noises, our whole class heard them,"" said Angel Ardito. ""I didn't hear any gunshots, I heard screaming,"" said Hannah Lee.

Speculation that the shooter, 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, was motivated by hate have gained traction since witnesses have reported that they heard Mercer ask victims about their religion, specifically targeting Christians in a classroom. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” a law enforcement official told the New York Times. The official motive of the shooting remained unknown Friday morning, as investigators began meeting people who knew Mercer. The shooting at Umpqua Community College left at least 10 people dead and injured seven others at the southwest Oregon campus. Mercer was killed in a firefight with law enforcement. Little is known about Mercer, but relatives described the gunman, who reportedly lived with his mother, as quiet. Mercer carried with him three handguns, one rifle and body armor.

68,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/BjOkbaaiUho/,"President Barack Obama‘s emotional statement Thursday evening marked the 15th time the president addressed the nation in the aftermath of a mass shooting during his time in the White House. But Obama’s message was markedly different from previous incidents, encouraging Americans to politicize the issue to reform the nation’s gun laws. “This is something we should politicize,” Obama said, warning the nation was growing “numb” to the “routine” shootings which don’t occur with such frequency in any other advanced country. At one point, Obama encouraged gun owners to rethink their relationship with the powerful National Rifle Association. The call for new reforms remains a political pipe-dream, especially under Obama’s tenure. But the president’s comments reflected his “fourth quarter” mentality, in which he feels freed from the political limits of re-election that allow him to speak his mind. The détente between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio was always more of a media creation that a reality, but the gloves are now officially off, with the one-time mentor openly criticizing the younger, better-liked, freshman senator. On Thursday, Bush said only time would tell whether Rubio was prepared to be president, drawing a comparison to his sharing Obama’s previous status as a first-term lawmaker. And he’s criticized members of Congress for skipping votes, something Rubio does with proclivity as he travels the country running for president. Bush’s super PAC was caught trying to “track” Rubio at a campaign event, a standard practice when it is looking for footage with which to attack the candidate. Democratic and Republican lawmakers announced an accord on high-profile criminal justice reform legislation Thursday which may be the only substantive legislation to move through the divided Congress in the coming months. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew informed Congress Thursday that the federal government will run out of “extraordinary measures” to work around the debt limit on Nov. 5, weeks earlier than previously predicted.

But honestly this is not a normal situation for me. I haven’t had the time to feel, let alone think, about everything that’s happened. I’m sure that’s true for many people out there. So, right now, we can only express our grief for the people who are lost. I guess I can do what I do best, and that’s try to make people laugh. Let’s do our show.” Ten people were murdered in the shooting, which happened in Roseburg, Oregon. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,” President Barack Obama said in an address about the killings on Thursday night. “It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache, grief and anger we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America, next week or a couple of months from now.” Watch Noah discuss the shooting below.

73,http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/oregon-shooter-left-behind-online-portrait-of-a-lonely-youth-with-a-grudge/2248046,"As the horrific details of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., slowly came together like a grisly jigsaw puzzle, one crucial piece remained missing. A portrait of the shooter. Federal law enforcement officials identified the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer of the nearby town of Winchester. But information about Mercer remained fragmented as of Friday morning, much of it scattered online like a shredded photograph. His family has so far declined to comment. His father, Ian Harper, told reporters simply that he was ""shocked"" by the news of his son's acts. Many of the scraps of information about Mercer uncovered so far by the media did not fit together easily and there was no immediate way to be sure that the various social media and Internet utterances and postings that appeared to come from him actually did. WATCH THE VIDEO: Shooter's family in shock Mercer was mixed race, according to an Internet dating profile that appeared to come from him, yet his email address referenced an iron cross, a symbol often associated with Nazis. He described himself as a ""lover,"" but posed with guns and posted photos glorifying violence. But two things are increasingly clear. Mercer was a quiet, withdrawn young man who struggled to connect with other people, instead seeking attention online or, ultimately, through violence. ""Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight,"" he wrote in a blog expressing admiration for Roanoke, Va., shooter Vester Flanagan, according to the Daily Beast. And for reasons unknown, he apparently bore a deadly grudge against organized religion. ""Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual"" he wrote on one dating website, also listing membership in a group called ""Doesn't Like Organized Religion."" On Thursday morning, those two aspects of his personality apparently drove Mercer to go on a rampage, shooting at least 16 people at Umpqua Community College, killing nine and injuring seven. According to survivors, Mercer asked his hostages if they were Christians. ""The shooter was lining people up and asking if they were Christian. If they said yes, then they were shot in the head. If they said no or didn't answer, they were shot in the legs,"" a witness said in a text message to the Roseburg Beacon News, according to its publisher. Yet, the picture of Mercer remains murky. Some of the confusion is deliberate. During a press briefing Thursday evening, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin refused to name Mercer, saying that doing so would ""give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice."" Hanlin appeared to be referencing a growing movement that argues against naming mass shooters. Survivors and victims' family members believe naming the culprits only encourages copycats. Little is known about Mercer, who records show moved to the Roseburg area with his mother in 2013. He was born in the United Kingdom and came to the United States as a young boy, his stepsister Carmen Nesnick, told CBS Los Angeles. Mercer moved to California, where he attended the Switzer Center. The school in Torrance serves ""students from 3rd grade to 22 years of age who have moderate to severe learning disabilities, emotional issues, attention problems and behavioral disorders,"" according to the Switzer Center's Web site. A graduation ad printed in the Daily Breeze, the local newspaper for Los Angeles County's South Bay region, lists a ""Chris Harper-Mercer"" as a member of the Switzer Center's class of 2009. Rick Rada, a classmate who graduated from the school the same year as Mercer, spoke to the Washington Post over the phone late Thursday evening. ""To me Chris was just an ordinary guy, really,"" Rada said. Rada would not say if Mercer had a learning disability or behavioral disorder, but he said his classmate ""was one of the silent types, like me."" ""Everyone in the school knew who each other was,"" said Rada, who, with Mercer, was part of a graduating class of just five people. ""Some made fun of others, others made fun of others. You know?"" Despite being a silent kid, Mercer could be coaxed into opening up, Rada said. ""He opened up with the teachers, talked to them, had fun,"" he said. Mercer was ""smart"" and could be ""cheerful"" at times, Rada said. But Mercer also had a harder streak. ""He actually broke up a couple of fights back in those days,"" Rada said. ""A certain female student would have a problem with a male student. He would step in and defend them."" Rada occasionally saw Mercer at Switzer's annual reunions. The last time they spoke was at a reunion several years ago, where Rada noticed nothing out of the ordinary. ""I saw him and said 'Hey what's up?' And he said 'Oh, good.' After that we just went on with the event and went our separate ways,"" Rada told the Post. ""I don't really know why he did what he did."" That portrait of Mercer as a quiet guy capable of violence is backed up by online profiles that appear to belong to the gunman. They sketch out an image of a young man who struggled to connect with people in real life, so he reached out online. ""Looking for someone who shares my beliefs, and is similar to me,"" he wrote on a dating profile on a website called Spiritual Passions. The profile hints at Mercer's social anxiety. ""Shy at first, but warm up quickly, better in small groups,"" he wrote. Under ""personality,"" he wrote: ""lover, conservative, professional, intellectual, introvert."" Mercer wrote that he was looking for ""romance, soulmate, conversation, miss right now, the yin to my yang, dating, penpal, friends only, relationship, miss right."" The profile, apparently created while he was living in California, listed his musical interests as ""Industrial, Punk, Rock"" and said that he didn't drink or do drugs. But that same profile also hinted at darker interests. He favored horror movies along with other cinematic genres, it said. And under hobbies, Mercer wrote ""killing zombies"" along with ""internet"" and other pursuits. Under food, he added ""Always Dieting, BRAINS!!!"" And in the clearest foreshadowing of Thursday's attack, the profile stated that Mercer was ""Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual"" and belonged to a group called ""Doesn't Like Organized Religion."" Another account, also linked to his email account, showed similar interests. ""I'm 20 years old, in college, I like to listen to music, mostly goth/punk/industrial/electronic, and I love to watch movies,"" he wrote on a website called Morgue Penpals. ""Horror movies are the best, but i also like some action films, depending on the type, and I like crime dramas as well."" A clearer glimpse into Mercer's mindset ahead of Thursday's attack comes from his MySpace account. An account associated with the same email address features photographs of him holding a rifle alongside posters for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). One of the images is a magazine cover from an Irish newspaper with the headline ""British army could not defeat IRA."" Another poster, depicting black-and-white armed figures wearing balaclavas, quotes hunger-striker Bobby Sands: ""They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn't want to be broken."" But the starkest sign that something was wrong appeared in a blog that praised Roanoke shooter Vester Flanagan. According to the Daily Beast, the blog was linked to Mercer's email address. ""I have to say, anyone who knew him could have seen this coming,"" the blogger, identified by the Daily Beast as Mercer, wrote. ""People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned him."" ""On an interesting note,"" the blog continues ominously, ""I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. . . A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" Neighbors in both California and Oregon said they saw signs of a militaristic bent and angry attitude from Mercer. His head was shaved and he wore military-style green pants with black boots, neighbors told the Los Angeles Times and New York Times. Several neighbors said they had seen Mercer and his mother carrying black cases that appeared to hold firearms while living in Torrance. When neighbors asked him about the weapons at a community BBQ, Mercer didn't respond but said he enjoyed going target shooting, neighbor David Westly told the Los Angeles Times. Torrance residents told the newspaper that Mercer and his mother, a nurse, were quiet people who kept to themselves. ""She would go around knocking on neighbor's doors,"" Rosario Lucumi told the Times. ""She would call him 'baby' all the time. I thought it was strange because he was an adult."" ""He was always moving around"" as if unsettled, Lucumi said. ""It's like he was always anxious or nervous,"" added her daughter, Rosario Espinoza. On one occasion, Mercer's mother went door-to-door with a petition to get the landlord to exterminate cockroaches. ""She said, 'My son is dealing with some mental issues, and the roaches are really irritating him,'"" Julia Winstead told the New York Times. ""I never saw him with friends or a girlfriend,"" another neighbor, Derrick McClendon, told the Los Angeles Times. ""He was bashful and timid."" Neighbors in Winchester described a similarly agitated young man, but angrier. ""He yelled at us, me and my husband,"" Bronte Hart, told the New York Times. ""He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone."" She told the Associated Press that Mercer would ""sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" Hart said that a woman she believed to be Mercer's mother lived with him and was ""crying her eyes out"" Thursday. Steven Fisher, another Winchester neighbor, described Mercer as ""skittish."" ""His demeanor, the way he moved, always looking around,"" Fisher told CNN. ""I got a bad vibe from him."" ""He was a little odd, like sensitive to things,"" Rebecca Miles, who took a theater class at UCC with Mercer, told CNN. It's still unclear how those elements - anxiety, loneliness, a distaste for religion and a taste for guns - added up to an alleged killer. A hint could lie on the anonymous web forum 4chan. A message was posted on Wednesday night warning: ""Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest."" ""Some of you guys are alright,"" the anonymous user wrote. ""so long space robots."" On Thursday afternoon, the thread was flooded with responses. ""THE MADMAN ACTUALLY DID IT,"" one wrote. Authorities are now investigating the threat, according to the New York Times. It's unclear if the anonymous warning actually came from Mercer, a young man who apparently felt more comfortable sharing online than he did in real life. But Mercer's actions matched the carnage predicted on the message board. On Thursday morning, the misfit interrupted a class at UCC's Snyder Hall, wearing a dark shirt and jeans and spewing bullets from multiple guns. Students told of hiding between desks and huddling in darkness as the shooter methodically sought out victims. ""There's a shooter! Run! Run! Get out of there!"" groups of students screamed as they ran out of the building. Some hid under cars or tried to hold shut classroom doors. Witnesses told Roseburg's local paper, the News-Review, and CNN that Mercer asked students in the classroom he entered to stand up and state their religion. According to CNN, victim Anastasia Boylan told her father before she went into surgery that Mercer said to the students who identified as Christian, ""'Good, because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second.'"" Mercer was killed in a shootout with police. Four guns were recovered from the crime scene, including three pistols and a type of semiautomatic rifle, people familiar with the investigation told the Post. A law enforcement official told CNN that the shooter had body armor with him and had enough ammunition for a prolonged gunfight. Mercer's family has so far been tight-lipped about the atrocity. Ian Harper, the suspect's father, briefly stepped outside of his Los Angeles home Thursday night and spoke with the Los Angeles Times. He said he couldn't answer any questions about his son or the shooting. ""Shocked is all I can say,"" he said. ""It's been a devastating day.""",2015-10-02 09:07:59,Oregon shooter left behind online portrait of a lonely youth with a grudge against religion,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

Now we must protect our country from those who misuse it Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST America’s gun violence, like our grief in Oregon, seems to know no bounds, no limits, no end. The reason is deadly simple: our very lives are chained to a constitutional amendment that is willfully misinterpreted by many and perverted by gun rights advocates for political ends.  That sullied amendment is the United States constitution’s Second Amendment which states, “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” The gun industry and its supporters have turned that simple statement into a clever marketing tool, and Americans are paying the price in blood. On Thursday, Roseburg, Oregon – a three-hour drive south of the Oregon’s largest city, Portland – was rocked by a deadly mass shooting that wounded seven people and took the lives of 10 others, including the gunman. Students were in classes at Umpqua Community College when a 26-year-old gunman shattered their world when he opened fire on them. They are, sadly, not unique: hardly a week has passed in the last three years without a mass shooting. For 15 years, Ceasefire Oregon has fought the gun lobby – and people like Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin, the gun rights advocate who is investigating this latest shooting – and worked to pass reasonable, effective gun laws. Hanlin is one of many who claim that the answer to gun violence is to help those who have mental health problems while the rest of us stock up on guns and ammo. Hanlin, gun extremists and groups like the National Rifle Association have scapegoated people with mental health problems for years – but they know that such people are far more likely to be victims of violence than the perpetrators of it (and far more likely to kill themselves than other people). Gun rights advocates also claim that we need more guns to protect ourselves from gun violence. But with 310m firearms in the US, and despite the fact that one in every three Americans owns guns, more guns are not making us safer. After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, we at Ceasefire Oregon worked with Moms Demand Action, Everytown for Gun Safety, Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership, the Brady Campaign and the Oregon Alliance for Gun Safety to pass a background check law despite opposition from a few Democratic legislators and a few Oregon sheriffs, including Hanlin. And, after years of work, Oregon finally passed a bill requiring background checks for almost all gun sales last spring. But gun violence is a cancer in our nation and, just as no single drug will cure all cancers, no single gun law will cure all gun violence. Rather, we need comprehensive, effective legislation and caring, courageous leadership to change both America’s laws and Americans’ views on guns and gun violence. Too often, gun control advocates hear that nothing can be done to change things in this country, but that’s just not true. Gun violence prevention researchers and advocates know that we can reduce gun violence by passing effective, common-sense laws, like background checks for all gun sales to stop criminals and those with demonstrated mental health issues and histories of violence from buying guns. Waiting periods between the time of gun purchase and possession can provide purchasers with a cooling-off period to help deter homicide and suicide. Instituting gun violence restraining orders can reduce violence by allowing family members and law enforcement to remove a gun from a loved one who is exhibiting warning signs of violence. We can require – or at least heavily incentivize through liability statutes – that firearms be kept secured at all times with trigger locks or in a safe. We can reduce gun trafficking by allowing people to purchase only one gun per month. We can reinstate the federal assault weapons ban to ban the purchase and possession of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles, which are not necessary for the most dedicated home-defender or hunter. And Americans can refuse to support lawmakers of any party who do not support “gun-sense” laws – like background checks, higher standards for gun ownership and funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms – at the ballot box. We can challenge all 2016 presidential candidates to issue a plan to cut gun violence by 50% before 2020 (the final year of the next president’s first term in office), and Ceasefire has done so. We are citizens of a great nation, but our children, our mothers, our fathers and our friends are being mowed down, fed to the gun industry’s insatiable appetite for profit. Our founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect our country. Now we must protect our country from those who pervert the Second Amendment. We know this can be done. We know this must be done. Our national nightmare of paying into the gun lobby’s profit machine must be brought to an end.",2015-10-02 10:25:26,Guns kill people in the US because we pervert the Second Amendment | Penny Okamoto,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

84,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-oregon-shooting-huppke-20151002-story.html,"Here are a few facts: • Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people and wounded nine others at a community college in Oregon. • There have been 294 mass shootings — defined as a shooting in which four or more people are killed or wounded — this year. Today is only the 275th day of the year. • The Washington Post calculated that during President Barack Obama's second term, not a single Sunday-to-Saturday calendar week has passed without a mass shooting. The political response to these facts? Prayers for the families of the dead, with many of those prayers disbursed via tweets from politicians' Twitter accounts. Here are some more facts: • A series of undercover videos released this year have attempted to paint the women's health organization Planned Parenthood as a soulless operation that sells the body parts of aborted fetuses to tissue procurement companies for profit. The edited versions of the videos, as well as the full videos that have been released, are disturbing but at no point provide proof that the organization is profiting from fetal tissue donation, which is legal under federal law. • Missouri recently became the sixth state to investigate Planned Parenthood on these allegations and find no evidence of wrongdoing. • Abortions account for 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides, and by law, no federal money can be used to fund those services. • The vast majority of the money Planned Parenthood receives from the government is Medicaid reimbursement for services ranging from breast exams to pregnancy tests to tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Cutting off federal funding would impact those services. The political response to these facts? Outrage, and calls that the government be shut down until Planned Parenthood is defunded. Tweeted prayers in response to mass shootings. A government shutdown in response to disturbing but suspect videos. Taking nothing away from those who oppose abortion, this is a wildly disproportionate response. I'm not saying abortion opponents should temper their passion, not at all. I'm just wondering how it is that certain people and politicians can be so incensed by an act that they view as murder, and so resigned — thinking a head bent down in prayer is action enough — to an act that everyone agrees is murder. People can hold different views on when life begins. But there can be no argument over when the life of a victim of gun violence ends. It ends moments after the gun is fired. If you're willing to shut down the government because you believe the allegations of an activist group with a clear agenda, what are you willing to do when confronted with the indisputable fact that Americans are being indiscriminately gunned down in places they once felt safe? The answer, apparently, is that you're willing to send your prayers out on Twitter. And that, clearly, is not doing a damn bit of good. rhuppke@tribpub.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2015-10-02 10:41:00,Oregon shooting v.

Cooke apeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" this morning to discuss the president's immediate call for more gun laws following the deadly mass shooting in Oregon yesterday morning.

The debate between Cooke and Bloomberg's Mark Halperin gets heated after Cook stumps Halperin by asking for one specific gun control policy that the U.S. should try.

""I completely agree with the president,"" Halperin said. ""People need to find solutions to this and not talk about what won't work, and why it's so complicated. We can't be the only country in the world that's like this...""

""Then, with respect, what is your plan?"" Cooke asks.

""Finding solutions, short term, in terms of finding legislation, state and federal, coming up with ideas--"" sputters Halperin.

""Which ideas?"" Cooke quickly follows up. 

Halperin gives up the pretense of attempting to come up with ideas: ""I'm not an expert in this field, I'm trying to be civil, not to criticize or attack you, but as I listen to your tone... I want everybody in the country to be saying we need to find solutions, not talk about how complicaed it is... We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity or how the ther side's ideas aren't good.""

""So you don't have any more ideas that I do, we've now established that,"" responds Cooke. ""It is complicated, and it is difficult, and there are no ideas. What I'm suggesting is that Mark Halperin and President Obama and Biden and now you keep saying we need to do something, and that is it. What? ... At least we could have a debate, what is it you are proposing?""

At this point, Howard Dean jumps in to the conversation and proposes making gun sellers liable for selling to potential criminals. 

""And now we can have a debate,"" jokes Cooke.

Transcript (part one) 

CHARLES CW COOKE: There's a difference in saying, ""are we upset? Yes, we are,"" and, ""is the president upset? Yes he is,"" and does the president have the slightest clue to fix this. 

Let's look at what he proposed in the past: universal background checks. Oregon had background checks as you said. 

The argument for universal background checks is that guns can come in from other states, but that is an anti-crime measure. No mass shooter seems to get their guns in any sense that would intersect with private sales. They either buy them from a dealer or get them illegally. 

Obama also wanted a ban on assault rifles, that doesn't seem to have much of an effect either; the shooter had three hand guns...

We have a problem in the United States with stopping contraband. We have never done it effectively. Not during the prohibition, the drug war. If anything, if you look at the way our police attitudes are changing, we're more reluctant to go after people, especially minorities and those more vulnerable, and search them, check them for items, drugs, guns we don't want them to have...

It's not true that the majority of mass killers and serial killers are white. It's equally distributed. What they are always is men. Always young men. What we have in America is a problem with young men killing a lot of people when they get the chance and I think an increasing copy cat problem because at some point someone decided hey, when you're upset with people you feel as if you're alone, you can do this...

It is distributed across all races evenly... but women do not commit these sorts of things...

If we want to focus on one thing, it should be this: Why are young men between 15-30 taking out their anger and sense of isolation on schools and other soft targets. There's a copy cat problem, but there is also a problem with masculinity, which is part of this sort of violence.

MARK HALPERIN:  There's no question this is a difficult problem. I want to engage Charles a little bit in a civil way. 

You know, everyone in the country in a leadership position, journalism, politics, etc. should have a thirst and hunger and passion to try to come up with solutions. To just talk about how other people's solutions won't work, or this is a complicated sociological issue. I don't think that's enough. I completely agree with the vice president. people need to find solutions to this and not talk about what won't work, and it's so complicated. We can't be the only country in the world that's like this...

CHARLES COOKE: Then, with respect, what is your plan?

MARK HALPERIN: Finding solutions, short term, in terms of finding legislation, state and federal, coming up with ideas--

CHARLES COOKE: Which ideas?

MARK HELPERIN: Well, we can talk about specific policies in a minute, but here's a second point. You say part of the issue involves young men. Well, again, public policy people should come up with long term ideas to deal with the question of what is causing young men to do this. 

CHARLES COOKE: So you don't have any more ideas that I do, we've now established that.

HALPERIN: I'm not an expert in this field, I'm trying to be civil, not to criticize or attack you, but as I listen to your tone... I want everybody in the country to be saying we need to find solutions, not talk about how complicaed it is... We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity or how the ther side's ideas aren't good. 

COOKE: It is complicated, and it is difficult, and there are no ideas.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Well what are you saying, no one has the answer? No one can do anything, so let's not do anything. 

COOKE: What I'm suggesting is that Mark Halperin and President Obama and Biden and now you keep saying we need to do something, and that is it. What? ... At least we could have a debate, what is it you are proposing? 

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I agreed with the Vice President, sorry. 

COOKE: He didn't make any proposals.

HOWARD DEAN: I think I can be helpful... First of all, universal background checks might be helpful...

You make the people who sell guns to people who are crazy liable in law suits, criminal prosecutiins, that might help, putting dealers onthe hook... There are ways we can put pressure on people who supply the guns... To make them understand they have some responsibility to who they sell to.

86,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/hT9mEjuiJ88/,"Taking President Obama’s cue, Democratic lawmakers have seized on Thursday’s deadly shooting at an Oregon’s Umpqua Community College to bring gun control to the forefront of the national conversation. Connecticut Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy announced new legislation Friday morning in Hartford, Connecticut that would bar gun sales until background checks are complete. Currently, if a background check isn’t completed within 72 hours, then a gun can be sold without the check. In what Blumenthal called a “tragic and sad coincidence,” the press conference had been scheduled weeks before Thursday’s shooting in Oregon occurred. Blumenthal compared mass shootings to a public health crisis in the country, and called his bill a “fairly modest” step towards addressing the epidemic. “These commonsense measures closing loopholes can make a difference as a matter of life and death,” he said, noting that 15,729 ineligible people have been able to purchase guns under the current rules once their waiting periods expired. Murphy, who was noticeably incensed as he spoke, took his language a step further. “Congress has become an accomplice in these murders,” he said. “We are quietly endorsing this mass slaughter by refusing to act.” He did not stop there. “I don’t care how many members of Congress send out tweets saying they’re sorry,” he said. “You aren’t sorry, you aren’t truly sympathetic if you’re not willing to act.” The Connecticut Senators were far from the only Democratic lawmakers who wrapped a call for gun control into their condolences after Thursday’s attack. Maryland Senator Ben Cardin put out a statement calling for Congress to “act swiftly on requiring universal background checks for firearms buyers. We must also take steps to strengthen our mental health system and reduce the glorification of violence in our culture. We absolutely should move to ban assault weapons and prohibit high-capacity ammunition clips. The inability to take these small steps is perhaps of one of the greatest failings of Congress.” Other lawmakers were more general in their statements of support for gun control. California Senator Barbara Boxer said, “We cannot close our eyes to this epidemic of gun violence that is erupting in our schools, our workplaces, our movie theaters, our military bases and in our communities. How many more mass shootings must we endure before we take sensible action to address gun violence in this country?” While Nevada Senator Harry Reid said simply: “Americans want us to act. We cannot dodge this conversation forever.” The issue also rose in the race for the Democratic nomination for President. Vermont Senator and 2016 candidate Bernie Sanders said, “We need a comprehensive approach. We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help they need when they need it. We also have to tone down the incredibly high level of gratuitous violence which permeates our media.” In an interview with Boston ABC affiliate WCVB shortly after she had heard of the shooting, former Secretary of State and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said, “I’m sick about it, and I feel an absolute urgency for this country to start being sensible about keeping guns away from people who should not have them. I’m going to be pushing this issue. Universal background checks, a long enough waiting period so that people can’t sneak in under the deadline because the full investigation wasn’t completed.” Former Maryland Governor and 2016 contender Martin O’Malley tweeted: There isn’t any imminent path for gun control legislation to be voted on in Congress. Republican leaders have made clear in the recent past they have no interest in pursuing new legislation. Thursday’s shooting, which claimed ten lives, marked the fifteenth time Barack Obama has addressed a mass shooting during his presidency.

87,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114925061/0/phoenix/nation~Education-Secretary-Arne-Duncan-to-step-down/,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a member of President Obama's original Cabinet, will step down in December and be replaced by deputy John B. King Jr., Obama announced Friday. Duncan has ""done more to bring our educational system, sometimes kicking and screaming, into the 21st century than anybody else,"" Obama said during the White House ceremony. Obama, who described Duncan as a longtime friend as well as valued adviser, said he accepted the decision to step down ""with some regret."" His replacement, King, has been ""an educator all his life,"" and will carry on Duncan's work, Obama said. Appearing at the event, Duncan — who choked up while talking about his parents and his family — said it has been ""an unbelievable honor"" be Education secretary, and he praised Obama for his ""moral leadership."" King, who said he is ""humbled"" to be following Duncan, pledged to follow through on an ""aggressive agenda"" that includes expanding childhood education, raising standards in kindergarten through high school, increasing access to higher education, and helping teachers. Duncan's departure is scheduled for December. Officials said the administration plans to have King serve in an acting capacity without a formal nomination to the secretary's post. That eliminates the possibility of a contentious confirmation hearing before the Republican-run Senate. In an email to staff members earlier Friday, Duncan described his service at the Education Department as ""the greatest honor of my life."" Among his legacies: The ""Race to the Top"" program in which states competed for federal grants, and an emphasis on K-12 education. Some Republicans criticized Duncan for what they called federal overreach into decisions that should be made by local school officials. In his email, Duncan also noted that his family has remained in his hometown of Chicago, and being apart from them ""has become too much of a strain."" USA TODAY Duncan: Find other paths for non-violent offenders, spend savings on teacher raises Duncan said he doesn't know what he will do next, but ""I imagine my next steps will continue to involve the work of expanding opportunity for children, but I have no idea what that will look like yet."" King, a former education commissioner in New York state, has been a backer of Common Core, a set of new learning standards embraced by many education professionals. Many Republicans, including some GOP presidential candidates, oppose Common Core, describing it as too much federal meddling. Duncan, a former head of the Chicago public schools system, is one of the few Cabinet members to have a personal relationship with Obama. The former basketball player at Harvard has often played hoops with the president. While praising Duncan's basketball skills, Obama joked that the secretary is kind of ""slow,"" without much ""hops."" Duncan's decision leaves Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack as the only original member of the Cabinet that came into office with Obama in 2009. (Shaun Donovan, the president's first secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is now budget director.) During a Wednesday appearance at the National Press Club, Duncan deflected two pointed questions about his future plans. Duncan answered: “We’re working hard every day and we have an amazing team and the amount of unfinished business — the president talks a lot about ‘the fourth quarter.’ And we’re proud of the progress we’ve made. There’s so much work that we need to do, not just for the next 14 months but for the next 14 years of the nation.” Asked what he’d do when he stepped away from the post, Duncan said, “I have no idea, and I’ve always tried to be pretty tunnel vision ... If anybody has any ideas, let me know.” While Duncan was popular within the Obama administration, that wasn't always the case with the education establishment. In  2011, a year before Obama’s re-election bid, members of the National Education Association said the USA’s largest teachers’ union would undoubtedly endorse Obama, but they also wanted to express their displeasure with the administration’s direction on several first-term education policies. So NEA’s board of directors drew up a strongly worded list of 13 grievances that laid out just how “appalled” the group was with Duncan’s actions on a host of topics — including his practice of weighing in on “local hiring decisions of school and school district personnel.” Former Duncan aide Peter Cunningham told USA TODAY the 13-things list “was an exercise in controlled venting and it worked. The membership felt like they were heard, the leadership felt that they could continue to work with the administration and even endorse the president and Arne took the hit like the good soldier that he is.” Contributing: Greg Toppo",2015-10-02 11:53:01,Education Secretary Arne Duncan to step down,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

By the time the massacre was over, seven people were injured and 10 people were dead, including Harper-Mercer himself.

Investigators found another seven guns at the apartment he shared with his mother. Also Friday, officials released the names, ages and brief biographical information about the nine dead, who ranged in age from 18 to 67 and included several freshmen and a teacher. They were sons and daughters, spouses and parents. One of the freshmen was active in the Future Farmers of America and loved to play soccer. Another was on only his fourth day of college. Grieving families began sharing details of their loved ones. ""We have been trying to figure out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that would take 18 years,"" the family of Lucas Eibel, 18, said in a statement released through the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. Quinn Glen Cooper's family said their son had just started college. ""I don't know how we are going to move forward with our lives without Quinn,"" the Coopers said. ""Our lives are shattered beyond repair."" Nine other people were wounded in the attack, officials said. Harper-Mercer, who died during a shootout with police, was armed with handguns and a rifle, some of which were military grade. The weapons had been purchased legally over the past three years, some by him, others by relatives, said Celinez Nunez, assistant field agent for the Seattle division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Harper-Mercer's social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army, frustrated by traditional organized religion and that he tracked other mass shootings. In one post, he appeared to urge readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues live on TV in August in Virginia, noting ""the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008 In Washington, President Barack Obama lamented the government's inability to pass stricter gun laws even after attacks like the one in Oregon. At a news conference Friday at the White House, Obama said he plans to keep talking about the issue and ""will politicize it"" because inaction is itself a political decision the U.S. is making. He said it's impossible to identify mentally ill people likely to perpetrate mass shootings ahead of time. The only thing the U.S. can do, he explained, is ensure they don't have an arsenal available ""when something in them snaps."" Read Saturday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.

95,http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123009/oregon-has-already-made-gun-control-political-choice,"President Barack Obama was in no mood to merely play ""mourner-in-chief"" on Thursday, after the massacre at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. In his 15th public statement as president after a mass shooting, Obama rebuffed the conservative critics who would soon be accusing him of ""politicizing"" another tragedy by tying it to gun control. “This is something we should politicize,” the president said, his voice edgy with unconcealed frustration and anger. ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America."" The state of Oregon, as it happens, is one of the few that have already heeded Obama's call to make gun control a political issue. In May, thanks to the efforts of gun-control advocates who turned the 2014 midterms into a referendum on gun violence, Oregon became the eighth state in the country to pass a near-universal background check requirement for private gun sales. But while that made the state a rare political success story for gun-control advocates, it's also been a lesson in the severe limits of what incremental, state-level reform can achieve without federal action. In the national wave of support for gun restrictions that followed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, during the 2012 holiday season, Oregon was one of several states that tried to move forward on gun control while Congress remained hopelessly deadlocked. Universal background checks had become the rallying cry of the gun-control movement, and bills passed in Connecticut, New York, Delaware, and Colorado in the months after Newtown. In Oregon, however, a background-check bill stalled for two years, before finally passing in May 2015. What changed? Voters made the kind of choice that Obama recommended yesterday, and booted out the Republican legislators who were blocking it. The bill had been bottled up since 2013 because the entire Republican caucus in the Senate opposed the overhaul, joined by one Democratic swing vote. In an effort to break the deadlock, national gun-control advocates seized upon Oregon’s 2014 mid-term elections as an opportunity. “It was a situation where you saw there was a political pathway in the legislature,” says Mark Prentice, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the advocacy group founded by former Representative Gabby Giffords. Taking a page from the NRA playbook, gun-control groups poured money into the selected legislative races, and the governor's race, to carve out that path to victory. Michael Bloomberg’s group, Everytown for Gun Safety, alone spent $600,000 on campaign donations, advertising, and grassroots organizing to help defeat legislators who opposed the background-check bill; the Oregonian cited Everytown as having helped to turn the tide. Two targeted state senators lost—just enough to give Democrats a sufficient Senate majority to push through the background-check bill this past spring. It was the first major gun-control law to pass in Oregon since 2000, and activists were understandably jubilant. “Today is a day to celebrate,” said Anneliese Davis, an activist from Moms Demand Action, an advocacy group affiliated with Everytown. Gun-control advocates had won by successfully turning Oregon's 2014 elections into a political referendum on gun control—precisely what Obama is urging the rest of the country to do. “When you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision,” he said on Thursday. “If you think this is a problem, you then should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.” The political breakthrough in Oregon was encouragng, to be sure: a glimmer of hope that gun control can work as a political issue. But the scope of what Oregon achieved, even after a pitched and expensive three-year battle, was limited. No one could have reasonably expected the new law to stop Chris Harper Mercer from his violent mission on Thursday, especially so soon after it was enacted, even though there is mounting evidence that background check laws do significantly help to reduce homicides. But these laws can only do so much, and Oregon's gun laws remain lax in many other respects. “They don’t have particularly high standards for gun ownership,"" says Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""They don’t have many types of regulation of gun sellers. They don’t have a permitting process for purchasers."" The state also allows concealed-carry on college campuses, and doesn’t regulate large-capacity ammunition magazines. “Last year, we graded Oregon as a D+, and the background check law probably raises that grade to about a C,” says Lindsay Nichols, a senior attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For those who want to seriously regulate guns in Oregon, there are years of heavy lifting ahead. Even if Oregon's gun-control activists could muster the political will to regulate gun ownership far more thoroughly, the state would run up against a hard reality: The most robust state regulations are no substitute for federal action. The absence of federal regulation has created a spotty patchwork of state laws, for instance, making it easy for traffickers to move weapons from places with lax regulations to those with stricter ones. The story of Oregon's gun-control politics in recent years illustrates the greatest problem gun-control advocates face going forward. The opposition has been practicing ruthlessly effective politics for many decades, and they have constrained the ambitions of gun-control advocates, who have largely focused their attention on politically palatable laws, like background checks. But these laws seek to exclude only narrow classes of people from getting guns; they don't strike at the heart of the problem by reducing the sheer number of guns available to begin with. Until the political landscape changes dramatically, in ways that are hard to foresee even as the country reels from the last example of what loosely regulated guns can lead to, the changes that pass will be necessarily incremental. That creates yet another political obstacle: Pro-gun advocates can use incidents like Thursday's to dismiss the efficacy of gun control in the first place, and make it harder to build momentum for more ambitious measures. The political obstacles have never faded away in Oregon, even in Roseburg itself. Douglas County Sheriff James Hanlin, one of the chief law-enforcement officials responding to Thursday's shooting, has been emblematic of the resistance: He's long been a prominent voice speaking out against the background-check law, and this year joined other Oregon sheriffs in refusing to enforce it. In April 2013, when Vice President Joe Biden was pressing for federal action after the Newtown shootings, Hanlin wrote a letter to Biden, vowing that he would refuse to enforce “unconstitutional” federal gun regulations. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote. The sheriff has yet to address the issue again since Thursday's tragedy. But both sides will be waiting to see how his remarks will shape the only path to gun control—the long, hard, political one.

Chris Mintz, 30, a North Carolina native who had moved to the Roseburg, Ore., area and is studying at Umpqua Community College to become a fitness trainer, hurled himself against the door in an effort to stop the gunman, identified as Christopher Harper Mercer, from entering. When Mercer, who killed at least nine people and injured at least seven before being killed by police, shot his way inside, hitting Mintz at least three time, the former soldier called out that it was his son Tyrek’s sixth birthday, according to Mintz’s aunt. His plea was rewarded with two more shots, Wanda Mintz told The Daily Beast. In virtually every mass shooting incident, there are stories of incredible courage — of unarmed men charging shooters, of men shielding loved ones with their bodies — and these stories should give us great hope about the character of our citizens. After all, Chris Mintz did not wake up this morning planning to be a hero. It was just any other day for him, yet his immediate reaction to a shocking, horrifying event was not to flee but to protect. While mass shooters are a tiny few, when they attack their random samples of the American population, there are always people who show courage and resolve. Thankfully, while these acts of courage are often fatal, it looks like Mintz will recover: None of the five shots that hit Mintz struck any vital organs, and he is expected to recover. “His vital signs are OK. He’s going to have to learn to walk again,” cousin Ariana Earnhardt told Q13Fox, “but he walked away with his life and that’s more than so many other people did.” Men have a duty to defend the weak and the vulnerable. Mintz did his duty under the worst possible circumstances. We should all salute him — and pray that we could show similar courage if the worst happens in our own lives.

It finally occured to me that Hollande is doing what any French socialist President knows he has to do with respect to the US: being more royalist than the king.  While center-right leader Charles de Gaulle was free to behave as obstreperously as he liked, Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist who presided France from 1981 to 1995, set the pattern for a socialist leader to demonstrate his bona fides to Washington by being an impeccable foreign policy ally. Francois Hollande is following suit, even though the fact that Russia now has an independent-minded president recreates a situation similar to the one that held sway during the Cold War, in which France carefully calibrated its alignment with each of the superpowers. The other issue that deserves mention here is the Western  effort to retake a key Afghan city, Kunduz, from the Taliban.  These Islamic fighters have been in the news since we trained them against Russia in the nineties, and fourteen years after we invaded Afghanistan in retaliation for harboring Al Qaeda, they are still successfully fighting the US-installed government.  Though I have not heard it mentioned, isn't it likely that the rise of ISIS has given this group a new lease on life?  Will they not at some point declare their allegiance to the Caliphate, signaling a (momentary) eastern boundary to the entity currently holding areas of Syria and Iraq in the west of the Eurasian continent? Both of these issues point to the reshaping of foreign interventions in the Middle East and Southwest Asia to reflect Russian interests: while the United States' presence on the Eurasian continent is about access to oil, Russia's attitude toward the resulting chaos is primarily about ensuring that the Muslim majority 'Stans' - the countries on its southern rim - remain peaceful.  I've written about President Putin's attitude toward Islam before:	http://otherjonesii.blogspot.com/search?q=Putin+attitude+toward+Islam,  http://otherjonesii.blogspot.com/search?q=Putin+attitude+toward+Islam	, which is to encourage development.  That is why, after careful consideration, he has acted in Syria: when Prime Minister Lavrov declared yesterday in his UN press conference that Russia considers ISIS to be an existential threat he was not referring to a 'recreation of the Soviet Union', but to the need for Russia to maintain close relations with its southern neighbors, a policy that any intelligent leader would pursue. It is being suggested today on US TV channels that President Putin is successfully pursuing a quid pro quo with his Western counterparts at today's Paris meeting: quit accusing us of dark designs on Ukraine (removing the sanctions) while staunch the number of Syrian refugees crowding your beautiful cities by bombing ISIL targets that the US has spared in its determination to remove Assad. Whatever the Russian president does, of fails to do, commentators try to make him look bad.  But while the docile French socialist president feigns support for US policy, the more powerful conservative German Chancellor takes the lead in tilting toward Moscow.  All are players on the Eurasian continent, while the US is two oceans away. P.S. France 24 reported that Francois Hollande came down from the Elysee Palace steps where he usually greets visitors to meet Vladimir Putin in the courtyard, saying ""Welcome President Vladimir"", adding that he had mishandled the Russian President's name: what foreign viewers don't know is that this was Hollande's way of signalling fraternity.  2

Does the American public have a right to know the name of the loser who marched onto the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon and ended the lives of nine innocent people, injuring seven others? Absolutely, we do. Do we have a need to know this creeper’s name? Nope. As always in the aftermath of the latest inevitable mass shooting, there will be plenty of talk about whether we can do more to keep guns out of the hands of lunatics like this guy. There will some talk about whether we can do more to lock up people who are clearly unhinged. But there will be almost no talk about whether we – the media, I mean, not law enforcement -- have the ability to take away one of what seems to be the prime motivations of mass murderers: Notoriety. This guy posted often on the internet about mass murders and other shootings that make national news. He recently blogged about Vester Lee Flanagan, the nutball who in August killed Virginia TV reporter, Alison Parker, and her cameraman, Adam Ward, before doing the world a favor and killing himself. ""On an interesting note,” he wrote. “I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more your're (sic) in the limelight."" Well, today he’s certainly in the limelight. But I’m not naming him. But I’m not naming him. Of course, reporters, newscasters and bloggers have every right to name him. A few years ago, I'd have argued that we have an obligation to name him. Now, I'm wondering... if members of the media had made a voluntary decision not to name this sick-o in the inevitable wall-to-wall coverage of this tragedy, if we’d decided not to splash his face across every screen, might that do as much (or possibly more?) to avert at least a few of the mass tragedies that headed our way? Think about it. If one of these murdering attention junkies didn’t get any of what they seek -- not so much as a mention and certainly not their names “across the lips of every person on the planet” then they’d have died for nothing. I’m wondering how they’d feel about that as they abide eternally in that hereafter called the jaws of hell. More importantly, I'm wondering how tomorrow's potential mass murderer might feel about that.",2015-10-02 13:54:14,Roberts: Media blew it in naming Oregon mass murderer,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Every Monday The mass shooting at an Oregon school again raises frustrations about the level of gun violence. Perhaps the focus should be on peace as something other than the absence of violence. Loading... October 2, 2015 In a tone of exasperation, Barack Obama expressed his frustration Thursday after the latest mass shooting in the United States, this time at an Oregon community college. As president, he has issued statements of both anger and consolation following at least nine mass killings. “Somehow this has become routine,” Mr. Obama said. “We’ve become numb to this.” Like many people who seek an end to gun violence, Obama again called for tougher gun laws, which would certainly help to curb opportunities for would-be mass shooters. The president has long sought disarmament in many areas, such as for nuclear bombs, chemical weapons, even cyber-weapons. In the history of peacemaking, de-weaponization is a favored tactic. One reason such an approach has been inadequate over the past century is that it is based on a concept of peace as merely the absence of conflict. The desire to eliminate the physical means of violence only begins to touch on the idea of peace in its affirmative meaning, such as harmony, empathy, unity. “At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love,” stated Martin Luther King Jr. A vivid example of this understanding of “positive peace” was the reaction of Virginia Tech University following the 2007 shooting on its campus. In the same classroom building in which a gunman killed 30 people, the school set up an interdisciplinary program called The Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention. One school dean calls it a “healing center.” Obama and others could also note the success of anti-bully campaigns in schools and elsewhere over the past two decades. These programs do not just teach against aggression but also promote social skills, such as a capacity for compassion, respect for alternative views, and an ability to form community. Another proof that peace can be an active reality is the history of nonviolent movements. Two scholars, Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, point out in a 2011 book that campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more effective than violent insurgencies from 1900 to 2006. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Dr. King defined nonviolent tactics as “a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of love.” Peace can be learned, by both individuals and nations, and not as the opposite of something else. It operates out of a conviction that violence is not inevitable because so many human societies have learned how to supplant it with high ideals. “War is not in our genes, and we need not accept human aggression as a fate,” declared a 1986 statement by UNESCO. Surely Americans are not yet “numb” to the best antidote to gun violence: peacemaking, in all its active forms. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

(AP) — The latest on a deadly shooting at a community college in Oregon (all times local): 9:20 a.m. A federal agency says the gunman who killed nine people at an Oregon community college had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives provided the information late Thursday in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton. The shooting Thursday at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College also wounded seven. Officials identified the killer as Chris Harper Mercer. He died after a shootout with police. He isn't believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student there because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting. ——— 7:03 a.m. Social media profiles linked to a 26-year-old shooter who killed at least 9 people at a southern Oregon college suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. There didn't seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Chris Harper Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. He appeared to have at least one online dating profile. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development. A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle. ——— 6:51 a.m. A doctor says one victim of the deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college will likely be released from a hospital Friday. Dr. Jason Gray of Mercy Medical Center says the hospital in Roseburg, which is 180 miles south of Portland, received 10 patients Thursday — one died, two were quickly treated and released and three were transferred to a hospital near Eugene for a higher level of care. Of the four remaining patients, one was discharged late Thursday, and one was expected to leave Friday. Gray says the other two are expected to survive, but one remains in critical condition. The three patients who needed additional care were transferred to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend. The Eugene-area hospital says in a news release that two of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. ——— 6:02 a.m. Authorities investigating a deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college say they have found a number of firearms at the gunman's apartment. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told television stations in Eugene, Oregon, early Friday that investigators were at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College and the shooter's nearby apartment throughout the night. He says investigators will release details on the number and types of weapons later Friday. Officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer and say he opened fire at the college Thursday, killing nine people and wounding seven others before dying during an exchange of gunfire with officers. Hanlin also says investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment to try to learn more details.",2015-10-02 12:48:08,"Latest updates: Shooter had 3 pistols, rifle, 5 extra magazines",,36,http://www.jsonline.com/

ROSEBURG, Ore. – Armed with multiple guns, a 26-year-old man walked into a morning writing class at a community college in this rural Oregon town and opened fire, hitting some students with multiple gunshots. One witness said the attacker demanded to know students’ religion before shooting them. Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave. “We began to run,” student Hannah Miles said. “A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building.” At least nine people were killed and seven others wounded Thursday, the fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with about 3,000 students. “I suspect this is going to start a discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare themselves for events like this,” former college president Joe Olson said. The killer was identified as Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Mercer died after a shootout with police, who were not saying whether they knew of any motive. He had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton.

He lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would be released later, he said. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The Associated Press that Mercer “seemed really unfriendly” and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.” Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday. Social profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. There didn’t seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account and a blog.

A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle. Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as uncommunicative. His father, Ian Mercer, said late Thursday that it’s been a “devastating day” for him and his family, and he has been talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana, California. Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn’t make sense. “All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,” she told KCBS-TV. Hanlin, the sheriff, said Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter’s name because that’s what he would have wanted. “I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” said a visibly angry Hanlin. Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn “Amazing Grace” was played. Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities. “That’s all I could think about today. There’s 10, 9 kids who won’t get those doors opened,” he said. Roseburg is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it’s no stranger to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and wounded a fellow student in 2006. After Thursday’s shooting, anguished parents and other relatives rushed to surviving students. Jessica Chandler was desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes. “I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s wounded,” Chandler said. Carnes’ best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital. Students described utter fear and panic after hearing the shots. Sarah Cobb, 17, was in a next-door classroom. She heard a shot. A teacher said they needed to get out, and the class ran out the door as she heard two more shots. “I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to think, what to do,” she said. Before the Roseburg shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school Thursday in the Northwest. The messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It was unclear if the messages were tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site. Investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter’s apartment seeking clues, Hanlin said Friday. The sheriff has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation. In 2013, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, declaring that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions “offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.” Associated Press writers Steven Dubois and Jonathan J.

Investigators believe he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting, the ATF said. The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008 in South Carolina. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said Harper-Mercer was in the Army for a little over a month at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, but was discharged for failing to meet the minimum standards. Garrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed to meet.

121,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/bwd-qQiMhKg/,"A gunman opened fire on a classroom full of students at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon early Thursday afternoon, killing 10 people and wounding seven more. Another tragedy took place just a few hours later some 2,500 miles away, when a baby girl was shot and killed while riding in a car on Cleveland’s East Side. In response to yet another mass shooting under his watch, President Barack Obama stressed our nation’s need for laws that prohibit the ease of procuring a gun. “We are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people,” he said from the White House press room on Thursday evening. “We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these mass shootings every few months.” LeBron James followed the President’s lead, taking personal outrage gleaned from more senseless gun violence in northeast Ohio to his millions of social media followers. Like seriously man!!!! A baby shot in the chest in Cleveland. It's been out of control but it's really OOC. Ya'll need to chill the F out. — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015  C'mon man let's do and be better!  Don't fall into the trap. This can't be only way. Accept more from yourselves. #TheLand #TheNation — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015  But the four-time MVP wasn’t quite done emphasizing the need for reform of America’s gun legislation. After the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice on Friday, James took his opportunity in the public spotlight to advocate for the change that would help prevent additional gun-related tragedies. LeBron James spoke out on gun control, one day after another infant killed in Cleveland and Oregon tragedy. ""There's no room for guns."" — Tom Withers (@twithersAP) October 2, 2015  The 30-year-old has been increasingly outspoken on off-court issues over the past several years. James and the Miami Heat donned hoodies in March 2012 following Trayvon Martin’s death, and was among a sizable contingent of players who wore “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts last season in support of Eric Garner and protests related to police killings of unarmed minorities. No matter what direction their NBA fandom or even political sentiments lean, all basketball followers should be appreciative of James continuing to use his fame for the greater good of society. Here’s hoping his words, let alone those of the President, inspire the public to take a stand for stricter gun laws before more innocent lives are lost.

123,http://www.ibtimes.com/oregon-shooting-tests-brian-williams-new-breaking-news-role-msnbc-2125343,"Brian Williams' first assignment last week was really more of a test run: In his new role as MSNBC's breaking news guru, the ex-anchor of NBC's ""Nightly News"" stepped back into the spotlight to cover Pope Francis' first visit to the United States, sporting a humbler and less punchy persona. He even had to suffer zingers in the press and on social media, with commentators poking fun at the idea of a disgraced newsman coming back to seek redemption by covering the pope himself. But on Thursday, as news broke of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, Williams appeared to find his voice as a broadcaster once again. “This is always a spooky business watching people walking through the parking lot and police with dogs, which means one of those cars belonged to the gunman,” Williams said deep into the coverage of the shooting, a sample of his running narration as the story unfolded. MSNBC's aerial cameras circled the UCC campus as experts and witnesses jumped on and off screen -- all while Williams remained the guiding voice for viewers at home. It was exactly the type of story he would have been all over back in his days as anchor of ""Nightly News,"" where he resided for almost 10 years before stepping down after embellishing tales from an assignment in Iraq. In the middle of the chaos on Thursday, he seemed to be at home. “This is what Brian excels at, and it’s tremendous to have someone of his stature and skill on our air,"" MSNBC President Phil Griffin told International Business Times on Friday. Despite the grim nature of the story, the moment was a prime opportunity for Williams, his crew, and the higher-ups at MSNBC to prove that the cable channel can pull off its new mission: more hard news in place of the usual left-leaning chatter. As IBT reported this month, Williams' new job is essentially to be on call: He has no particular show, no particular time slot and, aside from breaking news coordinator Mark Lukasiewicz, works with any MSNBC producer whose show has been interrupted by the breaking desk. So far, it's worked with few, if any, hiccups. Without appearing on air every single day since his return, Williams and the breaking news desk have merged with the landscape of MSNBC (even after causing a slight rupture upon arrival), solidifying the anchor as a fixture on the channel, and once again a familiar face for people watching at home. Williams appeared with little fanfare when he came back on air during the pope's visit: A brief promo preceding his re-entry to TV land was the only bit of hype for his first broadcast in over six months. Appearing at the desk, with his staff tittering in the background of MSNBC's new breaking news set, Williams jumped straight into the coverage with no long-winded acknowledgments or personal pleas to viewers at home. ""Good day. I'm Brian Williams at MSNBC headquarters here in New York,"" he said. If things keep going according to plan at MSNBC, that's a phrase viewers will hear more often in the months to come.",2015-10-02 16:29:09,Oregon Shooting Tests Brian Williams In New Breaking News Role At MSNBC,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/
124,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114972905/0/phoenix/nation~Obama-says-no-more-shortterm-spending-deals/,"WASHINGTON — Although Congress averted a budget shutdown this week, President Obama said Friday that he will ""not sign another short-sighted spending bill"" when the current deal expires in December. Congress needs to avoid ""manufactured crises"" that are threatening to slow the progress of the economy, Obama said during a White House news conference. Although Congress passed a temporary budget deal this week, it only sets up another crisis for December, Obama said. ""It's not how we're supposed to operate,"" Obama said of the constant uncertainty about budgets and other government actions. ""We can't cut our way to prosperity,"" Obama said. ""Other countries have tried it and it does not work."" ""The bottom line,"" Obama said, ""is that Congress has to do its job."" Congressional Republicans responded by saying Democrats have blocked the passage of key bills. ""The President just said he won't sign any more short-term funding bills,"" said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Maybe he can tell his party to stop their filibusters of the long-term bills we’ve been trying to pass."" Obama spoke with reporters after one of the busiest 10-day periods of his presidency. It included high-profile meetings with Pope Francis and China President Xi Jinping, as well as a visit to the United Nations that featured a tense talk with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Obama answered questions from reporters Friday after announcing the resignation of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, one of the last two remaining members of his original 2009 Cabinet. USA TODAY Education Secretary Arne Duncan to step down Obama's dispute with Putin over Syria became more complicated less than 48 hours after their meeting. Russia launched air strikes inside of Syria that it said targeted the insurgent Islamic State; U.S. officials said the strikes hit revel opponents of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, whom Putin supports and Obama wants removed from power. On Syria, Obama said Friday, the situation now is not so different as before, because Russia has supported Assad for years. The main difference, he said, is that the Russians are doing it more openly. Obama said Putin doesn't distinguish between Islamic State fighters and moderate opponents of Assad. To Putin, Obama said, they're all terrorists. ""That's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I reject."" The Russian policy is only strengthening the Islamic State, and ""that's no good for anyone."" USA TODAY Russian airstrikes in Syria are gambit to extend influence Obama responded to critics who said he had not done enough in Syria, such as sending more weapons to factions inside the country. ""This is a hugely difficult complex problem,"" Obama said. When he makes judgments about Syria, he said, he has to consider that if the United States starts something, it has to finish it. Obama's news conference followed his remarks Thursday about the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. A frustrated Obama, noting that he has spoken after more than a dozen deadly massacres, angrily called on voters to demand that Congress and local officials pass tougher gun laws. ""Each time this happens I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said. ""Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws."" USA TODAY 11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded When asked about former Florida governor Jeb Bush's comments that ""stuff happens"" in reference to the Roseburg shooting, Obama said, ""I don't even think I have to react to that one."" The American people, he said, know there are too many mass shootings. ""I will continue to talk about this"" in his 15 months in office, Obama said, ""and I will continue to politicize it."" Americans who don't like the influence of gun activists in Congress and politics need to do something, Obama said. Even if politicians are ""great on other stuff,"" voters who want action on guns need to vote against them so politicians will react. The problem goes beyond just mass shootings, Obama said. He mentioned his hometown, Chicago, which has had a surge in murders and shootings. ""This is happening every single day,"" he said. ""Kids are just running for their lives every single days trying to get to school.""",2015-10-02 16:29:21,Obama says no more short-term spending deals,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

So we know there are ways to prevent it.” “Australia” is Obama’s preferred euphemism for that most cherished of gun-control ideals: mass confiscation of the citizenry’s weapons. You will notice that the president doesn’t exactly spell out what following Australia’s model would entail. He speaks instead of “commonsense gun-control legislation,” “closing the gun-show loophole,” and “universal background checks.”
In the last 24 hours, New York magazine, CNN, and NBC have also sung the virtues of the Australian model.
But the Australian 1996 National Agreement on Firearms was not a benign set of commonsense gun-control rules: It was a gun-confiscation program rushed through the Australian parliament just twelve days after a 28-year-old man killed 35 people with a semi-automatic rifle in the Tasmanian city of Port Arthur. The Council of Foreign relations summarizes the Aussie measure nicely:

The National Agreement on Firearms all but prohibited automatic and semiautomatic assault rifles, stiffened licensing and ownership rules, and instituted a temporary gun buyback program that took some 650,000 assault weapons (about one-sixth of the national stock) out of public circulation. Among other things, the law also required licensees to demonstrate a “genuine need” for a particular type of gun and take a firearm safety course.

Among other things, the law also required licensees to demonstrate a “genuine need” for a particular type of gun and take a firearm safety course. The council’s laudatory section on Australian gun-control policy concludes that “many [read: gun-control activists] suggest the policy response in the wake of Port Arthur could serve as a model for the United States.” Two questions should be asked and answered: (1) Did the post–Port Arthur laws lead to a clear reduction of gun violence, and (2) What would an American version of the “Australian model” look like? Gun-control activists claim that the Australian model directly resulted in a pronounced fall in the gun-suicide rate and the gun-homicide rate. But these claims are disputable. In August, Vox’s German Lopez wrote a piece that included a chart attempting to show a causal relationship between the Australian gun-confiscation regime and a reduction in the Australian suicide rate. “When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides,” Lopez wrote. I noted at the time that: While the chart does show a steady decline in gun-related suicides, the reduction occurred at the same time as an overall reduction in the Australian suicide rate. What’s more, firearm-related suicides had been declining in Australia for nearly ten years before the 1996 restrictions on gun ownership. Vox’s own chart does not appear to show a causal link between gun control and a reduction in suicide rates in Australia.  Moreover, a look at other developed countries with very strict gun-control laws (such as Japan and South Korea) shows that the lack of guns does not lead to a reduced suicide rate. Unfortunately, people who want to kill themselves often find a way to do so — guns or no guns. Did the Australian model at least reduce gun-related homicides? That is hotly disputed. University of Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi concluded their 2008 report on the matter with the statement, “There is little evidence to suggest that [the Australian mandatory gun-buyback program] had any significant effects on firearm homicides.” “Although gun buybacks appear to be a logical and sensible policy that helps to placate the public’s fears,” the reported continued, “the evidence so far suggests that in the Australian context, the high expenditure incurred to fund the 1996 gun buyback has not translated into any tangible reductions in terms of firearm deaths.” A 2007 report, “Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?” by Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran similarly concluded that the buyback program did not have a significant long-term effect on the Australian homicide rate. The Australian gun-homicide rate had already been quite low and had been steadily falling in the 15 years prior to the Port Arthur massacre. And while the mandatory buyback program did appear to reduce the rate of accidental firearm deaths, Baker and McPhedran found that “the gun buy-back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia.” Would an American version of the “Australian model” perform any better? #related#In all likelihood it would fare worse. The Federalist’s Varad Mehta set down the facts in June: Gun confiscation is not happening in the United States any time soon. But let’s suppose it did. How would it work? Australia’s program netted, at the low end, 650,000 guns, and at the high end, a million. That was approximately a fifth to a third of Australian firearms. There are about as many guns in America as there are people: 310 million of both in 2009. A fifth to a third would be between 60 and 105 million guns. To achieve in America what was done in Australia, in other words, the government would have to confiscate as many as 105 million firearms.  And an American mandatory gun-confiscation program — in addition to being unconstitutional — would be extraordinarily coercive, and perhaps even violent. There is no other way around it: The mandatory confiscation of the American citizenry’s guns would involve tens of thousands of heavily armed federal agents going door-to-door to demand of millions of Americans that they surrender their guns. That. Is. Not. Going. To. Happen. If the president and gun-control activists want to keep saying “Australia” in response to every shooting in America, they should at least be honest about what exactly they are proposing. —Mark Antonio Wright is an assistant editor at National Review.

135,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/uqJYQSZXi5U/,"Hillary Clinton delivered harsh criticism of the National Rifle Association and Republicans in Congress on Friday in the wake of the deadly Oregon mass shooting, calling for a “national movement” to fight the gun lobby in the United States. In fiery remarks delivered at Broward College in Davie, Florida, Clinton lambasted the NRA and vowed to take on the gun lobby as president. “What is wrong with us, that we cannot stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby, and the gun manufacturers they represent?” a visibly angry Clinton said. “This is not just tragic. We don’t just need to pray for people. We need to act and we need to build a movement. It’s infuriating.” Clinton refrained just a day earlier on the eve of the Oregon shooting from harshly critiquing the NRA, and called on Thursday for stricter gun control measures. But she used her remarks on Friday to go on the attack, calling out Republicans for blocking background checks and other measures in Congress. “Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families,” Clinton said. A mass shooting at a community college in Oregon on Thursday left 10 people dead and seven wounded. The 26-year-old gunman had 6 weapons during the attack and wore body armor. The shooting has reignited a debate over gun laws in the United States, with most Republicans arguing that guns help keep Americans safe, calling instead for better mental health programs. John Kasich said he considers the death penalty an important check on mass shootings and Donald Trump saying the shooting was “horrible.” Democrats largely argue for stricter checks on the proliferation of weapons. The NRA has not yet commented on the shooting, but the conservative gun rights group Gun Owners of America accused some of politicizing the shooting, and said on its Facebook page that the Oregon shooter “chose a #GunFreeZone because it was ‘an easy target.'” There are about 310 million civilian guns in the United States, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, and somewhere between one-third and one-half of households have guns. The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world and the highest homicide by firearm rate among developed countries. It ranks around 100th worldwide in overall homicides. Clinton has called for universal background checks and closing loopholes that make it possible for gun buyers to purchase weapons without a background check online and at gun shows. She supported the Brady Bill, which established background checks for handguns and was passed by her husband Bill Clinton. Her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady Bill, but does support some gun control measures. “I will as your president never relent on trying to work on this, but we need a national movement,” Clinton said. She also conceded that gun lobbies had won important battles even while arguing that most Americans want stricter gun control measures. A 2013 Gallup poll showed that 65% of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases, though polls show a majority of Americans are opposed to “gun control.” “I don’t think they represent a majority of Americans or a majority of gun owners. They count on having a really intense dedicated group saying to politicians, ‘we will vote against you,'” Clinton said. “We’re not single-minded voters but each us of has to care about this issue. We’re going to take them on. We took them on in the 1990s and we’re going to take them on again.” In his comments last night, President Obama obliquely mentioned the NRA by calling on American gun owners to reconsider “the organization that suggests it is speaking for you,” but refrained from naming the gun lobby directly. Clinton’s decision to attack the NRA directly will likely be popular among the Democratic base, particularly those who are reticent of Sanders’ more moderate views. (He has been given an “F” rating by the NRA.) Florida, where Clinton delivered her speech, lands squarely in the middle of the Democratic nominating primary, two weeks after Super Tuesday, when Clinton allies hope the Democratic frontrunner will sweep up enough delegates to make the nomination a sure shot. But it’s also a key general election swing state, home to two of the more formidable contenders for the Republican nomination both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio. Clinton has been to the state several times. During her last campaign trip to Florida in late July, Clinton laid out a plan to strengthen relations with Cuba and build of President Obama’s move earlier this year opening up discussions with with the isolated island nation. Florida is a bellwether of her appeal among Hispanic voters, a key voting bloc in the Democratic primary she will likely need to win the the nomination. Clinton’s event in Florida comes the same day that Sanders announced the hire of a director of Hispanic outreach.

144,http://www.startribune.com/opinion/letters/330475901.html,"As a child growing up in the 21st century, I can honestly say that I’ve grown up in an era of chaos and false security. I’ve grown up with terrorists attacking the twin towers; with active shooters firing on kindergartners, college students and moviegoers, and now with an active shooter firing on community-college students in Oregon, apparently for being Christian. When I go into a restaurant, I like to sit by the exit, just in case of an active shooter. I’m growing up in a time when my father asks me if I want a gun when I go to college because he fears for my safety. In 2012, when Malala Yousafzai, a young girl in Pakistan, was shot for wanting an education, she was celebrated for her courage. In America, today we could all be considered Malalas for our risk of getting shot spontaneously, yet we would not be celebrated for our convictions if victims were shot; we will just be victims, part of a national tragedy. Will those at Umpqua Community College in Oregon be celebrated for being courageous Christians? We are quick to fight the battle on terror, yet when it comes to the battle on gun control, we are reluctant because of our Second Amendment right, and are so scared that the government will infringe on it that it’s causing us to be blind to the risks we face. I would argue that some of the people in our own country pose a bigger threat than do terrorists. Stephanie Haima, Eden Prairie • • • I was making dinner, listening to talk on the TV about yet another mass shooting, when unexpectedly my friend’s face came into my mind and how I would feel when I learned she was killed by gun violence. If you’ve ever lost someone you love deeply in a sudden, unexpected and unnecessary way — an accident, suicide, illness — then you know: Your heart launches into your stomach, the floor drops out from under your feet, you’re overcome with nausea, and all you can say is “no, no, no, please, no.” In one moment, you cycle through disbelief, heartbreak, fear, panic and agony. In that same moment, you know that your life is now divided into the before and after. You will be able to identify this exact moment in time as the moment everything changed. Now imagine that person you love and adore — your child, partner, parent, lover, friend — is taken in that tragic, sudden, unnecessary, senseless way by a gun at the hands of another person who felt they had the power and authority to end the life of another human. That person you love so deeply got up that morning out of bed like she or he always does, went to school, to work, to have fun, expecting to have another day, deserving to have another day — and was tragically murdered by someone they may have known or who was a stranger to them. Tragically, every year, more innocent people die from bullets in accidents, domestic violence, suicide and from individuals who are being socialized by our society to believe that a gun is the solution to some perceived inadequacy, offense, or a difference in religion or skin color. Imagine the people you love deeply being cut off from the days they deserved to live, and the fear they must have felt in those final moments. We have the ability to change this senseless trajectory through smart, common-sense policies — the evidence is on the side of stronger, sensible laws that will make us safer. Imagine that this horrifying ending is the fate of a person you love, but you just don’t know when, and you have the ability to change it if you choose to do something about it. The future is not written; this cause is not lost, and prayers without action in response to preventable, unnecessary, senseless tragedy and agony are woefully inadequate and sadly misplaced. Susie Schatz, St. Paul • • • Though I voted twice for President Obama, he’s disappointed me many times, not willing to go far enough to tackle the nation’s worst problems. But he was spot-on perfect in his candid, angry remarks in the aftermath of yet another mass murder, the one Thursday in Oregon. It’s certain, he said, that some will say that the remedy for gun violence is more guns so we can “protect” ourselves. And then, in a voice so honest and exasperated as to be both shocking and refreshing, he asked: “Does anybody really believe that?” That’s the question the nation must answer if we hope to have any chance to cut down the carnage caused by gun violence. Steven Schild, Winona, Minn. • • • Mr. President, I just listened to your speech on the shooting in Oregon. My prayers and thoughts to those involved, and kudos to the law-enforcement response. I’ve been through active shooter training as a law enforcement officer, but I really can’t imagine the stress of having to respond to such a horrible event. Question: How’s the body politic and gun control working out in Chicago? It’s not — and, thus, I will continue to vote for those who support the Second Amendment, which you as a lawyer, Mr. President, should know wasn’t passed to support my hunting rights or to provide me the ability to protect my family from the common thug. Might I suggest that you promote amending the Constitution if you really want true gun control, but even if that is successful, the cat is out of the bag. Greg Hedtke, Rosemount • • • I am so sick of the argument that we can do nothing about gun violence because it will infringe on our “freedom.” When we realized having lead in the air was bad, I lost my “freedom” to use gas with lead in it. After one person tried to bring a shoe bomb on a plane, I lost the “freedom” of keeping my shoes on when I board a plane. I even lost the “freedom” of having my electrical outlets exposed when I became a parent, in order to keep my kids away from them. You know, when I think about it, I did not really lose my “freedom.” I became an adult and did what had to be done to make my family and the people around me a little bit safer. I really wish the people of this country could act like adults when it comes to gun violence and do what we need to do to stop mass gun violence. My kids and everyone else’s kids deserve nothing less. Thomas Lucy, St. Paul • • • CNN analyst and moderator Chris Cuomo referred to the “culture of violence” that is never addressed after mass shootings. Gun laws, the NRA, gun sellers and the Constitution are not the only entities that should be confronted with the need for radical change. To address the “culture of violence,” Americans need to recognize and aggressively lobby against the makers of violent games, the makers of violent movies, against insufficient mental health practices and against citizenry that tolerates openly aggressive behavior. The seeds of disintegration, nurtured by our complacency for viewing and accepting day-to-day violence as normal, is cultivated by many sources. We cannot continue to discount the origins of violent thought that ultimately culminate in chaos and the death of the innocent. Sara Meyer, St. Marys Point © 2021 StarTribune.

Read more and post comments at www.ibabuzz.com/politics. Oct. 1 The flames of an arson attack at a Planned Parenthood health center in Thousand Oaks were fanned by recent rhetorical attacks on the women’s health organization by anti-abortion-rights politicians and activists, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday. “The toxic rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood has dangerous consequences. It sends a signal that using violence to close clinics and intimidate health care professionals and women is ‘OK’. It is not,” Feinstein, D-Calif., said in an emailed statement. “I’m grateful that no one in Thousand Oaks was hurt. My thoughts today are with the clinic’s staff, who provide compassionate care in spite of challenges no health care provider should have to face.” Unfortunately, there’s a long history of violence against women’s health care clinics that provide legal abortions, Feinstein noted. “There have been more than 200 arsons and bombings over the past 40 years. These acts are serious crimes at the state and federal level, and the criminals who perpetrate them must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” she said. “Going forward, I hope that my colleagues think about the ramifications of their words. Doctors, nurses, clinic staff and patients should not be terrorized, threatened and put in harm’s way.” Oct. 2 For the “Fat Chance” file: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi asked outgoing Speaker John Boehner on Friday to create a select committee to address gun violence, one day after a man armed with five handguns and a rifle killed nine and wounded nine more at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College. House Republicans have steadfastly resisted all calls for more stringent gun controls in the wake of other mass shootings in recent years. And with Boehner on his way out this month and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, trying to shore up his conservative bona fides as a successor, it’s hard to see Pelosi’s plan as anything other than a total nonstarter. Besides the six firearms recovered at the massacre’s scene, investigators found seven more firearms — two handguns, four rifles and a shotgun — at the slain gunman’s home, said a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman. All the guns were legally obtained, obtained by the shooter or family members over the last three years through a federal firearms dealer, she said. “Prayers for the victims, families, students, & faculty at Umpqua Community College, & the community of Roseburg, Oregon,” Boehner tweeted Thursday. In her letter to Boehner, Pelosi, D-San Francisco, also said the select committee she proposes should have to report its recommendations to the House within 60 days, “in time for a vote before the third anniversary of the Newtown shooting this year.” She also urged Boehner to see that the House hears and passes a bipartisan bill — heretofore ignored by most Republicans — to require background checks for all firearm sales. “The epidemic of gun violence in our country challenges the conscience of our nation. Mass shootings and gun violence are inflicting daily tragedy on communities across America,” Pelosi wrote. “As of today, nearly 10,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 2015 — more than 30 gun violence deaths a day. Yesterday’s terrible attack at Umpqua Community College in Oregon marked the 45th school shooting this year alone.” Rep. Mike Thompson, House Democrats’ point man on gun violence issues and co-author of the languishing background-check bill, wrote to Boehner on Friday, too. “Every single time a mass shooting happens we go through the same routine. Thoughts and prayers are sent. Statements are made. Stories are written. And nothing changes,” Thompson, D-St. Helena, said in a news release. “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Congressional Republicans have done nothing over and over again and, predictably, the results have been the same: more innocent lives lost, more families forever changed and more mass gun violence,” he added.

152,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/3pZlIGMx5Ts/," After former Florida governor and current presidential hopeful Jeb Bush responded to gun control talk in the wake of the Oregon shooting with “stuff happens,” current President Barack Obama had a quick response, while others took to Twitter and created the sardonic #StuffHappens hashtag. According to Mediaite, during a White House press conference on Friday, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl read Bush’s quote back to Obama (which you can watch in the above video). The president quickly responded, “I don’t even think I have to react to that.” He then continued: “I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.'” President Obama then said that his team was investigating what they could do to “prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place,” but that American politics as a whole had to change before these mass shootings ended for good. He pledged to keep talking about the issue, like he did yesterday. In the meantime, Twitter users have tweeted critical messages about Bush and his comments under the hashtag #StuffHappens. #StuffHappens You know, like when you stub your toe on the coffee table.

153,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/114991965/0/phoenix/nation~Groups-ask-Congress-to-reform-mental-health/,"A day after a mass shooting in Oregon, 23 mental health groups are calling on Congress to pass legislation aimed at repairing the USA's broken mental health system. The groups delivered a letter to congressional leaders Thursday, just hours before the attack at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. left 10 people dead. The shooting was the latest in a series of mass killings perpetrated by unstable young men, many of whom were mentally ill. While people with mental illness are generally no more violent than anyone else, the attacks have cast a spotlight on mental illness and the serious gaps in mental health care. ""How many more reminders do we need that mental health has to be a high priority?"" asked psychiatrist Renee Binder, president of the American Psychiatric Association, which coauthored a letter to leaders of the House of Representatives, where several mental health bills have been introduced. ""This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an American issue."" Although more than 13 million Americans have a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression, most fail to receive the psychiatric care and services that could help them lead productive lives, according to the letter. USA TODAY Mental Illness: The Cost of Not Caring In the House, Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif., has sponsored a bill that aims to make it easier for families to be involved in the care of loved ones with mental illness. Today, doctors and nurses often cite federal privacy laws when shutting families out of their loved one's mental health care, even though, in many cases, they're legally permitted to share the information. Reps. Tim Murphy, R-Pa. and Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas  also have introduced a bill to clarify healthy privacy rules. Their bill also would create an Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders, who would coordinate mental health care across federal agencies and ensure that private insurers comply with federal laws on mental health coverage. In addition, their bill would increase the number of hospitals beds for people in acute psychiatric crisis; support early intervention; and support ""telepsychiatry"" to increase mental health care for people in rural areas. ""Basic services are not available for many patients who have severe mental illness,"" Johnson said. ""Many of these people end up homeless or incarcerated because there is a scarcity of treatment options."" Murphy said he's frustrated that his bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, has not moved forward. ""A person is dying from suicide, homicide or drug overdose every few minutes,"" said Murphy, a child psychologist. The cost of delaying action ""can be measured in lives lost. . . . Every time I hear about another tragedy, I think about how bill could have helped them, so that people have a place to go in a crisis."" The Murphy-Johnson bill ""really is landmark mental health reform,"" said John Snook, executive director of the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, which also cosigned the letter. ""It talks about every aspect of this issue in a really smart way."" Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., have introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Also in the Senate, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has introduced a bill that would allow communities to use federal funds to expand crisis intervention teams. These teams -- already in place in many police departments around the country -- are trained to respond to deescalate psychiatric crises, helping people with mental illness avoid arrest. Cornyn's bill also promotes mental health courts, which allow inmates with mental illness to receive treatment, rather than remain in prison. Ron Honberg, national director of policy and legal affairs at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said it would be ""heartbreaking"" if Congress fails to improve mental health coverage. ""We need to get something meaningful passed this year,"" said Honberg, whose group also cosigned the letter. ""We'll never have a better chance at reform because both the Republicans and Democrats agree that significant improvements to mental health care are needed."" Honberg said he hopes lawmakers will find a way to work together. ""To get legislation passed in Congress these days is a challenge,"" Honberg said. ""But the fact that we have agreement on the need to fix the broken mental health system is huge.""",2015-10-02 18:30:47,Groups ask Congress to reform mental health,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

X OUR PICKS:  Students begin to gather at the Douglass County Fairgrounds Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, where they can retrieve personal belongings and board busses for a trip to Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., to retrieve their cars. (Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian via AP)  People embrace while preparing to get driven to Umpqua Community College to collect belongings Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in Roseburg, Ore. Armed with multiple guns, Chris Harper Mercer walked in a classroom at the community college, Thursday, and opened fire, killing several and wounding several others and forcing the evacuation of students and faculty from the school. (AP Photo/John Locher)  Thursday was a very special day for Chris Mintz: Oct. 1 was his son’s sixth birthday. Though the child was too young to see it, the proud dad posted a happy birthday message on Facebook anyway on Wednesday night.
Hours later, as the former Army infantryman and Umpqua Community College student confronted a gunman on the rural Oregon campus, Mintz’s son was at the forefront of his mind, according to accounts provided by Mintz’s family.
Mintz, 30, encountered the gunman as he attempted to block the door of the classroom, his aunt Wanda Mintz told the Washington Post. Her nephew was shot three times, then fell to the ground. In that moment, she said, he tried to reason with the gunman.
“He hit the ground and looked up at him and said, ‘It’s my son’s birthday, don’t do this,’ ” Wanda Mintz recounted, after speaking to the mother of Mintz’s son. “And the guy shot him at least two more times.” 


When Wanda Mintz spoke to her nephew Friday morning he was weak but awake after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.
“He just tried to do the right thing,” Wanda Mintz said. “That’s just how he is. If he sees someone who needs help, he just helps. He just tried to intervene.”
Roseburg, Ore., has now been added to the grim list of American communities devastated by a mass shooting; the incident left 10 dead, including the shooter, and others injured.
And Chris Mintz is now counted among a group of heroes caught in the crossfire while trying to intervene.
Mintz sustained gunshot wounds to his upper back, abdomen, left hand and upper and lower leg, according to a Facebook post by Jayme Skinner, the mother of Mintz’s son. 


Both of Mintz’s legs were broken during the shooting, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his family to cover medical and child care costs. Photos on the page show Mintz smiling from a hospital bed. His aunt said Skinner has been by his side.
After spending 6 1/2 hours in surgery, “he is conscious and he understands what is going on,” Skinner wrote on Facebook.
“He will have a long road ahead of him of recovery. However, he is one tough dude and he will do just fine,” she continued, adding, “Today he became a hero.”
Relatives have spoken to Mintz often since the shooting. His uncle Jerry Brown — who along with most of Mintz’s family lives in Randleman, N.C. — also confirmed that Mintz had been shot multiple times while rushing the shooter, and said he was doing well in the hospital.
“We’re just so glad that he’s OK,” Brown said from North Carolina. “He always had determination. In a situation like that, you knew he would be the one to respond.”
Mintz was born and raised in Randleman, where he graduated from high school in 2003. He joined the Army and was stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, where he met Skinner, Wanda Mintz said.
He also has a wrestling and mixed martial arts background, having fought twice on the MMA amateur circuit in 2011 and 2012.
“He was on the wrestling team and he’s done cage-fighting, so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically,” aunt Sheila Brown told NBC News on Friday.
Mintz moved to Oregon six years ago when the North Carolina economy collapsed, Brown said. He had been working in the furniture business and living in a trailer with his young family but wanted something new.
“He’s gone out that way for a fresh start,” Brown said. “Things were going good out there for him. That’s what he was looking for — being with his family, raising his son, being in school.”
Mintz’s Facebook page is filled with motivational memes, reflections on the importance of faith and photos of him playing with his son.
Wanda Mintz said her nephew’s 6-year-old boy is autistic and is too young, anyway, to comprehend what happened to his father, who might need more surgeries and could be stuck in a wheelchair for some time after Thursday’s shooting.
As the story of Mintz’s courageous actions became national news, a new post popped up on his Facebook wall:
“This is Chris’s friend,” it reads. “Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts.”
Alek Skarlatos, one of three Americans hailed as heroes for stopping a terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train in August, would also have been at the college Thursday if Skarlatos hadn’t been in Los Angeles to rehearse for ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.”
Skarlatos, 22, told the network’s “Good Morning America” program that he attends a class at Umpqua, ABC News reported Friday.
This report includes information from the Associated Press. Thursday was a very special day for Chris Mintz: Oct. 1 was his son’s sixth birthday. Though the child was too young to see it, the proud dad posted a happy birthday message on Facebook anyway on Wednesday night. Hours later, as the former Army infantryman and Umpqua Community College student confronted a gunman on the rural Oregon campus, Mintz’s son was at the forefront of his mind, according to accounts provided by Mintz’s family. Mintz, 30, encountered the gunman as he attempted to block the door of the classroom, his aunt Wanda Mintz told the Washington Post. Her nephew was shot three times, then fell to the ground. In that moment, she said, he tried to reason with the gunman. “He hit the ground and looked up at him and said, ‘It’s my son’s birthday, don’t do this,’ ” Wanda Mintz recounted, after speaking to the mother of Mintz’s son. “And the guy shot him at least two more times.” When Wanda Mintz spoke to her nephew Friday morning he was weak but awake after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds. “He just tried to do the right thing,” Wanda Mintz said. “That’s just how he is. If he sees someone who needs help, he just helps. He just tried to intervene.” Roseburg, Ore., has now been added to the grim list of American communities devastated by a mass shooting; the incident left 10 dead, including the shooter, and others injured. And Chris Mintz is now counted among a group of heroes caught in the crossfire while trying to intervene. Mintz sustained gunshot wounds to his upper back, abdomen, left hand and upper and lower leg, according to a Facebook post by Jayme Skinner, the mother of Mintz’s son. Both of Mintz’s legs were broken during the shooting, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his family to cover medical and child care costs. Photos on the page show Mintz smiling from a hospital bed. His aunt said Skinner has been by his side. After spending 6 1/2 hours in surgery, “he is conscious and he understands what is going on,” Skinner wrote on Facebook. “He will have a long road ahead of him of recovery. However, he is one tough dude and he will do just fine,” she continued, adding, “Today he became a hero.” Relatives have spoken to Mintz often since the shooting.

155,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EbQGCm88soY/,"On CNN’s “AC360” on Friday, without using his actual name, network justice correspondent Pamela Brown offered some insights into Chris Harper Mercer, the man responsible for the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, OR. According to the report, Mercer gave his writings to a survivor of the massacre, which revealed “hatred” toward black men and his struggles with the opposite sex. “In the middle of the shooting rampage, the gunman handed his writings to a survivor to give to police according to sources. In those pages, the shooter rambled about his hatred toward black men and how he was frustrated about being a virgin unable to find a girlfriend.” Brown went on to discussed the anti-Christianity aspect of his crime, but went back to his hatred of what was described to be “all different types of people,” including black men. “As a result, we’ve been asking people today, Anderson, if he left any trail behind indicating that he was anti-Christian or had a dislike for organized religion,” she said. “So far all we’ve been able to find is on a social media page that apparently belonged to him. He said he disliked organized religion but in the writings we talked about in the piece, apparently he gave no indication other than saying he associated with the dark side. Law enforcement officials I’ve been speaking with say this is someone that hated all different types of people. We talked about earlier – he hated black men. He described frustration with women. This is one of those situations where you can’t really apply logic to what is obviously a very illogical situation here, Anderson.

If only every Houston resident could stay there 24/7 and never leave in order to avoid the demolition derby occurring outside of its borders called Houston roads. In the recent past, I have had three tire replacements and one transaxle repair due to the negligence of our city government to provide safe and navigable roads. The city has set aside reportedly $220 million for hike and bike trails, while our roads literally crumble. Until the mayor and City Council live up to their primary obligation of providing basic infrastructure, there should be absolutely no funds applied to more frivolous projects. Carole Paul Vesely, Houston  Americans have spoken Regarding ""Carnage at Oregon college"" (Page A1, Friday), once again President Obama's speech after a tragic mass shooting politicizes a terrible tragedy as he attempts to forward his agenda of stricter gun laws. The majority of the people of this country have made it clear that they do not want stricter gun laws. The 2013 successful recall elections of two Democratic members of the Colorado Senate who supported strict new gun control laws is one example. We grieve for the victims in the Oregon shootings and others, but not to the point where we wish to surrender our freedoms.For those who want to see how well severe gun ownership restrictions work, I would direct their attention to Mexico.

This disaster disguised as a good idea is an easy target built on lies like ""you can keep your doctor"" and ""premiums will go down.""

control legislation. 
At that time - in the midst of our 
collective pain and disbelief - there was a level of national outrage 
that caused many to hope that this was the tipping point - that the 
horrific deaths of 20 children and the 6 adults who tried to save them would finally be enough to shame our Congress and our nation into taking 
action. But nothing happened... From commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gun_violence.jpg: Gun control. Time to lay down the law.(Image by Christiane Brown, Author: St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office)   Details   Source   DMCA 



In the two years that have
 passed since the Sandy Hook tragedy there have been more than 986 mass shooting events in the United States resulting in the deaths of 1,234 people 
and the wounding 3,565 more. 
There is now one mass 
shooting every week in America - and yesterday the people of Roseburg 
Oregon became the ""latest"" victims of what has now become an almost commonplace occurrence   -  9 murdered, shot execution style in their college classrooms, the 
gunman (with reported mental health issues) armed with six guns - 
and a stash of seven more waiting at home.   
We can write again and 
again that the victims of these tragedies and their families deserve our
 call for sane and sensible gun laws in America. 


We can write 
again and again that the congressional stonewalling of any and all gun 
safety laws is an assault on our   freedom and our right to live safely in this country.  
We can write again and again that we have moved so far beyond the 2nd 
Amendment's Right to Keep and Bear Arms, that high grade assault weapons
 (their only purpose: rapid, mass killing), can now be found in almost 
any home and in any quiet neighborhood in America.
And we can 
write again and again about the thousands with serious mental health disorders who have no access to mental healthcare but have easy and rapid 
access to as many guns as they want, and can purchase these guns out of any 
car, any backpack or off of any internet site.
But when will our nation say enough? Guns have killed 428 times more Americans than terrorism over the past decade. So why is terrorism the enemy that we have spent trillions of dollars fighting?  In the past ten years
 there have been 55 terrorism related deaths in America and 225 
overseas. In that same time frame gun murders in America have claimed the 
lives 119,000 people.   That is the real terrorism in our lives, and unrestricted access to firearms is the enemy we need to be fighting.
But we already know this... It is all nearly routine now: the grieving, the outrage, the pain, the numbness and then, the moving on ... until the next one. So sadly predictable that   -- I have an idea... and I think it ought to be a real time saver - a fill in the blanks Gun Violence Op Ed form for Americans:

The death of Aavielle Wakefield, plus a mass shooting at an Oregon community college in which nine people were killed, fueled the decision by the Cleveland Cavaliers star to take a public stand.

""There's no room for that. There's no room for guns, first of all, but then for violence toward kids or anybody. I see the news go across my phone and I'm sitting there in front of my three kids, so it automatically just hit me. ""It's not just in Cleveland, it's the whole nation that goes through this as well. We all hurt from it."" James didn't witness the speech of President Barack Obama following the massacre in Roseburg, Ore. -- an attack in which the shooter was killed by police. Part of Obama's comments included terming the United States as ""the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."" James agrees with Obama and wants to see change. ""I know what I see. I know how I feel,"" James said. ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out. I don't know how you can do that. There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big-time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves."" James's stature as an NBA superstar gives him a voice and he's hoping speaking out will make an impact. ""Part of the education program we're doing is keeping those kids off the street and keeping their situations that's maybe bad and turning them into good,"" James said. ""I think what we're doing is controlling some of the violence. Some of these kids might be in violent situations, violent areas or violent homes and we're trying to keep them away from that.""",2015-10-03 02:22:26,Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James speaks out about gun laws,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

He was an infantryman who received numerous honors during his service, including the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. According to North Carolina's Fox 8, witnesses said that Chris Mintz tried to block a door to keep gunman Chris Harper Mercer from entering the classroom he and a group of other students were trapped in during the shooting. Mintz reportedly told the gunman, ""You're not getting by me,"" before he was shot multiple times.

The Daily Beast reports that he was a very active guy who dabbled in mixed martial arts and was enrolled in community college to become a personal trainer, so temporarily losing the use of his legs will undoubtedly be extremely challenging for him.

The New York Times reports that Mintz has already received offers to appear on Good Morning America and Ellen, and he was initially going to turn them down. However, he changed his mind when his ex-girlfriend, who is also the mother of his six-year-old son Tyrik, pointed out that he could use his appearances to talk about being the parent of an autistic child. In a strange coincidence, another American hero also attended Umpqua Community College, and he became a fixture on talk shows after his heroics made headlines around the globe. According to E! News, Alek Skarlatos was also a student at the Oregon school. Earlier this year, the Army National Guard Specialist helped take down a terrorist on a train in Paris, and his hero status him score a gig as one of the celebrity dancers competing on the current season of the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars. However, Alek Skarlatos decided to ditch his dance rehearsals to head back to Roseburg.

""While I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time in August aboard a train bound for Paris, I only wish that the same could be said for today.""

163,http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123027/heres-why-no-one-can-agree-number-mass-shootings,"Depending on where you get your news, Thursday’s shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, was the 294th mass shooting, the 295th, or the 45th school shooting of the year. As Dave Cullen wrote in New Republic, news outlets will get the facts wrong in the immediate aftermath of an attack, but the conflicting news reports point to a more serious problem in America’s discussion of its gun problem. Gun control advocates rely heavily on the shocking numbers to make their case, but statistical discrepancies allow opponents to easily undermine the arguments. There’s no case to be made when everyone gets to view the evidence on their own terms. The confusion stems from varying governmental categorizations. There are mass murders and mass killings, active shooters and serial killers, mass shootings and mass public shootings. For instance, Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced website that many news outlets use, defines a mass shooting as one with “four or more people shot in one event.” In other words, they include incidents in which four people are wounded, but no one is killed. Accordingly, the database considers the Umpqua shooting the 295th mass shooting of the year. The FBI, by contrast, doesn’t have an official definition of “mass shooting” on the books, but in 2014 defined a “mass killing” as one with three or more fatalities in a report about active shooters—“an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area,” like at Columbine or Newtown. Using the three-fatality threshold, the Oregon shooting is the 54th mass killing of 2015. But in July, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) defined a mass shooting as a homicide in which four or more people are killed with firearms—a definition based on the FBI’s definition of a “mass murder” as opposed to a “mass shooting.” Under that definition, the Oregon shooting is the 32nd such incident in 2015. The conflation of “active shooter,” “mass murder,” and “mass shooting” has allowed the gun lobby to discredit statistics that point to the need for further control. The 2014 FBI report showed that active shooting incidents were increasing, but the NRA and other groups complained that this did not necessarily mean mass shootings were also increasing. Opponents of gun control can claim, like Jeb Bush did on Friday, that “stuff happens,” implying such incidents are just a fact of modern life. Similarly, Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox has said that the inclusion of statistics from the FBI’s “active shooter” report gives the false impression that incidents are rising when they are not. “A majority of active shooters are not mass shooters,” Fox told Time. “A majority kill fewer than three.” On Friday, Fox wrote in USA Today that “media folks reminded us of the unforgettable, high profile shootings that have taken place over the past few months, hinting of a problem that has grown out of control… as if there is a pattern emerging.” Fox is correct in pointing out that “active shooters” and “mass shootings” are not the same thing. But other statistics, including a Harvard analysis, show that mass shootings—in which four people were killed—have increased in frequency. The July CRS report also indicated that mass shooting incidents are also becoming deadlier. Of course, no matter which definition—and which statistics—you choose, America’s gun violence is appalling. The difference between three dead and four dead might be statistically significant, but is morally negligible. Just hours after the Oregon shooting, a man shot dead his wife and two others, and injured a fourth person, in North Florida. On Friday, five people were shot outside a Baltimore shopping center. The Mass Shooting Tracker total is now at 297. ",2015-10-03 08:00:00,Here’s Why No One Can Agree on the Number of Mass Shootings,,401,http://www.tnr.com/

165,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/2KGXHHc6HKE/,"President Barack Obama recently spoke about the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, explaining that mass shootings were so frequent they were becoming routine - along with the response afterward. He called for expanded gun control measures, echoing the sentiments of the majority of Americans, but not some of the residents of Roseburg. On Thursday, Obama made his remarks on the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon that left nine people dead (not including the shooter) and several more injured. The Washington Post described the President as ""visibly frustrated"" in the press conference. He thanked the federal law enforcement officers in Oregon for saving lives, complimented the people of Roseburg, and tried to voice some of the grief that the locals were feelings. But Obama explained it wasn't enough.""But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now.""The President went on to explain that America is the ""only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."" Obama made a similar claim in June, after the Charleston shooting, saying ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" Politifact rated that line as ""mostly false,"" noting the 2011 bombing and shooting in Norway and the 2009 shooting incident in Winnenden, Germany, as just a few examples of recent mass killings in other advanced nations. Likewise, they found some developed nations had a higher mass-shooting fatalities per 100,000 people rate than the United States. Still, other countries similar to the U.S., such as Australia and the U.K., did have exceptionally low incident rates for mass shootings along with strict gun control laws - a fact mentioned in Obama's speech. He also said the frequency of tragic events like the Oregon incident has made all of this routine.""Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this.""Equally routine, President Obama called for ""common-sense gun-safety laws.""""We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.""   President Barack Obama departs after speaking According to the Pew Research Center, Obama is correct. A poll conducted in July of this year found that 85 percent of Americans favor background checks on all private and gun show sales (including 79 percent of Republicans). Likewise, the pollsters found that 79 percent favored laws to prevent the mentally ill from purchasing firearms and 70 percent wanted a federal database to track gun sales. Still, the Guardian found the locals at Roseburg were wary of both President Obama and gun control measures despite the shooting. In the local gun store, there's a cardboard cutout of President Obama in an Arab keffiyeh scarf with a sign attached saying ""gun salesman of the year."" Obama's calls for gun controls often send people to the store to purchase firearms, in case future reforms make them unavailable. The Oregon store's owner Candi Kinney said that she had to order more assault rifles, explaining that there was always a surge in sales after a mass shooting. The Guardian's interviews with the Oregon locals resulted in a unanimous desire - that the shooting would result in more armed citizens, not the gun safety laws President Obama is promoting.

166,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/03/oregon-attacker-armed-with-6-guns-extra-1/,"ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The man who opened fire on fellow students in his community college English class, killing nine people and severely wounding several others, was armed with six guns, multiple extra ammunition magazines and a flak jacket, law enforcement officials said Friday. Survivor: Oregon gunman spared student to take package to police Survivor: Oregon gunman spared student to take package to police In all, the gunman -- who died in a shootout with police -- had owned 14 firearms, said Celinez Nunez, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including one he had traded in. The Douglas County sheriff's office said the shooter took five handguns and a rifle to Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Thursday, and he had two pistols, four rifles and a shotgun in his apartment. ""All 14 have been traced to a federal firearms dealer,"" some bought by the gunman and others by members of his family, said Nunez, the assistant special agent in charge of the Seattle field office. ""They were all purchased legally. ""We also were able to recover a flak jacket lying next to the rifle at the school. The jacket had steel plates, along with five magazines. An additional amount of ammunition was also recovered at the apartment."" Oregon's top federal prosecutor said the shooter used one of the handguns when he opened fire on classmates. Interim U.S. Attorney Billy Williams said Friday that the gunman stashed a rifle in another room and did not fire it. He said it's impossible to know what the shooter had planned for the rifle. Officials Friday described the shooter, identified by Oregon State Police as Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, as an alienated man who appeared to have a particular animus against religion and was an Army boot camp dropout. They said investigators were studying writings he left behind in which he described himself as angry and depressed. ""He seems to be someone who was very anti-organized religion and was suffering from all sorts of self-worth issues,"" said a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""It does not appear like he was part of some larger group."" Also Friday, officials released the names of the dead, who ranged in age from 18 to 67 and included several freshmen and a teacher. One of the freshmen was active in the Future Farmers of America and loved to play soccer. For another, it was only his fourth day studying at college. One was a 59-year-old student whose daughter was enrolled in the same school but not injured in the shooting. Grieving families began sharing memories of their loved ones. ""We have been trying to figure out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that would take 18 years,"" the family of Lucas Eibel, 18, said in a statement released through the sheriff's office. Eibel, who was studying chemistry, volunteered at a wildlife center and animal shelter. Quinn Glen Cooper's family said he had just started college and loved dancing and voice acting. ""I don't know how we are going to move forward with our lives without Quinn,"" the Coopers said. ""Our lives are shattered beyond repair."" Authorities identified the other seven victims as Lucero Alcaraz, 19; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59; teacher Lawrence Levine, 67; Jason Dale Johnson; Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18; Sarena Dawn Moore, 44; and Treven Taylor Anspach, 20. Seven other people were wounded in the attack in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. Family members of some survivors said their relatives told them that Harper-Mercer specifically targeted Christians. Law enforcement officials have not confirmed that. ""'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them,"" Stacy Boylan, father of Anastasia Boylan, 18, told CNN. ""'And if you're a Christian, stand up.' And they would stand up and he said, 'Good, because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second.' And then he shot and killed them, and then he kept going down the line doing this to people."" He said his daughter was shot in the spine but survived. Sheriff John Hanlin said Friday that it is too early to reach any conclusions. ""It is really too early to tell what the motive was,"" he said. ""We hope to get to the bottom of that in the next couple of days."" Accounts of what happened when the gunman stormed a classroom in Snyder Hall began to emerge, often from relatives who had spoken with survivors. One of the injured, Chris Mintz, 30, was shot five times and suffered two broken legs, but he is expected to live, according to family members interviewed by television station WGHP in North Carolina, where he grew up. Mintz ""tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming, gets shot three times, hits the floor, looks up at the gunman and says 'It's my son's birthday today,' gets shot two more times,"" said his aunt, Wanda Mintz, who was interviewed by the television station. Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the other, and their teacher told them to leave. ""We began to run,"" student Hannah Miles said. ""A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building."" Of those rushed to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, four underwent surgery for gunshot wounds, including one who died in the operating room, and two others were treated for less serious injuries and released, hospital officials said Friday. Three of the most seriously hurt were taken to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center in Eugene. Umpqua Community College remained closed Friday and classes were canceled for next week. ""Right now, it is a crime scene,"" Rita Cavin, the interim president of the college, said. 'Kind of out there' Those who knew the shooter described an awkward loner. Several years ago, Harper-Mercer moved to Winchester, Ore., from Torrance, Calif., with his mother, a nurse named Laurel Harper. His father, Ian Mercer, originally from the United Kingdom, told reporters outside his Tarzana, Calif., home, ""I'm just as shocked as anybody at what happened."" At school in Oregon, ""he was a typical Roseburg kid, kind of nerdy, kind of out there. Just himself,"" said Alex Frier, a stage manager at the college who said Harper-Mercer built sets for theater performances last semester. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, said Harper-Mercer ""seemed really unfriendly"" and would ""sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" At an apartment complex where Harper-Mercer and his mother once lived in Southern California, neighbors remembered a quiet and odd young man who rode a red bike everywhere. Reina Webb, 19, said the man's mother was friendly and often chatted with neighbors, but Harper-Mercer kept to himself. She said she occasionally heard him having temper tantrums in his apartment. ""He was kind of like a child, so that's why his tantrums would be like kind of weird. He's a grown man. He shouldn't be having a tantrum like a kid. That's why I thought there was something -- something was up,"" she said. The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said Harper-Mercer was in the military for a little over a month at Fort Jackson, S.C., but he was discharged for failing to meet the minimum standards. Garrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed. Generally, the Army requires recruits to pass physical-fitness tests and to be in generally good physical and mental health. Recruits also must pass a multiple-choice test covering science, math, reading comprehension and other topics. Harper-Mercer's social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army and frustrated by traditional organized religion. He also tracked other mass shootings. In one post, he appeared to urge readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues live on TV in August in Virginia, noting ""the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" He may have even posted a warning. A message on 4chan -- a forum where derogatory comments against minority groups and women are frequent -- warned of an impending attack, but it's unclear if it came from Harper-Mercer. ""Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest,"" an anonymous poster wrote a day before the shootings. Also Friday, President Barack Obama said he would make a political issue of U.S. gun violence and pressure Congress to change firearms laws. ""This will not change until the politics changes and until the behavior of elected officials changes,"" Obama said at a White House news conference. ""The main thing I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about this on a regular basis. And I am going to politicize it. Because our inaction is a political decision that we are making."" The president, who more than a dozen times has addressed the nation in the aftermath of a mass shooting, said the response to such violence had become too routine. ""This is a political choice we make -- to allow this to happen every few months in America,"" Obama said Thursday after the Oregon shooting. GOP presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Thursday on Twitter that the president was ""quick to politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda."" Another Republican presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, questioned Friday whether the federal government should be the source of solutions to gun violence, including limiting firearms access for people with mental illness. He said that states should take the lead in such efforts. Information for this article was contributed by Claire Cain Miller, Richard Perez-Pena and Michael S.

167,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/oct/03/2-settlers-shot-dead-in-west-bank-20151/,"JERUSALEM -- Israel's military deployed hundreds of troops in the West Bank on Friday, a day after a drive-by shooting by suspected Palestinian gunmen killed a Jewish settler couple driving home with their children. The attack took place late Thursday when gunmen opened fire on a vehicle traveling near the Palestinian village of Beit Furik. The shots killed Eitam and Naama Henkin, residents of the Jewish West Bank settlement of Neria. Their four children, including a 4-month-old, were in the back seat of the car but were unharmed. On Friday, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon visited the site, pledging to catch the perpetrators and, like other Israeli politicians, blaming Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for inciting such violence. Thousands attended the parents' funeral Friday in Jerusalem, including Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. ""We cannot stand silently when the hands of murderers steal a loving mother and father away from their children,"" Rivlin said in a eulogy. ""We are facing a brutal terrorist onslaught."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that Abbas and his government explicitly condemn the slaying of the couple. Meeting Secretary of State John Kerry in New York on Friday, Netanyahu said he appreciated U.S. condemnation of Thursday's attack and noted that some Palestinians had praised the killings. He said the only way to deal with such events is to fight terrorism, and he called on the international community to press Abbas and the Palestinian Authority to act. ""I have to say I have yet to hear any condemnation from President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority,"" Netanyahu told Kerry. ""Worse, I heard senior officials from his Fatah movement say 'This is the way to go'. No, it's not the way to go. The way to go ... is to fight terrorism and to make sure that terrorism reaps no rewards."" Netanyahu and Kerry noted the mass shooting at a college in Oregon on Thursday that left nine people and the gunman dead. They said Israel and the U.S. were united in grief. ""We're sharing with you the grief that Israel feels today,"" Kerry said. ""I hope we can share also the efforts going forward to reduce and maybe ultimately one day eliminate"" these ""terrible losses"" for the families. The attack comes on the heels of a series of Palestinian rock and firebomb attacks that have prompted Israel to vow to quash such threats. It also followed a hard-line speech at the United Nations by Abbas, the last of several that Israeli leaders have condemned as incitement. Abbas has said that Israelis desecrate a Jerusalem holy site with their ""dirty feet"" and that Israel was committed to the ""ethnic cleansing"" of his people. Speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, Abbas said Israel had repeatedly violated its commitments, most notably by expanding settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, on lands the Palestinians seek for a future state, and accused Israel of waging ""a new war of genocide ... against the Palestinian people."" ""A people whose leader encourages murder will never have a state, and this must be stated clearly,"" said Cabinet minister Naftali Bennett, head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party. Settler leaders said they planned to stage a protest in front of Netanyahu's office to demand tougher action to defend the settlers from militants. Gaza's Islamic militant Hamas rulers welcomed Thursday's attack but stopped short of claiming responsibility for it. Abbas' Palestinian Authority did not comment on the attack. Tensions have flared between Israelis and Palestinians over the Jerusalem site known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to the biblical Temples, and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, site of the Al-Aqsa mosque and the spot from where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended to heaven.

Chris Mintz, an amateur MMA fighter with a record of 1-1, was shot seven times by a gunman Friday during a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Mintz survived, but took bullet wounds to the back, abdomen and hands, according to NBC News (h/t Washington Post). The 30-year-old became an instant hero in the hours after the incident, which saw 10 people dead, including the gunman, and seven more injured. The casualties may have been even worse, if not for Mintz blocking the shooter's way into a classroom full of fellow students, reportedly telling the gunman ""you're not getting by me,"" according to a report from KTLA 5. This is Chris's friend, Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts. The shooter, who was subsequently identified as Chris Harper Mercer, opened fire on Mintz, but apparently did not get into the classroom. Here's your hero! Chris Mintz, Army vet used to live in Tacoma. He rushed the gunman and survived being shot 7 times pic.twitter.com/0lj8JF67or Later, Mintz's aunt, Sheila Brown, told NBC News Mintz was ""on the wrestling team and and he's done cage-fighting so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically."" ""[Mintz] tried to protect some people,"" she added. ""We were told he did heroic things to protect some people."" Mintz is also a 10-year Army veteran. In a sport that often sees villainous figures like War Machine and the arrests of top fighters like Jon Jones grab headlines out of the cage, it is a major change from the norm to see someone like Mintz, whose background in MMA is not elite but exists nonetheless, earn notoriety for the right reasons. Simply put: Chris Mintz is someone the MMA community can and should be proud of. Enjoy our content? Join our newsletter to get the latest in sports news delivered straight to your inbox!

Like his predecessor David Letterman, Colbert elected to confront a serious issue gripping our country, even as late-night television is generally regarded as a comedic haven from the harsh realities. “Whether or not we hit the right notes on any given night, I think that the least that we can do is not pretend to always know what to do or say, and in the face of the killings in Oregon yesterday I don’t know what to do or say, other than our hearts are broken for the people struck by this senseless tragedy,” Colbert said. “And I don’t know how to start a show like this, which is often about whatever happened in the last 24 hours. I can’t pretend that it didn’t happen; I also can’t pretend to know what to do to prevent what happened yesterday and all the times it has happened before. But I think pretending is part of the problem.” Related

						Black Sabbath on the Making of 'Vol. 4': 'It Was Absolute Pandemonium' Without taking sides or politicizing the incident, Colbert still criticized lawmakers for their overall inaction. “These things happen over and over again and we’re naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them, but then we change nothing, and we pretend that it won’t happen again. Some say the answer is stricter gun laws; others say the answer is mental health care, that we need better treatment or just keep the guns out of the hands of the insane. Maybe it’s both, I honestly don’t know,” Colbert said. “But I do know that one of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” After Colbert’s moving speech, the host brought some levity back to The Late Show by discussing “honest insanity” in the form of Donald Trump. “Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say: You’re not going to be president,” Colbert said. “There is zero chance we’ll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.” Colbert’s monologue was reminiscent of his former colleague Jon Stewart’s heartbreaking remarks on The Daily Show in the wake of the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting in June. “I honestly have nothing other than just sadness once again that we have to peer into the abyss of the depraved violence that we do to each other and the nexus of a just gaping racial wound that will not heal, yet we pretend it doesn’t exist,” Stewart said before admitting, “I’m confident, though, that by acknowledging it, by staring into that and seeing it for what it is, we still won’t do jack shit. Yeah. That’s us.” In This Article:

Here are the data, charts and maps seeking to put the issue in perspective. Following the shooting at an Oregon community college in early October that left 10 dead, including the shooter, President Obama delivered an emotional statement to the press lamenting that the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where mass shootings have become commonplace. He reiterated that sentiment on Wednesday following news of the San Bernardino shooting, telling CBS News, “We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world.” There’s data to show that he’s right. The San Bernardino shooting is the 355th mass shooting this year. That data comes from the Mass Shooting Tracker, maintained by the Guns Are Cool subreddit, which defines a mass shooting as one in which “four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling off period.” Earlier this year, the Washington Post charted firearm homicides per 100,000 people among wealthy nations, based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: “Somehow this has become routine,” Obama said after the Oregon shooting in October. “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it ... We have become numb to this,” he said. It’s no wonder that Obama feels his response to mass shootings is routine: The Washington Post’s Christopher Ingram writes there is a simple reason mass shootings have become routine: there are more guns than people in the U.S. This Vox graphic shows that the U.S. has 4.4% of the world’s population, but 42% of civilian-owned guns: Put another way: There is data showing a correlation between gun ownership and mass shootings internationally: Read: 10 things the gun industry won’t tell you Obama has said his primary strategy going forward on gun control legislation would be to mount a public campaign. He has called on Americans to change the politics and elect lawmakers who are willing to take steps to curb gun violence. Quorum has visualized the congressional response to major shootings over the past several years: That data show that congressional mentions of mass shootings in the context of gun control and mental health issues peaked after the late-2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn., when the White House unsuccessfully pushed for increased background checks for gun purchases. Republicans and Democrats do differ on the issue of guns, at least, in how they talk about it: Meanwhile, this National Journal article looks at the congressional response by tallying up the number of bills addressing gun usage and access passed in the wake of school shootings: Read related commentary: The NRA’s profit soars as deaths from gun massacres mount Read: 5 things harder to buy than guns Among the states with the lowest death rates from firearms are Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Hawaii. A graphic in the National Journal explains why that might be: those same states have the most gun laws. California strengthened its gun laws in 2014 and now has some of the strongest gun laws in the U.S. A Mashable analysis found that stricter gun control laws do correlate strongly with lower gun-related death rates: But the relationship becomes weaker once states meet a certain level in the strength of gun control legislation. California, for instance, has higher gun-related death rates despite its strong legislation.

Lawmakers have shied away from enacting stricter gun laws for precisely this reason: new restrictions would infringe on second amendment rights, they argue, and at best do little to prevent further shootings. But for proponents of gun control, those explanations are thinly veiled excuses amid intense pressure from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun rights advocates. A look at gun policy at the state level, however, provides evidence that new reforms are not as politically toxic as advertised. While the gun lobby has chalked up victories in terms of loosening firearm restrictions in conservative states, Americans have not in recent years kicked out of office those lawmakers who voted against them – or, in some cases, advanced comprehensive gun control packages. One such litmus test occurred last year in the 2014 midterm elections, when the odds were arguably stacked against gun control advocates. Democrats suffered heavy losses at the state and federal levels, losing control over the US Senate and suffering defeats in key gubernatorial races across the country. But two governors, Democrats who were deemed vulnerable, survived: Dan Malloy of Connecticut and John Hickenlooper of Colorado. Both signed into law sweeping gun reforms. One could argue their constituents were behind those efforts – for Malloy, the action followed the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown. For Hickenlooper the legislation was prompted by the Aurora movie theater shooting that same year. But Hickenlooper, especially, was a top target for the NRA. Gun rights advocates had recalled in 2013 two state Democrats in Colorado who voted for his gun package, which expanded background checks and placed a ban on high-capacity magazines. Not only did Hickenlooper hold on to to his seat, but the Republicans also lost the two seats they picked up in the recall the year before – undermining, in essence, the pro-gun narrative around its success. Malloy was similarly re-elected even though the Sandy Hook shooting led the governor to sign some of toughest gun laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban, prohibition on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks. Tom Foley, his Republican opponent in the 2014 race, refused throughout the election to articulate his position on gun laws. In perhaps the biggest win for the anti-gun violence coalition, voters in Washington State overwhelmingly supported a ballot initiative to expand background checks while rejecting a competing measure from the NRA designed to ease restrictions. Questions over the political consequences of supporting stricter gun laws extended to the federal level too. When the Senate failed to expand background checks after the tragedy in Newtown, two Democrats who sided with the NRA and opposed what was known as the Manchin-Toomey bill – Arkansas senator Mark Pryor and Alaska senator Mark Begich – lost their seats anyway. The outcome, at the very least, supported a poll conducted just prior to election day in which Americans said they did not rank gun control as a top issue. It is unknown whether that will change in 2016, a presidential election year that will draw far greater turnout. Democrats would certainly like attitudes to shift in their favor for what has emerged as yet another party line issue. Hillary Clinton has increasingly campaigned in favor of new gun laws amid a series of mass shootings over the summer and called for holding both the NRA and politicians accountable. It’s a risk that Obama himself did not take when facing re-election in 2012, memorably responding to a gun control question during a presidential debate with Mitt Romney not long after the Aurora movie theater shooting by focusing on the need to enforce current laws and keep guns away from the mentally ill. Obama, of course, has since been freed from the political ramifications of a hot-button issue and advocated for stricter gun laws with more passion than any modern president. He has pointed out that the rate of gun-related deaths and injuries in the US are unparalleled in the developed world. On Thursday he asked the media to publish comparisons of the number of Americans killed by terrorism as opposed to gun violence. As the president said while addressing the Oregon shooting with visible frustration bordering on helplessness, action “will require a change of politics on this issue”. “It will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision,” Obama said. “If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.” Recent years have shown that the American public is increasingly amenable to modest changes in access to firearms – their elected officials simply refuse to acknowledge it.",2015-10-03 12:08:10,Is enacting gun control a political risk?

But then we change nothing. And we pretend that it won’t happen again.” Colbert admitted he didn’t know if better mental health treatment or stricter gun laws were necessary, but said he did know that pretending and insanity are usually connected. “One of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” Colbert then segued into the rest of the segment about Donald Trump, congress, and “honest insanity.” WANT MORE?

180,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/oregon-community-college-gunman-killed-himself-sheriff,"First published on Sat 3 Oct 2015 21.05 BST The gunman responsible for Oregon’s worst mass shooting killed himself as police closed in, it has emerged.  Chris Harper-Mercer took his own life after being “neutralised” by officers who responded to the massacre scene in Roseburg on Thursday, Sheriff John Hanlin told a news conference on Saturday afternoon. The medical examiner had determined “suicide” as the cause of death, Hanlin said, without elaborating. It was initially thought the 26-year-old died from police bullets after murdering nine classmates and wounding nine others at Umpqua community college, where he was enrolled in a writing course. Hanlin said the deputies’ intervention saved dozens of lives by incapacitating the shooter, who wore body armour and carried enough firepower – three handguns and a rifle, plus lots of ammunition – for a potential siege. Police found another eight guns – it was initially reported to be seven – at the family home, bringing the total in the killer’s possession to 14, said the sheriff. The latest details came after Blackhawk helicopters ferried victims’ bodies back to Roseburg for burial, as the town prepared for funerals which it hopes will shift attention from the killer to his victims. The Oregon national guard airlifted the nine corpses from Portland, where autopsies were conducted, back to a hometown shrouded in mourning. The two helicopters broke a quiet, sunlit autumnal morning to land at the logging community’s small airport. The bodies were taken in a small fleet of vehicles to funeral homes to be prepared for burial. The victims were: Luero Alcaraz, 19; Treven Anspach, 20; Larry Levine, 67; Kim Dietz, 59; Quinn Glen Cooper, 18; Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18; Jason Johnson, 34; and Sarena Dawn Moore, 44. It was reported that Harper-Mercer passed a small box or envelope to a male student whom he spared, prompting speculation it held a note or a digital device containing a document detailing alienation and grievances, including the killer’s hostility to organised religion and his inability to find a girlfriend. Stacy Boylan, whose daughter Anastasia was injured in the shooting, said she told him the gunman “gave somebody a box, somebody who lived, and said, ‘You gotta deliver this.’” Another version of events said it was an envelope. The family of Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, a 16-year-old nursing student who was wounded and is believed to be the youngest casualty in the attack, told reporters at Mercy Medical Center that a bullet entered her back, clipped a lung and lodged in a kidney, which surgeons removed. “Her recovery will be long but she’ll get there,” said her mother, Bonnie. Bonnie Fitzgerald said her daughter saw the killer give an envelope to a student whom he ordered into a corner, “because obviously he was the one who was going to be telling the story”. The mother paraphrased a message Cheyeanne texted from the scene: “Fucker shot me in the back.” The family has set up a fundraising site to help pay medical bills. A failed soldier with apparent mental illness who lived with his mother, Harper-Mercer appeared to crave the infamy of other mass murderers. Roseburg, however, resolved to shift attention to his victims, a group ranging in age from 18 to 67, among them a basketball player, an outdoorsman, a student nurse and an animal lover, who had all signed up to a writing course at the campus where Harper-Mercer was also enrolled. “In remembrance”, said a banner headline of the local News-Review newspaper, accompanied by the names and images of the nine dead but no mention of their killer. People queuing to donate blood at a mobile clinic in the centre of town reflected the sentiment, saying the town, and the national blaze of publicity, should focus on victims. “This is hard. We’re very tight-knit here,” said Joleen Conner, 36, her arm patched after donating blood. She graduated from UCC three years ago and knew people caught up in the rampage. “I had pins and needles waiting to hear from everyone.” Flags flew at at half-staff and fast-food restaurants joined churches in posting invocations to pray for this community of 22,000 people. With media crews fanning around Roseburg to investigate and report details of Harper-Mercer’s troubled life, numbness turned to resentment as the town sensed this was what he intended: an atrocity to claim notoriety and add Roseburg to Charleston, Newtown, Aurora, Columbine – other towns hit by mass shootings. On a website called Kickass Torrents, a user believed to be Harper-Mercer noted that a disgruntled ex-television network employee in Virginia got his “face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet” after murdering former colleagues live on air last month. “So many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows,” the user wrote. Sheriff Hanlin has vowed to not name the shooter. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” he said. The Oregonian newspaper, however, criticised that stance in an editorial, saying Hanlin’s hostility to gun control was clouding investigation into what caused Harper-Mercer’s homicidal spree. “Did mental illness play a part?” the newspaper asked. “How did he get his weapons? These are relevant, uncomfortable questions that, in Hanlin’s mind, may glorify the act, but in truth they only expose the complexity of the problems we face.”",2015-10-03 16:05:19,"Oregon community college gunman killed himself, says sheriff",,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

X OUR PICKS: The tiny moment that ends the touring production of “The Events” at the Guthrie Theater puts an exclamation point on several issues with the well-meaning but awkward performance.
Inspired by a 2011 massacre in Norway, “The Events” is set in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a church. Claire, a priest, has survived but is obsessed with understanding why the shooting occurred, drawing her loved ones and her reluctant congregation into her search for answers.
The congregation will be played during the Guthrie run by several different choirs — on opening night, it was an ensemble of 20 or so from the Twin Cities Women’s Choir — who sing half a dozen songs and play supporting roles in the proceedings. 
At the end of the opening performance, Lesley Hart, who plays Claire, thanked the “wonderful” choir and then, in a gesture that drew chuckles because it made her “wonderful” seem insincere, walked halfway across the stage to pick up a Post-It note to find out the name of the wonderful choir she was thanking. 


Yes, it would be tough to remember the name of a different choir each night but there are theatrical ways to deal with that, or you could let the hard-working women introduce themselves. So the Post-It note seemed like a symbol for the whole production, which often distances the audience even as it is trying to pull us into its attempt to find healing and forgiveness in the midst of tragedy. The two leads — Hart and Clifford Samuel, who plays the shooter and several other roles, appear uncomfortable in their interactions with the choir (it can’t be easy to have new co-stars every night) and there’s a hollow quality to their acting as they slip in an out of the fragmentary scenes that make up “The Events.”
In theory, the fragments are a good idea, recalling the way we piece together events in our memories while also hinting that it’s impossible to assemble the pieces because there’s likely no way to understand where these sorts of appalling events come from (I kept thinking of John Weidman and Stephen Sondheim’s musical “Assassins,” which asks similar questions much more skilfully). But the play’s metaphors often seem facile, the actors’ practice of declaiming nearly every line straight to the audience while also ignoring us grows wearying and the scripts the choir members must carry are off-putting.
About that choir, though. They’re lovely and the women dive gamely into their roles as foils for the two leads. I’m not nuts about the way they’re used in the finale — like many an overblown Grammy Awards performance, “The Events” ends with a choir soaring in to provide musical uplift — but the group is a crucial part of the evening. “The Events”‘s banality-of-evil conclusion is no revelation but, throughout the show, the choir on stage functions as a tangible reminder that, although human beings are capable of violent and inexplicable behavior, we can also come together to create beauty and peace.

In a related report by the Inquisitr, a recent Florida shooting left three dead and one person critically injured in the town of Inglis. The Florida shooting took place at a home near the local town hall. The recent Oregon shooting at a community college left nine people dead in the town of Roseburg. Already, the discussion has turned to more gun control laws, but while Jeb Bush calls the mass shooting ""heartbreaking"" he also says that ""more government"" wasn't ""necessarily the answer."" ""I had this challenge as governor,"" Bush said, speaking about how the state government tended to respond after a Florida shooting. ""Look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" President Barack Obama was asked about Jeb Bush's comments made at the Conservative Leadership Project, and the president indicated that the increase in mass shootings points to a problem. ""I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting,"" Obama said, according to NPR. ""And they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening.' "" In response, Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger said it was ""sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush's comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy.""More importantly, go here to support OR victims through the Greater Douglas United Way and Umpqua Bank Relief Fund: http://t.co/SmrxPUlNrb — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 2, 2015Regardless of the war of words between Bush and Democrats, State Representative Greg Steube argues that Second Amendments rights are crucial in stopping a potential Florida shooting on college campuses. ""America's based on the freedom to be able to defend yourself, to defend others, and the inherent right to self defense; and for some reason, we have stripped that right as you enter a college campus,"" said Steube, who believes that it is a college student's right to wield a gun on a college campus. Curt Lavarello of the School Safety Advocacy Council disagrees, arguing that stopping a Florida shooting spree would only be made more difficult if police officers also had to deal with armed students. ""We know one thing,"" Lavarello said, according to WWSB. ""We're not going to reduce school gun violence by bringing more guns. The dynamics of a school shooting are very difficult already. I can't imagine being a police officer and having to respond to a school where the report is 'there's one bad armed person and 20 good armed people' and then having to make a split second decision."" In response, Steube argues that police officers deal with that particular problem ""everywhere else"" where Floridians are allowed to carry a gun, so he asks, ""Why can't they handle it on a college campus?"" College students are also grappling with the debate over Florida gun control laws. According to the Gainesville Sun, UF student Jeremy Youngquist believes that allowing college gun permits may help since the presence of armed students may dissuade a shooter from attacking. He also believes that gun-free zones do not help. ""My only thought is if someone wanted to bring a gun with mal-intent, they wouldn't care whether there is a law or not,"" he said.

Read Transcript Not at all Somewhat Certain Search and sort every Brewers regular season home run in the Miller Park era. ■ Before the game, the Brewers honored right-hander Jorge Lopez and shortstop Orlando Arcia, their minor-league pitcher and player of the year. Charlie Sullivan, the scout who signed Lopez, was on hand for the ceremony and will see him pitch the Brewers' season finale Sunday. Arcia went home to Venezuela so he was represented by Class AA Biloxi's Carlos Subero, who managed both players. As for Arcia, he said, ""Orlando definitely closed the gap (to the majors) with the year he put up. When he comes here, fans are going to be real excited watching him play. Orlando is somebody who loves the spotlight, and in a good way."" Beyond Lopez's obvious physical talent, Sullivan said he made it this far at age 22 because ""he's got tremendous poise, and he really always has. That's not something you can really teach."" ■ Head athletic trainer Dan Wright voiced support before the game for the citizens of Roseburg, Ore., as well as students and faculty at Umpqua Community College, where nine people were killed in a mass shooting Thursday. Wright's hometown is Roseburg and he received his associate's degree in physical education at UCC in 1982. ""For me, it hits as close to home as it can,"" said Wright. ""I didn't know any of the victims directly but I know people who knew them. It's a pretty tight-knit community. I just want to express my condolences and heart-felt wishes to the families of those who lost their lives."" ■ Brewers starter Tyler Wagner was in need of a solid outing after rough ones in his first two major-league starts (15 hits, 10 runs in 72/3 innings, 11.74 ERA). Wagner delivered the third time around, allowing seven hits and one run in six innings with two walks and three strikeouts.

The revelations also raise the question of whether the shooter's mother may have supplied him with any of the weapons he used in the Oregon mass shooting. Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Special Agent Salinas Nunez said on Thursday that of the 13 guns found in Christopher Harper-Mercer's possession, at least some were purchased legally by other family members. Oregon Shooting Suspect Christopher Harper-Mercer Harper-Mercer, who reportedly died in a pre-planned suicide after murdering nine people at Umpqua Community College and wounding seven more, moved with his mother to Oregon two years ago, from Torrance, California. ""I moved from So. Calif. to Oregon, from Southern Crime-a-mania to open carry,"" Harper said in the Facebook posting uncovered by the news site Vocativ.com. In the same posting, the woman lists the various makes and models of guns she claims to own. ""When the mood strikes, and as long as we're tossing around brand names, I sling an AR, Tek-9 or AK over my shoulder, or holster a Glock 21 (not 22), or one of my other handguns, like the Sig Sauer P226, and walk out the door. I find the shotguns are a little too cumbersome to open carry, "" she wrote in the online comment posted in September of 2014. Harper-Mercer's parents are divorced and his father, Ian Mercer, still lives in California. On Saturday, he told CNN that he was shocked that his son — whom he said he had not seen since the move to Oregon — was a gun owner, much less the owner of 13 firearms. ""I had no idea he had any guns. I have no idea that he had any guns whatsoever,"" Mercer told the news network. ""And I'm a great believer you don't buy guns, don't buy guns, you don't buy guns."" Ian Mercer, father of Oregon shooting suspect Christopher Harper-Mercer. The Oregon shooting suspect's mother, however, apparently disagreed, and also appears to have passed on her enthusiasm for firearms to her son. A New York Times investigation into the Oregon shooter's history found that while he rarely interacted with neighbors, he could become effusive if the conversation turned to the subject of guns. ""When we talked about guns and hunting, he was real open about it,"" one neighbor, Louie Flores, 32, told the New York Times. ""But anything about what was going on in his life, he really didn't say too much at all."" Another acquaintance, Shelly Steele, told the New York Daily News that Harper-Mercer's mother took him shooting on gun ranges — but preferred ranges with minimum supervision. ""She said she had multiple guns and believed wholeheartedly in the Second Amendment and wanted to get all the guns she could before someone outlawed them,"" Steele said. ""My husband is an avid hunter and former military, so she would talk to him about it all the time, how she liked to take her son shooting."" Steele added that the Oregon shooter's mom rejected a gun range near to Umpqua Community College because it required that customers be accompanied by a range master, and Laurel Harper ""didn't like anyone watching."" But Steele also told the paper that Harper had spoken to her about her son's mental health issues, and Steele found it ""strange,"" therefore, that she would ""encourage a fascination with guns."" That fascination appears to have culminated in the Oregon mass shooting, carried out by Christopher Harper-Mercer.

I don’t know how to start a show like this which is often about what’s happened in the last 24 hours.” “I can’t pretend that it didn’t happen.I also can’t pretend to know what to do to prevent what happened yesterday, all of the times it has happened before,” he said before adding, “But I think pretending is part of the problem. These things happen over and over again and we are naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them — but then we change nothing and we pretend that it won’t happen again.” “Some say the answer is stricter gun laws, others say the answer is mental health care, that we need better treatment or just keep the guns out of hands of the insane. Maybe it’s both. I honestly don’t know,” he continued. “But I do know that one of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.” Watch a clip of his comments:  h/t: Raw Story Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

It was done by a 20-year-old male student who asked about a person's religion. Immediately many in the news media and the president of the United States of America asked for more gun control. This weapon did not kill anyone; it was the finger on the trigger. It is the criminal and sometimes people with mental problems that do these acts. Remember fists, knives, machetes, clubs and rocks are also available. When will the public wake up and start insisting on tougher and more meaningful sentences for the criminal, better identification of the mental issues involved? Until that is done, these type killings will continue. James E. Muecke, Houston  Predictable Regarding ""America. The Beautiful?"" (Page B8, Friday), the saddest thing about the editorial cartoon with a giant gun imposed on the outline of the USA was my thinking that the cartoonist must have had that one already drawn, just waiting for the next massacre. Our unwillingness to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and criminals made another mass murder all too predictable. Stella Fitzgibbons, The Woodlands  Video games? It occurs to me that there must be a connection between the recent spate of mass killings, to video games. I have watched my grandsons play these video games and have been appalled at the inhumanity aspect of the ""games."" The idea is to ""kill"" as many intruders as quickly as possible. Anything that appears on the screen is a ""target."" Mass killings are pretty much of the last decade. I have not seen one reference to video games in all the analyses. Perhaps the problem is not ""guns"" but ""video games!"" Thomas W. Childers, Kingwood  Speak up It would seem logical that the Republican Party would be as vehement about taking a life by liberal gun laws as the loss of life by abortion. To have 10 students slaughtered at college and multiple shootings nationwide is atrocious. To take the life of the unborn is also murder, no matter what stage of development.

191,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/04/oregon-shooting-state-universities-campus-gun-laws-concealed-carry,"Amid 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, states have moved to allow more guns on campuses. Oregon is one of a handful that allows concealed carry Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.35 BST After Thursday’s mass shooting in Oregon – the 45th school shooting in the US this year – that left nine dead, attention has focused on the state’s policy of allowing guns on college campuses. Until recently, state law allowed colleges to ban guns on campus. Most public colleges and universities in the Beaver State, including the Oregon University System, opted to do so.  In 2011, though, the Oregon court of appeals ruled that gun bans on public campuses exceeded the university’s authority. At issue was a state law declaring that only the state legislature could regulate the use, sale and possession of firearms. The following year, the Oregon state board of higher education approved a policy that banned guns from being brought inside campus buildings. However, the status of campus gun regulations has yet to be fully settled in the courts. What is clear, Erika Soto Lamb, communications director at Everytown for Gun Safety, wrote in an email, is that “Oregon law actually forces colleges to allow guns on campus grounds”. Oregon is one of fewer than a dozen states, along with more conservative counterparts like Mississippi and Utah, which allow concealed carry on college campuses. At Umpqua Community College, the site of Thursday’s tragedy, the policy change came in a meeting of the board of directors on 9 November 2011. According to the minutes, the Oregon Community College Association legal counsel “spoke about the gun law changes which affect the ability to carry a concealed weapon on campus”. As a result, the counsel noted: “If you have a concealed weapon card, the policy of the board may not restrict a person from carrying a weapon.” Umpqua’s policy soon changed to allow guns on campus, although “at the time of the shooting, Umpqua Community College had as strong a policy as Oregon law permits”, Lamb said. A frequent refrain among conservatives is that violent rampages happen in places like college campuses and movie theaters precisely because guns are banned there. The thinking goes that someone setting out to commit a massacre can select a target where he is reasonably assured not to encounter an armed citizen. (There is no evidence of a shooter ever selecting a target precisely because it is a gun-free zone.) In the Umpqua case, though, at least one student (and likely others) was carrying a concealed weapon during the massacre. Needless to say, this did not prevent the tragedy. An armed Umpqua student, John Parker Jr, explained just how difficult, if not impossible, it would have been for an armed bystander to stop the attack. “The Swat team wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they could think we were bad guys,” he told MSNBC. Another reason college administrators tend to support banning firearms on campus is insurance. A rash of state bills to allow guns in classrooms followed the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, but according to Jennifer Lynch, spokesperson at the Oregon Alliance for Gun Safety, most were ultimately voted down because insurance companies refused to cover schools with more guns or charged sky-high rates. “Insurance companies aren’t emotional or political; they look only at the risk,” she said. “They know the risk of having armed people on campus increases the risk of gun injuries and gun deaths.” School districts in Oregon, for example, have to pay an additional $2,500 premium annually per armed staff member. Banning guns on college campuses is a controversial issue, but that doesn’t mean it’s a new one. In 1824, a University of Virginia board of visitors meeting decided that “no student shall, within the precincts of the University [...] keep or use weapons or arms of any kind”. Among those at the meeting were founding fathers Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, and James Madison, widely considered the father of the US constitution, including the second amendment. Nor is the issue confined to Oregon. Though there have been 142 school shootings in the US since Sandy Hook, the trend in statehouses has moved in favor of allowing more guns on university grounds. In the past few years, Kansas, Idaho and Texas have passed laws allowing concealed weapons on campus. Professors in these states are now grappling with a new and more armed environment. After Texas passed a bill, SB11, earlier this year to permit weapons on campuses, more than 180 professors at the University of Texas signed a petition vowing to ban guns in their classrooms. Jessica Smartt Gullion, an assistant professor of sociology at Texas Woman’s University, wrote in a recent Newsweek op-ed about a student so upset over a grade as to throw a public tantrum and bring an intimidating man to the classroom as a threat. Gullion argued that because this type of situation was not unusual, allowing firearms in universities could result in violence against professors over trivial issues like a poor mark. Despite the court ruling allowing guns on Oregon campuses, the state is nevertheless viewed as a recent success story among advocates of stronger gun laws. In May of this year, Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, signed SB 941, a bill that will require background checks on private gun sales. The following month, Brown signed SB 525, which bars domestic violence offenders from possessing firearms. The measures, which came after a 2012 shooting in a Portland-area mall left three dead, including the shooter, were passed despite opposition from the National Rifle Association. Lynch said that while there was no current legislation to overturn Oregon’s campus-carry ruling, “given that this is the second school shooting in Oregon in the last 18 months, this discussion will almost certainly come back up”.",2015-10-04 07:30:01,Oregon shooting occurred in state that 'actually forces colleges to allow guns',,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Immediately after news broke, an all too familiar political dance started. Without knowing anything about the shooter, how the gun was obtained or any of the facts other than vague reports, pro- and anti-gun control advocates took their standard positions. President Barack Obama even went on television to denounce the lack of gun control laws and political inaction after prior mass shootings. Late in the evening we learned the name of the shooter, but not much about him. Early reports in such emergency situations often are inaccurate. In other mass shootings, the shooters’ motivations have varied, from racism to religion to anti-religion. There has not been a single common theme, except for one. In almost all mass shooting situations, particularly at schools, the common theme is a gun-free zone, with the shooter being the only one armed person in the building for minutes or longer. And in each case, the shooter couldn’t care less about the gun-free nature of the building, and if anything, was drawn to such a location.

The Washington Post reports that all the four students who have been arrested by the local police are male students who had been preparing detailed plans about going on a killing spree in their Summerville High School for days.BREAKING: Tuolumne County deputies arrest 4 students in school shooting plot. http://t.co/hr4ydbWg18 pic.twitter.com/otgUszTi71— The Modesto Bee (@modbee) October 3, 2015However, unusually nervous behavior and excited body language on part of the students planning the attack during school hours drew suspicion from the students' classmates, some of whom anonymously called the police on Wednesday morning. Detectives arrested the four students on charges of conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons on Friday afternoon at their respective homes and turned them over to the Tuolumne County Probation Department, according to Miami Herald. The suspects' names were not released because all four are juveniles. BREAKING: Tuolumne County deputies arrest 4 students in school shooting plot. http://t.co/hr4ydbWg18 pic.twitter.com/otgUszTi71 According to Tuolumne County Sheriff Jim Mele, when the police raided the houses of three of the four students, who apparently all hail from California, they were stunned to find clues and paperwork which were ""very detailed in nature and included the names of victims, locations, and methods in which the plan was to be carried out."" Mele further told NBC that the four students had been emboldened to carry out their ghastly attack after witnessing a surge in mass shootings across USA during the past few years.""They were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible at the campus. It is particularly unsettling when our most precious assets – which are our students, their teachers – are targets for violence.""The California state police also thanked students whose timely intervention may have helped prevent another mass shooting in one of the country's educational institutions.""Their willingness to get involved and report what they saw prevented what well could have been another needless tragedy.""After the school arrests came to light, parents of concerned students gathered outside the school premises, wondering if it was safe for their children to carry on with their routines in tense times such as these. The local police then conducted an open press conference, where they answered questions by anxious parents, emphasizing that they had all the suspects under arrest. One of the parents has her doubts cleared during the open session called by the police in the town of Tuolumne, located in northern California. (Photo: Miami Herald) The officials also spoke of the need of small communities such as that of Tuolumne to stick together if the country was to successfully thwart violence inflicted by young people who were increasingly taking to guns in a bid to overcome their psychological and social problems.""We believe, with all our heart, the reason we were able to stop this was because we have a level of trust within our community. When you have a level of trust with the law enforcement, your education – we meet monthly, we meet constantly – you can do this.""After the hour-long discussion held at the Summerville High School, officials, teachers and parents concurred at the possible reasons for the surge in mass shootings. They identified bullying (also cyberbullying) and the exposure of children to violence in media as the main culprits.""When we turn on the TV, violence is always on, or at our fingertips on the computer. [We] think children today have a hard time trying to understand the difference between what is reality and fiction. To say why, [we] don't know why. [We] do know the discussion needs to start not only in our community, but throughout the nation, about what can we do to stop this violence.""Assistant District Attorney Eric Hovatter reiterated that his office will collect the information about the case from the Sheriff's Office and begin to decide what charges will be filed. He emphasized that in light of the Oregon shooting and other mass murders instigated by juveniles, it was important for parents to realize that their own children could be willing to carry out attacks without much premeditation.""It is clear from past history, such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against fellow students and teachers on school grounds.""It remains to be seen just what punishment will be meted out to the four students held responsible for planning the mass shooting in California, but one thing is clear to many claimants: it is time we addressed the violence raging within our educational institutions.

196,http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/someone-can-make-a-change-on-guns-you/2248326,"Editor's note: After the killing of nine people at an Oregon community college on Thursday, President Obama gave an emotional speech in which he admitted he was politically powerless to do something about the lack of gun control in America, but pointed out there was one group that could — the nation's voters. The following is a slightly condensed transcript of Obama's remarks: There's been another mass shooting in America — this time, in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families — moms, dads, children — whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children. In the coming days, we'll learn about the victims — young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who's grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America — next week, or a couple of months from now. It's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, ""The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws — even in the face of repeated mass killings."" And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country — they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws — including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America. So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And, of course, what's also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic. I would ask news organizations — because I won't put these facts forward — have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports. We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be? This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives. So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations, doesn't make sense. So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back. And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.",2015-10-04 16:29:57,Someone can make a change on guns: You,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

But while spineless lawmakers on Capitol Hill, cowed by the gun lobby, stand in the way of sensible change, at least a few states are moving to try to prevent some of the gun violence that kills 89 Americans each day in murders, suicides and accidents. USA TODAY Gun control is killing us: Opposing view The most basic, common-sense strategy is expanding background checks to include virtually all sales of guns, not just those sold by federally licensed dealers. A gap in the federal law allows buyers at gun shows and online to avoid the background checks. That's a huge loophole for felons, fugitives, drug users, the mentally ill or people prone to domestic violence. Since the fatal shootings in December 2012 of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Conn., six states — Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, New York, Washington and most recently Oregon — have expanded background checks to virtually all guns sold, no matter the venue. Nevada will vote on a similar initiative next year, and groups led by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are pushing an initiative in Maine. Are such laws a panacea? Of course not. The Roseburg suspect, Chris Harper-Mercer, managed to obtain an arsenal of 14 firearms legally. Some he bought, some were purchased by family members, according to a federal official. But even Harper-Mercer's father said the massacre ""wouldn't have happened"" if his son hadn't been able to buy so many guns. California has had expanded checks for all guns since 1990 and has cut its firearm mortality rate almost in half, according to one 2012 study done for the Brady Campaign. A wide array of evidence shows that states with more guns have more gun deaths and more police officers killed on duty.   States with tighter gun laws have fewer gun-related deaths. Average Americans have a lot more sense than the 45 U.S. senators who stood in the way of a federal gun-safety measure in April 2013, when the nation’s wounds from Newtown were still raw and stricter controls appeared to have the best chance in decades to pass. Those senators are out of step with the country. A vast majority of Americans favor expanded checks, including 88% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans, according to a Pew poll in July. Similarly, nearly 80% favor laws that would prevent the mentally ill from buying guns. But existing federal background checks prevent only a tiny slice of this population — those ruled mentally defective or involuntarily committed by a judge to a mental institution  — from buying guns. The most helpful strategy would give family members, who often know better than anyone else when someone’s mental state is deteriorating, an avenue to separate that person from guns. Again, states are leading the way. California passed a law, backed by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, last year that gives families or police a way to get a gun violence restraining order.  If a judge agrees the person presents a credible risk for violence, that person could be barred from buying guns and have any guns he owns taken away. Other advanced nations haven’t needed repeated massacres at schools, colleges, recruiting stations, churches and movie theaters to do something about gun violence. After 35 people were killed by a lone gunman wielding a military-style semiautomatic rifle at a popular Australian resort in 1996, Australia tightened every aspect of its gun laws. The USA now has 20 times the rate of homicides by firearm as Australia. Gun rights advocates can always point to some flaw in whatever sensible measure is debated or passed, or argue that it would not have stopped some particular gunman from some particular mass killing. But  just because you can't prevent every mass shooting doesn't mean you shouldn't try to stop any of them. A majority of Americans and a handful of states are on the right track. If more would follow, fewer communities would be added to the roster of sorrow that includes Columbine, Newtown, Aurora and now Roseburg.

199,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/TheInquisitrEntertainment/~3/rif5TUZHJus/,"With George H. W. Bush healing up after a taking a nasty fall during this summer, the former U.S. president is starting to feel active again. The former first lady, Barbara Bush, says she is ""thrilled"" by his progress and she is looking forward to his full recovery. In a related report by the Inquisitr, the Oregon shooting started a debate in Florida on whether college students should be armed with weapons in order to prevent such future tragedies. As the former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush gave his input about gun control laws, but some claimed he made a political gaffe when he referred to the mass shooting as ""stuff happens."" Unfortunately, stuff does happen as George H. W. Bush found out the hard way. Back in July, the former president fractured his C2 vertebra, which is the one located directly below the skull. The family has declined to provide details of how Bush fell down at Walker's Point. At the time, doctors said that it normally takes three to four months for such an injury to heal, but Bush has already been doing activities like visiting biker bars and going out on speedboats - albeit when the sea not too rough, and with his doctor's permission. Chief of staff Jean Becker believes the nation's oldest living president is making great progress, and with George H. W. Bush ""healing nicely,"" there is already talk of their future plans. Normally, the former president heads south for the winter after spending summer in Maine, so the family plans on heading to Texas this week. Becker also reports that former first lady Barbara Bush is pleased with the progress made so far. ''She is just thrilled that he has recovered the way he has. They're at the end of this road. It was a scary thing when it happened, and he's almost back to 100 percent,'' Becker said, according to the Associated Press. In addition to bikers and speed boats, George H. W. Bush also made a surprise visit to students at Philips Academy in Massachusetts, where Bush graduated from the prep school way back in 1942. Bush told students their school ""meant so much to me in my life."" The elder Bush attended a screening of a documentary on his life titled ""41on41,"" which features 41 speakers talking about the former U.S. president. Barbara Bush also attended the screen of the documentary since she was one of the 41 storytellers who speak in the film, along with family members, world leaders, sports figures and White House staffers.George H.W. Bush paid a surprise visit to Phillips Academy in Andover Wednesday http://t.co/h3trquOknP pic.twitter.com/hhzVJgb29V — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) October 1, 2015But they do not plan to travel all over the nation for the upcoming presidential campaign. Both Barbara and George H. W. Bush also say they do not plan to be heavily involved in Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign, although the Bushes will attend occasional events on their son's behalf. Although relatively active, the 91-year-old is not playing it risky. Bush continues to wear a neck brace in order to keep his neck injury immobilized. Doctors expect that Bush will be wearing the neck brace for another month, and it is highly unlikely he'll be repeating activities like the tandem parachute jump, which celebrated his 90th birthday in 2014. Doctors expect Bush to fully recover from the neck injury and they believe he did not suffer any nerve damage. With George H. W. Bush healing from this latest health scare, some may be concerned by his recent history of illnesses. Bush has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. The former U.S president was also hospitalized for about a week for shortness of breath last winter. He also spent Christmas of 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough.President George H.W.

200,http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Ayuero-If-we-don-t-push-back-now-on-campus-6547171.php,"A doctor and his patient are leaving the grounds of an infamous mental asylum. They have just visited the psychiatric ward that houses some of the worst cases of schizophrenia. The patient, visibly shocked, tells the doctor: ""I fear I won't be able to forget."" The doctor replies, ""Don't worry, you will forget."" Perplexed, the patient looks at him, and adds, ""I fear that, too; I fear I will forget."" The sentiments behind this scene mirror what many felt when Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB 11, also known as the ""campus carry"" law, earlier this year. The law, which becomes effective Aug. 1, 2016, for public colleges and universities (Aug. 1, 2017, for community colleges), provides that license holders may carry concealed handguns in university buildings and classrooms, extending the reach of a previous law that allowed concealed handguns on university grounds. Shouldn't we - faculty, staff and students at the University of Texas at Austin and other state colleges and universities - just forget and carry on, pretending this is not an issue, writing it off as another instance of ""how things are here (in Texas),"" becoming proverbial ostriches hiding our heads in the sand? I fear that, given the letter of the law and the limited exceptions that it allows, we will have to get used to guns inside our classrooms. I fear that the fact of sharing a classroom with students ""packing heat"" will stop shocking us as it now does. I fear I should not even be writing this as many gun-rights activists take reactions to the extreme when an opposing view is offered. And I fear our senses will become dulled (again) to horrific news like Thursday's, when a gunman opened fire on an Oregon community college, killing nine and wounding 20 before being killed himself. What would be the point if, after all, we comply and learn to conform? Because I believe that classrooms should be gun-free zones, this state of affairs saddens me. It also saddens me because it will irrevocably hurt a university that for the past two decades has worked hard to become a top institution of higher education. But even as UT President Greg Fenves works with us to develop a policy for implementation of campus carry, the new law not only saddens; it also presents a puzzle. Could I now, in good conscience, attempt to persuade a prospective graduate student or faculty (the ""top talent"" the university seeks to attract) to join us ostriches? I don't think I can. Another law passed by the Legislature this year (SB 273) might prevent me from hanging a sign stating ""no guns allowed""; the law might even forbid me from stating in my syllabus that I won't allow guns. To what extent that conflicts with ""free speech"" is another - but, at least for me, less important - legal matter. The moral dilemma is this: Does the law force me to lie? Shouldn't I tell prospective students and faculty that I am, in fact, profoundly afraid and that they should think twice about joining us? In my mind, as in those of many faculty members here and around the country, guns do not belong in classrooms. No legislation can force us to lie, can it? ""Don't tell,"" won't do it. So, if we are true to ourselves, the law will effectively prevent us from recruiting highly sought-after faculty and students. Alternatively, we could agree to ""refuse to forget"" about SB 11. We could manifest our opposition and, if necessary, refuse to teach in classrooms where guns are allowed. Should we hang signs stating that we don't allow guns - at the risk, as many a lawyer already warned us, of being fined? Shouldn't parents of UT students be writing letters to university administrators and legislators expressing their worries about the one (heavily) documented effect this bill will have - i.e., making campuses less-safe places? As a parent, I wouldn't want my own sons to attend this university. My students also express their hesitancy to tell their parents about this new development (""If I tell my mother, she will transfer me""). I've been around guns (big and small). I served in the military, and I do research on interpersonal violence. The evidence coming both from social science and from law enforcement shows that more guns (on campus, and elsewhere) does not increase public safety. We knew that before the campus-carry law passed, and we know it now. With campus carry, social, political or academic interactions will have the potential to explode in lethal violence. I can dwell on the arguments, I can show numbers, piles of evidence, case studies and experiments all confirming these facts. (I should add that Oregon, site of Thursday's mass shooting, is one of the seven states that now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses. No, packing does not prevent these things from happening.) But the campus-carry debate in the Legislature was not about logical, evidence-based, argumentation. Had it been about logic and evidence, the reasons persuasively put forward by UT Chancellor William H. McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, and Art Acevedo, chief of the Austin Police Department - both of whom know a thing or two about the subject and who argued against campus carry - would have been heeded. Lawmakers did not examine their arguments or anyone else's because the ""debate"" was not about reason but about interests - the legislators' interests and those of the organizations that support them. They, folks who neither teach nor do research, enacted a law that makes no sense for any the parties affected, and now we have to deal with the consequences. So, in this same spirit (not of reason-giving but of defending personal and organizational interests), let me express my hope that the university will make provisions to protect the interests of the students, staff and faculty who want to work, teach and learn in safe classrooms, gun-free environments where everybody can freely express his or her ideas without fear.

During the shooting at the Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, the 30-year-old Army veteran alerted others of the danger and then put himself at risk as he delayed the attacker, allowing time for others to escape. Mintz, a student at the community college, blocked a doorway when the shooter attempted to enter a classroom.

He suffered multiple gun shot wounds and broken legs. “You're not getting by me,” an Army veteran told gunman Chris Harper Mercer as he blocked the shooter from entering a... Social media is calling for a petition of awarding Mintz with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the government can grant a civilian, the Daily Dot reports. The petition reads: I am recommending Mr. Chris Mintz for the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his actions taken on 1 October 2015 during the shootings at the Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Mr. Mintz, a Veteran, continues to display the values of the United States military by his actions to alert others of the danger and then to endanger himself while delaying the attacker to allow time for others to escape. Mr. Mintz positively displayed the values of loyalty, duty, respect, honor, integrity, personal courage, and self-sacrifice to attempt to save as many of his fellow citizens as possible.

206,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/05/the_conservative_evasion_on_guns_128304.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama spoke some of the most important words of his tenure last week in response to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. ""This is something we should politicize,"" the president said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" This is something we should politicize. His statement was remarkable for violating the etiquette as to what a leader should say after another slaughter by a deranged gunman and the conventional wisdom about how politicians have to pretend that they are not engaged in politics. But Obama was forcing us to face reality. It's politics that has rendered our nation powerless in the face of butchery. There have been at least 142 school shootings since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, and Congress has done nothing. It's politics, as Obama said, that makes the U.S. ""the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,"" and politics that leads our learned legislators to pass laws barring the government from ""even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths."" Imagine: Congress has legislated mandatory ignorance. ""Politicize"" is the right word for another reason: We will not act until politicians start losing elections for opposing even the most modest gun safety measure. We will not act unless political parties that block action lose their majorities. Yes, I am talking about a Republican Party that has completely aligned itself with the interests of gun manufacturers and gun fanatics. I have criticized timid Democrats for doing the NRA's bidding, and they need to be challenged in primaries, even if this means putting some of the party's seats in Congress at risk. But it is the GOP that is institutionally tied to those who insist that gun rights supersede all of our other rights. And I cordially invite House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prove me wrong. Engaging in politics also means unmasking rationalizations that may sound plausible but are merely intended to justify pathetic pandering to the forces of evasion and inertia. The most debilitating dodge is to claim that nothing can be done, that nothing works. The gun lobby specializes in isolating a given incident and declaring sagely that this or that particular solution would not have prevented it. News flash: No law will ever solve every problem or create heaven on Earth. But it is a straight-out lie to assert that stronger gun laws make no difference. Here is the conclusion of a study released in August by National Journal: ""The states that impose the most restrictions on gun users also have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths, while states with fewer regulations typically have a much higher death rate from guns."" State laws could be even more effective if they were matched by federal laws that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands. Politicians who go on about American greatness should be ashamed of saying that the United States is the one and only nation that can't act effectively to solve a problem every other free and democratic country has contained. Conservatives might usefully listen to former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who has noted that he led ""a center-right coalition"" whose parties represented ""virtually every non-urban electoral district in the country."" In other words, his party is a lot like our Republicans. After a psychologically disturbed man killed 35 people in Tasmania, Howard championed state bans on the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons by Australia's states along with a federal ban on their importation. He also sponsored a gun buy-back scheme that got 700,000 guns -- the statistical equivalent of 40 million in the U.S. -- off the streets and destroyed. ""Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control,"" Howard wrote in The New York Times shortly after the Newtown killings. Politicizing this struggle means being unrelentingly candid in calling out an American conservative movement that proudly champions law and order but allows itself to be dominated by gun extremists who deride every gun measure that might make our country a little bit safer -- no matter how many mass killings we have. Conservatives all over the world are aghast at our nation's permissive attitude toward guns. Is a dangerous and harebrained absolutism about weaponry really the issue on which American conservatives want to practice exceptionalism?

Every Monday Teenagers plotting to open fire at a Northern California high school were arrested after fellow students overheard their plan. October 5, 2015 Four students were arrested after detectives uncovered a plot to carry out a shooting at their Northern California high school, authorities said. The plot – which officials described as “very detailed in nature and included names of would be victims, locations, and the methods in which the plan was to be carried out” – was foiled Wednesday after a group of students told a teacher they overheard three of the four talking about opening fire on Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif., about 120 miles east of San Francisco, The New York Times reported. The teacher alerted school administrators, who immediately removed the three from their classrooms and called the police, said Robert Griffith, the superintendent of the Summerville Union High School District. “Within two to three minutes, those administrators got up out of their seat, recognizing the severity of the information that they received, and were in the classroom pulling those students out,” Mr. Griffith said at a news conference Saturday. The fourth suspect was identified during the investigation, said Sheriff James W. Mele of Tuolumne County at the news conference. Detectives on Friday arrested all four students on charges of conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons and turned them over to the Tuolumne County Probation Department, The Modesto Bee reported. The suspects’ names were not released because they are juveniles, though officials said they were all male. While no weapons were recovered, Sheriff Mele said the students were in the process of obtaining some to carry out the attack. He did not identify a motive. “They were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible on the campus,” Mele told the Bee. “It is particularly unsettling when our most precious assets – which are our students, their teachers – are targets for violence.” The students were arrested just days after a mass shooting at a community college in rural Oregon that left 10 people dead, including the gunman. ""It is clear from past history, such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against fellow students and teachers on school grounds,"" said Eric Hovatter, Tuolumne County assistant district attorney, according to KCRA. ""While it is easy to say that can never happen in Tuolumne County, the public and local law enforcement must be vigilant, as they were here.""

209,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/115472319/0/phoenix/nation~John-Oliver-weighs-in-on-Oregon-shooting/,"John Oliver is speaking out about the Oregon shooting, and he wants to change the conversation. The Last Week Tonight host chose to dedicate the long-form section of his Sunday night show to mental health, which he calls ""the thing actors pretend to have in order to win Oscars."" He pointed out that mental illness is often blamed in the wake of mass shootings, like the one at Umpqua Community College on Friday. But Oliver argues that right after a mass shooting is in fact the worst time to talk about mental health, considering, ""the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people. ... So the fact that we tend to only discuss mental illness in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading."" ENTERTAIN THIS! John Oliver calls Donald Trump's presidential campaign 'performance art' But Oliver was happy to at least have an opportunity discuss the topic on Sunday, considering the fact that we rarely discuss it and ""in 2013 an estimated 43.8 million American adults dealt with a mental illness."" Oliver goes on to argue that the way we deal with mental illness is ""a mess and it always has been."" He says state and federal governments usually fail to prioritize mental health care, instead opting for strategies like ""Greyhound therapy,"" or putting people with mental illnesses on Greyhound buses to other states. He also says that one of the most likely places that people with mental illnesses end up is prison, which is ineffective in treating them, dangerous and expensive for the government. The host argues for a massive overhaul in the entire system so that we can deal with mental illness better as a country. And, he notes, since we're talking about it now, it's probably a good time to come up with a plan. Because, as he says, ""if we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, the least we owe them is a (expletive) plan.""

Every Monday In the Greater Philadelphia region, the FBI has warned college students to stay vigilant after 'threatened violence.' Could a posting on 4chan be responsible? Loading... October 5, 2015 After the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Philadelphia-area colleges are on high alert Monday because of “threatened violence,” according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). “Out of an abundance of caution, the FBI Philadelphia Field Office notified local colleges and universities of a social media posting which threatened violence at a Philadelphia-area college or university for Monday, October 5,” the agency said in a statement. “No specific college or university was identified in the posting. We encourage students, faculty, and employees at area colleges and universities to follow the guidance of their campus security officials. The FBI will continue to work with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to investigate threats of violence, and, as always, we ask the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.” Across the Greater Philadelphia region, colleges have disseminated alerts warning students to stay vigilant. While the FBI has not confirmed where they found the threat, some reports have linked to this posting on 4chan, an anonymous imageboard site. The post says on Monday at 1 p.m. Central Time, “a fellow robot will take up arms against a university near Philadelphia. His cries will be heard, his victims will cower in fear, and the strength of the Union will decay a little more. If you are in that area, you are encouraged to stay at home and watch the news as the chaos unfolds. His sacrifice will echo throughout the nation.” On Thursday, nine people were killed and nine more were injured after a classmate opened fire in his writing class at the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Ore. Federal law enforcement also investigated a 4chan thread in relation to the massacre, according to the New York Times. The day before that rampage, local detectives thwarted a potential massacre at a high school near Yosemite National Park. Three students were arrested and a fourth was detained for plotting to target specific classmates and teachers. But some are questioning the legitimacy of the Philadelphia threat. 4chan is known as a bastion of cyber-pranksters, and the site’s users have a long history of wreaking havoc – sometimes in the name of vigilantism. Its users are considered highly influential and tech-savvy, leading some to claim it “controls the Internet.” 4chan is responsible for the celebrity nude photo leak scandal, the self-harm hashtag #cuttingforBieber, and gaming the Time 100 poll, putting the site's founder, Christopher ""moot"" Poole, in the top spot. Recently, the personal contact information for Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who raised the price of a drug by 5,000 percent and became “the most hated man in America,” was posted on 4chan. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. And The Washington post called 4chan users’ attempts to convince West Africans that Ebola doctors were worshipping the disease a “cross between a prank, a witless joke and a truly vile strain of racism.” The site is also credited with spawing the “hacktivist” group Anonymous, which has targeted government agencies and corporations in the name of justice.

212,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/john-hanlin-sandy-hook-conspiracy,"The pro-gun sheriff in charge of investigating a mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College said Friday that he doesn’t subscribe to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting “truther” movement, despite having posted a video raising questions about the tragedy to his Facebook page. “I know what you’re referring to, but that’s not a conspiracy theory that I have,” Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told CNN late Friday when asked about the video. Hanlin posted a link in January 2013 to a YouTube video called “The Sandy Hook Shooting – Fully Exposed,” which summarized conspiracy theories surrounding the shooting and quickly went viral.  Hanlin posted the link about a month after the massacre of elementary school children in Newtown, Connecticut. “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore…” Hanlin wrote. “Watch, listen, and keep an open mind.” The Facebook post was removed from public view Friday afternoon after news outlets, including TPM, reported on it. Two days after posting the video, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden stating that he did not believe stricter gun control measures would prevent potential mass shootings. That letter earned him praise from a fringe “constitutional sheriffs” organization.

Given that politicians like Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Donald Trump have pegged this shooting epidemic to a broken mental health system, Oliver obliges and examines the issue in depth. But there’s a catch: “The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health,” he argues. “Because, for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people.” The host cites a February 2015 report by the American Journal of Public Health, which states that “fewer than 5 percent of the 120,000 gun-related killings … were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.” Related

						25 Best 'Friends' Episodes “In fact, mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators,” he continues. “So the fact we tend to only discuss mental health in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading.” Oliver reports that, “in 2013, an estimated 43.8 million American adults dealt with a mental illness.” And as some presidential hopefuls have observed, our system for helping these people is shattered. In 2009, The Associated Press reported that “nearly 125,000 young and middle-aged adults with serious mental illness lived in U.S. nursing homes” the previous year. Some states have been involved in “Greyhound therapy,” in which patients are discharged too soon and supplied with a one-way bus ticket to another city. According to another depressing report, there are 10 times more people in jail than in state-funded psychiatric centers. “That is terrible,” Oliver says. “Finding out jails are our largest provider of mentally health treatment is like finding out Lil Wayne lyrics are our greatest source of sexual education.” Some police departments have implemented “crisis intervention programs” intended to help direct those with mental health issues into treatment rather than prison. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of police agencies have utilized them. “Our whole system needs a massive overhaul,” Oliver says. But that won’t be easy because of the “clusterfuck” of American agencies devoted to mental health. “We, as a society, have to figure out how to fund [these programs],” he says. “Not just because it makes fiscal sense but because it would save lives. And if I remember rightly, there are some politicians who claim to be pretty motivated to address this problem … If we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control then the very least we owe them is a fucking plan.” In This Article:

(Ed Murray | The Star-Ledger) Colleges and universities in South Jersey are stepping up police patrols and warning students to stay alert after federal officials notified them of a possible threat against a college near Philadelphia Monday. An anonymous threat was made on an internet site warning someone will ""take up arms against a university near Philadelphia"" at 2 p.m. Monday. The threat was made on 4chan, the same website where a similar warning was posted about violence at an unnamed northwest school in the days before the mass shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College last week. RELATED: Several local colleges in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware said they were notified about the threat by the FBI Sunday. None of the colleges have announced classes are canceled, but several schools alerted students and gave them the option of staying home. What is the threat? The post on 4chan reads: ""On October 5, 2015 at 1:00 PM CT, a fellow robot will take up arms against a university near Philadelphia. His cries will be heard, his victims will cower in fear, and the strength of the Union will decay a little more. If you are in that area, you are encouraged to stay at home and watch the news as the chaos unfolds. His sacrifice will echo throughout the nation."" Who made the threat? The threat was posted by an anonymous user on 4chan, a web bulletin board known for jokes about violence and hoaxes. However, a  similar threat was posted by another user last week referencing violence in the northwest, shortly before the shooting at the community college in Oregon. The threat against the Philadelphia area colleges appears to refer to the Oregon shooter. ""The first of our kind has struck hear into the hearts of America. His cries have been heard, even by the President,"" the post said. Was any college named? No, the threat does not name any specific college or location. Federal authorities have notified colleges and universities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The area is home to dozens of county colleges, four-year colleges, for-profit colleges and technical schools. Are colleges taking this seriously? No colleges have announced they are canceling classes. But several New Jersey schools issued alerts to students. In a notice to Rutgers-Camden students, Chancellor Phoebe Haddon told students to report anything suspicious. She also posted links to Rutgers' plan if an ""active shooter"" in spotted on campus. ""In an abundance of caution, the Rutgers University Police Department is working closely with county, state, and federal agencies, as well as police and security units at other area colleges and universities, to monitor and assess the situation.  On-campus security patrols will be increased throughout the day,"" Haddon said in her message. Can students stay home? At least one university, Rowan University, told students they were permitted to stay home or leave campus if they felt unsafe. ""Our attendance policy allows students to not attend class when they have a reasonable concern for their safety,"" Rowan officials said in a tweet to students.

225,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-oregon-president-obama-dawn-turner-20151005-column.html,"Something struck me last week as President Barack Obama stood in the White House's press briefing room addressing the nation after the mass shooting in Oregon. I wondered what would happen if the president took to the airwaves every Monday after Chicago's weekend death toll. What if he delivered remarks similar to those he gave in response to the nine people killed at Umpqua Community College? ""So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate,"" he said, ""I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up."" Save these lives and let these people grow up. Yup, I'm happy to think about it. But whose lives was the president asking America to consider and save? Everybody affected by gun violence or just a few folks? Obama lamented how powerless he is without the help of Congress to strengthen gun laws and how ""routine"" mass shootings have become in this country. His speech was impassioned, necessary to help the country grieve, and yet, woefully predictable. It's clear why the president doesn't respond this way to mass shootings such as those perpetrated by gangbangers. It's clear why we all view urban killings as an afterthought, a footnote, the same old same old. What's happening in our cities — such as the uptick this year in murders in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, New Orleans and Baltimore — isn't considered aberrant or extraordinary. No one wants to admit this, but what's worse is that we consider it to be, well, normal. We expect mass shootings in tough neighborhoods in the city. We don't expect them in small towns such as those in Oregon and Connecticut and Colorado. But we've long felt this way. The spray of bullets seems to fit in with the crime and decay in our poor city neighborhoods. Not so much with our idyllic and idealized middle-class communities and small towns. Perhaps our great challenge, even beyond gun control, is to stop viewing street violence as routine and see these young black and brown men who stockpile guns and shoot up their communities as being as mentally deranged and disconnected as their white counterparts who shoot up theirs. One reason it's so difficult to make this connection is that we tend to see young black men as inherently violent and irredeemable. It's hard to acknowledge their physical and mental health; substance abuse problems; their family relationships, or lack thereof; their high incarceration rates and low academic achievement as playing a role in their creation stories. Sean Joe, a professor of social work at Washington University, said the disconnected male between the ages of 15 to about 29 is a challenge no matter his race. Joe began studying self-destructive tendencies after his younger brother, who was a drug dealer, was murdered. ""Whether it's social isolation or structural isolation — such as being disconnected from employment opportunities, training, or family and friends — there's an increased risk for engaging in … violence,"" Joe told me. That violence can be directed toward others or themselves. Joe said a lot of young black men feel angry and alone. They feel that no one cares about them, and they wind up engaging in the world in a way that's corrosive. The president is right to be upset that we're viewing Oregon-like mass shootings as routine. But we're only treating them the same way we've long treated mass shootings in tough neighborhoods. We've come a long way since 1999 when Columbine happened. The massacre at that high school was so extraordinary that it seared itself onto our consciousness, along with the names of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. When 7-year-old Dantrell Davis was killed in 1985, caught in gang crossfire while walking to his Chicago school, that story was so outrageous that it made national news. Now, pop quiz: Can you name the gunmen who shot up the movie theaters in Aurora, Colo., and Lafayette, La.? No?

McAfee, writing in a column for the International Business Times, stated that an EMP (eletromagnetic propulsion) attack on the U.S. should be a far bigger concern. In the wake of last week's tragic mass shooting in Oregon, President Obama said in his speech on October 2, ""Here's what you need to do: You have to make sure that anybody that you are voting for is on the right side of this issue."" That ""issue"" being gun control, the President went on to say that even if a candidate is ""great on other stuff, you've got to vote against them,"" if they're not for gun control. According to John McAfee, who recently announced himself a candidate in the 2016 presidential race, President Obama's sole focus on gun control is misguided but it did raise the question for McAfee of whether or not there is any other single topic that merits such a ""single issue status.""""My first thought upon hearing Obama's proclamation was that I was in the middle of an acid flashback and I had no benzodiazepines to mediate the trip. My second thought was: what possible single issue, in this complex society of ours, would merit a 'single issue' status?""Among the many important threats facing Americans, John McAfee cites one that he believes should top the list as a primary concern of all Americans and their elected leaders, that being cyber attacks which would be kicked off by an electromagnetic EMP attack. This would leave the infrastructure of the United States crippled indefinitely, according to McAfee, and lead to the deaths of a significant portion of the U.S. population.""Experts agree that an all out cyber attack, beginning with an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack on our electronic infrastructure, would wipe out 90% of the human population of this country within two years of the attack. That means the death of 270 million people within 24 months after the attack.""With this sobering image of the United States and its citizenry all but destroyed by an electromagnetic (EMP) attack, John McAfee also points out that the U.S. Government isn't ready to deal with an EMP attack. ""Our leaders are nearly all ill prepared for this near certain, not-too-distant (EMP attack) event,"" writes John McAfee. ""If I were forced to choose a single issue, this would obviously be the issue."" Cyber Security mogul and presidential candidate, John McAfee, says an EMP attack is the top threat facing Americans that he would address, not gun control. The Daily Mail reports that John McAfee was at first baffled by President Obama's assertion that gun control should be the top concern of all Americans, but again, it also raised new questions for McAfee.""Frantically searching again for my benzodiazepines, and certain that rabid squirrels would imminently emerge from my wristwatch and form a tribunal accusing me of crimes against humanity, a saving thought flashed into my mind: What if the president is right? Could this simplification be the salvation of this long-suffering nation?""Rather than gun control, the saving thought that flashed through John McAfee's mind was a possible connection between the rise of antidepressant drug use in 1980s America and the mass shootings that have since followed, John McAfee positioned that antidepressants may be at the core of the gun control controversy and the related tragic shootings.""In the 1980s we saw the first wide scale use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepressants), such as Prozac, Paxil and others. Hundreds of studies have shown that these antidepressants have side effects that include violent thoughts. A few minutes of research will tell us that 8% of the US population is taking antidepressants, yet a known 30% of all mass murderers since 1980 were taking antidepressants, and it is highly suspected that the real number approaches 90% – a statistical anomaly of egregious proportions.""In the end, John McAfee admits that President Obama may have discovered the ""Holy Grail of politics"" by telling people to vote only for those candidates that support gun control, making this single concern -- among all the other dire and important matters -- the one that will ""direct the entire future of our society."" If we are going to let just one issue dictate who should be elected, asks McAfee, shouldn't it be the issue that addresses the potential deaths of most of America's citizens? I.e EMP attacks? ""... surely weighing the possible deaths of 90% of our citizens due to cyber warfare against gun violence which causes fewer deaths per year than traffic accidents, seems that possibly our president is suffering an acid flashback rather than myself,"" concludes McAfee. But, are EMP - electromagnetic propulsion - attacks really an immediate threat that could send the U.S. and its people into a death spiral? In their May issue, VICE interviewed a military and global intelligence expert about the dangers of EMP attacks, and while the expert agreed that EMP attacks were technically possible, they'd also be prohibitively expensive and most likely would only be an added result of nuclear strikes. ""It's not that EMPs are not a threat,"" the expert told VICE, ""It's just that—although the effect would be massive—currently they're not really a risk apart from nuclear strikes, so highlighting them as the greatest threat there is might not be entirely realistic."" A nuclear attack would be the most likely cause of EMP-related damage to U.S. infrastructure, according to a military and global intelligence expert interviewed by VICE. At the same time, John McAfee is a recognized expert in several areas himself, so recognizing the dangers of an EMP attack, particularly if it would kill 90% of Americans in the two years that followed, might be a problem politicians should consider along with gun control.

237,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/115531357/0/phoenix/nation~Al-Roker-sorry-for-selfie-amid-SC-flooding/,"NBC weather wonk Al Roker apologized Monday for covering the historic flooding in South Carolina by tweeting a selfie with his crew, all grinning beside a disabled car trapped in a washed-out road. The tweeted picture, now deleted, showed Roker and his two-person camera crew, clad in rain gear, smiling widely as they prepared to ""report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina"" for NBC's Nightly News. Behind them, a small green-yellow car lay on its side in a shallow hole left by the collapse of the side of a road. Roker later said the woman who was driving that car got out safely.  But the explanation came too late; outraged tweets soon appeared: This selfie disgusts me. SC is not smiling over all they have lost @TODAYshow @alroker #SCStrong #PrayForColumbia pic.twitter.com/brFfd2LONR Let's hope this is the last disaster selfie ever @alroker 
No one else is smiling. 
http://t.co/1pI90BVoJv @alroker @NBCNightlyNews Al, your photo is extremely poor taste. We are devastated and you're smiling. Shame on you pic.twitter.com/katHhTKvxo Roker realized his mistake immediately, deleted the tweet and issuing apologetic new tweets. Absolutely correct. I apologize for being insensitive. The woman in that car got out without injury. We Should not have been in the picture We came down to report and I offended those who lost so much. I am sorry What does this mean? Maybe nothing. Veteran broadcasters like Roker know better than to smile on camera while reporting tragedies, such as a mass shooting for instance. But maybe they forget the rules, and good manners, when goofing off with silly selfies on social media. Roker, by the way, has gotten into trouble with some of his tweets in the past. In 2014, he apologized for tweeting a ""low-blow"" slam at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for not closing the schools before a major snow storm, forecasting he'd be a ""one-term"" mayor. It didn't help that he misspelled the mayor's name. I knew this am @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCSchools would close schools. Talk about a bad prediction. Long range DiBlasio forecast: 1 term ""I will say, the one tweet I do regret in the heat — I'm very passionate about the weather,"" he said later on Today. ""I made a prediction that there would be only one term of his administration. I apologize for that. That was … a little below the line.""

238,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/115549219/0/phoenix/nation~Rieder-Should-the-media-ID-mass-killers/,"It is such a counterintuitive question for a journalist to ask. The job of the journalist is to gather and disseminate information, a vital role in a democracy. The bigger the story, the more important the mission. So the very idea that the news media should not identify mass murderers and should not report exhaustively about them goes totally against the grain. But it is one that appears to be gaining momentum, particularly as information emerges suggesting that publicity about mass killers inspires others to follow their lead. The gunman who last week killed eight of his classmates and wounded nine others at an Oregon community college is believed to have written a blog post expressing his admiration for all the publicity attracted by the former TV journalist who murdered two ex-colleagues in Roanoke in August.  ""On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are,"" the post said. THE NEWS-PRESS Official: Oregon gunman left angry note glorifying mass killers The Roanoke murderer, in turn, wrote to ABC News that he had been inspired to shoot the journalists — on live TV, no less — by the gunman who killed nine worshipers in Charleston in June.  He also expressed approval of previous mass murders at Virginia Tech in 2007 and at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. USA TODAY 'Disturbed' Va. gunman angered by Charleston shootings USA TODAY A reeling Charleston tries to make sense of the senseless Significantly, a study by Arizona State University researchers published in July concluded that mass killings inspire more mass killings.  ""[W]e ... find significant evidence of contagion in mass killings and school shootings,"" they wrote. They added, ""We find significant evidence that mass killings involving firearms are incented by similar events in the immediate past."" The drive for restraint in covering these horrific episodes has been fueled by Caren and Tom Teves, whose son Alex was gunned down in the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. And there are indications their #NoNotoriety crusade is bearing fruit. USA TODAY Voices: Should media withhold names of mass murderers? Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Anderson Cooper of CNN and Denver anchorman Kyle Clark are declining to mention the name of the Oregon assassin. Douglas County, Ore., sheriff John Hanlin proclaimed, ""I will not name the shooter,"" and urged the media not to do so, either. As she surveys the media world, Caren Teves sees much less of an in-your-face approach to coverage of the latest outbreak of mass mayhem compared with rampages of the past. ""I'm feeling slightly victorious,"" she told CNN. So if coverage of carnage leads to more carnage, is it time for a news blackout? Not at all. There are important reasons why these hideous episodes need to be covered, and why the perpetrators need to be named. First of all, it's reality, and you can't pretend it didn't happen. It's important to know who carried out the dastardly deed. By examining the person's background, news organizations can spotlight motivation and perhaps uncover missed opportunities that might have prevented the bloodshed. Reporting can reveal patterns that are important to public-policy debates over gun laws, mental illness and other issues. But that doesn't mean wallowing. #NoNotoriety is making important points. While coverage — and, yes, identifying the culprit — are necessary, it should be coverage with care. It's important not to seem to be glorifying the killer. Too often the criminal gets far more attention than the victims. Once the name of the killer is out there, it doesn't have to be repeated over and over again. There's no need to showcase huge images of murderers. And no reason to publish their entire ""manifestos,"" which is often exactly what they want. The challenge is toughest for cable news, which has 24 hours to fill each day and by nature focuses heavily, if not obsessively, on the huge story of the moment. Even Tom Teves says he has no problem with the killer being ID'd at some point. Just don't do it over and over and over again. I asked Brent Jones, USA TODAY's standards editor, for his take on how to balance the objectives of informing the public and refusing to play into the hands of psychopaths. ""I think we have a journalistic mandate to explore the background, including mind-set, of a mass murderer in our quest for truth, specifically in seeking answers that might lead to understanding why a heinous crime was committed,"" he replied. ""Such insight can also lead to future safety measures. While we may be able to point to examples where news coverage likely contributed to copycat crimes, I don’t think it would be responsible for us to conclude ahead of the reporting process that every mass murderer’s motive was glory and fame."" But he thinks it's important to tread lightly: ""Events under such circumstances have shaped an important national discussion about finding a balance between sharing loads of click-bait information, some of which may prove harmful to the public, vs. sharing information strictly in the interest of the public’s need to know."" That's a discussion that needs to continue. Mass murders have become so shockingly commonplace in the U.S. that it's not shocking at all when they occur. And so news outlets, tragically, may well be put to the test again soon. Mass murders need to be covered, but in a way that sheds light rather than seems to turn deranged killers into notorious anti-heroes.",2015-10-05 16:47:15,Rieder: Should the media ID mass killers?,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Loading... October 5, 2015 Students were welcomed back on Monday by grief counselors and comfort dogs to the small Oregon community college shattered by a shooting rampage that left 10 people dead, though classes were to remain canceled through the week. The campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, about 180 miles (300 km) south of Portland, was reopened to registered students and staff four days after the massacre, allowing them to retrieve vehicles and other belongings left behind in Thursday's pandemonium. The reopening also was aimed at helping restore a sense of normalcy on campus before classes and other activities at the college of some 3,000 full-time students were due to resume next Monday, school officials said. While the bucolic college, situated on a bend in the North Umpqua River, appeared peaceful as staff and students milled about, an atmosphere of trepidation prevailed among some of those returning on Monday. ""The anxiety of walking back on campus is very real,"" student Jared Norman said in a text message to Reuters, adding that his campus visit ""begins the road to recovery."" He and other students met with the college student-life director on Sunday night in preparation for their return. Students were greeted by teams of volunteers with six golden retrievers from the national K-9 Comfort Dogs network run by Lutheran Church Charities. The group has worked at the scenes of various recent tragedies, including the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot to death by a gunman in December 2012, said Richard Martin, a volunteer from Northbrook, Illinois. The college bookstore also was reopened, and an outdoor amphitheater on campus was set up with tables adorned with bouquets of flowers flanked by wreaths on stands, one with the message: ""We Will Always Remember."" Law enforcement was not readily visible in the center of campus, but a mobile command post of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department remained set up in the parking lot. A permanent billboard along the main road leading onto campus greeted returning faculty with the message: ""Welcome back staff"" in black capital letters. The sunny, quiet tranquility stood in stark contrast to the fear that gripped the campus last Thursday in the midst of the deadliest U.S. mass shooting in two years and the bloodiest in Oregon's modern history. A gunman, later identified as Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, stormed into his writing class in Snyder Hall, shot the professor at point-blank range and began picking off cowering classmates one at a time as he questioned them their religion, according to survivors' accounts. The assailant ultimately died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging shots with police officers who arrived on the scene to confront him. Besides the English professor and eight students slain in the rampage, nine other people were wounded, three of them critically. Parents of two survivors revealed over the weekend that the gunman had handed an envelope to one of the male students in the class, whose life the suspect deliberately spared. CNN reported on Sunday that the envelope contained a computer flash drive that the surviving student turned over to authorities immediately afterward. Authorities said Harper-Mercer, who moved from the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, California, to Oregon with his mother in 2013, carried six guns, five magazines of bullets and body armor with him to campus the day of the killings. Another eight firearms and a stockpile of ammo were recovered from the apartment he and his mother shared a short distance from the college, officials said. Authorities have revealed little of what they may know about Harper-Mercer's motives. The FBI and local sheriff have declined to comment on media reports that he left behind racist writings. People who knew him casually have described Harper-Mercer as a withdrawn, socially awkward loner. After a brief, failed stint in the U.S. Army that ended with an administrative discharge, he graduated from a nonprofit school in Torrance that catered to students with learning and emotional disabilities. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. He was by all accounts preoccupied with guns, a passion he was reported to have shared with his mother, who spent time with her son at target ranges. The head of a private firearms academy in Torrance has said Harper-Mercer sought to register for classes there in 2012 or 2013 but was turned away because he was found to be ""weird"" and overly eager for high-level weapons training at his age.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

Special Correspondent Not yet halfway to her first birthday, Aavielle Nevaeh Wakefield was too young to be the victim of a school shooting. But on the same day as the massacre at Umpqua Community College, little Aavielle proved that no age is too young to be fatally wounded by a stray bullet in America. “Somebody was shooting at our car as we came through a street,” reported a caller to 911 in Cleveland. “And they shot the baby. The baby dead!” “How old is the child?” the dispatcher asked. “The baby is only 5 months old,” the caller said. “Five months old… Male or female?” the dispatcher asked. “Beg your pardon?” “Male or female? Is it a boy or girl?” “Female! Female!” “Is she awake?” “No!” “Is she breathing?” “No!” Screaming could be heard in the background. “That’s her mother holding her,” the caller explained. Moments before, the mother had been driving the family car back from grocery shopping when gunfire erupted. A bullet had torn through one of the car’s doors and the baby seat, and now Iesha Wakefield was clutching her bleeding infant daughter to her. The caller was apparently the grandmother. “What part of her body was she shot?” the dispatcher asked. “We don’t know,” the caller answered. “Her mother won’t let her loose.” “OK. Get a clean, dry cloth or towel. You need put it on the wound, apply firm and steady pressure and don’t lift it up to look.” The screaming continued. Aavielle’s 8-year-old sister had also been in the car, and she was hearing and seeing it all. “Ma’am, listen to me,” the dispatcher continued. “We have to give the baby mouth-to-mouth, OK? You need to get her flat on her back…” The screaming heightened in pitch and desperation as the caller tried to get Aavielle from her mother. “Ma’am, do you have the baby?… OK, ma’am, listen, do you have the baby?” The caller apparently succeeded. “She was shot right under her right arm,” the caller reported. “There’s a hole in her shirt.” “Get the baby flat on her back, nothing underneath her. We need to start mouth-to-mouth.” “Blood is coming out of her nose.” “We need to start mouth-to-mouth. Clean out her mouth. Ma’am? Hello?” “I’m here. I’m here. I’m trying to do what you say.” “With her head tilted straight back, you need to completely cover her nose and mouth with your mouth. Blow two puffs of air into the lungs, one second each, just enough to make her chest rise with each breath. Do that now.” “OK, that’s what I’m trying to do. My mouth over her mouth and nose. What do I do then?” “Blow two puffs of air one second each. Do you feel the air going in and out? Do you see the chest rising when you do it? Ma’am?” Paramedics arrived. An ambulance rushed Aavielle to Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital. But the bullet had done what bullets are designed to do, just as the bullets had in the mass shooting in Oregon that had the country stunned and President Obama outraged. In Cleveland, Police Chief Calvin Williams was left in tears by little Aavielle’s death. “Enough is enough,” Williams said at a press conference. “When are we going to stop counting babies killed out there?” But the rest of the country would not likely have paid much attention even if we had not been focused on the killing of nine at Umpqua. Two other children, ages 3 and 5, had been killed in Cleveland during the previous month and the nation had not even shrugged. No wonder a monster such as the gunman in Oregon felt he needed to kill as many people as possible to get the attention he craved. And there is nothing new about this indifference when even young children are shot to death one or two at a time. No uproar had ensued after a study by the Children’s Defense Fund found that in 2007 more preschoolers than police officers were shot to death. Number of preschoolers killed by guns: 87 Number of police officers killed by guns: 68 Among the school-age kids this year was 9-year-old Jamyla Bolden. She was killed in August by a stray round as she sat doing her homework on her mother’s bed in Ferguson, a block from where protests had erupted after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a cop. No demonstrations, no national debate followed Jamyla’s death. The kiddie carnage continued. This past September, a 2-year-old was shot in the face in Memphis and a 5-year-old was killed by a stray round in Kansas City, as was a 7-year-old at a birthday party in Charlotte. A 10-year-old was shot in Milwaukee, where 11 children were shot last year. And now we have a dead 5-month-old. “A baby baby?” the 911 dispatcher asked when first told. “A baby,” the caller confirmed. As of Monday afternoon, the police reported no arrests in the shooting despite having offered a $25,000 reward for information. The funeral for Aavielle Nevaeh Wakefield will be held on Thursday morning at Mount Zion Church of Oakwood Village. Obama is not expected to attend. Aavielle’s family notes that her middle name is “Heaven” spelled backward. She no doubt would have delighted in such word magic had she lived to learn her ABCs. She leaves us a country that barely seemed to notice when yet another child was shot to death before she was old enough to die in a school shooting.",2015-10-06 01:13:00,Died Before She Could Be Shot in School,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
242,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/NKC2NW3s1Cs/," John Oliver, host of Last Week Tonight, took a different approach to discussing the Oregon shooting. Oliver noted that often mass shootings are followed by a mental health discussion, specifically, speculation as to whether or not the shooter was or is mentally ill. According to John, as quoted by USA Today, the aftermath of tragedies like Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon is probably the worst time to hold such discussions. ""The vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent, and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people...So the fact that we tend to only discuss mental illness in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading."" John Oliver notes that Americans are extremely uncomfortable discussing mental illness, despite the fact that an ""estimated 43.8 million American adults"" are coping with mental health issues. He said that unfortunately, this topic is most likely to be discussed after a shooting like the one in Oregon, and often as a red herring: The topic that should be discussed at such times is gun control. Said Oliver, ""It seems there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health."" He particularly noted that Republican candidates were the ones pushing the blame for the Oregon shooting and other mass shootings on mental illness while actively denying the importance of gun control in the United States. Their arguments are countered by a rather powerful observation by John. ""The vast majority of mentally ill people are nonviolent, and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people. ""Mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators."" Considering the fact that such persons are more likely to be victims of shootings than perpetrators, it's rather distasteful that Americans continue to treat those with mental health issues as ""ticking time bombs"" and inevitable dangers to society. It's also important to note that members of the public are quick to speculate about the mental state of someone behind a shooting, but there's no actual proof that such persons are mentally ill.  John Oliver Slams GOP for Blaming Mass Shootings on Mentally-Ill, Avoiding Gun Control Talk http://t.co/jkjCPu8Dnb pic.twitter.com/3HCuBWsJHw — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) October 5, 2015 John Oliver said that since the public wanted to discuss mental health issues in the wake of the Oregon shooting, then he would do so while addressing the rather stark picture of mental health services today. According to John, severe mental illness affects nearly 10 million Americans, but the current treatment system is ""ineffective, expensive, and dangerous."" Much of the burden for these services are provided by ill-equipped nursing homes, prisons, and apparently ""Greyhound buses."" Tragically, in America, mental health is something more commonly known, as John Oliver quipped, as ""a great way to win an Oscar."" The public admires someone who pretends to be insane but has no time or compassion to push for real solutions. Oddly enough, not even in the wake of mass shootings. Like gun control, apparently this important topic is something to be kicked around but otherwise largely ignored. John Oliver said of this behavior that ""if we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a plan.""  John Oliver breaks down America's problem with gun violence and mental illness http://t.co/J3vsc5I0rq pic.twitter.com/b4E0evj9ql — BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) October 5, 2015 It will be interesting to see if the politicians that John Oliver referred to, including Donald Trump and Ben Carson, eventually lay down a solid plan for coping with mental health. Democratic candidates for president have directly attacked the issue of gun control in the wake of the Oregon shooting. Perhaps they too can offer plans to aid in advancing America's mental health system. What do you think of what John Oliver had to say about mental health discussions following the Oregon shooting? Why do you think Americans are uncomfortable talking about mental illness (except for after mass shootings)? Please share your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below!

Roker has since apologized for the insensitive selfie after a firestorm of anger erupted on Twitter. Al has also deleted the tweet and noted that the woman in the stranded car is okay, Page Six reported. Al Roker tweeted the ""flood selfie"" with NBC colleagues, all three wearing slickers and grinning before the grim scene, including a collapsed highway. Al's photo came with this message, ""My crew and I getting ready to report on East Coast flooding from S. Carolina on @NBCNightlyNews with Kate Snow.""After people in the Twitter-sphere came down hard on Al Roker for looking jubilant during a historic flood, which as of Tuesday has killed 13 people, he issued the following apology. ""Absolutely correct. I apologize for being insensitive. The woman in that car got out without injury. We should not have been in the picture.

One woman didn't agree. @alroker The three of you are totally disgusting..your selfie turned my stomach.. You were SMILING. That is what was shocking. The topic was not joyful. @alroker ""It's def not ppl being too touchy. Grinning in front of a destroyed road while in an area where ppl are losing lives and homes is incredibly inappropriate. If u can't understand why then u are extremely out of touch,"" she tweeted. As USA Today noted, newscasters know better than to grin broadly while reporting serious news -- a mass shooting, for instance -- but apparently this common sense etiquette hasn't yet translated into the modern-day habit of taking selfies to mark every occasion. And Al Roker has rubbed people the wrong way on social media before. In 2014, he criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (while spelling his name wrong) for not closing schools before a snow storm, predicting that he'd be a one-term mayor. Roker apologized for that comment, too.The situation in South Carolina has only worsened since Al Roker's ill-advised selfie. Flood waters have killed 13 people as of Tuesday, dozens of dams and bridges have been destroyed, caskets have washed away, apartments looted, and billions of dollars in damage caused -- and the rivers haven't even crested yet. All told, two feet of rain has fallen. Columbia resident James Shirer told CBS News he's never seen anything like this historic flood. ""It's been one of the worst things we've seen in the entire time that I've lived here. You've got people who are displaced from their homes, people whose businesses are wrecked.

""Even though we lost everything and stuff got stolen, we can rebuild together and help each other and be each other's backbones and carry each other through this time because we need each other."" In perhaps the most dramatic and heartbreaking story to come out of the flood, Pastor Wayne Reeves was giving an interview when two caskets popped out of the ground and started to be carried away by the waters -- a husband and wife.

244,https://www.nationalreview.com/murphy-helping-families-in-mental-health-crisis-act-good-legislation,"Follow Us National Review Bernie Sanders: ‘I Don’t Know’ If Democrats Will Try to Include a Public Option in $3.5 Trillion Bill The Biden Ministry of Truth Religious Liberty, Exceptions, and Targeting Why It’s Important to Pass State Critical Race Theory Bills Now Beto O’Rourke: This Voting Reform Bill Could Mean the End of Democracy in Texas In the wake of yet another tragic mass shooting, gun controllers have been quick to proffer a catalogue of measures, none of which would have stopped last week’s shooting at Umpqua Community College — nor the murders in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, nor those in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., in 2012. Yet many of those same gun controllers reject as a distraction mental-health-care reforms that could help prevent mass shootings committed by psychotics — and also assist the several million persons whose everyday lives are burdened by schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other serious mental illnesses. One such proposal is available to Congress right now: Republican representative Tim Murphy’s Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (HR 2646). Representative Murphy, a Pennsylvania psychologist, has garnered broad, bipartisan support for his bill, which would do much to overhaul our ineffective, oft-corrupt mental-health bureaucracy. The federal government spends $130 billion annually on mental health — to little effect. This is primarily because the federal government’s mental-health policy is largely driven by the failed Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The most important part of Murphy’s bill is to eliminate SAMHSA and replace it with an assistant secretary for Mental Health, charged with shifting federal dollars away from useless, often duplicative programs and those that focus on “behavioral wellness” and mild forms of mental illness and toward those that focus on the most seriously ill. One such program is assisted outpatient treatment, which has proven effective in reducing rates of violence, drug and alcohol abuse, incarceration, and repeated hospitalization among the seriously mentally ill. By reducing the use of expensive hospitalization and incarceration, these programs will provide significant savings to the state and federal criminal-justice and health-care systems, while providing families a way to admit dangerously ill kin into psychiatric care without abrogating patients’ legal protections. EDITORIAL: Congress Is Waking Up on Mental Health Murphy’s bill will also modestly modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act so that family members of people with serious mental illness can finally be involved in the care of their loved ones. The astonishing reach of medical privacy laws — many of which were developed to serve the interests of insurance, rather than health-care providers — will be pruned back to allow family members to know what medications their loved ones have been prescribed, when they are scheduled to see their doctors, and other crucial information when it is needed to protect health, safety, and welfare. The bill upholds HIPAA’s privacy protections — for example, notes from psychotherapy will not be available — while recognizing that patients whose families are involved in treatment normally have better long-term outcomes, and that current privacy strictures put families in untenable, even dangerous situations. Also, giving families access to necessary patient information is another way of helping to temper the influence of SAMHSA-promoted “patient advocates,” whose activities nowadays often hamper, rather than promote, access to effective treatment for the most seriously ill. The Murphy bill will amend the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Program, passed by Congress in 1986, to restore it to its original intent: protecting patients from abuse and neglect. #share#And the bill will do much more, including increasing access to tele-psychiatry for mental-health patients in underserved areas, advancing early invention programs with proven track records, and extending health IT laws to help mental-health providers and primary-care physicians better coordinate.  The bill is unnecessarily stalled in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Representative Fred Upton (R., Mich.), known for being conflict-averse, should not shy away from this fight. Every candidate for House leadership has signaled support for Murphy’s bill, 130 representatives from both parties have signed on as cosponsors, and the legislation has widespread grassroots support from the American Psychiatric Association, Mental Illness Policy Org., the National Sheriff’s Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and a host of others. Backers have even designated Wednesday, October 7, “National Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Day,” and plan to bombard Representative Upton’s office with calls and social-media messages (#HR2646). The congressman should listen to them. RELATED: Fixing America’s Mental-Health System Compared with the range of milder mental illnesses toward which our mental-health efforts have long been focused, serious mental illnesses directly affect a relatively small number of Americans — less than 5 percent of the total population. But the consequences are evident in our prisons and on our streets — as well as in those instances when untreated serious mental illness expresses itself in mass violence. There is no panacea to these problems, but the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act is a strong step in the right direction.

He then showed a chart on the relationship between the rates of gun deaths and gun ownership among developed nations. “We’re so far away from every other country, we’re running out of chart.” The segment also touched on Bush’s remarks in the immediate aftermath of the Roseburg, Oregon shooting, which left nine people dead. The former Florida governor was asked about gun control in the wake of the shooting, and responded, “I had this challenge as governor. Look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” “To be clear, he wasn’t callously shrugging off the shooting, he was saying that when tragedies like this occur, it’s important to not do anything,” Meyers joked.

Lovato, 23, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19, has been on Capitol Hill since Wednesday speaking with lawmakers about mental health disorders on behalf of the ""Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Illness"" initiative.
Advertisement While speaking with MSNBC's Tamron Hall Monday, the singer said that despite mental health being primarily discussed after such tragedies as last week's mass shooting in Umpqua, Ore., those with mental illnesses are rarely the ones to hurt others. ""Unfortunately, we've had several instances where mental health has been brought to the attention by the media because of these tragedies,"" Lovato said. ""I think it's really important to remember that actually...people with mental illness are... more likely to inflict harm on themselves and become the victim rather than be the perpetrators."" The mental health initiative is backed by organizations such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the Jed Foundation, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals. This is the first initiative supported by all five organizations at once, the website explains. The former Disney star and ""Cool For the Summer"" singer believes vocalizing one's mental struggles is important to help people find treatment sooner.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, an anonymous user of the anything-goes message board 4chan posted a threat warning that school shootings in the Philadelphia area would be coming.""The first of our kind has struck fear into the hearts of America. His cries have been heard, even by the President. This is only the beginning. The Beta Rebellion has begun. Soon, more of our brothers will take up arms to become martyrs to this revolution.""Authorities responded by beefing up security at schools in and around Philadelphia. It does not appear, as of this post, that the online threat was in any way connected to Tuesday's shooting (see Update below). The reports of a gunman at a Philadelphia college come just days after a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killing nine people plus himself, and injuring several others. The attack renewed debate about gun control in the U.S. and safety on college campuses. The Community College of Philadelphia has been locked down for gun violence before. In 2014, the school was locked down after a student pulled a gun on another student in class. No shots were fired and no one was injured. This is a breaking news story. More information about the Community College of Philadelphia gunman story will be provided as it becomes available. Update [12:47 P.M.

(Photo by Michele Anliker) Like most works of art, stage musicals will mean different things to you in different moments of your life. Last year, when director Ron Baumanis resurrected the short-lived Broadway musical ""Bonnie and Clyde"" by way of an Ann Arbor Civic Theatre production at Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre, I was enthralled by the naked intimacy of Clyde serenading his partner-in-crime with a ukulele while sitting in a bathtub. Now, as a brand new Baumanis-directed production of ""Bonnie"" takes the stage at Dexter's Encore Theatre, my heart stopped twice: when Bonnie's mother, played by Emily Rogers, desperately, fruitlessly pleads with Bonnie to leave Clyde and his life of crime; and when Bonnie, played by Mahalia Greenway, explains why she's not scared of the fatal path she's chosen in ""Dyin' Ain't So Bad."" Hints of Greek tragedy peek through ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in these crucial, turning point moments. Yet like ""Titanic,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde"" hardly suffers from a spoiler alert problem. Based on real-life, depression era crime duo Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and the pair's violent end, is a known commodity - even among those who have never seen director Arthur Penn's controversial 1967 movie version of the story, starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. So ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is inevitably about the journey, not the destination. The musical - with a book by Ivan Menchell, music by Frank Wildhorn, and lyrics by Don Black - begins by giving us glimpses of Bonnie's and Clyde's childhoods. Young Bonnie (Kylie Scarpace) must leave her Texas hometown with her mother (Rogers) after her father's death, and she entertains an escapist fantasy about becoming a movie star; and Young Clyde (Ben Chambers) is part of a family barely making it through the depression, so he regularly gets in trouble with the law and dreams about being Al Capone or Billy the Kid. As young adults, Clyde (Adam Woolsey) breaks out of jail and offers to help Bonnie (Greenway), a waitress whose car has died at the side of the road. Their powerful attraction to each other is mirrored by a marriage between Clyde's brother and fellow jail-escapee Buck (Peter Crist) and hairdresser Blanche (Elizabeth Jaffe). God-fearing Blanche convinces Buck to turn himself in to serve the rest of his sentence, but Clyde is snared against his will, and once he's back in prison, he faces brutal physical and sexual abuse. Bonnie helps him escape, and though the two start out only intending to commit robberies, they soon launch into a no-holds-barred, multi-state crime spree that makes them the object of an aggressive police manhunt. As with any tale that's focused on murderous criminals, you inevitably feel a slow burn of discomfort - particularly in the wake of yet another mass shooting - as you come to relate and sympathize with Bonnie and Clyde's self-inflicted predicament. There are, of course, moments when each could choose a different path, but these are people largely shaped by their circumstances (the unrelenting depression; the soul-shattering rape that fuels Clyde to ""Raise a Little Hell""; Bonnie's first reflex to run when Clyde starts killing, before she realizes that for her, it's ""Too Late to Turn Back Now""). Yes, we almost always have another choice; you don't usually have to choose crime and violence. But this tale, as it's told, helps us at least comprehend Bonnie and Clyde's foolhardy arc toward their own destruction. And as Brodie Brockie's projections of photographs of the real Bonnie and Clyde (and Buck and Blanche) remind us, repeatedly, the story is based in an all-too-true reality. Crist does strong work as Buck, who struggles to choose between the wife he loves, who wants him to live a law-abiding, but economically hard, life; and the brother he loves, who promises a life of excitement, wealth and fame. Jaffe is a good match for Crist, particularly when she's selling the positives of an ordinary life in ""That's What You Call a Dream."" Woolsey, meanwhile, is like a walking, unlit firecracker, human but ready to explode at all times. But Greenway is ""Bonnie and Clyde""'s biggest ""wow"" factor. (There's a reason she's won a Wilde Award the past two years in a row, folks.) From the slow dance slinkiness of ""How 'Bout a Dance,"" to the defiant ""This World Will Remember Us"" (with Woolsey), to the heartwrenching ""Dyin' Ain't So Bad"" (which had me in tears), Greenway nails it all, so that you feel just as desperate as Bonnie's mother to stop this young woman from so ardently pursuing her own destruction. Baumanis' Encore production, which runs just short of two and a half hours, inevitably feels a bit more claustrophobic, staging-wise, in the black-box space. But Tyler Driskill's music direction (and five piece orchestra) remains outstanding, and Matthew Brennan's choreography makes good use of Daniel C. Walker's colorless, tri-level set. Walker's lighting design - particularly in moments of ""no turning back"" decisions - complements the actions in subtle, effective ways. And Sharon Larkey Urick's costumes evoke the economically depressed era well, while also making Bonnie a stylish, more colorful standout. There's a lot to talk about in regard to this show, and this particular moment in our collective history. I couldn't help but think about how, in the wake of violence, we consistently end up fascinated by, and talking exhaustively about, the criminals instead of the victims. There's something in us that always wants to know the unknowable. So if you caught ""Bonnie and Clyde"" last fall, here's a chance to see a slightly different take on it and dig deeper into its questions. If the show is new to you, you may feel a bit unnerved, but you'll also likely feel an electric spark of discovery. Jenn McKee is an entertainment reporter for The Ann Arbor News.

252,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/06/shoot_first_ask_questions_later_128317.html,"After America learned of the latest mass shooting at an Oregon community college, President Barack Obama delivered remarks in which he lamented the loss of good, innocent people and then added: ""Somehow this has become routine. ... We've become numb to this."" By the next day, Obama had a remedy: ""Be a single-issue voter."" If you want to stop mass shootings, Obama argued, don't vote for candidates who oppose federal background checks and ""gun safety laws."" Nine adults who should be alive today are not, while the 26-year-old shooter got what he wanted -- to leave this earth in what he perceived as a blaze of glory. It is revolting to think how easy it is for some unhappy loser to leave a swath of destruction because he cannot make a life for himself in this world. The problem with guns is simple: Any idiot can kill others with them. Obama and other Democrats such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein would have you believe that they have an easy answer to this problem. Obama talked up proposed background checks as a remedy when he should have known the checks would have made no difference; the Oregon shooter had no criminal record, no restraining order against him, no involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The New York Times reported that the shooter brought five handguns and a rifle with him to Umpqua Community College -- but left seven firearms at home. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman said the shooter and his family had 14 firearms in total -- all purchased legally from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Feinstein sent out a statement: ""After each shooting, I've been hopeful that Congress would act to close the gun show loophole, mandate universal background checks and remove high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons from our streets."" Last week, National Review's Charles C.W. Cooke asked the hosts and other guests on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" which specific proposals they believe could prevent another Roseburg. ""This is not a competition to see who is the most vexed,"" Cooke maintained, adding it is -- or at least it is supposed to be -- a public policy debate. Cooke was wrong; it is a contest about which side looks angrier. Co-host Mika Brzezinski jumped all over Cooke for not wanting to do more. Mark Halperin, co-managing editor of Bloomberg Politics, said, ""We need passion to solve this, not talk about complexity and talk about how the other side's ideas aren't any good."" They offered no concrete ideas. In the gun debate, you often see people who would never buy a gun saying they support reasonable rules such as background checks, when what they really want to do is stop others from owning guns. The shooter's father on CNN said he wants Congress to pass ""gun control"" laws. He also said, ""I'm a great believer: You don't buy guns. Don't buy guns."" That's the sort of talk that prompts gun enthusiasts to buy more guns before Washington bans them. Ditto the Feinstein statement. So the question I would ask is: Is the idea to pass a law that makes supporters feel good, or is it to prevent violence against innocents? Or is it about turning people into single-issue voters?

This one was at an Oregon junior college. It  happens to be the 142nd school shooting since Sandy Hook (see:everytown.org/article/schoolshootings/ for the entire list), and no mainstream journalist is asking (or, if he knows, his editors are not allowing him to reveal the answer to) the pertinent question that people who truly want to understand the epidemic need to know: ""What brain-damaging, addictive psych drug(s) was this brain-altered shooter taking or withdrawing from?""  There is an immense amount of evidence that legally prescribed psychiatric drugs are major contributors to acts of violence. This evidence has been gathered (and even published [in peer reviewed journals and alternative media outlets that don't take advertising revenue from Big Pharma]) by a number of science writers, pharmaceutical industry whistle-blowers, courageous neuroscientists, good investigative journalists and a multitude of silenced psychiatric drug survivors. The range of acts of violence by Drug-intoxicated psych patients range from self-harm to suicidal thinking to suicidal attempts to homicidal thinking to mass murder, and the media is silent on the psych drug connection. (For more on the large variety of aberrant behaviors strongly linked to the so-called SSRI antidepressants, go to www.ssristories.net.)  It is important to acknowledge that the mainstream media's uber-wealthy corporate media owners profit mightily from Big Pharma's prime time advertising. It is also important to acknowledge that these media elites also profit mightily from their Wall Street investments in the pharmaceutical industry sector. Given those realities it is just good business sense to suppress any unwelcome information that would adversely impact their corporate or personal bottom lines. And so the McCarthy-era black-listing of truth-tellers, uncorrupted scientists, authors, whistle-blowers and real journalists is the norm wherever corporations and the wealthy elite rule.  The four lists below identify particular personality traits and behaviors (as well as issues of family, school and social dynamics) that the FBI regards as important risk factors for many forms of violence, especially in the case of the American childhood and adolescent school shooters. The complete file, which is entitled: THE SCHOOL SHOOTER: A THREAT ASSESSMENT PERSPECTIVE, from which I have excerpted (and edited, in some cases) what I regard as the most useful information, can be accessed by googling the title.  As a physician that practiced holistic, non-drug, mental health care during the last ten years of my family practice career, and who has studied our uniquely American School Shooter epidemic, I agree with the content of these lists. However, as I will point out, item D3 (The Effects of Drugs and Alcohol) is woefully - and deceptively - inadequate.  I have personally and very carefully listened to the horrific stories of over a thousand psychologically-traumatized (and subsequently drug-intoxicated) patients who sought my care. All of them had been labeled with a large variety of ""mental illnesses of unknown cause"". Many of my patients confessed to me that I was the first doctor to have asked about their stories, listened to them or even seemed to care about the origins of their mental health issues. Virtually all of my patients had been told by their psychiatrists that they would have to be on drugs for the rest of their lives.

258,http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/oct/07/gun-demanding-control-firearms-psychology,"Much has been said about gun control in the wake of yet another mass shooting in the US, but the heated and divided nature of the debate means that a fundamental question is often overlooked; why is it people actively want guns in the first place? The answers are not as obvious as you may think Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST Once again, we’ve had yet another mass shooting in the US. That the previous sentence can even be written in a serious manner is a bleak summary of the situation. Even President Obama has clearly lost patience with the regularity of such horrific occurrences. As ever, the fallout includes endless scapegoating, political posturing and analysis. It all boils down to a large number of people not wanting to lose their guns under any circumstances.  Those opposed to gun control regularly cite the second amendment, granting US citizens the right to bear arms. But having the right to do something doesn’t make it mandatory. I have the right to smear myself in peanut butter and dance naked through my kitchen. But I don’t, because I have no interest in doing so. So why do millions of ordinary people see weapons that use controlled explosives to propel bits of metal at lethal speeds at people, and think “I need that in my house”. Basically, why do so many want guns? Given the diversity of gun owners, there isn’t going to be any comprehensive or obvious answer. However, there are a few scientific explanations that could help understand how this comes about. Despite the preconceptions of many, according to a Gallup poll from 2005, the most common reason given for gun ownership is protection. Just like large dogs or security lights, guns are something people have to ensure their safety from intruders. Some might argue this is a cop-out, something gun owners say to seem moral and credible, and maybe sometimes that’s fair. However, it’s also the most common answer given by juvenile offenders incarcerated for gun-related crimes. If you’re already in jail for gun crimes, it should be obvious why you wanted a gun, but still the most common answer among such people is “protection”. This may seem excessively paranoid to those of us in countries where guns aren’t so familiar, but in the US at least they’re much more commonplace. I remember being struck by this on my one visit there. Even the guy supervising a car park had a gun. Why? How often does a Chrysler go on a rampage and need to be brought down? Humans are all about self-preservation and prone to anticipating worst-case scenarios, so if you’re surrounded by people with guns, it would be logical to conclude you need one too. This doesn’t address why guns became so widespread to begin with, but it would explain why this situation persists. And if self-preservation rather than aggression is why you have a gun, you’d undoubtedly be loath to lose it. Another common answer for why people own guns is recreation. Target shooting and hunting are two popular recreational activities, and whatever you think of them, would explain ownership of guns by a substantial number of people. Sometimes the simple explanation is correct; people enjoy hobbies, and hobbies require equipment. Many gun owners confess to feeling vulnerable or “naked” without their guns. Perhaps this isn’t surprising; having a gun gives you considerable power over people. If you feel small, or weak, or underachieving, or anything like this, dealing with others can induce a great deal of social anxiety. A gun would provide at least one easy way where you can have the advantage over them for once, even if this reasoning only occurs at a subconscious level. Achieving high social status is important to your typical human, and guns can play a big role in this in cultures where they’re common. Trouble is, of course, if everyone else has a gun too, then it’s not so useful. So you need more guns, or bigger guns, and on it goes. The fact that it’s more often men who own guns suggests masculinity (toxic or otherwise) plays a part too. And while associating gun ownership with mental health issues is (rightly) considered shameless scapegoating, there is some evidence suggesting gun ownership correlates with tendencies towards anger and impulsivity. It’s reminiscent of how Douglas Adams described people who seek power, in that that those who want it the most are least suitable to have it. It’s now common to see people queuing up for days on end to buy the latest iPhone. Sacrificing home comforts and hours/days of their lives, even travelling great distances, purely to buy a device which is slightly different to one they already own. Why? Clearly there are social and cultural factors that mean owning an up-to-date iPhone is absolutely essential to many people. Why wouldn’t this be true of guns to others? If you grow up and are immersed in a culture where gun ownership is the norm, even praised, of course this is going to influence your attitudes. Earlier suggestions that gun owners are “making excuses” for having firearms don’t make sense when you consider that, for many, owning a gun is a good thing, something to be praised for. They wouldn’t make excuses if they saw nothing that needed excusing. Guns being a status symbol or highly-valued accessory, like iPhones and the like, would explain sheer variety of guns available, at least in the US. If guns were purely for home protection, then you’d only need one basic sort, maybe two. But no, gun enthusiasts often end up owning a wide variety of them. Unless they anticipate being besieged by armed mobs (which could be the case), this makes more sense when you assume that guns infer social status in the culture in which someone is immersed, meaning more or better guns provide higher status. Polarisation can push this even further, beyond any rational limits. Everything else There are many other possible factors that could result in someone wanting a gun, most of which probably aren’t even hinted at here. Gun ownership is more common amongst those with right—wing views, so a stronger self-interest, authoritarian personality and mistrust of other groups may make a gun feel like more of an essential item. Modern entertainment is saturated with guns, usually in the context of good guys using them to deal with less desirable sorts. What we see in the media can, within reason, affect our views and behaviour, so if guns are regularly seen being used to save the day, then no doubt this will rub off on some. Similarly, the making and selling of guns is also a very lucrative industry, so the companies behind it are going to promote the benefits of firearms as often as possible. And, sadly, you always seem to get the people who acquire guns purely to do harm to others, for whatever warped reasoning motivates them. This piece isn’t meant to justify gun ownership, it’s just an attempt to look at how it becomes so commonplace, and why so many people defend it in the face of an ever-increasing list of tragedies. Understanding why people want to own a gun should be essential to better regulate them, because if you just rely on condemnation and blanket criticism of gun owners, they aren’t going to simply agree and hand over their weapons. They’re more likely to double down and become even more adamant that they’re in the right, making gun control ever more difficult. With an issue so serious, this is the last thing anyone needs. Dean Burnett attempted to write an objective, neutral article on the issue of gun ownership and has no doubt failed spectacularly.

265,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/-6xnUOIjuOI/,"According to 2016 presidential hopeful Ben Carson, it is ""more devastating"" for Americans to lose their Second Amendment gun rights than it would be to see a ""body with bullet holes."" This statement has ignited controversy all over social media, and some news media even claim Carson is not qualified to become a U.S. president based upon his previous comments. In a related report by the Inquisitr, the increase in California gun control laws led to the closing of the last San Francisco gun shop in the entire city. Although the law had to be passed, the gun shop says customers were made to feel like criminals, and the resulting drop in sales forced them to close their doors. On October 2, 2015, Ben Carson also asked that his Facebook followers update their profile photo to honor the victims and families of the Oregon shooting. Apparently, over two million people honored this request by using a photo that had the #IamAChristian hashtag.Yes, #IamaChristian. pic.twitter.com/H25uHSfQ9q— Ben & Candy Carson (@RealBenCarson) October 2, 2015While he was ""proud"" to be part of such a movement, Ben Carson's ""more devastating"" comment came up during a Monday night question and answer session on Facebook. He receives emails via AskBen@BenCarson.com, and then he answers the questions. Yes, #IamaChristian. pic.twitter.com/H25uHSfQ9q One email came from a man named Dan who asked if the Oregon shooting had in any way altered Ben Carson's gun control position, or if he still supported the Second Amendment as written. Carson says the mass shooting has not affected his position, but the way he answered has angered some. ""I grew up in the slums of Detroit. I saw plenty of gun violence as a child. Both of my cousins were killed on the streets. As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. Serious people seek serious solutions,"" Carson wrote on Facebook. ""The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda. To me, that is also devastatingly sad. The Left would have you believe that a man that asked Christians to stand up (and then executed them one by one) would obey 'new gun laws'. That kind of logic explains many of the problems we find ourselves in today."" Ben Carson's ""more devastating"" statement has received mixed reactions, but he also shot back at critics who say that his expertise as a neurosurgeon would not prepare him for the presidency. ""You don't need to know nearly as much to be able to maneuver in the political world as you do in the operating room inside of somebody's brain. It's not even close,"" he said, according to the Washington Informer. Last week, Carson also said incidents like the Oregon shooting should lead to a focus on preventing dangerous persons from committing mass shootings rather than taking away gun rights. ""We should be looking at all of the incidents where we have these people who go out and commit horrendous crimes to find out as much as we can about what type of person does this,"" Carson said, according to the Washington Times. ""The issue is the mentality of these people. And we need to be looking at the mentality of these individuals and seeing if there [are] any early warning clues that we can gather that will help us as a society to be able to identify these people ahead of time."" Carson's ""more devastating"" comment falls in line with his previous stance since he believes that more gun control laws only work for ""normal, law-abiding citizens,"" not the ""crazies.""  Ben Carson is on CBS right now blaming the victims of the shooting in OR for ""not rushing him"" (the shooter). Seriously #BenCarson?

Nine people were killed and nine others seriously injured. It was the 294th mass shooting in our country in 274 days. The same day as the massacre in Oregon, North Carolina’s law imposing a 72-hour waiting period to have an abortion went into effect. North Carolina is now tied with Missouri as having the longest waiting period for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to abortion.  What do these things have in common? What possible corollary could I be drawing between such seemingly disparate events? The short answer is: North Carolina doesn’t have a waiting period to buy a gun. Just days before the Oregon shooting, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee – led by chairman Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah – held a hearing at which Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards was aggressively grilled over the contents of several edited “sting” videos in a ridiculous show of interruptions and grandstanding. As everyone knows – and law enforcement agencies have confirmed – Planned Parenthood has done nothing wrong, and Richards proved that easily, despite hostile questioning from the majority GOP members determined to rally their base over the issue of denying women critical health care. Planned Parenthood provides needed, essential health care to 2.7 million Americans – male, female, cisgender, transgender, poor, underserved, and rural populations – each year. These services save lives, help keep families healthy and intact and prevent thousands of unintended pregnancies which, as every relevant health study has shown, reduces the rate of abortion. Yet while this Congress wastes millions of dollars investigating debunked claims of an imaginary “baby parts” black market, they refuse to even consider funding a simple, non-binding study on the effects of gun violence on public health, which causes more deaths each year than in any other industrialized nation on Earth. The hypocrisy of GOP “pro-life” ideology has become a joke. While 51 new abortion restrictions have been enacted at the state level this first half of this year alone, not a single bill has reached the floor of the US House that would attempt to address gun violence. Millions of taxpayer dollars are wasted investigating a health care organization that saves lives and, sometimes, provides a constitutionally-protected and necessary health care procedure that interrupts pregnancy. Yet we are told it’s not worth spending a cent to learn how to save the lives of living, breathing, studying, working, family-raising human beings. The policies of those who claim to care for nothing more than protecting human life are a straw man argument to prevent women from exercising their right to bodily autonomy and participating fully in social, economic, and democratic life. Unsafe abortions kill 47,000 women annually around the world; there is a strong, continuing correlation between deaths from unsafe abortion and countries where the procedure is illegal or its access is significantly restricted. Meanwhile, guns kill 2.3 out of every 100,000 women in in the US. Women here are 11 times more likely to die from gun violence than in any other developed country. Legal abortion is even markedly, dramatically, absurdly more safe than childbirth, resulting in .06 deaths per 100,000 each year in the United States. Safe abortion reduces maternal mortality – and states with higher abortion restrictions see an increase in maternal death rates. Today, though, 28 states require a waiting period ranging from 24 to 72 hours to obtain an abortion. But only nine states require any waiting period at all to purchase a gun. There are 35 states that require so-called “abortion counseling” before a procedure, which may include misleading or outright false information dictated by the state legislature in a script that your doctor must read, whether they know it to be false or not. Some 24 states require an unnecessary ultrasound. But only six states require any form of training or certification courses to purchase a gun. In Wisconsin, a child 14 years of age may carry a gun to hunt without a guardian or adult present. But, as in 20 other states, any minor under the age of 18 must have the legal consent of a parent to obtain an abortion. Republicans’ insistence upon absolute, unfettered freedom to own, carry, or stockpile weapons stands in stark contrast to their dedication to restricting women’s personal choices. Potential life – with all its promise and power – means far more to these demagogues than the actual lives of people here on Earth, now. For the personhood of embryos, they draft legislation. For the safety of living, playing, laughing children, they do nothing. The potential dreams of a not-yet-sentient organism are paramount – not because it is a human life, as demonstrated by their lack of commitment to actual living humans, but because it is inside of a woman. And that woman must not be permitted to do as she pleases or else all Hell may break loose. So long as women know their place, we must assume, no amount of blood spilled is too much to protect the status quo. Meanwhile, Hell is already here.",2015-10-07 11:15:06,"Those who decry abortion but condone gun violence are anti-woman, not pro-life | Martha Plimpton",,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Bobby Jindal said the father of the man accused of killing nine people at an Oregon college is ""a complete failure."" Jindal vented his opinion Tuesday about the mass shooting which took place last week at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. Chris Harper Mercer, 26, is accused of killing nine people and injuring nine others prior to shooting and killing himself. Ian Mercer, Chris' father, called for tougher gun restrictions following the shooting.
Advertisement ""Another week, another mass shooting, another press conference by the president lecturing us on the need for gun control,"" Jindal said. He said ""the root cause"" of acts such as Mercer's rampage is ""a symptom of deep and serious cultural decay.""
RELATED Witnesses: Oregon college shooter targeted Christians Part of that decay includes poor parenting and a violent popular culture but excludes ineffective gun laws, he said. Jindal called Mercer's father a ""complete failure"" and said that people ""devalue human life"" and that the rupture of traditional families in the United States is facilitating the development of mass killers. Jindal also spoke of television shows and movies that ""feature a continuous stream of grotesque killing"" and music that promotes ""evil"" and ""the degradation of women."" He said boys who have not had a father figure in their lives are typically the ones who commit crimes like the one in Oregon. He also criticized the father's surprise at learning his son even had guns. Jindal went on to criticize Democrats' calls for tougher gun laws, calling them ""shallow and simple-minded."" President Barack Obama also vowed to ""politicize"" gun violence.

It's an adage followed by many politicians, including former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, whose newest book hits shelves Tuesday, as the surprise 2016 GOP presidential candidate continues to surge in the polls. ""A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties,"" co-authored by Dr. Carson and his wife, Candy, and published by Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, uses the US Constitution to explore current events and controversial issues. ""As someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery.... In our age of political correctness it's especially important to defend the Bill of Rights, which guarantees our freedom to speak, bear arms, practice our religion, and much more,"" Carson said in a preview of the book. Carson, a celebrated retired pediatric neurosurgeon captured national attention when he criticized President Obama at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. His comments won him conservative fans who encouraged him to enter politics. He is now one of three surprise contenders in the GOP presidential race with no political experience who are surging in the polls. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls, Trump runs first in the Republican field at 23 percent, followed by Carson at 17 percent, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 11 percent. ""A More Perfect Union"" is one of at least seven books, many of which have become bestsellers, penned by the former neurosurgeon. While the book is largely a 253-page primer of the 16-page Constitution covering the basics like the history, challenges to, and purpose of the founding document, Carson has recently used the topic as a means to speak out about controversial topics. For example, he told USA Today's weekly paper, Capital Download, his philosophy on gun control is grounded in the Constitution. The lessons from the latest mass shooting aren't to enact more limits on guns, he says, but to identify and treat mentally ill people, arm teachers, and question whether gun-free zones attract shooters. ""If I had a little kid in kindergarten somewhere I would feel much more comfortable if I knew on that campus there was a police officer or somebody who was trained with a weapon,"" he told Capital Download. ""If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" Carson recently came under fire for making comments suggesting he would not support a Muslim in the White House, a comment critics called unconstitutional. In September, Carson told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd he doesn’t believe Islam is compatible with the Constitution and “would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” In fact, the Constitution does not permit a national religion or a religious test for public office. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Still, Carson tells Fox News he wrote the book to educate others about the founding document ""Everyone knows we have a constitution but not many know what's in it, and the Constitution is there to protect us, the people,"" he told Fox News. ""It's 16 and one-third pages long, written at the level of an 8th grader, and they did that specifically so the people would understand what the foundation of our country is,"" he said.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

        Mark Arce Posted on October 7, 2015, at 10:35 a.m. ET Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 1998 book Kids Who Kill is full of spurious quotations from leading American political figures, mostly the country's founding fathers. A number of the quotations, such as those from Washington and Jefferson, have been routinely debunked by libraries of the past presidents but still regularly find their way into books from conservative figures. Other quotes, debunked by prominent historians, seem to be used for the first time in the book. The book was co-written with evangelical author George Grant in response to a mass shooting in Arkansas. The book links that shooting to the decline in America's moral culture. The quotes, from figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry, are often used to reinforce Huckabee's moral viewpoint. Huckabee isn't the first Republican presidential to attribute fake quotes to America's founders. Ben Carson, Rand Paul, and former candidate Scott Walker have all done so. ""That book was co-authored, and I'm not sure which one wrote those, but we appreciate you reading the book,"" a Huckabee spokesman said. However, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, ""this quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson."" Another quote attributed to Jefferson read, ""Any woodsman can tell you that in a broken and sundered nest, one can hardly expect to find more than a precious few whole eggs. So it is with the family."" Neither the Thomas Jefferson Foundation nor The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University could verify the quote. ""I have searched our presidential files using woodsman, nest, and family as keywords and have not found this quote,"" The Papers of Thomas Jefferson wrote to BuzzFeed News in a statement. Huckabee's cites ""King's Signet Book's"" in his book as the source for the quote, but a search for the source only turns up links to Huckabee's book and another book, Revolution: Jesus' Call to Change the World. ""The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington, particularly in regards to his farewell address of 1796,"" writes the National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. Huckabee also attributed multiple quotes to founding father Patrick Henry that are unverifiable and sourced only to Huckabee's book or a book cited by Huckabee. ""The manners of a gentleman are an outgrowth of his due respect for the life and integrity of others; likewise a breach of courtesy is emblematic not so much of barbarism as of utter and complete self-absorption. A rude man is but a callous egotist,"" reads one quote attributed to Henry. The only source available for this is Huckabee's book. The quote is not cited in the book. Another quote attributed to Henry, ""For good or for ill, the estate of the family will most assuredly predetermine the estate of all of the rest of the culture,"" could again only be sourced back to Huckabee. One prominent historian, Baylor professor Thomas S. Kidd, who authored Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots, told BuzzFeed News he had not seen the quotes before. ""Those are new ones to me. Like you, I cannot find any hits on them except for the Huckabee book,"" Kidd told BuzzFeed News. Another quote attributed to Henry in Huckabee's book can also be found in a different book from Huckabee's co-author, but in that book it's attributed to Pope Leo XIII. Huckabee's book reads: ""Patrick Henry argued, 'The contention that the civil government should at its option intrude into and exercise control over the family and the household is a great and pernicious error.'"" ""The philosophy of the classroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next,"" reads on quote attributed to Lincoln. The quote is untraceable to Lincoln and is often listed as an unconfirmed quote. ""It looks like that quote began appearing in various evangelical books attributing it to Lincoln at some point in the 1990s, but beyond that I don't know its origins,"" Lincoln scholar and Dickinson College professor Matthew Pinsker. ""It's certainly not Lincoln, or to be precise, there's no evidence that it comes from any of Lincoln's writings and no recollected account that I know of which even claims this line as his."" Another quote attributed to Lincoln in the book (""We are indeed, the almost chosen people"") seems to be a slight misread of an address Lincoln gave to the New Jersey legislature in February of 1861, where he is quoted by the New York Times as saying, ""I shall be most happy in lead if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, as the chosen instrument, also in the hands of the almighty, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle."" Huckabee and his co-author also attributed a quote to Samuel Adams (""without civility, there can be no society,"") that, upon searching, could only be found in his book and a 1999 column in a South Carolina newspaper written by a wedding consultant. Finally, a quote attributed to founding father Gouverneur Morris is not only a fake quote but a misattribution of a fake quote. ""The Constitution is not an instrument for government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government—lest it come to dominate our lives and interests,"" read the quote attributed to Morris. This quote is fake as noted by prominent historians, and is usually attributed to Patrick Henry. Andrew Kaczynski is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

278,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/115975383/0/phoenix/nation~Striking-number-of-cops-leery-of-confiscating-guns/,"WASHINGTON — More than a third of top police officials either believe they have no legal authority or did not know whether they could seize firearms from people who have been determined by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others, according to a recent national survey of local law enforcement authorities. Of those officials who believed they had such authority, more than half said they rarely or never used it in the past year, according to the survey of 266 agencies representing 42 states conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based law enforcement advocacy group. Moreover, 60% of respondents said their agencies had no program or protocol for carrying out firearm confiscations. The striking responses come amid a renewed debate about the availability of firearms, prompted by yet another deadly mass shooting that so far has only underscored the challenges to blocking the mentally ill and emotionally disturbed from obtaining and using guns. Some analysts said the survey identifies another troubling loophole in firearm access: confusion over the extent of basic law enforcement authority and a genuine lack of it. ""This is clearly not an everyday part of law enforcement, and it should be,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""In most cases there is not a good process for removing guns. This is an area of big concern. We're allowing people to be armed when they are considered to be most dangerous.'' Federal law prohibits firearms purchases from licensed dealers to people who have been found mentally defective, incompetent to handle their own personal affairs and those involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Yet uneven compliance with reporting such data to state and federal authorities for vetting firearms purchasers has made the identification of those at risk more difficult, authorities said. USA TODAY In face of criticism, police officials preaching de-escalation tactics USA TODAY Guns are not the only deadly weapon for mass killers ""This is a problem,'' said Richard Beary, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ""I'm not surprised that officers are apprehensive or intimidated ... If there is a question, I would rather we confiscate. If we get hit with a lawsuit, then I'll deal with it.'' Perhaps the most prominent firearm confiscation effort in the country, the so-called Armed and Prohibited Persons program, is overseen by the California Department of Justice, where agents have seized thousands of firearms since 2001. The system identifies people who previously purchased one or more guns legally but later have become ineligible to possess firearms due to criminal criminal conviction, mental instability or other conditions. Since 2013, agents have conducted 14,012 investigations, recovering prohibited firearms in a majority of those cases, California Justice Department spokeswoman Kristin Ford said. There were still an estimated 15,662 suspected prohibited weapons owners in California, according to the most recent accounting by the state, which Ford said represents the fewest number since 2009. In Prince George's County, Md., gun confiscations are generally carried out in conjunction with a formal court hearing, resulting in an order from the judge, county police spokeswoman Julie Parker said. In cases when officers are responding to calls and there is a belief that the situation has become unsafe due to the presence of a firearm, Parker said officers have ""the discretion to seize a firearm and send to our property warehouse for safekeeping.'' Parker said the department does not specifically track the number of weapons seized. ""This is something we definitely have to look at,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ""There is considerable support for police stepping in when there is an immediate threat of harm ... Obviously, we should be getting a 100% response'' from police related to their procedures for confiscating weapons. ""This is an area that's just not talked about enough,'' Wexler said. ""There are so many situations involving the mentally ill or emotionally disturbed with some type of weapon.''

(AP Photo via Chris Pietsch/The Register-Guard) (Chris Pietsch) ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The gunman who fatally shot nine people at an Oregon community college last week killed himself in front of his victims after two police officers wounded him, authorities said Wednesday. When two plainclothes detectives spotted Christopher Harper-Mercer in the doorway of a campus building, he fired at them, and the officers quickly returned fire. The killer then went back inside and shot himself in a classroom where many of his victims lay dead and wounded, a prosecutor told a news conference. It was authorities' most detailed account yet of the gunman's death. Previously, they had said only that the 26-year-old attacker killed himself after a shootout. The detectives arrived within minutes of the first reports of gunfire at Umpqua Community College. Seconds later, the officers ""both felt they had a good target,"" Douglas County District Attorney Rick Wesenberg said. Two of their bullets hit a wall. A third struck Harper-Mercer on the right side. The wounded gunman ""entered the classroom again, went to the front of the classroom and shot and killed himself,"" Wesenberg said. The attack in this rural timber town was the worst mass shooting in Oregon history. Eight students and a teacher died. Nine others were wounded. A private memorial has been held for Lawrence Levine, who was killed while teaching the class. Another private service was held Wednesday for 44-year-old Sarena Dawn Moore of Myrtle Creek. More funerals are scheduled through Saturday. Investigators have not yet shared any motive for the killings. They have seized 14 guns -- six found at the college and eight at the apartment Harper-Mercer shared with his mother on the outskirts of Roseburg. Authorities have said the gunman's mother told them her son was struggling with mental health issues, but no details have been released. Harper-Mercer and his mother shared a love of firearms and would go to shooting ranges together.

280,http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/10/07/GOP-contender-Carson-again-under-fire-for-comments-this-time-on-Oregon-shooting/3331444257807/,"NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (UPI) -- Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson has again found himself the target of criticism for making potentially insensitive remarks -- this time about last week's mass shooting at an Oregon community college that killed nine people. In separate interviews with news media Tuesday and Wednesday, Carson described how he would have reacted if he'd been caught up in the shooting at Umpqua Community College on Thursday.
Advertisement ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, `Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me but he can't get us all,'"" the Republican neurosurgeon told Fox News' Fox & Friends Tuesday. ""I said what I would do. ... I would ask everyone to attack the gunman,"" he subsequently told ABC News. ""That way we wouldn't all end up dead."" Carson, who is still receiving criticism for remarking last month that he would not approve of a Muslim U.S. president, has been stumping for president as he hopes to secure the GOP nomination. The Republican's new remarks are now attracting yet more criticism from some who have said Carson appears to be blaming the victims -- nine of whom were killed and another nine who were wounded by the gunman. President Barack Obama plans to travel to Roseburg, Ore., on Friday to meet with families of the victims, but several community members are criticizing the trip because they believe it's an attempt by the president to politicize the tragedy. Carson is perhaps facing even harsher criticism for his reply to a question from Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade, who hypothetically asked, ""Dr. Carson, would you go? If the people of the community say, 'don't go,' would you still go if you're president on Friday?"" ""Probably not,"" Carson replied. ""I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I would go to the next [shooting]."" ""When comments like Republican candidate Ben Carson condemning President Obama's decision to visit and console the families in Roseburg in a private meeting, that somehow he would wait for the next one? It's stunning,"" Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said. ""I can't imagine a more callous, heartless remark than that,"" he added. Carson again appeared on Fox News Wednesday and defended his remarks from a day earlier, saying that the fallout is merely a product of typical politicking that is being aided by the national news media. ""We are living in a culture now where you have a group of people who just sit there, they don't try to listen to what you're saying. They are just trying to find a defect so that they can cause more division,"" Carson said. ""They are trying to divide our nation.""

282,http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/07/video-a-gun-free-america-in-5-easy-steps/,"Want to stop gun violence? Dare to dream of a gun-free America, progressives claim as they demand action to curtail access to firearms after the mass shooting in Oregon. Reason TV dared to dream of how to get to a gun-free America, and found that it’s as easy as these five steps. Except … it’s not that easy, and it’s going to make the situation much, much worse: It’s amusing, of course, but I’d bet progressives can do this in fewer steps. All they need is three or four Supreme Court appointments, and at some point we’ll end up watching the discovery of a right to be safe from gun violence. The Second Amendment will suddenly only apply to militias, and confiscations will become all the rage, in one or more senses. That’s something to keep in mind when debating the nuances of the primary season, yes? Meanwhile, Eugene Volokh points out that the homicide rate correlation in states with lower gun-control regulation not only doesn’t exist, it may actually lean the other way: The correlation between the homicide rate and Brady score in all 51 jurisdictions is +.032 (on a scale of -1 to +1), which means that states with more gun restrictions on average have very slightly higher homicide rates, though the tendency is so small as to be essentially zero. (If you omit the fatal gun accident rates, then the correlation would be +.065, which would make the more gun-restricting states look slightly worse; but again, the correlation would be small enough to be essentially zero, given all the other possible sources of variation.) If we use the National Journal data (adding the columns for each state, counting 1 for each dark blue, which refers to broad restrictions, 0.5 for each light blue, which refers to medium restrictions, and 0 for each grey, which refers to no or light restrictions), the results are similar: +0.017 or +0.051 if one omits the fatal gun accident rates. … Perhaps there are other confounding factors (such as demographics, economics, and so on). Perhaps even controlling for those factors, there will be other missing factors that are hard to control for — for instance, maybe as the crime rate increases, calls for gun controls increase, so high crime causes more gun restrictions, or maybe calls for more freedom to defend oneself increase, so high crime causes fewer gun restrictions (e.g., liberalized concealed-carry licensing rules). And of course when small changes in the model yield substantial changes in results (e.g., if you calculate the state gun scores differently, the results will likely be different), you know how little you should credit the output. Figuring out the actual effect of government actions, whether gun laws, changed policing rules, drug laws, or anything else, is devilishly difficult. But since people have been talking about simple two-variable correlations between gun laws and crime, I thought it would be helpful to note this correlation — or, rather, absence of correlation. Duly noted, but that won’t stop the demands for action in the face of tragedy. Let’s just be glad that our form of government is designed to force legislators to slow down and proceed carefully while forming larger consensuses. At least, it has until now, anyway. We’re about three steps from seeing that dissipate, too. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

284,http://www.startribune.com/politics/331179751.html,"One after another, firearms of varying calibers cracked and thumped at Bill’s Gun Range in Robbinsdale. On a Tuesday afternoon, the recreational shooters represented a wide range of ages, ethnic background and experience. Stephen Kwong, 24, of Eagan, hadn’t fired a gun at the range in two years, but decided to swing by after lunch one day last week, bringing with him his friend, first-timer Jessica Wong, 21. In the wake of the latest mass shooting, this one at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Kwong remained steadfast that while everyone should have gun training, the right to bear arms should be inviolate and restricting gun rights will not prevent future carnage. “I mean, look around,” Kwong said. “For $73, two of us were standing inside with a bunch of other people who don’t know each other with guns. The deadliest place could be right here.” Nevertheless, gun control supporters say they are more motivated than ever to apply the kind of sustained pressure gun rights advocates have brought to bear. Brian Rusche, executive director of the Joint Religious Legislative Coalition, said his organization has undertaken similar efforts before, but amped up its efforts since nine African-Americans were killed last June during a similar mass shooting at a Charleston, S.C., church. “I’m almost ashamed to say this, but in a way previous shootings jostled us but maybe we became complacent,” he said. “Charleston gripped us.” Then, he said, as they were preparing a bill for the 2016 legislative session, “Oregon happens.” Now Rusche is determined to find a reasonable consensus with the gun owners lobby, rather than the bruising debates of the past. “I’m convinced we can save lives, and we can come to reasonable gun laws if we can show that gun policies could save lives without compromising Second Amendment rights,” he said. Back at the gun range, Ashlee Hutchinson, 23, of St. Paul, would also like to see a balance struck. Hutchison says she grew up with what she calls a healthy respect and fear of guns, thanks to a father who was also a firearms enthusiast. Hutchinson brought her friend, Jeremy Wilson, 19, also a first-timer. Both said they think the vetting process for obtaining a gun should be as stringent as possible, while allowing legal owners to carry. They say everyday violence is just as disconcerting as random mass shootings. “They get in the hands of the wrong people, anything can happen.” Hutchinson said. “That’s putting other people at risk, and it’s not right.” The issue is one that cuts deeply in a state where many consider gun ownership a birthright. Some 200,000 Minnesotans hold permits to carry a handgun, and advocates estimate that about half of the state’s households have a gun on the premises. Gun control advocates say they are preparing to push Minnesota to close the so-called “gun show loophole,” by requiring background checks for any firearm sales — not just from licensed dealers. They also want to renew a push for short-term gun violence restraining orders that would allow law enforcement officers to temporarily confiscate firearms with a judge’s signoff in cases of potential domestic violence or suicide. It’s modeled after a “red flag” bill passed in California last year. Senate Democrats in Washington are expected Thursday to unveil a national proposal that will focus on extended background checks. Andrew Rothman, president of the Minnesota Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance, said none of those measures will stop the shootings. “Everybody agrees that if there’s something we can do to make these rare and horrible things even more rare, we should do it,” he said. “But the caveat … is that it has to be something that will actually help. We know a common thread running through these mass murders is mental illness. But at the same time we can’t pick these murderers out from millions of other Americans that have similar mental health issues but never turn violent.” Abrogating the rights of law-abiding citizens will do little, he said. In fact, proponents of gun rights are looking to expand them. One of their proposals would remove the “duty to retreat” from Minnesota’s self-defense laws, and authorize “Constitutional Carry.” That would allow anyone not prohibited from carrying a firearm to pack a gun without additional paperwork, training or a sheriff’s signoff. Rob Doar, political director of the Minnesota Gun Owners Political Action Committee, said that he isn’t confident Constitutional Carry will gain much traction here, but that the proposal is intended to start a dialogue and possibly lower permit-to-carry application fees, which vary from county to county — the most expensive among them in Hennepin and Ramsey counties. Doar, who like Rothman is a firearms instructor, said he believes that anyone who carries a firearm should be properly trained, but that being forced to pay for training and application “is the equivalent of a poll tax to exercise a constitutional right.” Traction unlikely Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, chairman of the House Public Safety and Crime Prevention Policy and Finance Committee, said he does not intend to hear any gun-related legislation unless it somehow addresses mental illness. “In other words, it sounds like it’s getting to be a tired cliché nationally, but I agree that we have a mentally ill problem, not a gun problem,” said Cornish, a longtime proponent of gun rights. “Plus, I don’t think the DFL has any appetite in an election year to look like gun control advocates.” State Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and last year sponsored the “red flag” bill. Latz said he’s made no decisions, but is interested in moving toward universal background checks for firearm purchases and the “red flag” bill. Latz notes that such a law would have allowed family members of either the Oregon or South Carolina shooters to petition a judge to remove weapons from the house if they harbored concerns. “I think from the public standpoint, both of these would get really good traction, but whether they get traction legislatively is a different story, because vigorous gun rights advocates resist any steps in these directions,” Latz said. Heather Martens, executive director of Protect Minnesota, said she sees momentum for what she prefers to call “gun violence prevention.” “I think people are getting really sick of the bloodshed,” she said. Martens pointed out that 80 percent of Minnesota gun deaths are suicides. A red flag law, she said, could possibly curb those. In addition, she said, “It seems like there’s an increasing trend for suicidal people to go to public places and take others with them.” As he cased up his gun at Bill’s, Bruce Tix, 65, a Navy veteran from Inver Grove Heights, said he thinks Minnesota laws have treated gun owners well. Tix has his own theory on why mass shootings keep happening. “They’re blaming guns for the problem and it’s not the problem,” he said. “The problem is a moral issue. Many, many years ago, people wouldn’t have done this.”  Abby Simons is the Star Tribune’s Public Safety Editor. Her team covers crime and courts across the metro.

To give context, Colbert played the rest of the quote, where Bush said that after crises like the Oregon shooting, ""the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" ""That's leadership: Not necessarily doing anything,"" Colbert said, illustrating his point with an imagined dialogue: ""'Follow me, everyone!' 'Where are we going?' 'Right where we are.'"" Bush should be doing much better than 8 percent in the GOP polls, Colbert said, but ""when he says stuff like that, after 142 school shootings since Sandy Hook, it sounds like he's got — how can I put this delicately? — stuff for brains."" But Bush isn't the only Republican vying for a position of power who has a hard time expressing himself, he added, turning to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the probable next House speaker. ""McCarthy's got plenty of support in Congress, so he's got the House part down,"" Colbert said, ""but apparently, he's still working on the 'speaker'."" After playing one garbled speech excerpt, he gravely lauded McCarthy's ""strong, English-like words."" After showcasing the future House speaker's verbal inabilities, Colbert showed all tongue-tied politicians how it's done. The music and waving flag help lend gravity to Colbert's incoherent speech, so maybe McCarthy should take note — well, that or hire a speaking coach.

This amendment is a dangerous anachronism. It was put in the Constitution by the Southern states not to protect freedom, but to protect slavery. Their representatives to the Constitutional Convention feared a federal monopoly on firearms as envisioned by the Constitution would enable the central government to shut down the slave patrol militias needed to maintain slavery. That's why the amendment cynically states: ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.""Repealing or revising the Second Amendment and limiting private gun ownership to hunting and legitimate self-defense would also go far to solving another serious problem -- the unwarranted and excessive use of gun violence by police, which is generally justified by the pervasive presence of guns in our communities. In most civilized countries, gun ownership is strictly regulated and police have far less or even no firepower on their daily patrols.

Elliott posted the picture to Facebook on Monday. In the accompanying post, which was shared more than 4,000 times as of Thursday afternoon, he describes himself as a ""responsible gun owner"" who saved up funds for his first gun, a Browning 12-gauge shotgun, from his paper route as a young boy. Since then, guns have been a part of his life, a part that personal experiences and mass shootings made increasingly ""harder and harder to justify.""

Elliott explains that owning a gun makes him feel as though he bears ""a portion of the responsibility for our nation's gun violence.""

300,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/YdbP5Gt8E_Y/," While many of President Obama’s critics were quick to jump all over him for admittedly politicizing the mass shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, GOP candidate Ben Carson chose to politicize it in his own weird way. Carson rolled eyes and raised brows when he wrote on his Facebook page that he “never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” People were obviously shocked and outraged over such a comment, but plenty of other people also raised their muskets in the air to celebrate the bold and occasionally clueless candidate’s words. Carson wasn’t done, though. In addition to his belief that stricter laws won’t stop killers from finding guns, Carson also offered a solution to these recurring mass shootings: “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” At least one survivor from the Umpqua incident was upset by Carson’s hypothetical bravery, telling CNN, “Nobody could truly understand what actions they would take like that in a situation unless they lived it.” But Carson has lived it, you see. Well, sort of, if you believe his latest story about why he’s qualified to be 2015’s Chuck Norris. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye’s organization” in Baltimore, the retired neurosurgeon told Karen Hunter on Sirius XM Radio, referring to the fried chicken fast-food chain. “Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, ‘I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.'” (Via CNN) Perhaps I need to consult with a brain surgeon, but that seems like the complete opposite of bravery.

High Bridge Arms, the only gun retailer within the city limit for the last 15 years, will be no more after Oct. 31. “There are multiple reasons. Ordinance is one factor,” said Russel Susbilla, an assistant manager at High Bridge. Susbilla is referring to San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell’s proposal to require all firearms sales to be videotaped and submission of records to the police of all ammunition sales, including online sales. That proposal is slated for a committee hearing in the next couple of weeks and could be signed into law by the end of the year if it secures enough support. High Bridge says it has made an effort to accommodate city demands, including installing a specific model of surveillance camera. But when the city came back and asked for additional cameras, High Bridge’s owner decided to call it quits, according to Susbilla. “The idea of the proposal is to be forward-looking,” said Jess Montejano, a legislative aide to Mark Farrell. “If Congress isn’t going to act [on tighter gun control], we will do everything possible to protect the public safety of our residents.” Montejano also scoffed at the idea that a policy that isn’t even in effect yet could cause the closure of the store. “It’s harassment,” said Delbert Wong, a customer at the store. Characterizing the move for additional surveillance of gun sales as a “liberal attitude,” Wong claimed that more gun control would not have stopped the mass shooting in Oregon that resulted in 10 deaths, including the shooter. The incident prompted Sens. Chuck Schumer--D-N.Y. and Debbie Stabenow--D-Mich. to propose additional regulations to expand background checks and prevent illegal gun purchases, according to reports. So far this year, there have been 298 mass shootings in the U.S., according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as one in which “four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling-off period.” For now, High Bridge has no plans to relocate. “People will have to drive out of the city to buy exactly the same thing [that they did here],” said John, a salesperson at the store who declined to give his last name.

303,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/lnPsUr-Vujg/,"According to a recent blog post by Bobby Jindal, mass shootings have a number of causes, all centering in what he calls cultural decay: absent fathers, abortion, movies, and video games. With references to God's law, common decency, political correctness, and young boys who ""will never become real men"" because of a lack of truth in their lives, Jindal offers a baker's dozen of bullet points that he believes need repair in order to put an end to the killing. Jindal opens by warning readers that what follows ""will be a sermon,"" then proceeds to declare that the real reasons behind mass shootings are things that politicians refuse to discuss (such as abortion, apparently).  He begins to list them, and though some of his 13 bullet points are a bit redundant, they can be condensed to the following:Media: movies, video games, and music that glorify killing and death.Lack of regard for sanctity of life; abortion.Lack of father figures.In multiple bullets, Jindal addresses video games, music, and movies, which he says have centered ""for at least a generation"" on glorifying death, murder, and lack of respect for human life. Taking a detour to swipe at programs that are intended to protect schoolkids, he throws out the following.""Oh, we make sure that we stop them from bullying at school, but we are completely fine with them watching people get murdered and raped on the internet after school, and we are willing to let them go to the basement and join a fantasy world where they pretend they are killing people for 2 hours after school."" As for abortion, that is, of course, a key talking point for all presidential candidates at the moment, as the controversy continues over the Planned Parenthood videos and threats by some politicians to shut down the government over funding of the organization. However, other than declaring a lack of value for the sanctity of life, Jindal doesn't go into further detail about how he believes abortion and mass shootings are connected. He also offers no explanation for his assertion that there is a lack of care for elderly lives, though that could perhaps be linked to long-debunked (Snopes covers this here) claims of death panels and ethics boards connected to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Lack of father figures is a particular key point for the Republican presidential hopeful. It conveniently ties in to the GOP ""family values"" talking point, and allows for the attack on males who aren't ""real men."" He declares that most of these mass shootings are carried out by individuals who either have no father figure in their lives, or who have a poor relationship with their fathers. In fact, the most recent mass murder to make major headlines is directly connected to this point, in Jindal's view. In his final four bullet points, Bobby Jindal focuses on the recent mass shooting in Oregon, declaring that the shooter's father, who ""..is now lecturing us on the need for gun control."" Turning the narrative around, Jindal points out that the father said he hadn't spoken with his son in a while, and that he didn't know his son owned guns.""Why didn't he know? Because he failed to raise his son. He should be ashamed of himself, and he owes us all an apology.""Without going as far as stating directly that Christopher Harper-Mercer's dad was responsible for the murders, Jindal firmly implied it, demanding an apology from the man. Bobby Jindal's declaration on the causes of mass shootings is getting largely negative feedback, with tweets from followers who say that the real ""cultural rot"" is rooted in bigotry, racism, the gun lobby, and low availability of medical care, including mental health care, for Americans living below the poverty line.

306,https://www.nationalreview.com/article/425290/what-gun-control-advocates-mean-dare-not-say-guns-should-be-confiscated-charles,"Follow Us National Review Bernie Sanders: ‘I Don’t Know’ If Democrats Will Try to Include a Public Option in $3.5 Trillion Bill The Biden Ministry of Truth Religious Liberty, Exceptions, and Targeting Why It’s Important to Pass State Critical Race Theory Bills Now Beto O’Rourke: This Voting Reform Bill Could Mean the End of Democracy in Texas There’s the cycle of poverty. There’s the cycle of violence. And then there’s the cycle of gun talk. It starts with a mass shooting. Gun-control advocates blame the deaths on gun-control opponents, who argue, in turn, that none of the proposed restrictions would have had any effect on the incident in question. The debate goes nowhere. The media move on. Until the next incident, when the cycle begins again. So with the Roseburg massacre in Oregon. Within hours, President Obama takes to the microphones to furiously denounce the NRA and its ilk for resisting “commonsense gun-safety laws.” His harangue is totally sincere, totally knee-jerk, and totally pointless. At the time he delivers it, he — and we — know practically nothing about the shooter, nothing about the weapons, nothing about how they were obtained. Nor does Obama propose any legislation. He knows none would pass. But the deeper truth is that it would have made no difference. Does anyone really believe that the (alleged) gun-show loophole had anything to do with Roseburg? Universal background checks sound wonderful. But Oregon already has one. The Roseburg shooter and his mother obtained every one of their guns legally. RELATED: Hillary & Co. Fight a Phony War on Gun Violence The reason the debate is so muddled, indeed surreal — notice, by the way, how “gun control” has been cleverly rechristened “commonsense gun-safety laws,” as if we’re talking about accident proofing — is that both sides know that the only measure that might actually prevent mass killings has absolutely no chance of ever being enacted. Mere “commonsense” regulation, like the assault-weapons ban of 1994 that was allowed to lapse ten years later, does little more than make us feel good. A Justice Department study found “no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.” #share#As for the only remotely plausible solution, Obama dare not speak its name. He made an oblique reference to Australia, never mentioning that its gun-control innovation was confiscation, by means of a mandatory buyback. There’s a reason he didn’t bring up confiscation (apart from the debate about its actual efficacy in reducing gun violence in Australia). In this country, with its traditions, public sentiment, and — most importantly — Second Amendment, them’s fightin’ words. Obama didn’t say them. Nor did he seriously address the other approach that could make a difference: more-aggressive psychiatric intervention. These massacres are almost invariably perpetrated by severely disturbed, isolated, often delusional young men. RELATED: For Obama Gun Control Is About the Issue Not the Solution Yet even here, our reach is limited. In some cases, yes, involuntary commitment would have made a difference. Jared Loughner, the Tucson shooter, was so unstable, so menacing, that fellow students at his community college feared, said one, that he would “come into class with an automatic weapon.” Under our crazy laws, however, he had to kill before he could be locked up. If President Obama believes in Australian-style confiscation, why not spell it out? Similarly, the Navy Yard shooter had been found by police a few weeks earlier in a hotel room, psychotic and paranoid. They advised him to get psychiatric help. Advised. Predictably, he fell through the mental-health cracks. A month later, he killed twelve and was killed himself, another casualty of a mental-health system that lets the severely psychiatrically ill — you see them sleeping on grates — live and die wretchedly abandoned. The problem is that these mass-murder cases are fairly unusual. Take Roseburg. That young man had no criminal history, no psychiatric diagnosis beyond Asperger’s, no involvement in public disturbances. How do you find, let alone lock up, someone like that?  There are 320 million Americans. Schizophrenia affects about 1 percent of the population. That’s about 3 million people. Only a tiny fraction are ever violent — and predicting which ones will be is almost impossible. #related#Loner, socially isolated, often immersed in a fantasy world of violent video games. There are myriad such young men out there, but with different ages of onset, in different stages of derangement. Only a handful will ever harm anyone. What to do? Forcibly apprehend them, treat them, put them on perpetual preventive parole? By the tens of thousands? Committing the Jared Loughners would have an effect. But even they are the exception among the shooters. Yet “commonsense” gun control would do even less. Unless you’re willing to go all the way. In the final quarter of his presidency, Obama can very well say what he wants. If he believes in Australian-style confiscation — i.e., abolishing the Second Amendment — why not spell it out? Until he does, he should stop demonizing people for not doing what he won’t even propose. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

In the wake of the recent murders at the rural Oregon community college, Republican Assemblywoman Michele Fiore says that she would like a scientific study into psychiatric drugs, because she says lawmakers must act to try to end mass shootings. Fiore has been a defender of the Second Amendment and says that even though guns are being blamed for mass shootings, she believes the real trigger could be the pills in the medicine cabinet.pic.twitter.com/q6H30kgOWl — Michele Fiore (@VoteFiore) October 6, 2015She pointed out the anecdotal evidence of past mass shooters and their use of psychiatric drugs. Fiore wants to know more about the side effects and risks of treating mental illness with psychiatric drugs. ""We should really be focusing on the root of the problem: mental illness. I urge everyone to educate themselves on mental illness and the drugs that doctors are so quick to prescribe, because knowing the signs and side effects of these could save lives; banning guns will not,"" Fiore wrote on her website. ""Today's victims and their families will be in my thoughts and prayers, and I will continue my work to raise awareness of the dangers of gun-free zones and the dangers of the drugs that are prescribed.""Let's take back Nevada together http://t.co/ud37bAddxB pic.twitter.com/j1zGIHneIY — Michele Fiore (@VoteFiore) September 11, 2015In Oregon, the mass shooter was armed with body armor, extra ammunition, and more than a dozen weapons, according to Channel 3 News, but the Nevada lawmaker points out he was also likely under the influence of psychiatric drugs. The shooter had a screen name on social media of ""lithium love."" Lithium, of course, is a psychiatric drug. Also on social media, the mass shooter posted that he had multiple pills in front of him, and that he would take them all. Law enforcement in Oregon claims that the mass shooter was struggling with mental illness and he graduated from a school for children with learning and emotional special needs.

She sponsored a bill in Nevada in order to fight an existing law that prohibited people who legally carried a firearm to foster children. She also introduced what was known as the ""Bundy Bill,"" which was legislation favored by Nevada ranchers led by Cliven Bundy.

309,http://www.inquisitr.com/2481768/highland-high-school-shooting-nude-pics/,"Less than one week after a horrifying mass shooting that killed 10 at a community college in Oregon, a high school in Idaho may have narrowly averted a similar tragedy, arresting a 15-year-old student who posted frightening online threats to carry out a mass shooting at the school — a student who, though he has not been named publicly by police, reportedly had a history harassing other students via social media posts. The incident caused police in Pocatello, Idaho, to place Highland High School there on lockdown for much of Wednesday, until the teen was identified and taken into custody. The school was able to resume normal operation on Thursday. Another student at Highland High School described the teen accused of making the violent and disturbing mass shooting threats as ""having attention problems."" The incident apparently began with a Facebook post that included a screen shot of what appeared to be a text message conversation on a smartphone. The text messages contained threats by one of the participants, apparently a high school student, to ""bring a gun to school and kill all the girls."" Screen shot of threatening text messages allegedly made by the teen suspect The student in the text message went on to detail how he planned to carry out the school shooting. ""I've got this figured out,"" he wrote. ""I will start in upper b hall, work to lower b halls. I will then so the attendance office c hall. Then e building enter the back the other c hall then finish in the weight rooms."" The other teen in the bizarre and chilling text exchange seemed to know the motivation of the threatened shooter, replying, ""Over freaking nudes? Dude."" Interviewed by KPVI-TV in Pocatello, another student, Isaac Gomez, explained that the student making the threats was angry that school cheerleaders would not share nude pictures of themselves with him. ""Some kid who was having attention problems with some of the like, specifically some of the cheerleaders, didn't get, like, nudes,"" Gomez said. ""He was asking for some inappropriate things."" Highland High School student Isaac Gomez, who described the suspect In the text messages, the teen wrote of his anger at the girls' refusal to show him nude pictures of themselves. ""Because no one will give any to me,"" he wrote. ""Everyone hates me. and I hate [name obscured]. Also I will kill myself after. I hope everyone has a will written."" In other text messages attributed to the teen, he claimed to own ""a 12 gauge shotgun and 9mm pistol I will bring and start killing everyone."" Pocatello/Chubbuck School District No. 25 public relations specialist Shelley Allen said that the school will ""always overprotect"" in cases where potential threats are made against district schools. Whether or not the student actually owned the firearms claimed in the text message exchange, or if they have determined whether he intended to carry out the threats of violence, has not been confirmed by police in Pocatello. But according to a report in the Idaho State Journal newspaper, the same 15-year-old boy used his Twitter account to harass numerous Highland High School students, most of them girls. In another tweet, the teen made threats of violence against United States President Barack Obama, and yet another of his objectionable Twitter posts contained racist language referring to African-Americans. School officials said that the school also received an anonymous phone call on Wednesday as well, but would not say what the content of that phone call might have been. During the Highland High School lockdown, all classroom doors were locked and access in and out of the building was restricted to one set of doors only. The teen suspect was charged with one count of telephone harassment, and one count of making a violent threat against a school. He is being held in a juvenile detention center in the area.

Police in Sacramento said that the U.S. Airman was stabbed numerous times in an attack that took place Wednesday night. A spokesman for U.C. Davis Medical Center said that Stone had been stabbed in the torso three times, and was expected to make a full recovery, ABC 10 reported. While Stone recovers from his injuries, police are on the hunt for two or three Asian males who were seen fleeing the scene of the attack in a 2009 to 2012 dark gray or black Toyota Camry. Authorities say the attack stemmed from a nightclub incident, which spilled out into an altercation near 21st and K Streets. Surveillance video captured the attack and stabbing of Spencer Stone, though police said the footage was too grainy to make out faces. Stone gained fame this summer when he, along with four other men, stopped a gunman who was trying to attack passengers on a train headed from Amsterdam to Paris. Stone rushed the gunman and was stabbed several times in the process, including one slash that nearly took off his thumb, CNN noted. It was Stone who first attacked the gunman, with the other men saying he put himself at the most risk in order to help save the others on the train. ""If anybody would have gotten shot, it would have been Spencer for sure, and we're very lucky that nobody got killed, especially Spencer,"" said Alek Skarlatos. But even after suffering the slash wounds, Stone managed to give aid to another man whose throat was cut. Stone applied pressure to the cut, ultimately saving the man's life.

        Andrew Kaczynski and 
      
        Mark Arce Posted on October 8, 2015, at 5:36 p.m. ET Ben Carson says he is ""very glad"" his comments in the aftermath of the shooting in Oregon about attacking the shooter have started a conversation about the appropriate way to react during a mass shooting. The former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate has been criticized in the past week for telling Fox News that if he had been at the shooting he would have attacked the gunman to prevent him from killing more people. ""Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson said on Fox. ""I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Responding on Wednesday to the controversy over his comments, Carson said he thought the ""sacrifice"" of those in Oregon might be what triggers what he called an ""appropriate response"" next time to prevent less death. ""I'm very glad to be able to inspire a conversation about what people should do when they get in these situations, not a criticism of people who've been in the situation before,"" Carson told radio host Lars Larson. ""In fact, you know, their sacrifice may be the thing that will trigger an appropriate response the next time so that not as many people will be killed."" Carson cited Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers fought back against al-Qaeda hijackers. ""I believe that's the case and remember with, you know, Flight 93 over Pennsylvania. You know, they decided that, you know, if they were going to go down, you know, they were going to go down trying and I believe that if, you know, you don't really see hijacking situations anymore, but if you did see one I think you'd see a lot of passengers get up and attack the person,"" stated Carson. LARS LARSON: You're in the middle of what the media likes to call a controversy, but I didn't think that you're remarks were that controversial. It concerned the shooting at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon about a week ago now as we're doing this interview, in which you were asked, 'what you would've done had you been in that situation' and people I guess have twisted this to say Dr. Carson is criticizing anybody who didn't fight back against this gunman.BEN CARSON: Which is absolutely absurd, but of course that's the world that we live in now. People don't actually listen to what's being said, they look for a way that they can twist it to create controversy and wars between people. And instead of setting up warfare between people we should be using our collective intellect to figure out how do we solve these problems. And I'm very glad to be able to inspire a conversation about what people should do when they get in these situations, not a criticism of people who've been in the situation before. In fact, you know, their sacrifice may be the thing that will trigger an appropriate response the next time so that not as many people will be killed.LL: Well in fact I had the thought as I was seeing this made up controversy, cause I really think it is a made up controversy Doc, because I've had people ask me, 'what would you do' and I would say, 'well, this is what I would do' and they'd say 'are you criticizing someone that doesn't do that?' I say, 'no, you asked me what I would do.' When you said 'I would ask everyone to attack the gunman because he could only shot one of us at a time. That way we don't all wind up dead.' If that comment sticks in the minds in millions of Americans - and your words do seem to stick in minds and we can tell that from the polls - I would imagine that someday that if someone finds themselves in a situation like this they might think, 'this guy can't shoot us all at once. Let's, you know, let's yell at him and all run at him at once but it has to be done quickly.' I think you're words might just save a few lives. BC: I believe that's the case and remember with, you know, Flight 93 over Pennsylvania. You know, they decided that, you know, if they were going to go down, you know, they were going to go down trying and I believe that if, you know, you don't really see hijacking situations anymore, but if you did see one I think you'd see a lot of passengers get up and attack the person.

Regarding ""Ben Carson's advice on mass shooting under scrutiny"" (HoustonChronicle.com, Thursday), Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is taking heat for suggesting that victims, such as those in Oregon, not sit there and get shot but rather do something to keep from being shot. I entirely agree! I am a recently retired teacher from the Houston Independent School District. Right after Columbine happened, I told my students that this practice of shooting students was going to catch on. Someone finally figured out that targets are lined up, unaware and unarmed. I then gave them a quick briefing on what to do called ""In case a nut comes through the door with guns blazing"" drill. I told them what steps they could take to ""lower the body count"" and impressed upon them the need for speed (""You have less than half a second to act and it will be over in 5 seconds!"") For the most part, they listened. Tell it Carson. Tell it! Mike Lopez, Houston  Mental illness Regarding ""The unimaginable keeps happening, and we have to make it stop"" by columnist Lisa Falkenberg, (Page B1, Sunday""), mental health issues play a large part in these shootings. There is a shortage of psychiatrists, mental hospitals, patient beds, programs, you name it. Also, once a person becomes an adult, the parents, family, friends become nearly helpless to intervene. Late teens, early adulthood is often when mental illness shows its ugly head. Therese Perez, Houston  Criminals Lisa Falkenberg makes some valid points as well as many of letters to the editor. One admitted that criminals and gang members are going to get guns anyway, but tighter regulations on guns may stop an unstable person from going postal. However, that accounts for less than 1 percent of gun deaths, yet demands 99 percent of the attention - which isn't very sensible or reasonable. And like another writer said, criminals are attracted to gun-free zones like pedophiles are to playgrounds. Charles Westmoreland, Houston  Driving Regarding ""Unsafe zones"" (Page B6, Wednesday), the letter writer seems to compare deaths caused by automobile crashes to deaths caused by guns. There is one big difference. Cars were not designed to kill people. Guns, especially handguns and automatic weapons, were designed for that sole purpose. If there is any comparison, it should be in the regulation of these two dissimilar items. By law, I must register my car. There are laws which prevent me from allowing under-aged children or my blind father-in-law from driving my car. Yet even though the opening words of the Second Amendment are ""A well-regulated militia...,"" we do hardly anything to regulate these instruments of death. It seems guns will always be with us.

315,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/116264427/0/phoenix/nation~Sympathetic-NoNotoriety-has-a-downside-Our-view/,"On a trip to Hawaii in 2012, Tom and Caren Teves got the call all parents dread. Their son, Alex, had been wounded in a movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colo. They turned on the TV but in the next gut-wrenching hours, despite saturation coverage, they heard nothing about Alex’s fate.  “All we kept seeing was the shooter, the shooter, the shooter,” Caren Teves recalls. Alex, 24, was among the 12 people killed, and since then the Teves have worked to change the way mass shootings are covered. Their advocacy group, No Notoriety, challenges news organizations to limit the use of a shooter’s name and photos and to refrain from publicizing his manifestos or videos. Several TV reporters have jumped on board, including CNN's Anderson Cooper and Fox News' Megyn Kelly. USA TODAY Don’t give killers what they want: Opposing view Voluntary efforts by individual news organizations to avoid glorifying mass murderers are reasonable ways to deny attention to people deranged enough to seek it with guns. Such steps are compassionate gestures to victims' families and, according to experts, might even help prevent future carnage. But the No Notoriety movement and its offspring could do more harm than good if they give public officials an excuse to withhold information, impede investigative reporting on what makes killers tick, or provide the gun lobby with a way to point fingers at the news media in an effort to deflect pressure for common-sense laws. There's no question that mass killers study their predecessors and crave similar notoriety. In a recent study, Arizona State University researchers found “significant evidence that mass killings involving firearms are” contagious. Oregon shooter Chris Mercer-Harper proved the point, writing in a blog post attributed to him about the gunman who shot two journalists on live TV in Roanoke, Va. “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. … Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" The Roanoke killer, in turn, wrote that he was influenced by the racist gunman who killed nine worshipers in Charleston, S.C., in June and wanted to start a race war. Even so, preventing the contagion is not as simple as refraining from repeating a name, airing a photo or publishing a manifesto.  Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz has argued since the 1980s that the problem is cable TV’s “saturation coverage” with its electronic images, color, bleeding bodies and screaming sirens:  “Those are the emotionally arousing aspects” to someone “already alienated from society, blaming some group for his failures, depressed and suicidal who can gain access to weapons.” Some joining #NoNotoriety or similar campaigns forget that last vital point: access to weapons. Grasping at any way to stop what has become almost routine violence, some are shifting blame to the messenger. “Next mass shooting — you are morally complicit,” Rich Orman, one of the prosecutors in the Aurora shooting case, tweeted to a USA TODAY reporter about naming the Oregon shooter. Perhaps people forget the value of the news media's deep dives into the minds, acts and histories of mass killers. Publishing the Unabomber’s manifesto in 1995 helped lead to his capture when the bomber's brother recognized the style of the prose. Investigations into the lives of the Virginia Tech and Charleston shooters uncovered holes in the nation’s gun laws and mental health databases. Last Thursday, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin refused to say the Oregon killer's name on camera. OK. By then it was already out. But what if officials use this movement as an excuse to thwart the public's right to know? What if the idea of not being named becomes somehow alluring to a mentally disturbed mind, as with Harry Potter’s villainous Lord Voldemort, known as He Who Must Not Be Named? The biggest downside of No Notoriety, despite the valid goals of its founders, is if it prompts news organizations to forget the essence of their job: finding facts and reporting them, without fear or favor. Once the news media get caught up in the potential consequences, it will infect everything they cover. It’s laudable for individual news organizations to make subjective decisions to tone down coverage, to refrain from repeating a name ad nauseam or to focus more on the victims — so long as voluntary restraint doesn't cross the line into censorship.

As director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, a founder of the Don’t Name Them campaign, and a researcher of these events, I believe there are three primary reasons that a shooter should only be named a single time, if at all. USA TODAY #NoNotoriety has a downside: Our view We now have empirical evidence that the contagion effect operates in mass shootings. When a mass shooting is widely covered, there’s an increased chance that another mass shooting will occur shortly after the first. This “contagion” effect has been well documented in the suicide literature, and the news media have taken the responsible position of not widely publicizing suicides. Evidence of contagion is clear in the Oregon shooting. The attacker referenced the recent murders of Roanoke, Va., reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward, and the notoriety their killer amassed. Second, one of the principles of situational crime prevention is that if you reduce the reward for committing a crime, you reduce the occurrence of the crime. The Oregon shooter clearly sought recognition. He went so far as to say, “The more people you kill, the more you are in the limelight.” If we know that one motivation for many attackers is a desire for notoriety, why would we give them what they want? Doing so only rewards them for their crime and encourages other potential attackers. The same applies to publishing and distributing their manifestos or videos. Members of the Don’t Name Them and No Notoriety campaigns believe society should not reward criminal behavior in any way. Finally, focusing on the shooter further victimizes the families of those killed. Having to see the shooter over and over is a constant reminder of their loss. Focusing on the shooter also devalues the lives of the victims. We should focus on the victims and heroes. J. Pete Blair, a professor of criminal justice at Texas State University, is director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center.",2015-10-08 18:22:09,Don’t give killers what they want: Opposing view,murders and attempted murders,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

One self-described ""gun lover"" by the name of Mark Carman has made a major impression online after releasing an 11-minute message aimed at his fellow ""responsible gun owners."" Carman is hardly someone who identifies on the liberal side of the political spectrum. A self-described Evangelical Christian Republican (who was also a 2015 Grammy award nominee as a Christian music producer), Carman nonetheless felt compelled to speak out in the wake of the recent shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College.  In a clip posted both on his Facebook page and YouTube channel, Carman begins by holding a loaded gun up to the camera, asking the viewer if they are familiar with just what the weapon is. He goes on to say that he both owns and likes that particular gun, yet if he wanted to sell it to you, he could legally do so without any kind of background check. In fact, according to Carman, the transaction could legally take place between he and a total stranger while standing on his front porch. Carman goes on to say that we as a nation have a problem on our hands when it comes to gun ownership. Pointing out that he both loves firearms and is trained in their safe use (Carman was formerly a police officer in Norfolk, Virginia, as the Daily Press points out), he nonetheless asserts that policies need to be put into place to keep guns out of the hands of ""people who shouldn't have them.""

Carman advocates in the video for better screening policies and expresses his belief that firearms sales conducted without a background check should be made illegal. He directly references the double standard that forces brick-and-mortar gun stores to conduct background checks, while private sales aren't subject to such regulation. As Reverb Press points out, buying guns online or at gun shows are also effective methods for circumventing background checks in most states. The Simple Solution To Gun Violence?

Comparing gun ownership to car and plane operation, Carman suggests that not only licensing requirements, but also written and practical tests used to prove competence should be implemented, and perhaps even required on an ongoing basis. Carman also tackles arguments advanced by some who wish to prevent government representatives from knowing they own a firearm. If you have a membership at a gun range, a hunting license, or a concealed weapons permit, Carman points out that federal and state authorities almost certainly already know that you are a gun owner.

In his video, however, Carman challenges others who see themselves as responsible gun owners to consider their opinions toward legal safeguards surrounding firearms. ""If you're a responsible gun owner, why WOULDN'T you want some safeguards in place?"" In the finale of his video, Carman points out that no legislation will be able to stop every mass shooting or act of terror. He challenges the assertion, however, that such legislation would be without a point or justification. ""We're not going to be able to stop people from killing people. But we can surely slow them down from killing people with firearms."" After the video was posted, it quickly went viral on Facebook.

The four, all students at Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif., “were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible at the campus,” Sheriff James W. Mele of Tuolumne County said at a news conference on Saturday. Sheriff Mele did not identify the students other than to say all were male juveniles. Tuolumne is about 120 miles east of San Francisco. Investigators have found no clear motive for the planned attack, Sheriff Mele said, but he said that “the suspects’ plans were very detailed in nature and included names of would-be victims, locations and methods in which the plan was to be carried out.” The students planned to open fire during an event at school, he said, and “were in the process of trying to obtain these weapons.” Officials said the plot was foiled on Wednesday when a group of students alerted a teacher after they overheard three of the four discussing a plan to open fire on the school. The teacher immediately told school administrators, who quickly removed the three from their classrooms and called the police, said Robert Griffith, the superintendent of the Summerville Union High School District. Sheriff Mele said the fourth suspect had been identified during the investigation. “Within two to three minutes, those administrators got up out of their seat, recognizing the severity of the information that they received, and were in the classroom pulling those students out,” Mr. Griffith said at the news conference. An “immediate” search of the students’ lockers by administrators turned up no weapons, Mr. Griffith said, “so within a very, very short period of time we knew that we did not have an immediate threat to safety.” Nevertheless, Sheriff Mele said the plot had been “pretty doggone close” to fruition. The investigation has so far been based on interviews with the suspects, during which they gave a detailed confession, Sheriff Mele said. The police executed two search warrants and seized the suspects’ electronic devices, he said, but have not yet analyzed their contents. The students were ordered to leave the school that day, and their parents were notified and are cooperating in the investigation, he said. He praised the parents for their help during “a very trying time” for their families and called their assistance “a key element” in foiling the plot. None of the suspects were allowed to return to school between their removal Wednesday afternoon and their arrest on Friday, Mr. Griffith said. The parents of students whose names appeared on a list of targets have not yet been notified, Sheriff Mele said. The four suspects were taken into custody at their homes and transported to the Tuolumne County Probation Department, and then to a juvenile detention center in another county, he said. Eric Hovatter, an assistant district attorney, said his office would file charges based on evidence from the investigation. “It is clear from past history such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against students and teachers on school grounds,” Mr. Hovatter said. “While it is easy to say that could never happen in Tuolomne County, the public and local law enforcement must remain vigilant, as they did here.” “That the suspects are young does not minimize the gravity of the conduct nor the potential for great harm to many innocent people,” he added.

Guns http://fus.in/1ZfVjki Copied to clipboard Senate Democrats are poised to introduce a sweeping set of gun reforms on Thursday, and they’re ready to fight for it, too. The package includes elements of several other failed gun reform efforts, like a proposal to close the loophole that allows people purchasing firearms from private sellers or gun show vendors to skirt background check requirements and another to extend the window of time the F.B.I. has to conduct a background check before the purchaser is approved by default. (Under current law, if the background check takes longer than three days, the sale is automatically allowed to proceed. This loophole is what allowed Charleston shooter Dylann Roof to legally obtain a gun.) The bill is kind of the policy equivalent of Frankenstein’s monster, if Frankenstein’s monster was actually really good, and people really liked it, and it also had the capacity to prevent gun deaths every year. That’s the good news. The bad news is that this sensible reform package—provisions on gun safety that the overwhelming majority of American people, including gun owners, support—is utterly and unmistakably doomed. It stands little to no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. It stands even less of a chance of being taken up by the House, where the Republican majority is even stronger. Senate Democrats know this, and are pushing ahead anyway. “I’ve started to reach out to senators and talk about what can be done to advance the cause of background checks while Republicans are in charge for the next year or so,” Minority Leader Harry Reid said earlier this week. “But one thing is clear. To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as puppets of the N.R.A.” Though passing reform doesn’t seem politically possible in this Congress, Democrats are intent on getting their Republican colleagues on the record as opposing basic gun safety provisions that their constituents support. They have also indicated that they will block votes on other bills until the Senate takes up the reform package. It’s spectacle. It’s not going to help the bill pass. And it’s exactly what proponents of gun reform should be doing. The last time lawmakers collectively dedicated this kind of energy to gun safety was in 2013, after Adam Lanza brought four of the firearms from his 11 gun arsenal to Sandy Hook Elementary and murdered 20 children and six adults. As the country reeled from such incomprehensible violence, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers—led by Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Patrick Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania—introduced a modest package of reforms that reflected, at least in part, what a majority of Americans wanted to see happen in the wake of the massacre. One of the key elements of that package was the expansion of background checks, which is also a central component of the new proposal. Here’s how a majority of Americans, including gun-owners, felt about strengthening that system in 2013, according to a survey from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research:  The basics: 88.8% of Americans supported universal background checks, including 84.3% of gun owners and 73.7% of registered members of the NRA. A staggering level of consensus. But the bill still failed. Two years later, Johns Hopkins revisited these survey questions to take the national temperature at a moment when the public wasn’t as close to a mass shooting of that scale. (Those moments, however, seem increasingly hard to come by.) Researchers found essentially the same results. The 2015 data revealed that 83.7% of people supported universal background checks, including 84.7% of gun owners. That’s where we are today, with Democrats poised to fight for a package of bills that stand basically no chance of passing despite long-standing public consensus on the issue. On one side, there stands an overwhelming majority of the American public, including the rising number of families who have lost loved ones because our gun laws allow for easy, ready access to deadly weapons. On the other side, there are others, a great many Republicans in Congress, who—in the face of nine deaths in Oregon, two deaths in Virginia, nine deaths in South Carolina—continue to shrug their shoulders and do nothing. So far, “do nothing” has won. Democrats seem ready to do something, even if that something is a symbolic gesture to keep opponents of gun reform from looking the other way as the public tells them they want to live in a less deadly country.

Education http://fus.in/1OLWuV1 Copied to clipboard A judge has sentenced a former Virginia Tech student to a year in jail for a Yik Yak post that appeared to warn of a mass shooting. Tonia Moxley of the Roanoke Times reports that Kiung “Eddie” Moon admitted that he posted “…Another 4.16 moment is going to happen tomorrow. Just a warning” on the popular social networking service in April. Moon, 22, was apparently referring to April 16, 2007, the date of the Virginia Tech shooting that left 33 dead and more than a dozen wounded. It was the deadliest lone-gunman mass shooting in U.S. history Moxley writes that Moon blamed the posting “on smoking too much marijuana to calm his nerves before final exams,” and that “his memory of the posting was hazy.” He turned himself in to police after receiving emails about it, Moxley writes. Yik Yak retains the right to share information about posters’ information with law enforcement when necessary. In exchange for a plea agreement, Moon received a suspended sentence and will only serve one month in jail. Last month, a Florida college student was expelled over a Yik Yak post for posting similar language about a threat that the student said had been misinterpreted. Last fall, 11 different students were charged with making threats on Yik Yak. The trend has led to a wave of Yik Yak bans (or attempts at such) on college campuses. In a New York Times piece last year, the app’s founders said they were unprepared for the app to be used in this way, and that they now add filters so that certain keywords, like “Jewish,” or “bomb,” prompt this message: “Pump the brakes, this yak may contain threatening language.

Earlier this year, Texas passed its own “campus carry” law despite opposition from University of Texas Chancellor William McRaven, former leader of the U.S. Special Operations Command who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. (Yeah, he did that.) Texas now joins other states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Oregon (!), which are forcing colleges to allow concealed handguns on campus to varying degrees. In the wake of school shootings like the one in Roseburg, OR, it’s tempting to think that a “good samaritan” with a gun could prevent loss of life, but there’s not exactly a precedent yet for armed civilians stopping a mass shooting. There have been, however, an incomprehensible number of deaths from gunfire. It seems likely that the number of accidents, suicides, and heat-of-the-moment shootings would quickly eclipse the number of lives saved by armed college students.

Guns http://fus.in/1iQWS71 Copied to clipboard Following Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, which left the gunman and nine others dead and more injured, the country met Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin, most notably as he refused to mention the shooter by name so as to not sensationalize him. Two years ago, Hanlin gained some attention for a different reason: In 2013, weeks after the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut, Hanlin was one of hundreds of sheriffs around the country to write the White House and urge them to avoid new gun control legislation. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote at the time. You can read his full letter below:  Last night, President Obama told assembled reporters at the White House that the country needed “common sense” legislation for guns because “our thoughts and prayers are not enough.” Of course, if Congress and elected representatives in state legislatures paid attention to what their constituents wanted, these laws might already be on the books.

Army veteran Chris Mintz is being hailed as a hero after protecting fellow students during the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. According to family members, Mintz was shot multiple times while trying to prevent the gunman from gaining access to his classroom. ""He was on the wrestling team and he's done cage-fighting, so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically,"" an aunt told NBC News. Mintz, 30, is recovering from his injuries in the hospital and is expected to survive. Thursday was reportedly his fourth day of classes at the school after serving in the Army for 10 years. A status update was posted to his Facebook account Friday morning which said, “This is Chris's friend, Chris asked me to thank everyone for their support, he is grateful and keeping our community and all victims in his thoughts.” Story by Tony Manfred, editing by Stephen Parkhurst Follow INSIDER: On Facebook  ",2015-10-02 11:08:00,An Army veteran was shot multiple times protecting others students from the Oregon gunman,"education and schools,computers and the internet,medicine and health,colleges and universities",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

The gunman, identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, is also dead, according to NBC's Peter Williams. While little was known about the gunman as of early Thursday evening, reports were starting to come in from bystanders who witnessed the attack. One such account is particularly disturbing. Kortney Moore, an 18-year-old student at Umpqua Community College, told Oregon newspaper The News-Review that she was in her Writing 115 class when the attack began. After the shooter shot her teacher in the head from outside the window, he entered the classroom and told people to get on the ground, she said. The shooter then demanded that people stand up and state their religion, Moore told The News-Review. After doing so, he started firing.

414,http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/guns_are_cuddly_security_blankets_how_the_media_helps_right_wing_gun_nuts_push_propaganda/,"Conservative politicians and pundits lie and distort far more than liberals do. At the same time, conservatives have a well-known persecution complex, frequently accusing the mainstream media of having some secret anti-conservative agenda. This puts mainstream media fact-checkers in an unenviable situation, trying to seem balanced in an environment where one side simply has more enthusiasm for lying than the other. Now the pressure to overemphasis or even exaggerate claims of liberal mendacity, in an attempt to seem more balanced, has infected Glenn Kessler's coverage of the gun debate in the Washington Post. Our tale begins with a speech by President Obama where he said, ""We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don’t work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence."" This is, as Kessler's investigation demonstrated, a true statement. The statistics are complicated by demographic and social factors, but overall, the data shows a direct correlation between how easy it is to get a gun and how many people die from gunshot wounds. But Kessler gave Obama two ""Pinocchios""---out of of four Pinocchio scale---to this claim. ""Many readers requested a fact check of this statement, believing it to be untrue,"" Kessler writes. I'll bet they did! Conservative fetishization of guns is at a point where even suggesting that guns might be unsafe is treated like you're insulting their mother, so of course they're going to be outraged that Obama dare suggest that objects created for the sole purpose of killing might be very good at making people dead. It's understandable that, deluged by all that conservative outrage, one might give into the urge to show that you're not biased by giving them what they want. But unfortunately, Kessler, despite being a fact-checker, ends up heavily massaging the statistics to give conservative readers those Pinocchios they desperately want. To get to the conclusion that Obama fudged the facts, Kessler starts by manipulating the data that Obama used for his claim, by removing suicides from the number of overall gun deaths. He justifies this by arguing ""the president’s policy proposals are aimed at mass shootings, not suicides."" But that is, in and of itself, a false statement. While Obama did focus heavily on mass shooting in his speech, it's clear that he was making a larger point about how the proliferation of guns in our society leads to more gun deaths. ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" Obama said right before the sentences in question. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?"" It's clear that he was speaking about how a gun-fanatical society is one where people get shot to death a lot, and not just in the context of mass shootings. In addition, while the president's proposed policy agenda on gun violence focuses heavily on preventing murder, many of the policies are about preventing gun deaths generally, including those from suicide. The White House policy proposal for reducing gun violence repeatedly mentions suicide. Many of the agenda items, including more funding for research and better mental health services, would have suicide prevention benefits as well as murder prevention benefits. There's no reason to exclude suicides from the gun death count, except to pander to opponents of gun control. For one thing, suicides are just as dead as people who are murdered. Suicide has major effects on families and communities. Plus, the gun suicide and gun murder rate are heavily intertwined. Laws aimed at reducing gun murders appear to lower the suicide rate. It's a myth that suicidal people will kill themselves no matter what. Most people who attempt it and survive don't try again. Easy access to guns makes suicide more likely because it means you're more likely to die than people who try through other, less deadly means. But what makes Kessler's article particularly frustrating is that all this quibbling over a couple of outlier states that defy the trend or whether or not suicides ""count"" ends up serving not the truth, but the Big Lie about guns: That they are not only safe, but that they somehow make people safer. Conservatives want to distract from the larger fact that soaking a society in guns means people are going to use them more, whether on themselves or on other people. So they claim, instead, that guns actually induce safety and if people keep getting shot, it's because they don't have enough items with which to shoot people with. The Big Lie is everywhere in the wake of this most recent shooting in Oregon. This week, Ben Carson argued that putting guns inside kindergarten classrooms is the best way to protect small children from guns. ""Gun-free zones"" are being blamed for the shooting all over conservative media. The message from the right is clear: Far from being deadly weapons, guns are cuddly security blankets! The Big Lie is what Obama was calling out in his speech. Conservatives keep pushing this notion that guns keep you safe, and Obama was, well, fact-checking them. Kessler should be applauding him for that instead of pandering to conservatives who want to deflect attention from the larger argument about  the irrational enthusiasm some Americans have for arming themselves like they're the about to face the zombie apocalypse. All of which is why two eyebrows should be raised at the eagerness for conservatives to exclude suicides from the gun death rate. Of course they do, because, in a lot of ways, suicides prove exactly how dangerous it is to cultivate a gun-nut society. Take, for instance, the debate over gun-free zones on campus. Conservatives like to argue that allowing guns on campus will keep students safer, on the grounds that there might be someone around to stop a mass shooter in his tracks. Even if that were true---and there's no reason to think it is---it doesn't actually follow that stuffing college campuses, which are full of young people and alcohol, with guns is a great idea. Most gun deaths are, after all, the result of accidents, suicides, or interpersonal crime, not mass murder.  Suicide rates for college-aged men are particularly high, in part because they have so much access to guns. Giving them more is not going to help. Look, conservatives are going to deflect, quibble, and use ""liberal media"" accusations to try to distort coverage of major issues like gun control. It's understandable to feel temptation to throw them a bone, even if you have to massage the facts, in hopes that they will shut up. But fact-checking ceases to be fact-checking when it's in service of distorting the truth instead of illuminating it.

Trump's comments came less than 24 hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday -- an incident that prompted President Obama to give an impassioned speech calling once again for tighter gun control legislation. Appearing via phone on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Trump offered a different perspective when asked what he'd do to prevent mass shootings if he were elected to the White House. The billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino magnate said the country already has ""very strong laws on the books."" ""But you're always going to have problems,"" said Trump, who is leading his 14 rivals for the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- in the polls. ""We have millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world. And it does happen all over the world."" MORE: N.J.'s House Democrats: Protect Americans from gun violence Trump -- who released a policy paper last month calling for the expansion of rights for legal gun owners -- noted that school shootings are ""unique to this country."" And he blamed mental illness for the issue. In his paper, Trump advocates for better programs to treat mental illness, though he doesn't specify how. ""It is a terrible situation,"" the real estate mogul and former reality television host told MSNBC on Friday. ""It's huge mental illness. You're going to have these things happen. And it's a horrible thing to behold."" Host Willie Geist asked Trump is it's ""fair to say"" his opinion is that ""some people are going to slip through the cracks, and there's nothing you can do about it."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty, it would be, for the next million years,"" Trump replied. ""People are going to slip through the cracks. Even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks."" Trump noted that many shooters in mass killings are ""loners"" and ""have all sorts of difficulties."" ""There are many people like that,"" he said. ""What are you gonna do, institutionalize everybody?"" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is shown on the campaign trail. Trump was one of a few Republican presidential candidates Friday who said that despite yet another mass shooting, tougher gun laws are not the answer. Speaking in Iowa, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said ""you're not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal law-abiding citizens. ""It doesn't work for crazies,"" Carson said. Speaking in South Carolina -- the site of the Charleston church shooting this summer -- former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said ""before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have."" Fiorina -- who was an executive at Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill before her time at HP -- also said President Obama's remarks after the shooting were ""premature at best and at worst a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy."" Obama made his comments hours after the shooting Thursday. ""Somehow, this has become routine,"" the Democratic president told reporters during  a news conference at the White House. ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine ... we've become numb to this."" ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' Well, this is something we should politicize,"" he added. It was the 11th time during Obama's seven years as president that he delivered a speech in the wake of a mass shooting in America. A 2014 report by the FBI found that even though homicides have dropped overall in the U.S., mass shootings have risen drastically over the last seven years. And research by Harvard University scholars shows that a mass shooting has occurred every 64 days on average in America since 2011. Christie, who was in Cape May County preparing for the possibility of Hurricane Joaquin hitting New Jersey, did not issue a statement Friday about the shooting.

Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters that the 20-year-old college student was “neutralized.” The suspect, who was not named, also appears to have had a conversation online about the attack last night. According to CNN: The suspect was a 20-year-old man, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. Investigators are examining social media postings they believe were made by the suspect, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. “We arrived to find multiple patients in multiple classrooms. Law enforcement was on scene and had the shooter neutralized,” Douglas County Fire Marshal Ray Shoufler told CNN. He said that two patients died while being transported to a hospital. The shooting appears to have started in one building before the gunman moved to the school’s science building, the source told CNN. Those killed and wounded were found in at least two classrooms. This is a developing story. ————– UPDATED: Thursday, October 1, 2015 3:00 PM EST The shooter has been taken into custody, a Douglas County commissioner confirmed to CNN. The number of deceased has been decreased to seven to 10, Oregon State Police Lt. Bill Fugate told KATU-TV. ————– UPDATED: Thursday, October 1, 2015 2:35 PM EST According to multiple media sites citing Oregon State Police, 15 people are now reported dead in the Oregon community college shooting.

419,http://www.salon.com/2015/10/08/fox_news_sick_capitulation_to_mass_murderers_making_gun_violence_the_new_normal/,"Sometime between the Sandy Hook massacre and the most recent mass shooting in Oregon, Americans crossed a threshold from having a relatively focused eye on sensible gun control laws to summarily rejecting anything short of an expansion of gun rights. Rather than being repulsed by military-style assault weapons in the wake of mass shootings, firearms like the AR-15, the Sandy Hook weapon of choice, are sold in record numbers. Lawmakers and gun store owners alike have routinely held AR-15 giveaways after Sandy Hook -- contests that are just about as tasteless as giving away box cutters and one-way airline tickets in the aftermath of 9/11. The sole NRA-sanctioned measure to ameliorate gun violence is to simply invent new and ludicrous ways to fight back. The upshot is that we need to learn to live with mass shootings. Instead of making a serious effort to keep firearms out of the hands of would-be killers, the NRA and the gun lobby are happy to market guns to school districts for arming teachers, and to condition students to accept the potential for massacres. It's the new arms race, and it's happening exclusively inside the United States. Tell me if this sounds familiar: instead of reducing the number of available guns, the so-called ""good guys"" are being instructed to stockpile more firearms to out-gun the ""bad guys."" Where does this escalation lead? More gun sales, of course. If it sounds like the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States, it should. Furthermore, in schools and college campuses, students are participating in gun massacre drills. Our kids are being instructed how to shield themselves in case of an active shooter scenario and, really, they should just go ahead and name the drills ""Duck and Cover."" We'll circle back to this shortly. Meanwhile, the giggling couch tumors on ""Fox & Friends"" defended Dr. Ben Carson's latest remarks on the Oregon massacre. The presidential candidate and neurosurgeon told the Fox News morning show hosts, ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'"" Nice that Dr. Carson is so steady-under-fire than all those dead college students, not to mention the Sandy Hook kids, or those Virginia journalists. Good for him. While defending Carson's indefensible statement, Elisabeth Hasselbeck went off on a rant: But this is a man who spent 40 years plus bringing people back to life, giving people a chance at life. And the mainstream media wants to now mischaracterize him as someone who is dancing on graves. That's unfair, it's incorrect, and it's irresponsible. Well, Carson tried to one-up dead college students. He might not be literally dancing on graves, but he's certainly grandstanding on them. Nevertheless, here was the salient quote from the show: It's completely irresponsible to do this man whose life mission has been to give life and who is simply answering a question, which, by the way, a bunch of universities are now training their students to deal with mass shootings, potential mass shootings, as a hazard such as a tornado, a hurricane, a mass flood. They're actually training students to deal with situations particularly in the way that Dr. Ben Carson stated here. He wasn't saying that the victims there didn't do enough to defend themselves.  Yes, we've become so utterly spineless about controlling the sale of deadly firearms, we have no choice but accept gun massacres and to prepare for them like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. There's something profound about treating gun massacres like natural disasters. We're basically admitting that massacres are unpreventable, just like natural disasters -- even though there are numerous measures we could immediately take to prevent them but which the gun lobby will never allow. So, whatever. Deal with it, America. If anything represents our collective torpor on guns, it's this. Rather than seizing the initiative away from the for-profit gun industry by taking a hardline posture on guns, Republicans and Democrats alike appear to be satisfied with doing nothing and hoping that ""Duck And Cover"" drills will result in fewer mass shooting deaths. Hell, at least during the nuclear arms race there were treaties signed that curbed testing and proliferation. On guns, however, even incremental federal laws are unheard of. It's also important to note that some experts believe active shooter drills are generally ineffective. ""There ends up being zero learning going on because everyone is upset that you've scared the crap out of them,"" said Greg Crane, a former SWAT officer with the North Richland Hills Police Department near Dallas who holds seminars to teach civilians different strategies to deal with mass-shooting scenarios. The new normal on firearms is resignation and capitulation, while the crisis has grown so severe that we're treating massacres like hurricanes and, yes, preparedness for a nuclear attack. We're being convinced that we have no choice but to prepare our children for massacres that we, as adults, are too chicken-shit to have resolved before the bullets started flying. Why? Because the NRA is committed to selling millions of deadly consumer products to phallically-challenged bro-scholars who think they know something about constitutional law. Consequently, we're faced with man-made disasters on the magnitude of natural ones that, unlike tornadoes, could've been mostly prevented. Seriously, anyone marketing in this nonsense, especially Ben Carson and ""Fox & Friends,"" ought to be ashamed of themselves. Bob Cesca is a regular contributor to Salon.

420,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/obama-rebukes-bush-on-stuff-happens-reaction-to-oregon-shootings.html?ref=first-draft&_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by The Candidates By Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — Jeb Bush drew a sharp rebuke from President Obama on Friday after the Republican presidential candidate shrugged off any need for government action in the wake of the massacre of nine people at a community college in Oregon. “Look, stuff happens,” Mr. Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, said at a campaign event in South Carolina. “There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not always the right thing to do.” Mr. Obama, who in remarks the night before had denounced Congress and the entire American political system for what he called its numbness to repeated gun massacres, responded: “The American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting. They can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happens.’ ” The exchange between Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush reflected the paralysis that has settled over the issue of new gun control legislation in the United States. Virtually no member of Congress issued a statement after the Oregon shootings arguing for or against new gun control measures, and a number of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates were dismissive of new gun control measures as well. After Mr. Obama failed to get Congress to pass even modest gun control legislation after a 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., killed 20 schoolchildren, the president has put more energy into legislation where he can find common ground with Republicans. As a result, gun control advocates have for now given up on a nationwide universal background check system or other changes to gun regulations and are instead pushing for tougher gun laws in state legislatures. In the state of Washington, a ballot initiative imposed universal background checks over a recalcitrant legislature. In Oregon, the legislature also passed background checks, which went into effect several months ago. transcript na Reacting to the Oregon shootings on Friday, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican presidential candidate, said that “you can strip all the guns away but the people who are going to commit crimes or have problems are always going to have the gun.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican candidate, said there is too much focus “on what people are using to commit violence.” The Democratic presidential candidates sought to offer a sharp contrast. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has called for a renewed effort to pass universal background checks and other gun measures, posted on Twitter: “What is wrong with us that we can’t stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another Democratic presidential candidate, said that “we’ve got to do something,” although he added: “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.” Bush campaign officials, even before Mr. Obama’s rebuke, insisted that people were unfairly seizing on only part of the candidate’s comments. “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context,” said Allie Brandenburger, a campaign spokeswoman. In response to a question about whether more prayer in schools might help reduce tragedies like the shooting in Oregon, Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, said in entirety: “Yeah it’s a — we’re in a difficult time in our country, and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It’s just, it’s very sad to see. But I resist the notion, I had this challenge as governor, because, look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” Although Mr. Bush did not say explicitly there was no need for new gun control legislation, it was implicit in his message. A selection of President Obama’s comments after mass shootings. In comments made before Mr. Obama spoke, he also said he had not made a mistake in his initial comments: “Things happen all the time. Things. Is that better?” Mr. Obama ordered flags at the White House on Friday to half-staff to honor the victims of the shooting. “When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer,” he said on Thursday night as early reports of the dead and injured in Oregon reached the White House. “When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.” Gun control advocates continued to say they have given up on Congress, which has more pro-gun lawmakers now than at the time of the Newtown massacre. “We almost have to act as if Congress doesn’t exist,” Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the retiring mayor of Baltimore, said in an interview Friday. “I don’t know if Congress is numb or just has a conviction to inaction on this issue.” Ms. Rawlings-Blake, who will lead a discussion about the gun violence issue at a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors this weekend, said a national effort to confront the spread of guns would be preferable, because states with lax gun laws affect those with tougher ones. This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. “We have one gun shop in this city,” she said, blaming the surge in violence in Baltimore in part on a flow of guns from outside the borders of Maryland. “We know that the I-95 corridor is responsible for the tracking of illegal guns up and down the East Coast.” John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded in part by the former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, compared the push for new gun laws to the successful fight for marriage equality, which progressed first in the states before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in June. “The arc for success here is just like the arc for marriage equality,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “I think people are actually angry. If Washington chooses to do nothing, the rest of the country is not waiting around.” Polling suggests that the country remains divided on the question of the need for more gun control, even if that tide is slowly shifting in favor of regulation. An August report on guns in the United States by the Pew Research Center found that 50 percent of Americans thought it was more important to control gun ownership, while 47 percent thought protecting the right to own guns should be a priority. Opinions are split deeply along partisan lines, with nearly three-fourths of Democrats favoring gun control and 71 percent of Republicans saying gun rights are most important. The study found, however, that there was broad support for expanding background checks for private gun sales and for legislation preventing the mentally ill from buying guns among people who want gun ownership rights.

422,https://www.bustle.com/articles/115351-bernie-sanders-gun-control-stance-might-hurt-him-in-the-first-democratic-debate,"News  As the nation grows closer to the first Democratic primary debate, some experts are beginning to wonder whether Bernie Sanders' gun control stance might hurt him. Until now, his moderate stance on gun control and gun rights has mostly flown under the radar, given the candidate's reputation for being extremely progressive. But in the wake of the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Sanders' voting history in terms of gun control has come back to haunt him. To be clear, Sanders is not pro-gun. But he isn't anti-gun, either. Instead, he's caught in a strange political limbo: someone who believes in gun rights, but also desires gun law reform. And it makes sense, considering that Sanders hails from Vermont, a state where recreational hunting is popular. And the pro-gun community has been good to him. While seeking a position in Congress in 1990, Sanders was actually endorsed by the NRA as ""more honorable choice for Vermont sportsmen"" than his competitor. And his voting record has shown a sensitivity to gun rights and gun manufacturers as well. Many critics of his stance point to his voting record from the 1990s, in which he voted against the Brady Bill, which would have expanded background checks. In 2005, he voted in favor of a bill that barred individuals from lodging lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Hillary Clinton, his main challenger, voted against it. But he also has a substantial record of voting in favor of reform, such as in 1994 when he supported banning assault weapons, and in 2013 when he reversed his earlier vote and supported a bill that would expand background checks. But when compared to the other Democratic candidates, Sanders is not even close to being the most progressive on the matter. ""We need a comprehensive approach. We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them,"" said a statement released by Sanders' campaign following the Oregon shooting. ""We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help they need when they need it. We also have to tone down the incredibly high level of gratuitous violence which permeates our media."" On the far left of Sanders are Clinton and Martin O'Malley, who both have strong gun control records, and have made reform key issues within their campaigns. Following the shooting, O'Malley announced his desire for efforts such as banning assault weapons, utilizing finger print records, and making gun trafficking a federal crime. During town hall meetings, O'Malley reiterated his success as mayor of Baltimore at cracking down on gun violence, while calling on Clinton and Sanders to support his initiatives. On Monday, Clinton released a comprehensive policy plan for gun control that would include repealing the 2005 bill that Sanders supported, as well as closing the gun show background check loophole. And like O'Malley, her previous history gives her credibility â as a senator, Clinton co-sponsored legislation aimed toward combating the gun show loophole. The candidates will meet on stage in Nevada on Oct. 13 for the first time to debate, and gun control will almost definitely be main subject. O'Malley and Clinton are prepared and ready to discuss their backgrounds, as well as what they would do as president. But Sanders is likely to avoid engaging, and will reiterate his desire for ""sensible gun control."" In other venues, this tactic may work for Sanders and appeal to voters. But with emotions still running high following last week's shooting, it may spell bad news for Sanders. He's a candidate who favors facts and figures. But unfortunately for Sanders, the facts show that he's not the most progressive when it comes to gun control. And voters might not be willing to compromise this time.

424,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/04/fact-checking-the-sunday-shows-october-4.html,"SEARCH Trump was challenged on Syrian migrants and Mark Kelly was questioned about a dated gun statistic. By Joshua Gillin, Linda Qiu and Katie Sanders Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump defended his change in position on accepting refugees from Syria on Sunday, saying he has concerns about how many able-bodied men seem to be fleeing the war-torn nation. “The migration was strange to me, because it seems like so many men,” Trump said on ABC’s This Week. “There aren’t that many women, there aren’t that many children. It looked like mostly men, and they looked like strong men.” Host George Stephanopoulos interjected, saying “half the refugees are children.” But Trump went on to say the admission of thousands of men arriving without documentation “could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse.” Trump, whose campaign did not respond for comment, is conflating his talking point over a couple of different issues and refugee populations. We rate the statement False. Stephanopoulos was asking him about his changed position on Syrian refugees who would be coming to the United States. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees counts a total of more than 4 million Syrian refugees, and of those 4 million, 50.3 percent are female, and 51.1 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. In all, only 23.5 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the UN were men older than 18. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, says Trump’s anecdote may have been referring to Europe’s mass influx of refugees and migrants, not the registered refugees in camps that Stephanopoulos was asking about. Trump likely meant so-called “sea arrivals,” refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The UN counts almost 534,000 people who have crossed into Europe this year, with almost 3,000 dying during the journey. To Trump’s point, 69 percent of sea arrivals are men, and these are the people dominating headlines about the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Slightly more than half of them are from Syria, and many are undocumented. But the problem with Trump’s statement is that none of the majority-male refugees and migrants in Europe are coming to the United States. The UN has said 10 percent, or about 400,000, of the Syrian refugees in camps need to be resettled. President Barack Obama announced that in fiscal year 2016 (through September 30), the United States would accept at least 10,000 refugees from Syria. Those 10,000 aren’t necessarily the type of people who would be ISIS operatives as Trump fears, according to Mock. “The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,” Mock said. The people selected undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the process can take years. Outdated gun statistic As the country grapples with Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college, retired astronaut Mark Kelly is continuing his charge for stricter gun control. Kelly is married to former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), who was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson that left 10 others dead. Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control. ""One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check,"" Kelly said during CNN’s State of the Union. Kelly’s statistic isn’t as clear as it sounds. We rate it Half True. The claim about lax background checks is based on a 1994 survey by Duke University’s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago’s Jens Ludwig. The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases from licensed dealers, was enacted. There’s debate on whether a 21-year-old statistic still holds up today. Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check. Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is ""notoriously slippery,"" as gun sales that don’t go through a federally licensed seller are not subject to formal recordkeeping.

425,http://www.ibtimes.com/barack-obama-umpqua-cc-speech-full-text-read-presidents-oregon-shooting-statement-2124082,"President Barack Obama delivered a news conference from the White House, voicing anger and sadness as he responded to a massacre on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, that left at least 10 people dead. The gunman, identified by police as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, injured several others before being killed by police. He reportedly was not a student of the school. In the president's speech, Obama called for Americans to push their elected officials to act to prevent gun violence. He also tasked the media with creating graphics comparing the number of gun-related deaths to the number of terrorism-related deaths. He noted that gun-related deaths were vastly more common, yet terrorism deaths received more attention.  See his full remarks here: There’s been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever. That means there’s another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children. I’ve been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there. I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today. Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we’ve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need. In the coming days, we’ll learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.  And America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love. But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.  It’s not enough.  It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.  And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.  But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, “The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.”  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day!  Somehow this has become routine.  The reporting is routine.  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.  The conversation in the aftermath of it.  We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they’ll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country -- they know that's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America. So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize.  It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.  I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.  This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.  We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.  And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.  How can that be? This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.  We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.  When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer.  When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer.  When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities.  We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.  So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn’t make sense. So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.  And that will require a change of politics on this issue.  And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.  If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you. And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up.  Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws.  And this is not something I can do by myself.  I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances.  But based on my experience as President, I can't guarantee that.  And that's terrible to say.  And it can change. May God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back. And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.",2015-10-01 23:17:44,Barack Obama Umpqua CC Speech Full Text: Read President's Oregon Shooting Statement ,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/
426,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obama-putin-congress-gun-control-214399,"White House In a freewheeling news conference, the president smacks down Putin, Congress and gun control opponents. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 10/02/2015 08:34 PM EDT AP Photo It’s not just the fourth quarter. It’s trash talk time. President Barack Obama’s never done a good job hiding his disdain for the people he doesn’t like—a long list that includes reporters, Republicans, pretty much every member of Congress, the foreign leaders he considers petty and childish (Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyanu most of all). Everyone would see things his way, he tends to project, if only they were a little smarter and thought it through as thoroughly as he has. Usually when he’s explaining why the world’s wrong and he’s right, he’s looking down his nose and drily lecturing, getting deep into wonky policy explications that leave even his staff yawning and too confused or bored to explain. On Friday afternoon in the State Dining Room, at a wide-ranging press conference, he was just having a good time. He showed up ready to mock, with an unimpressed, exaggerated upside down smile just one right cheek mole short of a Robert DeNiro impression. The smile popped up again and again, as he swept his hand to dismiss questions, cutting off one reporter reciting criticism of him versus Putin with a wrap-it-up finger motion and saying, “I get it,” then sneering through a takedown that ended with him taking a beat like he’d been training at the Friar’s Club: “So – what was the question again?” On Jeb Bush's dismissal of a school shooting in Oregon as “stuff happens"": “I don’t even think I need to react to that one.'' On the upcoming fight with Congress over the debt ceiling, with a laugh: “I’m sure the speaker’s race complicates these negotiations.'' The most pronounced smirk came as he brushed off people who don’t agree with him on guns: “There are all sort of crackpot theories floating around,” Obama said, “some of which are sometimes ratified by elected officials in the other party.” By SARAH WHEATON Not that he didn’t have things to be genuinely torn up about: He was announcing the departure of Education Secretary Arne Duncan, one of the few members of the Cabinet left from the days when the administration was all promise and potential, and an actual friend. He’d kicked off the week shadowboxing with Putin and having to sit through a 90-minute bilateral that went nowhere, only to wake up the next morning and find out that Russia had just started bombing American interests in Syria before they’d remembered to return the calls to administration officials looking to work out a plan. And Thursday night, he’d stood in the White House briefing room grieving another mass shooting, tears in his eyes as he admitted there wasn’t much he could do except keep talking about it, and have his staff spend the evening tweeting about it. But Obama’s been in ""rhymes-with-bucket-list"" mode for months, riding high from a spring where all of a sudden his presidency seemed to come together, embracing poll numbers that he and the West Wing assumed were never going to go up, and watching with glee as he’s outlasted people who’ve made his life hell (not a lot of weeping in the Oval Office about John Boehner’s tail-between-his-legs resignation). Even a very bad week, capped off by Hurricane Joaquin ensuring he’s not getting any rounds of golf this weekend, didn’t shake that. His administration’s history in Syria is such a jumbled mess of false starts and assumptions proved wrong that he spent half an hour in response to the first question asked, and managed to say nothing new. But, hey, he said, that’s a lot better than what anyone else has got. “When I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in the situation, what I’d like to see people ask is, ‘Specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do and how would you fund it and how would you sustain it?’” Obama said. ""Typically what you get is a bunch of mumbo jumbo.” Putin, meanwhile, is just a liar, Obama said—a silly, weakened, ridiculous liar, as anyone could see. Obama smacked away statements the Russian president made in public and in private in their Monday sitdown. He even did a double shot of mine’s-bigger-than-yours, tearing into the size and growth of the Russian economy and noting with pleasure that though Putin seemed confident in his America-bashing, Assad-supporting address to the General Assembly in New York, “I didn’t see after that speech at the United Nations suddenly that 60-nation coalition we have lining up behind him.” Obama said he knows Putin wants to draw him into a proxy war in Syria. Of course he does—that’s what a small power like Putin would want to do, he said. But he’s not biting, and he sees a quagmire coming for the Russians (just like Putin’s other “brilliant” geopolitical moves around Ukraine) despite all their strutting. “Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength, but out of weakness,” Obama said, to protect Assad, “his client.” This is a predictable routine from a flailing leader whose “actions have been successful only insofar as its boosted his poll ratings inside of Russia'' -- which is a lot ""easier to do when you've got a state controlled media."" So on Syria, Obama said, he’s not surprised by the Russian moves (although his aides this week spent time expressing their own surprise at what the fighter jets were doing up in the air around Damascus). By MICHAEL CROWLEY “What they’re doing now is not particularly different from what they’ve done in the past,” Obama said. “They’re just more open about it.” And back in Washington, there won’t be a fight about the debt ceiling, he explained, basically because he said so: “We’re not going back there.” Obama did more of a second grade teacher routine than the usual college professor, walking the room through his rundown of what the debt ceiling is and why Republicans don’t understand what the difference is between raising it and new spending. “It’s not that complicated. The math is the math,” he said. Or, of course, they could do what they were doing in insisting on a government shutdown unless he defunded Planned Parenthood, and “throw a tantrum.” “Thank you guys for your patience,” Obama said, ending the press conference, speaking to the children of the outgoing and new Education secretaries, who'd sat through the hour-plus news conference. But it also sounded like he was dismissing everyone else from class, ahead of the weekend. “You can now go home.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

It may have been just a coincidence. And regardless of which scenario is true, the fact we can't yet be sure should tell you plenty already about the horrifying subculture of murderously angry young men out there. As law enforcement and the press scrambled for information in the wake of Thursday's mass shooting at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, which left ten people dead and seven wounded, Federal officials announced they were investigating a recent 4chan exchange that appeared to predict the rampage. In a cryptic post on the /r9k board on Wednesday, an anonymous poster with an image of Pepe the Frog holding a gun reportedly posted, ""Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning. so long space robots."" After the shooting, some users noted that a well-known figure on the board who goes by Eggman had in August posted a video declaring ""I'm done with r9k"" and on Wednesday had added another video saying, ""Anybody in the Seattle area, the Washington area, and want me to come, like, couch surf at their house or whatever, just hit me up dawg. I’m going to be here a few days."" Predictably, speculation soon ran rampant that Eggman was the shooter. But the killer was later identified as someone else — 26 year-old Chris Harper Mercer. Was Mercer the 4chan user who issued the warning? The timing is certainly eerie. But what's demoralizing is that it could easily have been the rambling of just one more loathsome 4chan troll in an ocean of loathsome 4chan trolls. The post was immediately greeted with a Christmas Eve level excitement — the first reply was, ""Is beta uprising finally going down? You might want to chillax and not alert police."" See, in the sad world of frustrated men who dwell in the lowest reaches of online community, males can divide themselves into ""alphas"" — self-aggrandizing, openly hostile followers of pick up artist culture, and betas, the poor misunderstood, passed over men who will have their glorious day of revenge. Does this talk of alphas and betas sound familiar? Maybe you remember getting the tutorial a year and a half ago, when another young man, Elliot Rodger, went on a deadly spree. Responding to the original poster, other users jumped in with helpful feedback. One person told him, ""I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun."" Another suggested, ""You might want to target a girls school which is safer because there are no beta males throwing themselves for their rescue. Do not use a shotgun. I would suggest a powerful assault rifle and a pistol or 2x pistols. Possibly the type of pistols who have 15+ ammo."" Someone else posted a photo of Elliot Rodger with the message, ""It takes a great man to do great things. Become Legendary."" Someone else, concerned, asked, ""You're only shooting college age students, correct? I have grandparents that live up there,"" while another person encouraged discretion, telling him to aim for the ""Chads and Stacies who have scorned many and yourself. You'll do the world a favor by purging part of the population that only exists to consume resources and act for themselves."" And one person posted hopefully, ""I am so excited for this. If this comes true then thank you for my late birthday gift anon."" Yes, some other participants chimed in to say, ""Nobody cares you're pathetic and this is why no one likes you,"" but the amount of enthusiastic support the post received is nauseating. And after the news of the shooting broke? ""HE DID IT ONE OF US ONE OF US."" ""You made us proud today, son. You made us proud."" One of the more rational comments came from the man who said,""Wanting to KILL EVERYONE (including yourself) is a symptom of having male emotions,"" because at least he added, ""Ya gotta get some distance mentally... but more importantly, you have to turn around and feel, just feel."" Not every frustrated male with mental health issues posting about how ""Our hero showed us the light and a reason to live"" is going to go out and do what Mercer did. What Rodger did. What Roof did. But it should be clear that guys like this are there, all the time, so full of fury at the world and the regular people living in it that they are delighted at the prospect of their deaths. And when it happens, they celebrate it. So maybe Chris Harper Mercer wasn't really in that 4chan thread on Wednesday. The sickening thing is, there are so many voices in it, just like his, how could you even tell?

          / CBS News FRANKLIN, Tenn. -- As the seemingly endless debate on gun control rages in the country in the wake of yet another mass shooting, GOP front-runner Donald Trump took the stage in Franklin, Tennessee, on Saturday and made his thoughts clear in front of a raucous crowd. Trump said he was a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment and that any gun legislation that emerges as a result of mass shootings in the U.S. should be limited to addressing mental health. He went as far as to imply that if teachers were armed at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, where nine people were killed on Thursday, the campus ""would have been a hell of a lot better off."" ""The Second Amendment of our Constitution is clear,"" Trump said, reading from his second policy paper on gun rights. ""Every time something happens, they don't blame mental illness -- that our mental healthcare is out of whack and all of the other problems. And by the way, it was a gun-free zone. I will tell you -- if you had a couple of the teachers or somebody with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."" 2016 presidential candidates are handling the latest mass shooting under a familiar microscope - and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush may have stumbled in South Carolina. Trump criticized Bush for his ""stuff happens"" comment, where Bush was referring to how governments should respond to crises. On Friday, Bush said, ""I had this challenge as governor, 'cause we had -- look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" ""I thought it was a very bad word,"" Trump said. ""He used the words 'stuff happens' - I thought it was a very bad phrase to use. I actually was watching that and I thought, 'Wow -- he certainly has taken heat.' I thought it was certainly an inappropriate phrase."" However, later in the press conference, Trump expressed similar sentiments when asked how mass gun shootings could be stopped. ""No matter what you do you will always have problems,"" Trump said. ""That's why people are watching the news.  There's always going to be problems. There's always going to be horrible things happening. And that's not necessarily politically correct. There will be problems in the world - that's the way it is. I think we can make a big dent with mental health. If we can solve a big chunk of the mental health problem in this country, that would be so fantastic."" The speech also featured the color verbiage that his rallies have become synonymous with. When discussing foreign policy, Trump said Iraq had become the ""Harvard University for terrorists."" For the first time, Trump endorsed a safe zone in Syria for migrants but once again reiterated that they shouldn't be allowed in the United States. He went on to say the migrants could be a ""Trojan horse"" for ISIS. The latest Trump rally took place at The Factory at Franklin, which was built in 1929 for manufacturing. At one point, it made high-end mattresses and sofas before sitting dormant for seven years. It was eventually refurbished into a cultural touchstone, serving as the concert venue, theater and a vibrant farmer's market it is today. The rally was packed with supporters, as chants of ""America loves Trump!"" rang out from the audience of about 1,500. Hundreds more waited outside in the rain even though they couldn't get inside. Trump briefly addressed the overflow crowd afterwards to loud applause. ""Donald Trump is my hero so I'd do anything for Donald Trump,"" said 26-year-old firefighter Bradley Herring. Herring drove nearly ten hours from Raleigh, North Carolina to see Trump. ""He's a businessman, he's rich,"" Herring said. ""If he can build a billionaire empire, he can build a rich country. "" Before Trump took the stage, conservative stalwart Rep. Marsha Blackburn took the stage, making her the second high-profile elected official to speak at a Trump rally. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions briefly spoke at Trump's event in Mobile, Alabama. Blackburn railed against illegal immigration and Planned Parenthood before welcoming Trump to Tennessee. It was one of the more enthusiastic crowds of the Trump campaign. One supporter, Paulette Vee, who drove from Georgia, was wearing ""Vote for the DonDald"" buttons - yes that's the correct spelling. It was a button with Donald Duck on it. Richard Snowden, a 64-year-old retired former nightclub owner, road trips to as many Trump events as he can. He actually went all the way to Virginia Beach for a rally that was supposed to be held on Friday. Unfortunately for Snowden, a Tennessee native, it was canceled due to the approach of Hurricane Joaquin. ""We love Trump,"" said Snowden, putting his arms around his 12-year-old son Robbie. Robbie flew in from Buffalo just for the event. He was helping his father sell ""Make America Great"" visors to those waiting in line to get in. ""We like a non-politician,"" Snowden explained. ""I'm retired and I've been around politics since I was a boy his age. My first rally was Goldwater-Miller rally in Lockport, New York, in 1964. We love this. This is quite a phenomena. This is beautiful. We love it that he has the establishment in a tizzy. Don't we?"" Snowden turned to the line waiting in the cold and said, ""We love Trump, don't we? All the way to the White House."" First published on October 3, 2015 / 7:42 PM © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

An Open Letter to the National Rifle Association Dear Wayne LaPierre, I would like to formally invite you to Flint to discuss the National Rifle Association's ideas for curbing gun violence in the city. Frustrated with the escalating number of gun deaths in our city, I am at a loss for answers. At first, I thought that expanded background checks were the answer. But your website, nraila.org, claims that people who go to prison for gun crimes typically get the guns through theft, the black market or friends and family. Nearly half the illegally trafficked guns came from people who can legally buy guns but then pass them on to those who cannot buy them legally, you claim. So, how about a gun registration that would allow us to track owners who can't safeguard their guns from theft or who are supplying firearms for crime? Turns out, the NRA doesn't like that idea either. Why? I'm not sure. Your website is kind of vague on that one, except to say that you don't like the idea of a gun registry. (Do you also oppose the Department of Motor of Vehicles? We register cars without too much hassle.) Why do you oppose a gun registry? Does your government scare gun owners that much? Do you really think anyone is coming for them? The NRA website claims that federal gun laws are strong enough. Guess what? You're wrong. The laws aren't strong enough. Not even close. Last week's mass shooting at an Oregon college is proof that the system isn't working. I know some of the guns-for-everyone crowd believes that tragedies like these would be prevented by the mythical ""good guy with a gun,"" but we both know that is just Hollywood fiction. I'd like to think there are a legion of Dirty Harrys out there waiting to spring into action, yet I fear the reality is closer to the Home Depot patron who opened fire on shoplifters in Auburn Hills this week. Even closer to home, the death toll continues to mount with each passing month. A few days after the Oregon shooting, Flint saw yet another death in what has become an all-too-familiar refrain of violence. At the rate we're going, we should hit 50 homicides by Halloween, which will at least give your friends in the gun industry assurance that their product is as popular as ever in Flint. I hate to break it to you, Mr. LaPierre, but contrary to your group's beliefs, we do have a gun problem. A big one. And I'm going to keep banging this drum until something happens. It drives some of our commenters crazy, but this issue is just too important to ignore. Racist claims that the problem is really just proof that liberal policies have failed mainly African American cities are bunk. It's a good dodge for the anti-gun-control crowd, but c'mon, Mr. LaPierra, we both know its just a sideshow. This is a real problem that deserves real solutions. Not paranoid ramblings of perceived government conspiracies to seize all the guns or blame-shifting explanations that pass the buck to the communities that are ravaged by these deaths. Guns don't kill people. People with guns kill people. So, please, Mr. LaPierre, stop pretending like there is not a problem and come help us fix it. We're running out of time -- and people.

        Andrew Kaczynski and 
      
        Mark Arce Posted on October 2, 2015, at 2:29 p.m. ET Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday criticized President Obama for the comments he made following the mass shooting in Oregon that left 10 people dead. ""Well, unfortunately that is the approach with President Obama on every issue, is that he seeks to tear us apart, he seeks to politicize it and it's worth remembering he is ideological and he's a radical,"" Cruz stated on the Mark Levin Show. ""You know, as his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel said, 'you never let a good crisis go to waste' and that sadly is his approach."" Speaking from the White House briefing room on Thursday, the president called the latest mass shooting at a small community college in Oregon ""a political choice"" that the country allows to happen again and again. The president, in comments directed at the gun lobby, added ""this is something we should politicize.""' Cruz said Obama would use the tragedy as excuse to take away guns from law-abiding Americans. ""We ought to first of all be lifting up in prayer the families of those who lost their loved ones today to this horrific crime, we still don't know the details of what exactly happened or what the motivations were, but what is clear is that every time we see a shooting of this kind, we've seen people with significant mental illnesses, with people who are violent criminals and there is no doubt that we ought to come down on violent criminals like a ton of bricks,"" said Cruz. ""We ought to do everything we can, for example, to be prosecuting the felons and fugitives who are trying to illegally buy guns. The Obama administration doesn't do that. Instead they try to use these tragedies as an excuse to come after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. It's unconstitutional, it's cynical, and it's wrong.""

431,http://www.salon.com/2015/10/07/ben_carson_is_just_this_vile_5_repugnant_statement_hes_made_since_the_oregon_mass_shooting/,"Republican voters may be hungry for a Washington outsider, but being a political novice and running for president is proving to be a rather tricky undertaking for former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has found himself at the center of yet another storm of controversy over his comments on last week's deadly shooting rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. In a matter of days, Carson has seemingly blamed the victims for failing to jump the gunman, dismissed bullet-ridden dead bodies as simply the cost of freedom and called for the arming of kindergarten teachers. And it's only Wednesday: Carson said ""guns don't kill people"" During a visit to ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, Carson took on the typical conservative complaint that any mention of gun control in the aftermath of a mass shooting is a ploy to ""politicize"" tragedy. “When do we have people that actually want to solve our problems, rather than just politicize everything?” Carson asked the hosts. “Guns don’t kill people,” he insisted, “and the Second Amendment is extremely important. And Daniel Webster said that America would never suffer tyranny because people are armed.” Carson has credited Webster for his newfound and ardent anti-gun control views. While Carson once supported the idea of banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition, he says he has since changed his mind. ""Reading people like Daniel Webster, who talked about tyranny in Europe and said it would never occur in America because the American people were armed,"" he told USA Today this week. ""When you look at tyranny and how it occurs, the pattern is so consistent: Get rid of the guns for the people first so you can go in and dominate them."" Carson wants kindergarten teachers to be armed Carson is out promoting his new book, ""A More Perfect Union,"" and has been stumbling left and right over the issue of guns all across the media. On Tuesday, Carson stopped by ABC's ""The View"" to take a grilling from the ladies. Co-host Joy Behar asked Carson about comments he made to USA Today's Susan Page earlier in the week. ""If I had a little kid in kindergarten somewhere I would feel much more comfortable if I knew on that campus there was a police officer or somebody who was trained with a weapon,"" Carson told Page. ""If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't."" ""If the gunman comes in with an AK-45, or AR-15, how fast can that teacher go to the locked drawer and get that gun?"" Behar followed-up on ""The View."" “Not all kindergarten teachers. I said people who are trained and understand all the implications,” Carson backtracked. “And you’re obviously not just going to have a weapon sitting on the kindergarten teacher’s desk. It would be secured in a place where kids could not get to it.” Carson said he'd rather see a body with bullet holes than see nationwide gun control ""As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies,"" Carson wrote in a Facebook question and answer session Monday evening. ""There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. Serious people seek serious solutions."" Carson said Obama should just wait for the ""next one"" instead of visiting with Umpqua victims Carson seemed disturbingly resigned to the constant national mourning over mass shootings in America we've been accustomed to when he told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade that he would skip a trip to the grief stricken town of Roseburg if he were president. There are reports that some residents will protest President Obama's upcoming visit because of his remarks on gun control. Would you still go? Would you still go if you were president?” Kimeade asked Carson. “I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I’d go to the next one,” Carson offered nonchalantly. Carson's vicious victim blaming: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me"" “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me, I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all,’” Carson said during that same Fox News interview. ""I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time. That way, we don't all wind up dead,"" Carson repeated again during an interview with ABC News while chuckling on Tuesday. But in an interview on the ""The Kelly File"" on Fox News Tuesday night, Carson tried to clean up his mess, explaining that he meant no offense to the shooting victims but just wanted to  ""plant the seed in people's minds"" that this is how they should behave when confronted by a gunman. ""If everybody attacks that gunman, he's not going to be able to kill everybody. But if you sit there and let him shoot you one-by-one, you're all going to be dead,"" Carson explained. ""And, you know, maybe these are things that people don't think about. It's certainly something that I would be thinking about."": This last line got Carson in so much trouble that even his biggest political rival had to jump in and defend him: Sophia Tesfaye is Salon's senior editor for news and politics, and resides in Washington, D.C.

432,https://mic.com/articles/126247/donald-trump-argues-guns-no-guns-it-doesn-t-matter-in-response-to-ucc-massacre,"In the wake of this week's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, where nine victimsÂ died and seven were injured at the hands of a handgun-toting gunman, President Barack Obama urged the public to politicize the topic of mass shootings. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton demanded increased gun control, while Republican presidential candidateÂ and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush argued ""stuff happens"" and new laws aren't always the solution. Republican front-runner and real estate billionaire Donald Trump, however, just argued that not only will gun laws not preventÂ future shootings, but that mass shooters will accomplishÂ things ""people will not even believe are possible and that they are ""geniuses in a certain way."" In an interview with NBC'sÂ Meet the PressÂ that aired onÂ Sunday, Trump argued there is little that can be done to prevent future mass shootings and that ""guns, no guns âÂ it doesn't matter."" He added that ""they happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they're geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system."" ""I watched [President Obama's]Â statement, and I understand exactly what he's saying,"" Trump said. ""But, you know, no matter what you do âÂ guns, no guns âÂ it doesn't matter. You have people that are mentally ill, and they're going to come through the cracks."" ""And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible,"" he continued. ""And whether it's the school shootings which are really very prevalent in this country. They seem to be more prevalent in this country. And I'm not sure..."" ""What's your explanation?"" host Chuck Todd asked. ""They're just sick people,"" Trump responded. ""They're mentally imbalanced, and they probably see it happening here more."" Todd asked the front-runner if he thought there were more mentally ill people in the U.S. than elsewhere. ""I think what we have is, I think, we have copycats,"" Trump said. ""I think that they watch it and they see it here more than other places. And the world can be a pretty sick place in so many different ways."" ""But we have mentally, very unstable, people and that is going to lead âÂ and you know it's not politically correct to say,"" Trump concluded. ""You can have the best security. You have the best everything, but people are able to get in and do this âÂ just terrible damage."" Additionally, theÂ GuardianÂ reported that at a Nashville rally on Saturday, Trump invoked the 1974 Charles Bronson film Death Wish,Â in which a man whose wife is murdered and daughter is raped goes on a bloody rampage against New York City criminals. Trump told the crowd anyone who attacked him would be ""shocked"" to find him as prepared and well-armed as Bronson's character, adding, ""Today you can't make that movie because it's not politically correct."" Trump is currently leading the GOP pack in the polls, with the most recent Pew survey finding him at 25% support, followed by neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 16% and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tied with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 8%. However,Â his support has dimmed somewhat in recent weeks, with one poll finding him just 1% above Carson.

""Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a lot of issues,"" Sanders said. ""We disagree on Wall Street and what we should do, whether or not we bring back Glass-Steagall or break up the large banks. We disagree about how high the minimum wage should go, I think it should go to 15 bucks an hour. We disagree about our college plans, I believe she hasn't come up with an opinion yet."" Sanders also spoke at length about his support for gun control, noting that ""I come from a state that has virtually no gun control at all. Yet, I’ve cast some very, very difficult votes in favor of strong gun control. I mean, you're looking at a guy who was a Congressman who voted for strong background checks, instant background checks -- I want to see them made even stronger."" However, he also proffered, unprompted, the preferred argument of anti-gun control conservatives, noting that ""in my view we need a revolution in mental health in this country. I believe you have thousands of people walking the streets of America today who are suicidal, who are homicidal."" Hayes asked Sanders how well he believed was doing ""building the multiracial coalition that is necessary to succeed in a Democratic primary past Iowa and New Hampshire,"" to which the Vermont senator replied that although he's now considered ""a serious candidate,"" his campaign does ""need to do more outreach to the Latino and African-American community."" ""One of the things that we are going to be able to do,"" he explained, ""because 650,000 people, a record-breaking number, have contributed to our campaign, is we are going to have the resources to develop a strong organization in South Carolina, Nevada, and the states that follow."" Sanders added that he has ""a strong record of standing up for African-American community -- but more importantly, we have an economic agenda, a social justice agenda, a criminal justice agenda which I think will make sense to the African-American community once they hear it.""

434,http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/seth_meyers_mocks_gop_responses_to_oregon_shooting_jeb_bush_is_in_favor_of_pool_control_not_gun_control/,"Former ""Saturday Night Live"" Weekend Update news anchor Seth Meyers crushed Republican primary candidates for their cavalier disinterest over last week's mass shooting in Oregon. Monday night on his nightly show ""Late Night,"" Meyers addressed Jeb Bush's ""stuff happens"" by quoting the entirety of Bush's comments to clarify what Bush actually meant: ""So to be clear, he wasn't callously shrugging off the shooting, he was just that when tragedies like these occur it's important for the government to not do anything."" This is remarkably similar to many of his brother President George W. Bush's policies on domestic issues. Meyers showed Bush after the Conservative Leadership Project forum being questioned by the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza: ""No, it wasn’t a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong? Things happen all the time—things—is that better?"" Bush said defensively. ""I will say,"" Meyers said. ""When it comes to running a campaign, Jeb Bush isn't good at things or stuff."" Funny, because it's true. He went on to cite Bush's second attempt at a clarification, where he talked about fences around pools: ""A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools,"" Bush said. ""Well, it may not change it… the cumulative effect of this is in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people, burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder for people to protect liberty."" Meyers then cited a Florida law passed during the Bush administration and signed by Jeb in 2000 called the Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act which did actually require that a ""barrier must be placed around the perimeter of the pool."" This is awkward. ""So to clarify"" Meyers said, ""Jeb Bush is in favor of pool control, not gun control."" That's when Meyers completely crushed it with a kind of logic that could send Republican candidates spinning in bumbling circles of confusion: ""But this illustrates the point perfectly: We implement sensible regulations on potentially dangerous things like pools all the time. Why should guns be any different?"" Meyers asked. ""I know, I know. There's no 'Right to Bare Pools' in the the Constitution. But that's only because our Founding Fathers failed to see that a bunch of rich assholes would want cement ponds in their back yards."" He then moved on to attack Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, all of whom made similarly disconnected statements about the futility of regulations for guns. Meyers said, however, that the best illustration of hopelessness with the issue came from Chris Christie, who said yesterday that there is no correlation between tighter gun restrictions in New Jersey and low gun crimes. ""Christie actually disagrees that the laws in his own state have been successful in curbing gun violence,"" Meyers said. ""That's how backwards the politics of this issue are. Have you ever seen a politician decline to take credit for something good that happened in their state? That's like Kanye saying 'ya know I don't deserve this award, it was really the sound mixer...'"" Watch Seth Meyers crush Jeb Bush below:   Copyright © 2021 Salon.com, LLC.

Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  The Daily Show's Trevor Noah is pissed off at Ben Carson for blaming the victims of the Oregon shooting. On Tuesday, the Republican presidential candidate described on Fox News how he would handle a mass shooting: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Carson has doubled down on the comments since then, telling Fox News's Megyn Kelly, ""If you sit there and let him shoot you one by one, you're all going to be dead."" Noah was quick to point out that this sounds a lot like victim blaming. ""Let him shoot you? What do you mean, let him shoot you? What do you really expect the victims to do?"" He added, ""This guy would make the worst hostage negotiator ever. 'All right, sir, I need you to stay calm and put your gun down. Everyone else, rush him! Rush him now! How many people are dead? Well, at least it wasn't everyone.'"" Not only are Carson's comments offensive, but they misunderstand basic psychology. As Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver psychology professor, told the New Republic, blaming the victim in these situations misunderstands how people's brains work in times of crises. ""When you are in a life or death situation, sometimes your autonomic nervous system takes over and you may not behave the way you thought you would,"" she said. ""There are some factors that might make someone more likely to freeze versus run versus perhaps fight back, but it's not a real straightforward generalization that you can make."" That's why these imaginary heroic scenarios play out better in the movies, and when Carson's advice happens in real life, people tend to get hurt — exactly what happened in the Oregon shooting. Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  As the New York Times's Alan Rappeport reported, ""The heavily armed Oregon gunman killed nine people before taking his own life. The fact that an Army veteran who did try to stop him was shot multiple times and remains hospitalized underscores the risks of attacking an armed attacker, as numerous critics pointed out Tuesday."" This highlights another problem with Carson's comments: It took someone who has been trained for combat scenarios to try to act. Most other people are — justifiably — paralyzed by fear in these situations, and they don't have the training to overcome that fear. So expecting a large group of people to charge at the shooter is simply unrealistic, on top of coming off as victim blaming. So instead of suggesting that people attack shooters, a safer way to end gun violence may be preventing it from happening in the first place. ""I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away"" One way to do that is gun control: The US has more gun deaths than other developed nations because, according to the research, Americans have more guns, and more guns mean more gun deaths. So reducing the number of guns — by limiting access to them, or by immediately cutting the supply of them through, for example, buyback programs— would very likely lead to fewer gun deaths. But Carson is against gun control, writing on Monday, ""As a doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking — but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" Perhaps that explains Carson's comments: If he's unwilling to look at real solutions, fantasies are all he has left.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Obviously, The Daily Show had some shit to say about that. Host Trevor Noah describes Carson as being “for people who like Donald Trump’s ideas, but hate his charm and charisma,” and also compares him to “drug-free cocaine for people who don’t want to get high but just like snorting white powder.” He also points out Carson’s tendency to laugh at socially inappropriate times, for instance right after reporters have asked him what he would do if he found himself in the middle of a mass shooting.

Partially it's because of the body count, but partially it's because President Obama made a taboo-busting speech where he said, ""And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.  Well, this is something we should politicize."" Of course, Republicans generally politicize mass shootings while pretending to be above such things, using shootings as opportunities to assert support for our gun-crazed culture. But Obama's statement and Hillary Clinton's declared intent to make gun safety a priority issue has only ramped up pressure on Republicans running for president to assure the right wing base that they think it's absolutely ridiculous to think guns have anything to do with all these gun deaths. Here's where the candidates stand on the issue after this latest shooting. Ben Carson. Carson has had the most alarming run of grotesque pandering to gun nuts after the shooting, starting with blaming the victims for not being action heroes. ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" Carson fantasized on Fox News. ""I would say: ‘Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me but he can’t get us all.'” In the same interview, he suggested the president can just skip visiting the family members of the victims, because there's always ""the next one"". He's not wrong that it's a regular event, but his wording certainly suggested that he doesn't really think of it as a big deal. His next appearance on Fox, on Tuesday night, confirmed this impression. ""“I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away,"" he told Megyn Kelly. If you think of ""devastating"" in terms of the political careers of Republicans instead of in terms of actual lives lost, you can sort of see where he's coming from. Donald Trump. Unsurprisingly, Trump has Ben Carson's view that the real world is indistinguishable from an action movie. ""Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Hey, if Daredevil can bicycle-kick a gun out of a bad man's hand, then why not those of us who aren't living in a superhero TV show? Jeb Bush. ""Look, stuff happens, there’s always a crisis,"" Bush said right after the shooting. ""And the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do."" The comments offended a lot of people, but you have to admire his pithiness. He managed to get across the idea that mass murder is no big deal and that gun violence is no more controllable than the weather, all in a nice, tweetable sound bite. Rand Paul. Paul seems confused about the nature of guns, seeming to think that they exist to stop bullets, not fire them. ""The other common denominator, other than mental illness is that people are going to places where guns are prohibited,"" he told an Iowa talk show host. ""So when you have a gun-free zone at a school, it’s like an invitation, if you are crazy and want to shoot people, that’s where you go. I would do the opposite. I would have and encourage every school in American put stickers on every window going into the school saying, ‘We are armed. Come in at your own peril. We have concealed carry for teachers who have it and we also have armed security and you will be shot.’” The only way to stop kids from dying in a hail of bullets is to toss in a few more guns spraying bullets. With that kind of ironclad logic, you can see how our gun-saturated, shooting-happy culture got the way it is. Bobby Jindal. Jindal took his inspiration from the religious right, casting around for an excuse to blame sexual freedom for mass murder. In a blog post titled, ""We fill Our Culture With Garbage, And We Reap The Result"", Jindal blamed music that promotes ""the degradation of women"" and flaunts ""the laws of God and common decency"" (read: music videos that suggest that sex is fun). He also took a potshot at legal abortion, following the theme that letting women have sex somehow leads men to murder. But Jindal saved his angriest rant for the father of Chris Mercer, who committed the ultimate sin of suggesting guns have something to do with gun violence. ""He’s a complete failure as a father,"" Jindal ranted, because Mercer's parents are divorced. ""Because he failed to raise his son."" Of course, plenty of other Western cultures have legal abortion, women who have sex, and divorce, but don't have mass shootings like the U.S. But let's not let facts get in the way of a rant about how the decline of patriarchy is the reason for murder. Mike Huckabee. Huckabee made the same argument as Jindal, but with more Bible-thumping. ""We have not so much a gun problem, we have a problem with sin and evil,"" the former pastor argued, before going on to falsely argue that all mass shootings happen in a ""gun-free zone"". If Huckabee is right, then Western European countries that do not endure weekly mass shootings must be free of ""sin and evil"". Someone should ask him about that. John Kasich. “I don’t think gun control would solve this problem,” Kasich said at a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce event. “The deeper issue is alienation. The deeper issue is loneliness. The deeper issue is we’re paying no attention to an individual who is really struggling.” So countries like England, Canada, and Germany don't have loneliness or alienation, to go with their lack of legal abortion, divorce, sin, or evil? Must be, since they don't have a mass shooting problem like the United States. Marco Rubio.  Rubio invoked the mental health dodge, arguing that mental illness is ""a societal thing that we need to confront."" He does, at least, have a record of promoting mental health policies, though only in response to shootings. However, adding ""mental illness"" to the sin-evil-abortion-divorce-loneliness pile of causes doesn't explain why the U.S. is unique in having a problem for endless mass shootings. Ted Cruz. ""Well, unfortunately that is the approach with President Obama on every issue, is that he seeks to tear us apart, he seeks to politicize it,"" Cruz sneered, while hypocritically using the occasion to launch a divisive, politicizing attack. ""And it’s worth remembering he is ideological and he’s a radical,"" he continued, without noting that Obama's opinion is actually the mainstream of world opinion on this issue, and that Cruz's opinion is the one that falls well outside the norm. ""You know, as his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel said, ‘you never let a good crisis go to waste’ and that sadly is his approach,"" he added, making sure not to let this opportunity to bag on Obama go to waste. Carly Fiorina. For someone who likes to get wild with the rhetoric, Fiorina's entrance into this competition of who can be the most callous after a shooting is rather weak. ""Before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have,"" she said in response to Obama's speech. The comment did feature her trademark allergy to the truth---the guns used for this murder were purchased legally and all applicable laws were, in fact, followed---but overall, not the most attention-grabbing comments for a contest where the loudest mouth demagogue is generally the most popular. Looking over the field of candidate responses to this, the Republican strategy on guns has become quite clear: Minimize the violence and find anyone or anything else---including the victims themselves---to blame instead of our country's failed gun policies.

""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, 'Obama politicized this issue.' Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together,"" a visibly frustrated Obama said on Wednesday. ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" But the part of the president's speech which gave the greatest offense to those at Fox News was his claim that ""we know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths, so the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence."" On ""The Kelly File,"" guest Dana Loesch said that ""he comes from Chicago, so I find that a little hard to believe he's stating that. Illinois has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. You basically can't even drive through Illinois without having your ammunition and firearms stored in a certain way."" Loesch failed to mention that those regulations are in place because residents of Illinois purchase and then transport their firearms and ammunition from neighboring states with more lax gun control laws. That would suggest that federal gun control legislation would be an effective way to curb gun violence, but that's decidedly not the point Loesch wants to make. ""There are a lot of Roseburgs that happen every single weekend in Chicago,"" was the point Loesch wanted to, and did, make -- sans the discussion of neighboring states, of course. On ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" host Bill O'Reilly said ""I don't have a script here, I'm just talking to President Obama right now, me to him,"" and then proceeded to make the exact same argument Loesch did. Without a script, though, because he's speaking off-the-cuff, and directly to the president. Just a coincidence it's an identical argument. ""Your home state of Illinois has the most stringent gun laws in the country,"" he said, ""and Chicago is the largest city in Illinois. Since 2012, there have 1,679 murders, many of them exactly where you worked as a community organizer."" ""You know that Chicago has extremely stringent gun laws,"" O'Reilly added, of course neglecting to mention the fact that states neighboring Illinois don't. Because what would be the point in that? O'Reilly has all these dead bodies and a possible Christian persecution angle to exploit, and mentioning simple facts about interstate commerce won't help him transform these victims of gun violence into ratings gold.

440,http://ew.com/article/2015/10/05/john-oliver-mental-health-oregon-shooting/,"On Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver slammed Republican presidential nominee hopefuls Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee for citing mental health issues in response to last week’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college. “There’s nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health,” Oliver said during a segment on America’s dysfunctional mental health policies. “The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health. Because, for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people.” Citing historical facts and figures, and current stats (prisons, for instance, are the largest provider of mental health care in the U.S.), Oliver detailed the systemic flaws with America’s treatment of the mentally ill. And according to the host, only bringing up mental health in relation to mass shootings “is deeply misleading.” “If we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a f—ing plan,” Oliver said.

Activists and Democrats attribute the shift to a hard-charging president, a powerful new infrastructure of gun control advocates, and a handful of gubernatorial victories — all of which have helped to end Democratic caution about guns. By
      
        Evan McMorris-Santoro Posted on October 7, 2015, at 9:12 a.m. ET WASHINGTON — Just a few hours after a gunman shot and killed two Virginia TV reporters live on air Aug. 26, while the details of the shooting were still a confusing mess, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took to Twitter. Heartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, started talking about gun control and a political solution to the Virginia deaths. She had talked about it before then, and since then, she's unveiled a set of gun control measures. President Obama expressly promised to ""politicize"" the Oregon deaths in his first remarks following the murders last week, the latest in a series of emotional speeches he's delivered after mass shootings. These days, they’re just the two most prominent Democrats of the many elected officials willing to talk about gun control early and often. This is the sound of the new gun control political safety net working, say advocates and Democratic political strategists. That Democrats move instantly to politicize shootings — and invite the sustained criticism of gun rights supporters, who view the move as callous at best and calculated at worst, for doing it — is now an expected part of the national debate. Not too long ago, it really wasn’t. Democrats might say they’d be interested in exploring gun control if asked about it, or start any conversation about gun control by talking about their own firearms collections, or say that the untenable politics made the idea unrealistic. It wasn’t something Democrats generally brought up on their own and it wasn’t a topic they were especially interested in dwelling on. Over the last few years, advocates and activists have worked hard behind the scenes to show politicians likely to support new gun laws that politicizing won’t hurt them and that the gun industry lobby isn’t as powerful as they thought. Groups like Americans for Responsible Solutions, founded by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, a mass shooting victim, and her husband, Mark Kelley, and Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, are regularly meeting with top staff in Democratic circles to discuss messaging strategy, and trying to prove the gun lobby can be beaten by funding state-level political action and touting it to national party strategists. Those efforts, President Obama’s personal commitment to the cause, and the victories of a handful of Democratic governors who’ve run on gun control messages have gone a long way in changing the Democratic conversation. “People have some air cover now,” said a senior Democrat in the orbit of Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who won re-election in 2014 after championing a slew of gun control laws after Newtown. The National Rifle Association targeted Malloy — as well as Colorado Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who also supported and signed new gun laws — but both men won their elections in a dark year for Democrats. Smarter, more powerful gun control advocates helped, said the Malloy source. “There’s an additional savvy to them,” the source said, referring to the new gun control advocates at Americans for Responsible Solutions and Everytown. “They’ve got good methodologies, good polling, good tactics, and they’ve got money. That was something the NRA had institutionalized.” Obama turned Democrats back to gun control with his forceful but ultimately unsuccessful push for it after Newtown in early 2013; Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe won as a gun control Democrat in a purple state in late 2013. Observers in Democratic politics and the gun control community argue both events helped make the party comfortable with making shootings political once again. McAuliffe’s good friend, former president Bill Clinton, once signed the 1994 crime bill that in Democratic mythology helped cost the party the Congress in Bill Clinton’s first midterm elections thanks to its gun control provisions and subsequent NRA backlash. When Obama steered the party back toward gun control in January 2013, the first real Democratic efforts in the area since that bill, Bill Clinton urged caution in meetings with Obama supporters. By early 2014, Bill Clinton was headlining an Americans for Responsible Solutions fundraiser in New York City and giving advice on Democrats can do more to pass restrictions on gun purchases. In between came McAuliffe’s election. Running for governor in the state that’s home to NRA headquarters, McAuliffe promised expanded background checks and a return to the state’s defunct one-handgun-per-month purchase limit. He celebrated his low grades from the gun lobby and bet that voters for whom gun control is on the list of policy priorities would outvote the single-issue firearms voters gun rights groups like the NRA had successfully turned out for years. McAuliffe won his election. Clinton campaigns with McAuliffe in 2013. According to an attendee who related the story to BuzzFeed News last week, Bill Clinton held an impromptu strategy session with Americans for Responsible Solutions leadership on his way out the door from the New York City event, poking one senior member of the group’s leadership in the chest to emphasize the point that McAuliffe had changed the game. McAuliffe took on the NRA, but focused on “access” issues like background checks rather than demonizing gun ownership, Bill Clinton said, according to the source. The next election cycle, 2014, was terrible for Democrats. But the wins by Hickenlooper and Malloy, as well as various state, legislative, and other victories by gun control advocates resonated, they said, and the groups scrambled to make sure gun control wasn’t blamed for 2014 the way it was for 1994. (The examples may not be perfect — Malloy governs a blue state, for instance.) Shortly after the election, Americans for Responsible Solutions staff met with senior officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) to show them how to use microtargeting to find voters open to a gun control message without turning a whole election in a tough state into a referendum on gun control, according to a person who attended the sessions. A DCCC spokesperson confirmed committee staff have met with representatives for Americans For Responsible Solutions as well as those from Everytown. The DSCC did not respond to a request for comment. Fear among advocates that Democrats might go weak on gun control after sticking their necks out on it in 2013 was part of the reason for the meetings, the attendee said, but advocates would have reached out even if things had been “rosy” for Democrats. The goal was to share the knowledge about modern gun control campaigning with the party most likely to be interested in it in future elections. Gun control advocates — or “gun safety advocates,” as they prefer to be called — said they still faced a lot of cautious politicians, especially Democrats. But the partisan lines around the issue are also changing with the help of the new gun control advocacy, they said. “Washington is certainly a town of political calculation, but as the strength of our community has grown, it’s become something that our elected leaders can’t ignore,” Hayley Zachary, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, told BuzzFeed News. She said her talks with politicians sometimes still result in “antiquated responses” to the politics of the guns, but that looking away from Washington has helped her make the point that pushing for expanded background checks and other measures isn’t the political risk it once was. “We have found Republicans and Democrats who are willing to meet with us,” Zachary said. Groups have touted successes in winning over Republican lawmakers on the state level, and they note the 2013 Senate bill pushed by the White House had bipartisan backing. The politics are shifting, even if the players in the gun control debate aren’t really, she said. What political leaders want is to know that they’ll be supported if they vote for gun control — and that the voters who will back them after the vote can be found and pulled out. They want the same help from gun control supporters opponents have had for decades. “There is definitely a history of political involvement on this issue from the gun lobby,” Zachary said. “We are up against them more than we are against a political party.” Millions of dollars are flowing in support of gun control now, and the politicians that take risks have backup they didn’t used to. “There’s nothing like a scorecard,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown. “We’re out there; everybody knows we’re out there. Thirty-six states in this last legislative session. And, winning. Beating the gun lobby... That speaks 1,000 words.” National politicians, especially Democrats, are open to talking about gun control even as gun rights advocates continue to control the Washington debate, making national legislation practically impossible. Howard Wolfson, a former top Bloomberg and adviser who helped oversee the billionaire former mayor’s super PAC spending in 2012 and 2014, said even small state-level wins reverberate. “Politics in D.C. is stuck on a gridlocked partisan loop on nearly every every issue,” he told BuzzFeed News in an email, “but in the states we are having real success — and people are noticing.” The NRA has certainly noticed. The group has been running ads aimed at tearing down a nonexistent Bloomberg presidential candidacy since August. The impact on Democrats of a consistent gun control push from the White House and a support system to back it up on the trail is clear. But gun politics are still some of the toughest politics around: While polls routinely show huge majorities of Americans favor stricter federal background checks and tighter regulations on gun purchases, 2016 will be the first test in a long time of how willing they are to vote against politicians who continue to block background check expansion. Gun rights advocates have shown they’re still willing and able to punish lawmakers who cross them, or at least convince them that the politically beneficial path after a mass shooting still steers them well clear of new gun laws that, the gun rights advocates often point out, might have done little to prevent the event in question. Democrats who have stared down the NRA and found an infrastructure to back them up say the feeling is liberating. “You can vote your conscience here and that’s something you couldn’t say five years ago,” the Malloy insider said. “The most interesting contrast is between 2008 and 2016,” said Feinblatt, president of Everytown. “Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were not debating gun issues in 2008. I’d argue they were doing just the opposite because they had really accepted the notion that no matter how you felt about it in your heart, it wasn’t worth the political risk of talking about it.” Seven years later, Feinblatt said, there’s been a “sea change” in Democratic presidential politics. “Clinton is talking about it and she’s talking about it everywhere, not selectively,” he said. “And Bernie Sanders is actually trying to convince voters that his record on guns is actually better than most people think. … That is a completely different political calculus, and I think that’s happening because of what’s happening in the states.” Bob Beauprez ran against Hickenlooper in 2014.

446,http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/10/horror_in_roseburg_10_minutes.html," Gallery: Oregon School Shooting - Umpqua College ROSEBURG -- In a few brutal minutes Thursday, a 26-year-old man turned Roseburg's Umpqua Community College into the site of Oregon's deadliest mass shooting -- a rampage so violent police pleaded for ""as many ambulances as possible"" and President Barack Obama went on national TV to argue, again, for tougher guns laws. The gunman shot and killed nine people before dying himself after a firefight with officers. ""There's been another mass shooting in America, this time at a community college in Oregon,"" the president said. ""It means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief ... ""I've been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there."" The gunman, whose name police have not released but The Oregonian/OregonLive confirmed as Chris Harper-Mercer, entered an Introduction to Expository Writing class in Snyder Hall around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. He carried a ""long gun,"" according to radio calls between police and emergency dispatchers, and up to three handguns. The shooting began immediately. Across campus, in adjacent classrooms, administrative offices, the cafeteria and the bookstore, hundreds of other students abandoned their textbooks, cell phones and computers in a mad race for cover as ""pop, pop, pop"" echoed. English instructor Jenny Friedman counted 15 shots. Police cars quickly blocked the only road onto campus. Some students stayed in hiding for more than two hours before police marched them out, patted them down and shepherded them onto school buses that ferried them to Douglas County Fairgrounds. Detectives, family members and the media awaited. Police arrived on campus moments after the first 911 call and declared the gunman ""neutralized"" barely eight minutes in, a swift response that witnesses and law enforcement officials say may have saved dozens of lives. About 35 people were in Snyder Hall when the shooter attacked. MORE : Who is Chris Harper-Mercer? Records, internet paint a hazy picture Still, in perhaps 10 minutes of violence, the gunman killed at least nine people and injured at least seven others. Paramedics took victims to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. Three critically injured patients were later airlifted elsewhere. Victims had been shot in the chest, back, legs and hands, hospital officials said. The killer shot a teacher in the head at point-blank range, one witness told the Roseburg News Review newspaper, and ordered students to the floor. He demanded they tell him their religious affiliation, the witness said, but did not wait for answers before firing again. Federal investigators, chasing rumors that the shooter had warned of his intentions on social media, were investigating the case as a possible hate crime. As night fell Thursday, police escorted neighbors from the apartment complex where Chris Harper-Mercer lived in nearby Winchester, and officers in camouflage and police dogs began to search his unit. Investigators also worked through every room on campus and were checking every car left behind in the community college's packed parking lot. Harper-Mercer moved through his 26 years barely leaving a paper trail to prove he existed. Public records show no brushes with law enforcement, no record of borrowing money. His parents filed for divorce in the Los Angeles area in 2005. Later, Harper-Mercer moved with his mother 790 miles north to Winchester, four miles north of Roseburg. It was not clear Thursday evening whether Harper-Mercer was shot by a police officer or if he killed himself. At least two officers exchanged fire with him, said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin. Hanlin encouraged the media and Douglas County residents not to mention the shooter by name. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to his horrific and cowardly act,"" the sheriff said. ""You will never hear me mention his name."" A full account of the dead and wounded was not available late Thursday. Although some students expressed, along with their heartbreak, frustration that they did not immediately know which classmates or instructors had been killed, Hanlin said the county's ""mass casualty"" protocol requires a wait of 24 to 48 hours before names are released. Umpqua serves about 4,600 students over the course of an academic year, a mix of recent high school graduates starting work on their college degrees and middle-aged adults returning to school in search of new skills and job opportunities. Many take classes part-time. Like community colleges across Oregon, the school offers a lower-cost higher education to any student who wishes to enroll. ""This is a community of one degree of separation,"" said Russ Wilson, associate pastor at Roseburg's New Life Christian Center. ""If you don't know somebody who goes to the school, you know somebody who knows somebody at the school."" At the time of the shooting, school officials said, one unarmed security guard was on duty. This week marked the start of the fall term, and Thursday was only the second day of classes for many students and instructors. ""We are a community college in the best sense of the word,"" said Rita Cavin, Umpqua's interim president. ""Things like this last forever. It's an emotional scar for the college."" Roseburg, a town of 22,000 three hours south of Portland, has suffered tragedy before. In 2006, Roseburg High freshman Vincent Leodoro shot fellow student Joseph Monti four times in the back while both were in the school courtyard. Monti survived, and many Roseburg-area institutions, including Umpqua Community College, responded to the attack with new plans for how to handle and prevent active shooter scenarios. More broadly, the collapse of the timber industry and the recession have devastated Douglas County, driving the median family income in Douglas County from the equivalent of $46,447 in 2000 to $40,524 two years ago. Yet this community, the latest addition to a tear-stained list that includes Littleton, Aurora and Newtown, has never suffered a loss this bloody or far-reaching. Football games and other sporting events were postponed Thursday night, and school systems across Douglas County have cancelled classes Friday. The community college itself will be closed until at least Monday. According to crowd-sourced counts, this is the 294th mass shooting in the United States so far this year and the 45th shooting on a school or college campus. ""It's sick,"" said longtime Roseburg High football coach Thurman Bell. ""You wonder what's happening in the world today. ""In Roseburg? In Roseburg?""

Senior Reporter Days after the massacre at a black church in South Carolina, some Americans woke to a vile surprise: KKK fliers with candy on their lawns. The propaganda—stuffed into plastic baggies with pieces of peppermint and Tootsie Rolls—included a phone number for the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Planted under the cover of darkness, the fliers were distributed in California, Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. It’s not something local police departments are taking lightly, and some have even reached out to the FBI for assistance. The Rockdale County sheriff’s department in Conyers, Georgia, collected more than 80 fliers and is investigating whether anyone can be charged with criminal trespass or littering. “Whether it was a joke or from an organization doesn’t matter to me,” Sheriff Eric Levett told The Daily Beast. “The fact that it was done during this time is ignorant and cowardly.” A message on the hate-spewing hotline, based in North Carolina, salutes 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who was charged with murder for the killing nine people in Charleston. Roof penned a racist manifesto before the June 17 mass shooting and wanted to start a “race war.” “We in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK would like to say hail victory to … Dylan S. Roof who decided to do what the Bible told him,” a man chirps in the recording. “An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. They [black people] have spilled our blood too long. It’s about time someone spilled theirs.” “If it ain’t white, it ain’t right,” the message concludes. “White power!” Robert Jones, of the Royal White Knights in North Carolina, told The Daily Beast that the Klan is undergoing a national recruitment drive that coincidentally started around the time of the South Carolina murders. “We’re doing this from the East Coast to the West Coast, just to let people know the Klan’s in their community,” said Jones, the grand dragon of the hate group based in Pelham, N.C. “Especially with all the stuff that’s in the news—in South Carolina they’re wanting to take the Confederate flag down.” Jones told The Daily Beast that he supports Roof’s crime, but preferred that he “shot the correct people,” such as minority drug dealers rather than churchgoers. “It’s a racial war against our people,” Jones said. “The more the media pushes multiculturalism down our throat, the more you’re going to see killings like this.” In Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, the Klan also recently caught cops’ attention when it got personal—naming and urging a boycott against local Mexican restaurants. The fliers from the Northeastern Oklahoma Klavern warned of the same supposed “black on white” violence that spurred Roof’s militancy, and pushed “civil ways to discourage these animals from our community,” the Pryor Daily Times reported. “Stop going to Maggie’s Mexican Kitchen … [she] thinks she can talk trash about white people in Spanish, thinking none of us will understand her anti-American, anti-white rhetoric,” read the flier discovered on Father’s Day. “Or, El Humilde Mexican Restaurant, which takes your money while employing illegals and sending our American currency back to their homeland.” Captain Rod Howell of the Mayes County sheriff’s department in Pryor told The Daily Beast that “the timing’s not a coincidence.” “They’re doing it for a reason,” Howell said. “They’re trying to get as many people as possible to put some fuel in the fire. With the political climate the way it is today, it’s really tough right now.” Meanwhile, Alabama residents were horrified by the racially-charged hate bags filled with candy. “I didn’t even know the KKK was alive and well,” Shannon Phillips of Lake View told local news station WIAT. “I certainly didn’t know it was in our area. It disturbed me that they put Tootsie Rolls in here trying to appeal to children. I mean that’s just pathetic, sick, disgusting.” Phillips said she and other neighbors scrambled to pick up the bags before kids could find them. “Why would they put a piece of peppermint candy in here? There’s no sweetness involved in this group,” fumed another resident, Charley Buckland, to ABC 13. “This is a very sad, sad situation when you find these in your yards. It’s very disheartening.” Cops in nearby Bessemer, Alabama, filled a 30-gallon bag with the bulletins, which officers collected from one church and more than 60 homes. “If we find out who has done it, we’ll deal with it,” Police Chief Nathaniel Rutledge Jr. told The Daily Beast. “For right now, it’s criminal littering at the very least.” After the fliers were found in Topeka, Kansas, the police chief there called the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI and held a press conference with the city’s Black Ministers Association. Other fliers were found as far as Fullerton, California, a city of 135,161 in Orange County. Proclaiming “Save our land, Join the Klan,” some of the baggies—anchored by rocks and candy so they wouldn’t blow away—misspelled “California.” “It’s just wrong. There’s no words,” Fullerton resident Alia Cass told CBS Los Angeles. “Racism isn’t born. It’s taught.”",2015-09-15 11:10:58,The Klan’s Vile Post-Charleston Recruiting Spree,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

Kornsgold On Wednesday, August 26, in Moneta, Virginia, Allison Parker, a 24-year-old reporter, and Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman, were shot to death on live television by a disgruntled ex-employee. On June 17 a mass shooting took place at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, during a Bible study session. Nine people were killed by a gunman, including the Senior Pastor, State Senator Clementa Pinckney. These are two of the many well-known incidents of gun violence that took place this past year. The day of the Virginia shooting incident was the 238th day of the year and the 247th mass-shooting incident of the year. Since the December 2012 school shooting in Newton, Connecticut, at least 133 school shootings have taken place in America.  This is an average of nearly one a week. If that were not enough, here are a few more sobering statistics: - American children are 14 times as likely to die from guns as children in any other developed country in the world. - More Americans die in gun homicides and suicides every six months than have died in the last 25 years in every terrorist attack and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. Gun violence is out of control in the United States and it is getting worse each year. Elie Wiesel, the famous author, human rights activist and Holocaust survivor, is often quoted as saying that during any large scale, life-threatening crisis, you will find three kinds of people: Victims, Perpetrators and Bystanders.  My colleague, Rabbi Nina Mandel, believes gun violence in America is such a large scale, life-threatening crisis. Who are the Victims? They are the innocent children, women and men that die or sustain permanent injury, because of a culture of violence that promotes gun ownership and weak regulation.  They are the children who live in areas where they are more likely to be killed by a gun than they are to graduate from high school. Who are the Perpetrators? The perpetrators are NOT law-abiding, responsible gun owners. They are those who make money on the free trade of guns.  The perpetrators are the state and federal lawmakers who block legislation that would allow individual records to be shared, records that could prevent guns ending up in the hands of criminals. Who are the Bystanders?  That's us.  Those of us who are horrified when the random, mass killing happens - wringing our hands and wracking our brains about why - but failing to speak out.  Bystanders see the problem, but believe nothing can be done about it. There is one more category of people needed today - the Actor. The actor is the activist who calls his/her congressperson to support comprehensive gun control reform. The actors are the family members who speak out at funerals and rallies, sharing their pain and their loss and asking that the violence end with their dead children. The actors are local lawmakers who push for better education, better healthcare, and better regulation to stem gun violence. It is time for all of us to join with Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence, a diverse coalition of denominations and faith-based organizations, to rally support for immediate legislative action to accomplish the following: 1. Every person who buys a gun should pass a criminal background check, including guns sold on-line, at gun shows and through private sales. 2. High-capacity weapons and ammunition magazines should not be available to civilians. There is no legitimate self-defense or sporting purpose for these military-style, high capacity weapons and magazines. They are, however, the weapons of choice for those who want to shoot and kill a large number of people quickly. 3. Gun trafficking should be a federal crime. Currently, prosecutions only happen through a law that prohibits selling guns without a federal license, which carries the same punishment as trafficking chicken or livestock. We also need to invest in mental health and public health support and in targeted investments and approaches from the Federal Government in areas most impacted by gun violence. People of all faiths should email or call your Senators and Congressperson and ask them to support legislation that will prevent guns from getting into the wrong people's hands. On the Jewish high holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we ask ourselves some very basic questions:  Who are we, as human beings?  Why do we exist?   We blow the Shofar (Rams horn) to awaken our souls, to face some difficult truths, to examine our actions and inactions and to change the path we chose to take from ""bystander"" to ""actor"". Following my sermon on gun violence on Rosh Hashanah, a member of the congregation asked if any of these actions could truly alleviate the crisis in our country.  The problem is too complicated, to entrenched for us to really make an impact.  I replied with the words of a great Jewish Rabbi philosopher, who pointed out, it is not the task of someone else ""over there"" to change what needs to be changed; it is our task.  And while we cannot necessarily complete the task, we are not free to abandon it.

454,http://www.nationalmemo.com/oregon-town-reels-from-classroom-carnage/,"By Eric M. Johnson and Courtney Sherwood ROSEBURG, Ore. (Reuters) – Residents of a quiet Oregon town struggled to comprehend the carnage left by the latest U.S. mass shooting as investigators puzzled over what drove a young gunman to kill nine people in a college classroom before he died in an exchange of gunfire with police. The Thursday late-morning shooting rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, a former timber town of 20,000 on the western edge of the Cascade Mountains, ranked as the deadliest mass killing this year in the United States. The gunman stormed into a classroom in Snyder Hall on campus, shot a professor at point-blank range, then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before he shot them one by one, according to survivors’ accounts. Seven people were hospitalized, three of them listed as critical. The killer died after exchanging gunfire with two police officers who confronted him. The gunman was not identified by local authorities, and Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin vowed never to utter his name. But a law enforcement source confirmed media reports naming the suspect as Chris Harper-Mercer, 26. In a photo posted on what was believed to be his MySpace profile, a young man with a shaved head and dark-rimmed eyeglasses stares into the camera while holding a rifle. “WE’VE BECOME NUMB” At the White House, a visibly angry President Barack Obama challenged Americans across the political spectrum to press their elected leaders to enact tougher firearms-safety laws. He lashed out at the National Rifle Association gun lobby for blocking reforms and lamented how common mass shootings had become. “Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine,” he said. “We’ve become numb to this.” Residents at an apartment house a short distance from campus where the suspect lived recognized him from photos and described him as edgy. A man identifying himself as Ian Mercer, the gunman’s father, spoke briefly to a throng of reporters and camera crews outside his home in Los Angeles on Thursday night. “It’s been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,” he said, according to a transcript provided by KNBC-TV. Authorities offered no motive for the shooting. Hanlin, the county sheriff, said an investigation was underway by homicide detectives and federal agents. Residents of Roseburg, about 260 miles (420 km) south of Portland, were left to ponder the how and why of the violence. “ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?” Accounts from survivors were chilling. Stacy Boylan, the father of an 18-year-old student who was wounded but survived by playing dead, told CNN his daughter recalled seeing her professor being shot point blank as the assailant stormed into the classroom. “He was able to stand there and start asking people one by one what their religion was,” Boylan said, relating the ordeal as described by his daughter. “‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them. … ‘If you’re a Christian, stand up. Good. Because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second,’ and he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line, doing this to people.” Scores of people huddled at a somber candlelight vigil in a park on Thursday night. “We need to start loving each other as people … or our nation is going to start falling apart,” said Michael Sprague, 35, a businessman who lives in the Roseburg area. The violence in Roseburg was the latest in a flurry of mass killings in recent years across the United States and the deadliest so far in 2015. It surpassed the nine killed in a gun battle between motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the nine who died in the rampage at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June. Not counting Thursday’s incident, 293 mass shootings have been reported this year, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The violence has fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and for better care for the mentally ill. Those grieving at Thursday night’s vigil said they were still trying to understand the tragedy. “You know, there’s all this stuff in the news and with politics going on about the Second Amendment and gun control,” said Ken Shemel. “It’s like, ‘Come on, guys, just give us a second to breathe,’ you know?” (Additional reporting by Jane Ross in Roseburg, Shelby Sebens in Portland, Curtis Skinner in San Francisco, Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Fiona Ortiz in Chicago, Jeff Mason and Robert Rampton in Washington, Dan Whitcomb, Piya Sinha-Roy and Daina Beth Solomon in Los Angeles and Katie Reilly in New York; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) Photo: People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon October 1, 2015.  REUTERS/Steve Dipaola Know first.

456,http://www.nationalmemo.com/oregon-sheriff-wrote-gun-control-is-not-the-answer-and-residents-agree/,"By Marisa Gerber, Los Angeles Times (TNS) ROSEBURG, Ore. — Carolyn Kellim’s upper lip snarled to the left at the mention of gun control. “I think that’s the worst thing in the world that can happen,” said Kellim, 86, who runs KC’s Exchange gun shop out of her home. The words “2nd Amendment” are pasted in a decal onto her front door and there’s a Rifle Range Street nearby. In Roseburg, deer antlers line people’s driveways and locals hardly notice the pop-pop-pop of gunfire from nearby shooting ranges. “This is hunting territory,” Kellim said, smiling proudly. Her views about guns — and who should be able to buy them — didn’t change, she said, when a gunman shot and killed nine people and wounded at least nine others at Umpqua Community College not far from her home. In Connecticut, state leaders called for stricter firearm laws after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. People in Tucson rallied behind then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who became a loud supporter of gun reform after surviving a 2011 shooting at a grocery store. And when a 22-year-old man stabbed and shot several students in California’s Santa Barbara County last year, one of the victims’ fathers, who grew up hunting, went on every national TV station that invited him and begged for stricter gun laws. The tone in Roseburg is different. An ex-girlfriend of a surviving victim scoffed at the idea of tightening gun laws, and Kendra Godon, an elementary education student who hid from the shooting in a nearby classroom, said she hoped her community’s tragedy wouldn’t get spun into the national debate about firearms. “That’s not the issue,” she said. John Hanlin, Douglas County’s sheriff and the public face of the community since the shooting, is also an outspoken critic of increasing gun control. On his work biography, the broad-shouldered lawman who once attended Umpqua Community College lists three interests: fishing, riding his Harley and hunting. When Vice President Joe Biden asked for stricter gun laws after the Newtown killings, Hanlin decided to speak up. He wrote Biden a letter. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote in a letter posted on the Sheriff’s Office’s Facebook page. He asked that Biden “NOT tamper with or attempt to amend the Second Amendment,” and informed the vice president he didn’t plan to enforce any laws he found unconstitutional. His deputies wouldn’t either. Around the same time, Hanlin — who keeps his gray hair cropped close on the sides and flat on top — shared a conspiracy theory video about the Sandy Hook shooting on his Facebook page. “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore … ,” the post read. “Watch, listen, and keep an open mind.” The post has been deleted and much of Hanlin’s account went private since the shooting, but the posting is saved in Internet archives. Asked about the video, the sheriff told CNN last week, “I know what you’re referring to, but that’s not a conspiracy theory that I have.” This spring, Hanlin testified before Oregon lawmakers about legislation requiring background checks for private gun sales. He argued that the measure — which has since become law — would keep guns from criminals about as much as laws keep methamphetamine out of the hands of drug addicts. “What I fear most,” Hanlin said, his face red, “is that we’re going to create criminals … out of some of our most ordinary, normal, law-abiding citizens.” Dennis Harper, 50, who works at an auto parts store near Umpqua Community College, said Hanlin’s views matched his own and those of most people in Douglas County. “He’s trying to protect everybody’s Second Amendment rights,” Harper said. “We’re in Oregon; that’s what we do.” At a prayer vigil Saturday, a local pastor said he was proud of Hanlin for leading a charge to avoid saying the shooter’s name. Several people in the crowd clapped and a woman shouted, “That’s my sheriff!” A sign outside a Roseburg barbershop read, “We stand with Sheriff Hanlin.” Since the shooting, Hanlin has steered clear of public critiques of gun control. Asked about his image as a Second Amendment advocate at a news conference Friday, Hanlin lowered his head. His lips tightened and he said his mind was consumed with the investigation. “Now is not an appropriate time to have those conversations,” he said. As Hanlin walked away, someone shouted one last question: “Sheriff, why does this keep happening in America?” Hanlin kept walking.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the community of (fill in the blank).” Now cue the gun lobby: “It’s too soon to discuss guns in the wake of (fill in the blank) mass shooting. To do so only politicizes these tragedies.” Then come the rote media questions: “Could laws have prevented this tragedy from happening?” And, “Why haven’t we seen any action since Sandy Hook?” It should alarm us that any time someone asks, “Did you hear about the school shooting?” we have to ask, “Which one?”' You know the drill. Given that there’s nearly one school shooting every single week in America, we all know it by heart. But this isn’t a drill. These are real lives being sacrificed to our nation’s lax gun laws and real families and communities affected by and left to deal with the aftermath. It should alarm us that any time someone asks, “Did you hear about the school shooting?” we have to ask, “Which one?” As a mother with three children in college and one in high school, I am constantly on alert for campus and school shootings – and it’s not paranoia: The mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, was the 142nd school shooting since Sandy Hook and the 45th school shooting in 2015. Many of these shootings don’t show up in the headlines. But guns are going off inside school buildings or on school or campus grounds with disturbing frequency -- once a week, on average. RELATED: Unacceptable: An unintentional child shooting every 36 hours And despite the pleas of the gun lobby and some lawmakers to hold off on any conversation about solutions to strengthen gun laws in the wake of preventable shooting tragedies, mothers across the country will never be silent again. Not after the shooting of 20 innocent first-graders in the sanctity of their classroom in Newtown, Connecticut. We refuse to let school shootings become an acceptable reality, and we will stop at nothing until our political leaders in Congress and in statehouses across the country stop asking students and teachers to stand up to gunmen so they don't have to stand up to the gun lobby. The rhetoric that nothing can be done is tired and wrong and pathetic. Obviously no one law will prevent every episode of gun violence, but we have a moral imperative to do more to protect our children from weak gun laws. And we will not let our children fall prey to gun laws dictated by the gun lobby that works toward putting more guns in more places with no questions asked. We must act to stop this carnage. While thoughts and prayers are needed and healing, the thoughts and prayers being offered in statements and on social media by pundits and lawmakers are not enough to stop the text messages that say, ""Mom, active shooter. Love you."" To drive real change on this issue, Americans must act, and we must act NOW. We must do more than posting about a shooting on social media. We must do more than say nothing will change or that stronger laws won’t work. Very simply, we must refuse to become numb to the gun violence that kills 88 Americans every single day and injures hundreds more. We must become educated about our state and federal gun laws. We must ask our elected officials, who are supposed to represent us, where they stand on guns. And we must hold them accountable for supporting stronger laws. Having founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America almost three years ago, I can tell you first-hand that since then, things are changing. Moms are fighting for sensible gun laws and policies, and we are winning. In the last three years, we've helped close background check loopholes in more than six states. We've pushed nearly a dozen states -- red and blue -- to pass laws that will help keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And we've influenced major restaurants and retailers -- like Starbucks, Chipotle and Target -- to adopt sensible gun policies to keep customers safe.

Fox News is reporting that Oregon Attorney General indicates the shooter is deceased. The shooter was reported to be a 26 year old male.

Trump talks about possible exit from ’16 field Donald Trump continues to lead the GOP presidential horserace -- see our new NBC/WSJ/Marist polls of the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But what happens if Trump suddenly exits the race in December or January? It’s not a far-fetched idea. “If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me 'cause you no longer have any interest in Trump because ‘he has no chance,’ I'd go back to my business. I have no problem with that,” Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” yesterday. Translation: If he’s not a sure bet to win the GOP nomination, he’ll get out, which would completely reshuffle the Republican race -- and which could benefit several different other Republican contenders. Jeb Bush? Marco Rubio? Ted Cruz? Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina? Trump replied on Twitter yesterday: “I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out? They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!” But notice that he didn’t deny this escape-hatch possibility. And it wasn’t the first time that he’s floated it, either (see his interview with CNBC’s John Harwood from last week). Just as his poll numbers decline a bit Trump’s declaration that he could possibly exit the GOP race comes as his poll numbers have declined, according to the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls we released yesterday. “In New Hampshire, Trump now holds a five-point advantage over Carly Fiorina among GOP primary voters, 21% to 16% -- followed by Jeb Bush in third at 11%, and Marco Rubio and Ben Carson tied at 10% each. But a month ago, Trump's lead over the nearest competition in the Granite State (John Kasich) was 16 points, 28% to 12%. And in Iowa, Trump is ahead of Carson by five points among potential GOP caucus-goers, 24% to 19% - with Fiorina in third at 8%, Bush at 7%, and Ted Cruz, Rubio and Bobby Jindal tied at 6%. A month ago, Trump's lead over Carson in Iowa was seven points in the same poll, 29% to 22%. Hillary leads in Iowa, while Sanders is ahead in New Hampshire Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls show that Hillary Clinton maintains her lead in Iowa, and Bernie Sanders is still ahead in New Hampshire. In Iowa, Clinton gets support from 47% of Iowa caucus-goers, while Sanders gets 36% and Martin O'Malley gets 4%. That's essentially unchanged from a month ago, when the poll showed Clinton ahead of Sanders by an identical 11 points, 48% to 37%. But Clinton's lead shrinks to five points when Vice President Joe Biden is added to the field -- Clinton at 33%, Sanders at 28% and Biden at 22%. And in New Hampshire, Sanders leads Clinton by nine points, 48% to 39%. That's essentially unchanged from a month ago, when Sanders was ahead 49% to 38%. Yet once again, Clinton loses ground when Biden is added to the contest -- Sanders sits at 42%, Clinton at 28% and Biden at 18%. In addition, the NBC/WSJ/Marist polls find that Sanders outperforms Hillary in hypothetical general-election matchups in these two battleground states. What Clinton told Savannah Guthrie So with Clinton trailing Sanders in New Hampshire, she sat down in the Granite State this morning for an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie -- and answered questions from town hall participants as part of “Today’s” Pancakes & Politics event. Asked by Guthrie about her poll standing in New Hampshire, Clinton answered, “I’ve got work to do in New Hampshire. I’m excited to be leading everywhere else… Bernie is a neighbor here; he represents Vermont.” Asked about her “SNL” appearance and why she often doesn’t come across as trustworthy and personable, Clinton replied that’s “not the nicest question” a politician wants to hear, because she believes she has a long record working for Americans. But she did admit that she’s a bit more reserved than some other politicians out there. And when Guthrie asked Clinton about her email controversy and if she’d be howling at Republicans for setting up their own private server, she fired back with this response: She never would have used a tragedy like the death of four Americans to make political hay. This is precisely why Kevin McCarthy’s comments from last week -- in which the likely next speaker of the House admitted that the Benghazi committee has set up to hurt Clinton’s poll standing -- were such a big deal. By the way, here’s our live blog of Hillary’s town hall event by NBC’s Carrie Dann. Hillary unveils gun-control proposals Also in New Hampshire today, Clinton is unveiling “a sweeping gun control proposal Monday that would include closing the ‘gun show loophole’ and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers, NBC’s Monica Alba reports. “Under the plan, which comes in the wake of a mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left 10 people dead last week, Clinton would tighten rules governing gun show and Internet sales using executive action ‘if Congress will not act,’ aides said. That includes the so-called gun show loophole, under which private gun sellers aren't required to perform background checks of buyers. She would also push to repeal a law backed by the National Rifle Association that prevents crime victims from suing gun manufacturers. And her proposal would revoke the licenses of ‘bad actor’ dealers who knowingly supply guns to straw purchasers and traffickers.” WaPo: Fiorina didn’t immediately pay staffers/consultants from her failed 2010 Senate run Turning to the rest of the 2016 field, don’t miss this tough Washington Post piece on Carly Fiorina: She didn’t pay some of her staffers from her failed 2010 Senate campaign. “Famed California pollster Joe Shumate was found dead in his home one month before Election Day 2010, surrounded by sheets of polling data he labored over for the flailing Senate bid of Carly Fiorina. Upon his death, Fiorina praised Shumate as ‘the heart and soul’ of her team. She issued a news release praising him as a person who believed in ‘investing in those he worked with’ and offering her ‘sincerest condolences’ to his widow. But records show there was something that Fiorina did not offer his widow: Shumate’s last paycheck, for at least $30,000. It was one of more than 30 invoices, totaling about $500,000, that the multimil­lionaire didn’t settle — even as Fiorina reimbursed herself nearly $1.3 million she lent the campaign. She finally cleared most of the balance in January, a few months before announcing her run for president.” The inevitable Bush vs. Rubio fight is here Don’t miss this piece by MSNBC’s Benjy Sarlin on the inevitable Bush vs. Rubio fight that has finally arrived. “Rubio, who has steadily improved in the polls since the last debate, is looking more and more like a threat to win the nomination as Bush’s campaign fails to reach escape velocity. Recognizing the danger, Bush has started to raise pointed questions about his old friend’s qualifications, portraying him as a promising protégé who needs more time in the minor leagues. Their jostling will likely determine who carries the establishment banner against Trump and outsiders like Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Ted Cruz.” TPP agreement is reached -- and it has big 2016 consequences Finally, here’s a significant development that will have 2016 consequences, per the Washington Post: “The United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations reached agreement Monday on the largest free-trade accord in a generation, an ambitious effort led by the Obama administration to knit together economies across a vast region. The deal capped more than five years of arduous negotiations on a project central to President Obama’s economic agenda and potentially hand him a legacy-defining victory late in his presidency.” The Washington Post adds that congressional ratification of the TPP trade accord will take place early next year -- just as the early presidential nominating contests begin.

A 5-month-old girl was shot to death while riding in a car with her mother in Cleveland. A man killed his wife and a good Samaritan then turned his gun on himself in north Florida. A security guard was allegedly killed by a co-worker in Atlanta. Teen-aged brothers were gunned down in broad daylight near a busy intersection in Fresno, California. A suspect in a Georgia shooting killed himself after a three-county car chase. The list of the Oct. 1 dead goes on and on: murders, suicides, workplace violence, domestic violence, street shootings, and drive-by gunfire. And there is nothing statistically unusual about it. RELATED: Gun control advocates: Don’t say nothing’s changed The most recent data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2013 an average of 92 people died in the United States each day of firearm-related injuries. Homicides accounted for about a third, and suicides most of the rest. More than twice as many are shot but survive. ""This is happening every single day in forgotten neighborhoods around the country,"" President Barack Obama said at a White House press conference Friday. The previous evening, reeling from news of a gunman's killing of nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Obama said the nation had become ""numb"" to gun violence. NBC News tracked down cases of two-dozen people who died from gun-related injuries on Thursday, the same day as the rampage in Oregon. Their stories portray a tragic, but perhaps typical, day in America. The victims included 5-month-old Aavielle Wakefield, who was riding in a car with her mother on Cleveland's east side Thursday night when a bullet, believed to have been shot from a nearby apartment building tore into her chest. She was the third fatal drive-by shooting of a child in the city in the past month, and her death nearly brought Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams to tears. ""We will stay on this as long as it takes,"" he said. ""We want bodies in jail tonight for this crime."" RELATED: The statistics surrounding gun violence in the US Williams said there were no leads yet in the investigation, in which prosecutors announced a $25,000 reward for information that leads to the killer's conviction. That same night, in Inglis, Florida, Walter Tyson, 57, allegedly opened fire on the lawn of a home, hitting his wife's boyfriend, Otis Ray Bean, police said. Bean survived. A good Samaritan, 68-year-old Walter Scott Terhune, tried to intervene, and Tyson shot him to death before entering the house and killing his wife, Patricia Tyson. Then the gunman shot himself. Much earlier, during the early morning shift at the Peachtree Tower apartments in the upscale Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, security guard Emmanuel Nwankwo, 23, was shot to death in the lobby. A fellow guard, 26-year-old Dexter Harper, was charged in the 5 a.m. killing. Later that morning, in Forsyth, Georgia, police found a man bleeding from several gunshot wounds. They chased the alleged shooter, Milton Terry Bowden, through three counties before forcing his car off the road. Officers then heard a single gunshot; Bowden had committed suicide. Around that time in Fresno, California, a shootout erupted in a busy intersection. Police arrived and found brothers Willie Ford, 19, and Denzel Ford, 18, dying from gunshot wounds. The motive, police said, was a falling out between the brothers and the 19-year-old gunman, who was arrested in a nearby apartment. That's just a small cross-section of Thursday's destruction, which also included young men shot dead on streets in Miami, St. Louis and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; a Pittsburgh kidnapping suspect who turned his gun on himself as police closed in on him; a bar fight in Toledo, Ohio; a murder-suicide in Cincinnati; and a suicide at an upstate New York gun range. On Friday, Williams, whose detectives are searching for whoever killed Aavielle Wakefield, urged the people of Cleveland to go beyond anti-violence marches and step forward to help find her killer, and those responsible for two recent drive-bys that claimed children. ""It's hard to stomach that,"" Williams said of the deaths. ""Because it's not for any reason that we can come up with. Not for any reason that any sensible person can come up with."" —NBC News' ML Flynn, Aliza Nadi, and Polly DeFrank contributed to this article, which first appeared on NBCNews.com. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2015-10-02 20:10:00,A sadly typical day for US gun violence,,359084,http://www.msnbc.com/#superglue

""It's just heartbreaking, it is sickening to me to see another massacre.""' Clinton made an impassioned appeal for action Friday at Broward College in Davie, Florida, to counter the influence of the powerful NRA. ""What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?"" Clinton asked, vowing to ""fight for new, effective gun control measures"" as president. ""It's just heartbreaking, it is sickening to me to see another massacre.

Now, I’m not justifying the fact that he’s coming in to rob the place, but you’ve got to be able to distinguish between somebody who’s trying to rob a joint and somebody who’s trying to kill you.” The Republican presidential candidate's story comes amid backlash over comments he made Tuesday, when he told ""Fox and Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade that he would have attacked the gunman if confronted with a scenario similar to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College last week, which left 10 dead and nine injured.

Some of the victims' families released statements, which were read by sometimes visibly emotional officials during Friday's news conference. Johnson ""was proud to be a Christian,"" his family said. His mother, Tonja Johnson Engel, added that both she and her son were ""proud"" that the 33-year-old had enrolled in school. ""They felt he had finally found his path,"" the statement said. Johnson Engel told NBC News on Friday that her son decided to continue his education after finishing a six-month drug rehabilitation program. This was Johnson's first week of school, she said. Cooper was also new to the school, as a freshman, and Thursday was his fourth day, his family said in a statement. Cooper and his older brother were ""inseparable,"" the family said. ""Our lives are shattered beyond repair,"" the family said. Eibel's family said it would take the time the 18-year-old spent alive to explain how ""amazing"" he was. The teen was active in Future Farmers of America and volunteered at Wildlife Safari and an animal shelter. He was studying chemistry at Umpqua, his family said. Anspach's parents, Justin and Kim, said the 20-year-old was ""the perfect son."" ""Treven was larger than life and brought out the best in those around him,"" they said in a statement. Levine was a retired school teacher, who returned to teaching at Umpqua and excelled at imparting knowledge to students, said his colleague, Malinda Benton. ""You couldn't find a classic he hadn't read and remembered,"" she said. Benton said Levine was an ""old-fashioned gentleman"" who would leave surprises in his coworkers' mailboxes — mushrooms for her, and fishing flies for another colleague who enjoyed angling. President Barack Obama on Friday ordered flags be flown at half-staff until sunset Tuesday in honor of the victims of the shooting.

And their positions are not much different than after previous mass shootings. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who once received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association for supporting the 1994 assault weapons ban, told NBC News that ""stripping law abiding people of their guns … I don't believe will get the job done."" Dr. Ben Carson said Friday in Iowa said early warning systems that identify a possible culprit need to be put in place. ""You're not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal law abiding citizens. It doesn't work for crazies,"" Carson said. RELATED: Kasich: ‘Stripping’ people of their guns won’t help On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Donald Trump called the situation ""horrible"" and noted that school shootings are ""sort of unique to this country"" but said inferred that there's not much that can be done. ""So it's a terrible situation, it's a huge mental illness. You're going to have these things happen and it's a horrible thing to behold,"" Trump said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in Iowa that ""there's really no evidence that these gun laws would prevent these shootings."" While campaigning in South Carolina, which witnessed the Charleston mass shooting, Carly Fiorina said that ""before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don't enforce the laws we have."" She points to the fact that the college was a gun free zone and the individual who committed the crime didn't abide. Fiorina also called President Barack Obama's remarks after the shooting ""premature at best and at worst a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy."" President Obama gave an impassioned news conference Thursday where he said, ""I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue - fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?"" ""Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize,"" Obama added. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton told Boston NBC affiliate WHDH that the shooting ""raises the urgency of the issue of gun control for me."" Enough is enough and the vast majority of Americans and even the majority of gun owners believe we should have universal background checks."" Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who supports gun ownership, said ""a comprehensive approach"" is needed, which includes mental health resources, reducing violence in the media and keeping guns away from ""people who should not have them.""

476,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-jeb-bush-was-talking-about-when-he-said-stuff-happens," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows GREENVILLE, South Carolina—Jeb Bush said calls for sweeping government rules and regulation often follow tragedies like the mass shooting this week in Oregon, but that such responses aren't always focused on the correct challenge. ""It's just heartbreaking to see these things,"" referring to Thursday's mass shooting, ""but this is -- this is the broader question of rule-making."" ""What we end up doing lots of times is we create rules on the 99.999% of human activity that had nothing to do with the tragedy that had forced the conversation about doing something,"" Bush said. ""Stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do,"" he added. RELATED: Obama: Inaction on gun violence is a political decision Bush made the comments during a broad conversation about the Constitution at an event in South Carolina where he emphasized the importance of protecting personal liberty, even after tragedy. He later clarified that his comments on limiting liberty were not directly related to the events in Oregon but a more general commentary on public tendency. ""Yeah, not related to Oregon,"" he said, adding, ""Just clarity here. Let’s make sure we don’t allow this to get out of control. There are all sorts of things that happen in life. Tragedies unfold. Look, just read the papers, and you see a child dies in a poll, is drowned, and parents want to pass a law to do something. And you got to be careful that you want to solve the problem. If there is a problem, a defect in the law, fine, then we did that all the time. But sometime you’re imposing solutions to problems that doesn’t fix the problem and takes away people’s liberty and rights and that’s the point I was trying to make."" As he has done after past shootings, Bush focused the cause more on mental health problems of a few rather than gun control for the many. ""No gun law necessarily is going to be able to deal with that, that is a sick person where there was no intervention in their lives to get them on the right course."" The Republican candidate said his philosophy on this issue is similar to his entire constitutional view which he said focuses on ""the bottom up"" with deference to states over the federal government. ""Maybe we ought to be more connected in our communities, maybe we ought to have a greater awareness of the mental health challenges that exist all across this country,"" he said. ""Maybe there's a better way to deal with this."" Asked about Bush's comments at a news conference Friday afternoon, President Barack Obama said, ""I don't even think I have to react to that one, I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting ... and they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening.'"" Responding to criticism, Bush's campaign issued the following statement late Friday: “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions.” This article first appeared at NBCNews.com © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2015-10-02 17:40:00,Bush on Oregon shooting: 'Stuff happens',,359084,http://www.msnbc.com/#superglue

On Monday, he wrote on Facebook, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday, he appeared on Fox & Friends, where he seemed to suggest that the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting should have responded differently to the heavily armed gunman. “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,” Carson said. “I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'” (Carson was apparently unaware of the story of Chris Mintz, an army veteran who did block the door between the shooter and a classroom full of people, suffering several gunshot wounds and two broken legs in the process.) On Wednesday, Carson doubled down on these controversial comments in an interview with CBS This Morning. “I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time,” he said. “That way, we don’t all wind up dead.” That brings us to Wednesday evening, when Carson appeared on a radio show and described an actual episode in which he was faced with a gunman. In Carson’s telling, he responded quite differently in this real-life scenario than he said he would have reacted if faced with a possible shooter. “I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye’s in Baltimore,” Carson told Sirius XM’s Karen Hunter. “[A] guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, ‘I believe you want the guy behind the counter.'” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Twittersphere pounced: @drewmagary Ben Carson at Ford’s Theater: “HE’S the President Mr. Booth” — Steak Knives (@Josh1938) October 8, 2015  It makes you wonder what Carson really would have done had he been in that classroom, staring down the barrel of a gun.

485,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/05/hillary-clinton-unveils-plan-for-tougher-checks-in-bid-to-reduce-gun-violence,"The Democratic presidential candidate says she would also roll back legal immunity for the gun industry as she attempts to seize the policy initiative First published on Mon 5 Oct 2015 05.00 BST Hillary Clinton has unveiled a series of proposals aimed at reducing US gun violence, including universal background checks, rolling back legal immunity for the gun industry, and legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. Clinton’s announcement follows yet another deadly mass shooting – the 44th this year at a school – at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Thursday.  The Democratic presidential candidate vowed to take on the National Rifle Association and gun lobby in the wake of the massacre, in which a gunman killed nine people and then himself. At a town hall in New Hampshire on Monday morning, Clinton said that she would work with Congress but she would also “look for ways as president to tighten some of these checks, particularly to get more of the background checks get done at gun shows and online than we currently have”. Clinton’s firearm proposals arrived as gun control moved to the forefront of the conversation in the Democratic race for the White House. Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley issued his own broad platform for reform on Sunday, while Vermont senator Bernie Sanders sought to position himself as a consistent supporter of gun safety measures despite having a mixed record on the issue. Under Clinton’s plan, background checks would be expanded to close loopholes for private sales at gun shows and online. Congress failed to act on legislation with similar aims after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Clinton, if elected president, would use executive action to deem any individual selling a significant number of firearms “in the business”, in order to hold private sellers to the same rules as gun retailers. She also proposed closing a so-called “Charleston loophole” – a reference to the shooting in June at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which the gunman was able to purchase a gun despite having a criminal record because if a background check takes longer than 72 hours a gun dealer can sell the weapon without the completed check. Clinton’s campaign said she would push to ensure that a gun sale does not go forward if a background check is not complete within three days. “Hillary Clinton lived in Arkansas and represented upstate New York – she knows that gun ownership is part of the fabric of many law-abiding communities,” her campaign said in a release. “But as a nation we can no longer allow guns to fall into the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the seriously mentally ill. It is a rebuke to the families that have lost loved ones, to the communities that are plagued by gun violence, and to this nation that we love.” According to a campaign fact sheet, Clinton would also call on Congress to repeal a federal statute signed by former president George W Bush that granted broad legal protections to gun manufacturers and dealers in both state and federal court. Citing the disproportionate number of deaths among young black males, Clinton’s campaign said she would also crack down on dealers who knowingly supply so-called straw purchasers – illegal sales in which someone buys a gun to deliver it to a third party – and traffickers with illegal weapons. Clinton, a longtime and staunch advocate for stricter gun laws, also embraced proposals to prevent domestic abusers and the mentally ill from acquiring firearms and backed classifying straw purchasing as a federal crime. The former secretary of state has repeatedly called for action against gun violence while campaigning across early voting states amid a series of high-profile shootings over the summer. Whether referring to the Emanuel AME Church massacre in June, the movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana in July, or the gunning down of two reporters during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Virginia last month, Clinton has refused to shy away from calling for gun safety measures and has condemned the influential gun lobby. Her rhetoric has grown sharper each time, and her frustration increasingly more visible. A day after the Oregon shooting last week, Clinton urged the American public to form a “national movement” against the NRA and similar gun rights activists. “What is wrong with us, that we cannot stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby, and the gun manufacturers they represent?” Clinton said while campaigning in Davie, Florida. “This is not just tragic. We don’t just need to pray for people. We need to act and we need to build a movement. It’s infuriating.” She added: “Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families.” Clinton’s proposals would face steep opposition from Republicans in Congress and would ostensibly require Democrats to regain control of both chambers. Republicans on Capitol Hill have insisted gun violence is a mental health issue and they led a filibuster in the Senate against the universal background checks bill in 2013. “We need universal background checks,” Clinton said at the New Hampshire town hall. “We know that they will work.” Republican presidential candidates are uniformly against any new restrictions on guns. Former governor Jeb Bush and senator Marco Rubio, both of Florida, told reporters at separate campaign events on Friday that new laws were not the answer. Real estate mogul and GOP frontrunner Donald Trump blamed the issue on mental illness, while referring to mass shooters in a Sunday interview as “geniuses in a certain way”. Clinton has chosen a bolder way forward on gun control, a hot-button issue that is rarely made a theme by presidential campaigns – apart from by Republican candidates on the other side of the argument touting their second amendment bona fides. O’Malley, who as Maryland governor signed into law one of the most comprehensive gun safety packages in the country, on Sunday called on both Clinton and Sanders to back provisions he had laid out. These included a requirement that every person who purchases a firearm obtain a license and is fingerprinted, making gun trafficking a federal crime, and a ban on assault weapons. Clinton has long supported an assault weapons ban, something signed into law by her husband Bill Clinton in 1994 but not reauthorized by Congress upon its expiration in 2004. While running for president in 2008, the former first lady said during a primary debate that she would seek to reinstate the ban if elected to the White House. Clinton also stood by her support of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines last summer while promoting her book Hard Choices. “We cannot let a minority of people, and that’s what it is, it is a minority of people, hold a viewpoint that terrorises the majority of people,” Clinton said at the time during a CNN town hall. Clinton’s press secretary, in a Twitter response to a Guardian reporter after this article was published, said her new plan included support for an assault weapons ban. Sanders has a more complex record on anti-gun violence measures. Although he voted to expand background checks after the Newtown shooting, the independent senator – who is running in the Democratic primary – voted against legislation establishing mandatory background checks known as the Brady Bill signed by Bill Clinton in 1993. Sanders also supported the law granting legal immunity to gun manufacturers. Reacting to the Oregon shooting in a Friday interview on MSNBC, the senator said he would support a ban on assault weapons and closing loopholes in the background checks system. Gun rights groups have already begun to sound alarms over a Hillary Clinton presidency and its implications for access to firearms. But the Democratic frontrunner reminded voters on Friday that she had been here before, referring to the former Clinton White House. “We took them on in the ’90s. We’re gonna take them on again,” she said. In a statement, Dan Gross, the President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a leading pro-gun control group, praised Clinton’s plan. “This is the type of bold leadership that we have been missing in Washington,” said Gross. “Just four years ago it seemed unthinkable that a major presidential candidate would make gun violence prevention a cornerstone of his or her platform. We applaud Hillary Clinton for standing up to the gun lobby and for her vision to protect the people and nation she hopes to represent as president.” Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Washington",2015-10-05 13:53:13,Hillary Clinton unveils plan for tougher checks in bid to reduce gun violence,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

But studies have found several ways to reduce the current annual toll of 30,000 gun deaths — from universal background checks to smart policing. By
      
        Peter Aldhous Last updated on October 2, 2017, at 1:11 p.m. ET Posted on October 2, 2015, at 11:35 a.m. ET In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, on the Las Vegas Strip, everyone is asking once again: What can be done to reduce the toll of gun violence? Two years ago, after a mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, BuzzFeed News asked researchers who have devoted their careers to studying gun violence. Their answers were encouraging: Saving thousands of lives every year is an achievable goal. But meeting that challenge will require both conservatives and liberals to look beyond their usual knee-jerk reactions. It's not a simple question of gun rights versus gun control. This, with some small updates, is what the experts had to say. Here is a sobering fact: The number of Americans who died from gunshot wounds in the last decade — more than 300,000 — exceeds the nation's total combat fatalities in World War II. Gun deaths in the U.S. today are almost as frequent as deaths from traffic accidents, as this graph shows. Yet the United States isn't an especially violent country, judged by statistics on general assaults. It's the rate of gun deaths, specifically, that outstrips that of any other developed nation. When you look across rich countries, those with higher rates of gun ownership tend to have higher gun homicide rates. Put simply, people with guns seem to kill people at higher rates than people armed with less efficient killing machines. The big problem is that no policy that stands any chance of being implemented in the United States is likely to make a big dent in the huge numbers of guns that are already in circulation — as many as 310 million, or nearly one for every U.S. resident. The Second Amendment is a reality, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to bear arms operates at the level of the individual, not just the ""well regulated militia."" So whatever gun control advocates would like to do, the government is not going to come and take away people's guns en masse. What's more, some of the gun controls that are often proposed probably wouldn't achieve very much. After the Newtown School shooting in December 2012, President Barack Obama called for a reinstatement of a federal ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault weapons that lasted for a decade, ending in 2004. Congress did not oblige. And while that decision had more to do with the influence of the gun lobby than the scientific evidence, studies of the earlier ban's effects by Christopher Koper of the University of Pennsylvania found no strong indication that it reduced gun deaths. If anything, he concluded in a report to the Department of Justice, ""gun attacks appear to have been more lethal and injurious since the ban."" Police and rescue workers respond to the Las Vegas shooting. Enthusiasm for bans on the sale of especially lethal weapons stems from the context in which the debate over gun violence comes to the fore — in the wake of mass shootings, where shooters arm themselves to inflict maximum casualties. Even though mass shootings come around with distressing regularity — and seem to be getting more frequent — they barely register in the overall statistics on gun deaths in America. In 2012, the deadliest year for mass shootings in three decades, according to data compiled by Mother Jones, 72 people died in incidents including the Newtown massacre and the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Casualty reports from Las Vegas mean that 2017's toll may be even higher. Every one of those deaths is a personal tragedy, but in the context of some 30,000 annual fatalities from gunshots across the nation, they are drops in a vast ocean of suffering. The best evidence on how to prevent mass shootings comes from Australia. In 1996, after 35 people were killed in a massacre in Tasmania, Australia banned a range of weapons including semi-automatic and pump-action rifles and shotguns. Income tax was hiked so the government would have the money to buy back the now-illegal weapons, and the results were striking: There had been 13 mass shootings in 18 years before the new controls, but no similar incident in the decade that followed. The Second Amendment makes it unlikely that the Australian experiment could ever be repeated in the United States. ""It is so far beyond anything that is going to happen,"" Philip Cook, a gun violence researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News. Among the gun violence experts consulted by BuzzFeed News, the most popular policy was the introduction of universal background checks, intended to keep guns out of the hands of people disqualified through their criminal records or mental health issues. (A comprehensive review of gun violence studies, published in January 2017, confirmed that background checks and laws that require a permit to purchase firearms seem to be the most effective policies.) Under federal law, these checks are required each time a registered dealer sells a gun. But they're not required for private sales, which may account for 40% of the trade. It's a loophole that you can drive busloads of firearms through. Eight states, including California and New York, have implemented universal background checks, including for private sales. But it's been hard to judge the success of these moves, because changes to gun laws tend to be introduced in packages, making it difficult to know which policy, if any, was responsible for any subsequent changes in gun violence. However, legislative changes in Connecticut and Missouri, which went in opposite directions, have provided a clearer picture. Until 2007, Missouri required people buying a gun to have a permit issued by law enforcement, which was contingent on passing background checks. Over the five years that followed without this requirement, the state's annual gun murder rate rose by 16%, according to a study from a team led by Daniel Webster of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Neighboring states saw no similar spike. Connecticut introduced a similar permit-to-purchase law, again with background checks, in 1995. In this case, Webster's team estimated that the law reduced gun homicides by 40%. Some of the strongest evidence on reducing gun violence comes not from controls on gun purchases, but from an approach to policing called ""focused deterrence."" Pioneered in the 1990s in Boston, where it was called ""Operation Ceasefire,"" this involves police and community leaders meeting with members of criminal groups and delivering the message that their identities are known and that gun crime won't be tolerated. Then come efforts to help people out of criminal activity, with the clear understanding that law enforcement will crack down hard on the targeted individuals if they use their guns. Since rolled out in dozens of other cities, repeated studies have shown that the approach can reduce urban gun violence — typically by between 20 and 40%. In the wake of almost every mass shooting — especially if it occurs in a location where people aren't supposed to carry guns — gun lobbyists tell us that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And over the years, the main reason given for gun ownership in surveys of the U.S. public has shifted from hunting to personal protection. But the evidence suggests that gun ownership actually does little to make people safer. Analyzing 14,000 incidents involving personal contact between perpetrator and victim from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health and economist Sara Solnick of the University of Vermont found that a gun was brandished in self-defense on only 127 occasions. And doing so didn't reduce the likelihood that the victim would be injured — although it did lessen the chance of property loss. The idea that gun ownership deters crime also looks shaky when subjected to close scrutiny. Again using data from the NCVS, Cook found in an earlier study that burglary rates tend to be higher in counties with higher rates of gun ownership. The reason for the relationship wasn't clear, but one possibility is that guns themselves are valuable commodities, motivating criminals to steal them. The conversation about how to reduce gun deaths tends to focus on homicides. But for every gun murder, there are almost two gun suicides. And while gun homicides have been in decline since the early 1990s, firearm suicides are on the rise. The demographics of these two categories of gun deaths are very different. Young black men are disproportionately likely to be both victims and perpetrators of gun murder. Those who turn firearms on themselves are again mostly male, but are typically older and white. ""Firearm violence is increasingly becoming an old white guy problem,"" Garen Wintemute, an emergency room doctor at the University of California, Davis, told BuzzFeed News. So any attempt to seriously reduce gun deaths needs to keep firearms out of the hands of people who are most vulnerable to self-harm. If they can't get their hands on a gun, chances are that someone desperate enough to consider killing themselves will survive: The fatality rate for suicide attempts overall is around 9%; but where a firearm is used, that rises to 85%. Encouragingly, background checks seem to help prevent gun suicides, as well as reducing gun murders. Webster and his colleagues have calculated that Connecticut's permit-to-purchase law reduced firearm suicides by 15.4%, while Missouri's repeal of its law increased its gun suicide rate by 16.1%. It's easy to blame gun violence on mental illness, especially in the wake of a mass shooting by a highly disturbed individual. But this is based on a misunderstanding of the wider problem. Epidemiological studies have found that people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are somewhat more likely to be violent than healthy people. But the vast majority of mentally ill people are never violent to others — and even if the risk posed by mentally disturbed people could be reduced to the average level for the general population, about 96% of the violent crime in America would still occur. Far more powerful is the link between mental illness and gun suicide. ""If we were to cure mental illness, the suicide rate would go down by 50 to 75%,"" Jeffrey Swanson, a gun violence researcher at Duke University, told BuzzFeed News. The federal Gun Control Act, passed in 1968, prohibits gun ownership by people who have been involuntarily committed for treatment for psychiatric illness, and those judged to be ""mentally defective."" The problem is that these restrictions are both too broad and too narrow. In particular, many people at high risk of harming themselves have never been committed involuntarily for treatment. Another problem is that the federal mental health restrictions on gun ownership are lifelong. This fails to recognize that suicidality comes in episodes — which usually pass, if the urge is not acted on. What we should do, according to Swanson, is to recognize when people's behaviour indicates that they are at immediate risk of harming themselves or others, and temporarily restrict their access to guns until they have recovered. Some states have introduced laws that try to do this. In California, people who are deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others can be held in a mental health facility for 72 hours, and since 1990 this has triggered a five-year ban on possessing guns — which can be curtailed earlier though a court petition. We're still waiting for conclusive studies on the effectiveness of such restrictions, Swanson said. ""It will be a while before there's enough experience with these laws to say whether they've worked."" buzzfeed.com Updated to include information on the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas and a January 2017 review of scientific studies.

08 October 2015  The sheriff of Douglas County in Oregon where a mass shooting occurred on Oct. 2 is in hot water after the discovery that he posted a ""Sandy Hook truther"" video to Facebook in 2013. Now, a new study casts doubt on the psychology blamed for belief in such conspiracy theories. Contrary to popular opinion, the research finds, people who think conspiratorially aren't more likely to assume everything happens for a reason, rejecting the likelihood of random chance, than people who don't hold conspiracy beliefs. ""What we show is that the psychology of conspiracy theories is located in a rather high level of cognition, perhaps at the level of beliefs and ideology and not at the level of a deeper personality or perception mode,"" said study researcher Sebastian Dieguez, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories] The spread of conspiracies In the Sandy Hook shooting, 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Almost immediately after the news broke, conspiracy theorists, some calling themselves Sandy Hook truthers, began claiming that the shooting never really happened, and that the supposed bereaved parents were hired actors. Similar conspiracy theories have sprouted up over other high-profile shootings, including the August on-air killing of a television reporter and cameraman in Virginia and the October shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. A common theory for why people believe in these sorts of conspiracies is that they can't accept that, sometimes, bad things happen for no good reason. In other words, they're primed to see patterns everywhere — and, in fact, find it comforting to think that someone's in charge when tragedy strikes. A few indirect studies bolstered this notion, including a 2008 study showing that people who felt they had less control were more likely to believe in conspiracies than people who felt more in control of their lives. But no one had ever tested the link between a rejection of randomness and conspiracy belief directly, Dieguez told Live Science. ""It was not clear whether 'nothing happens by accident' is something conspiracy believers say or whether it's how they think,"" he said. ""That's what we wanted to test, whether this is a rather deep psychological disposition they have."" Accepting randomness The researchers conducted three very similar studies in which they asked participants to look at randomly generated strings of X's and O's and gauge how ""truly random"" each was. In two of the experiments, participants were told that they were on the hunt for a cheater who was supposed to write down the results of a coin flip, but just wrote results without actually flipping the coin. In one experiment, the X's and O's were presented without any suggestion of human intentionality behind them. The first two experiments involved 107 and 123 psychology students, respectively, and the third involved 217 French speakers recruited online. Each participant filled out a survey about their conspiracy beliefs, which they were told was part of a separate study. Then the researchers looked for a link between people's perceptions of randomness and their conspiratorial mindset. They found nothing. ""This finding, although it's a negative finding, was actually pretty interesting, because in our study we had very strong findings [otherwise],"" Dieguez said. ""Pretty much everything worked except the main hypothesis that we wanted to test."" Complex conspiracies The researchers found that people are actually quite good at detecting random-seeming character strings (as determined by a mathematical algorithm). They also found something that other scientists have noted, which is that people who believe in one conspiracy theory tend to believe in many conspiracy theories, even those that have nothing to do with each other (or even contradict one another). Someone who believes the moon landing was faked, for example, is likely to believe that Princess Diana was deliberately murdered. But the researchers couldn't find evidence that a deep-seated need to see patterns is linked to conspiracy beliefs. [10 Persistent Kennedy Assassination Theories] Other modes of thought have been linked to the conspiratorial mindset. Anxiety is one. ""Anomia,"" feelings of powerlessness and distrust, is another. People who believe in conspiracies also seem prey to the conjunction fallacy, which is a cognitive ""oops"" that involves believing that a more specific thing is more likely than a general one. This bias was illustrated in a 1974 paper with the ""Linda problem,"" which describes a 31-year-old single woman interested in social justice and anti-nuclear protests. It then asks whether it's more likely that a) Linda is a bank teller, or b) Linda is a bank teller and an active feminist. Mathematically, it has got to be more likely that A is truer than B. There is always a greater likelihood that one thing will happen than that two independent things will happen. If, for example, there's a 1 in 10 chance that Linda is a bank teller, A has a 10 percent chance of being true. If there's also a 5 in 10 chance that Linda is a feminist, the likelihood that she is a bank teller as well is 5/10 times 1/10, or 5/100 — only a 5 percent chance. But because B seems more descriptive of a person like Linda, people often fall prey to thinking B is more likely than A. Ultimately, the new research — published Sept. 21 in the journal Psychological Science — suggests that conspiracy thoughts are complex and subject to outside factors, Dieguez said. ""It shows that, well, perhaps conspiracy theories are really associated with ideology, with our worldview, and not really to more basic cognitive factors,"" he said.

The Oregon shooter bought his guns legally. So did the Roanoake, Virginia shooter. The Tucson shooter passed a background check. The Aurora, Colorado shooter bought all of his guns legally.
Hillary blamed the Charleston shooter’s ability to buy a gun on a “loophole in the Brady Bill.” It wasn’t a loophole in the law; it was that local and FBI officials simply didn’t do their job correctly:

On April 11, Roof tried to buy a handgun at a store in West Columbia, S.C. And under normal procedure, that paperwork was assigned to an examiner at the FBI’s unit in West Virginia. The unnamed FBI examiner turned up Roof’s arrest on March 1 on a felony drug charge — but the system did not show a conviction, and it wasn’t enough to deny the purchase.
So she kept checking. And, Comey said, the first mistake comes in here. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the Lexington County, S.C., sheriff’s office as the arresting authority. The examiner then reached out to the sheriff’s office and prosecutors in Lexington for more information.
The sheriff’s office told her the Roof case was not theirs and advised her to check with police in Columbia, S.C.
And now, Comey said, the second mistake was made. The examiner consulted a contact sheet for local contacts in Lexington County, and didn’t see anything for Columbia. So she called West Columbia, where Roof allegedly tried to buy the gun, instead. Local authorities in West Columbia said they had no record of the case, and the examiner turned to other matters while she waited to hear from prosecutors.
Under the normal process, if gun dealers do not hear back from the FBI with a flat denial in three business days, they are free to sell the weapon to the person who filled out the biographical paperwork. And that’s what the gun store did with Roof on April 16.

Hillary’s mention of the gun show loophole generated automatic applause. Again, none of the mass shooters above obtained their firearms at gun shows. Hillary repeated the oft-debunked “40 percent of guns  are sold without a background check” statistic, a figure that stems from a 1994 study of 251 people. Blame NBC’s Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist had a responsibility to ask Hillary how any of the laws she suggested would have stopped the Oregon shooting. They didn’t. Hillary never seems to get those kinds of questions in her infrequent appearances for questions from the media. Meanwhile, the man who had as much ability to shape the Oregon shooter as anyone else, his father, blames guns. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

493,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/02/obama_on_shootings_only_voters_can_stop_carnage.html,"President Obama, in what has become the grimmest routine of his presidency, beseeched Americans Thursday evening to transform yet another mass shooting into a rallying cry for “modest” new gun regulations. “This is something we should politicize,” Obama said during emotional, at times angry remarks in which he quoted himself, and then challenged his conservative critics and gun-law opponents head-on. Expressing sorrow and angst for grieving victims and their families for the 15th time during his presidency following a domestic shooting incident, this time in Oregon, the president voiced exasperation with Congress, irritation with the news media, and determination to campaign for new laws he said a president cannot accomplish alone, but which require the collective will and “courage” of voters, including gun owners. In Roseburg, Ore., officials said 10 people died and at least seven were injured Thursday when a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College. The suspect, identified as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, was declared dead after exchanging gunfire with authorities. The president, speaking in the White House briefing room, did not wait for the public identification of the suspect or the victims before repeating his conviction that additional gun restrictions he did not specify would spare American families from what he called “carnage” that has become so commonplace, it has rendered the public “numb.” “We don’t know why he did what he did,” Obama said, after noting he had visited the “good people” residing in Roseburg in the past. “It’s fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations might me,” he said, walking head-long into a debate about whether mental illness or guns are to blame for mass murders committed by young men. In arguing that federal and state regulation of guns would prevent future murders, Obama again compared the United States to developed countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, where he said tighter gun restrictions reduced mass shooting statistics. And he challenged the news media to publish statistical comparisons between domestic deaths tied to terrorism and mass deaths committed by troubled killers with guns. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is not enough,” Obama said, at times wandering away from his prepared text, now achingly familiar to his speechwriters. He said his critics argue, correctly, that as president he seeks to politicize the issue. “But this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic,” he said. He said American voters bear some responsibility if they believe action focused on guns in Congress and within state legislatures could save lives. “This is a political choice that we make,” he argued, “to allow this to happen every couple of weeks.” “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and save lives, and to let young people grow up, and that will require a change of politics on this issue,” he said. “Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody,” Obama said, gun safety and control issues “should be a relevant factor in your decision.” At the start of his second term, Obama and Vice President Biden unsuccessfully pushed to enact tougher background checks and assault weapons restrictions through Congress. Despite increased mass shootings nationwide and struggles to understand their causes, the Senate blocked legislation. “We’ve become numb to this,” Obama said, raising his voice as he listed numerous sites of U.S. mass shootings during his two terms. “What’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation … `We need more guns,’ ‘fewer gun safety laws,’ they’ll argue. Does anybody really believe that?” Obama asked. “There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country; they know that’s not true.” While the president sought to rally Americans to ask lawmakers to act, Republican candidates seeking to succeed him expressed little appetite for gun legislation. Ben Carson, who is currently polling in the top tier of GOP aspirants, reacted to the Oregon murders during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Prior to Obama’s remarks, the retired neurosurgeon said, “Obviously there are those who are going to be calling for gun control. But that happens every time we have one of these incidents,” Carson said. The focus on guns is misplaced, he said. “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.” Jeb Bush, reacting to Oregon’s events via Twitter, said he was “praying” for victims and their families and called the murders a “senseless tragedy.” Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also a GOP presidential candidate, offered prayers. RealClearPolitics political reporter Rebecca Berg contributed to this report.

494,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/09/the_more_you_politicize_guns_the_weaker_your_case_becomes_128356.html,"After the horrific mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, President Barack Obama made an impassioned case that gun violence is ""something we should politicize"": ""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" Everything in that statement is wrong. What happened in Oregon is tragic, and the nation should comfort families and look for reasonable and practical ways to stem violence, but there is only one murderer. Now, if government somehow bolstered, endorsed or ""allowed"" the actions of Chris Harper-Mercer -- as it might with, say, the death of 10,000-plus viable babies each year or the civilian deaths that occur during an American drone action -- a person could plausibly argue that we are collectively answerable as a nation. Then again, when the president asserts that Americans are collectively answerable, what he really suggests -- according to his own broader argument -- is that conservatives who've blocked his gun control legislation are wholly responsible. The problem with that contention, outside of the obvious fact that Republicans never condone the use of guns for illegal violence (in fact, these rampages hurt their cause more than anything), is that Democrats haven't offered a single bill or idea (short of confiscation) that would impede any of the mass shootings or overall gun violence. This is not a political choice, because it's likely there is no available political answer. For the liberal, every societal problem has a state-issued remedy waiting to be administered over the objections of a reactionary Republican. But just because you have a tremendous amount of emotion and frustration built up around a certain cause doesn't make your favored legislation any more practical, effective or realistic. It doesn't change the fact that owning a gun is a civil right, that the preponderance of owners are not criminals or that there are 300 million guns out there. And if it's a political argument you're offering -- and when hasn't it been? -- you'll need more than the vacuousness of ""this is bad, so we have to do something."" That's because anti-gun types are never able to answer a simple question: What law would you pass that could stop these shootings? Many liberals see the Second Amendment as tragically misinterpreted or useless and guns as abhorrent, so they do not believe that any legislative imposition is a trade-off -- even an ineffective law. Many conservatives view guns as a civil right, so this is an unacceptable trade-off. Some don't even view mass shooting as primarily a gun problem. Now, that doesn't mean guns have nothing to do with it, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it well responding to a Slate piece: ""One can simultaneously believe that the high volume of firearms contributes to our high homicide rate and that these laws aren't good ideas. It's actually pretty easy to believe both of these things at once, since none of the regulations at issue would do much at all to reduce our high volume of firearms."" Jeb Bush took a lot of heat for asserting that ""stuff happens"" (out of context). Now, horrific stuff happens, and we should do what we can, balanced with a host of other concerns, to stop these shootings. But it's worth pointing out that less stuff has been happening. Despite all the Obama administration's fearmongering and as horrifying as any shooting is, gun violence has precipitously declined over the decades without any meaningful federal law being enacted. This most likely tells us there are a number of other social currents driving this kind of violence. The left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills -- because no person can be evil. So the debate takes on the same old contours, and we focus on firearms and nothing else. That kind of political debate only makes it less likely that anything good will happen. When we politicize a tragedy, it is immediately sucked into a broader ideological conflict. Then conservatives (at least when out of power) will see (rightfully, I believe) an intrusive agenda that is a perpetual slippery slope. (Can you blame them when they hear this? ""No, we don't want confiscation, but look at what the Australians did! They confiscated guns. We don't want confiscation, but isn't that Second Amendment interpretation so stupid?!"") Trust me, it's not unreasonable to treat liberal policies as if they have a tendency for mission creep and unwieldy expansion.

In the wake of Thursday’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, many Republicans were quick to dismiss renewed calls for increased gun safety measures, in favor of discussing the need for a stronger mental health care system. On Sunday, John Oliver agreed that mental health is a topic Americans need to properly address. But as he explained on the latest Last Week Tonight, broaching mental health issues in the aftermath of a mass shooting is more often than not a political strategy used to simply reroute the conversation away from gun control. “It seems like there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest in mental health,” Oliver said, while featuring the talking points of Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee—all of whom steered away from discussing increased gun control legislation after the shooting in Oregon, to tout the need for better mental health programs. In reality, this is dangerously problematic because, as Oliver explains, “the vast majority of mentally ill people are nonviolent, and the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally-ill people.” But if Republicans are only willing to talk about treating mentally ill people following mass shootings, so be it: Then at the “very least we owe them a fucking plan,” Oliver said.

Mark FollmanNovember/December 2015 issue Soon after the school year started in September 2000, a police officer working at McNary High in Keizer, Oregon, got a tip about a junior named Erik Ayala. The 16-year-old had told another student that “he was mad at ‘preps’ and was going to bring a gun in.” Ayala struck the officer as quiet, depressed. He confided that “he was not happy with school or with himself” but insisted he had no intention of hurting others. Two months later, Ayala tried to kill himself by swallowing a fistful of Aleve tablets. He was admitted to a private mental health facility in Portland, where he was diagnosed with “numerous mental disorders,” according to the police officer’s report. To most people, Ayala’s suicide attempt would have looked like a private tragedy. But for a specialized team of psychologists, counselors, and cops, it set off alarm bells. They were part of a pioneering local program, launched after the Columbine school massacre the prior year, to identify and deter kids who might turn violent. Before Ayala was released from the hospital, the Salem-Keizer school district’s threat assessment team interviewed his friends, family, and teachers. They uncovered additional warning signs: In his school notebooks, Ayala had raged about feeling like an outsider and being rejected by a girl he liked. He had repeatedly told his friends that he despised “preps” and wished he could “just go out and kill a few of them.” He went online to try to buy a gun. And he’d drawn up a hit list. The names on it included his close friend Kyle, and the girl he longed for. The threat assessment team had to decide just how dangerous Ayala might be and whether they could help turn his life around. As soon as they determined he didn’t have any weapons, they launched a “wraparound intervention”—in his case, counseling, in-home tutoring, and help pursuing his interests in music and computers. “He was a very gifted, bright young man,” recalls John Van Dreal, a psychologist and threat assessment expert involved in the case. “A lot of what was done for him was to move him away from thinking about terrible acts.” As the year went on, the team kept close tabs on Ayala. The school cops would strike up casual conversations with him and his buddies Kyle and Mike so they could gauge his progress and stability. A teacher Ayala admired would also do “check and connects” with him and pass on information to the team. Over the next year and a half, the high schooler’s outlook improved and the warning signs dissipated. When Ayala graduated in 2002, the school-based team handed off his case to the local adult threat assessment team, which included members of the Salem Police Department and the county health agency. Ayala lived with his parents and got an IT job at a Fry’s Electronics. He grew frustrated that his computer skills were being underutilized and occasionally still vented to his buddies, but with continued counseling and a network of support, he seemed back on track. The two teams “successfully interrupted Ayala’s process of planning to harm people,” Van Dreal says. “We moved in front of him and nudged him onto a path of success and safety.” But then that path took him to another city 60 miles away, where he barely knew anyone. This past August, I traveled to Disneyland to join more than 700 law enforcement agents, psychologists, and private security experts from around the country at the annual conference of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals. While families splashed in the Disneyland Hotel’s pools and strolled to the nearby theme park, conference attendees sat in chilly ballrooms for sessions like “20 Years of Workplace Shootings” and “Evil Thoughts, Wicked Deeds.” After a day of talks focused on thwarting stalkers and preventing the next Sandy Hook, it seemed incongruous to emerge to throngs of overexcited kids and their weary parents enjoying the nightly fireworks. But it is no coincidence that Disney plays host to this conference. As gun rampages have increased, so have security efforts at public venues of all kinds, and threat assessment teams can now be found everywhere from school districts and college campuses to corporate headquarters and theme parks. Behind the scenes, the federal government has ramped up its threat assessment efforts: Behavioral Analysis Unit 2, a little-known FBI team based in Quantico, Virginia, now marshals more than a dozen specialists in security and psychology from across five federal agencies to assist local authorities who seek help in heading off would-be killers. Those calls have been flooding in: Since 2012, the FBI unit has taken on more than 400 cases. The conference keynote was given by Reid Meloy, a tall, white-haired forensic psychologist from the University of California-San Diego who is a leading researcher in the field. His presentation was peppered with gallows humor—a clip from Breaking Bad, a photo of Jack Nicholson “playing himself” in The Shining—and professional koans. “Monitor your own narcissism,” he warned the assembled investigators. “This is going to be easier for some of you to get than others,” he quipped, flashing an image of Donald Trump. There was a simple reason, Meloy suggested, for the record number of people packing the room: Mass murder is on the rise. “We’ve seen this very worrisome pattern over the past five or six years of an increase in targeted violence in public places,” he told me later. “Personally and professionally, this is a big concern—that uptick is very important, especially as violent crime has decreased.” Threat assessment is essentially a three-part process: identifying, evaluating, and then intervening. A case usually begins with a gut feeling that something is off. A teacher hears a student’s dark comments and alerts the principal, or someone gets freaked out by a coworker’s erratic behavior and tells a supervisor. If the tip makes its way to a local threat assessment team, the group quickly analyzes the subject’s background and circumstances. They may talk with family, friends, or coworkers to get insight into his intentions, ability to handle stress, and, most importantly, potential plans to strike. “One of the first things you focus on with this process is access to weapons,” Meloy notes. Like the group that handled Ayala’s case, the team draws on mental health and security expertise. Possible responses range from helping the subject blow off steam and refocus on school or work to providing longer-term counseling. If violence seems imminent, involuntary hospitalization or arrest may be the safest approach. But such drastic measures are rare. “With a lot of these cases, you peel back the curtain and there are good social and mental health interventions that are diverting the person onto a better course,” Meloy says. Often the best initial step is the most direct—conducting a “knock and talk” interview, which has the dual benefit of offering help and putting the subject on notice. Simply realizing that authorities are watching can be an effective deterrent. Threat assessment requires a remarkable shift in thinking for law enforcement because in most cases no crime has occurred. “Our goal is prevention over prosecution,” supervisory special agent Andre Simons, who led the FBI unit until this summer, explained when we met at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington earlier this year. “If we can facilitate caretaking for individuals who are not able to perceive alternatives to violence, then I think that’s a righteous mission for us.” Ever since Columbine, the FBI has been studying what drives people to commit mass shootings. Last fall it issued a report on 160 active-shooter cases, and what Simons could disclose from its continuing analysis was chilling: To a much greater degree than is generally understood, there’s strong evidence of a copycat effect rippling through many cases, both among mass shooters and those aspiring to kill. Perpetrators and plotters look to past attacks for not only inspiration but operational details, in hopes of causing even greater carnage. Emerging research—including our own analysis of the “Columbine effect“—could have major implications for both threat assessment and how the media should cover mass shootings. In October 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Simons’ FBI unit had helped prevent almost 150 attacks in one year. The nearly two dozen experts I spoke with didn’t like to be so definitive, noting that it’s impossible to prove a negative. But many cited cases in which they believed threat assessment teams had prevented great harm. Sergeant Jeff Dunn, who leads the Los Angeles Police Department’s Threat Management Unit, described a firefighting recruit who became enraged when he failed out of the academy. “He told another recruit, ‘When they fire me, I’m gonna come back here and fucking massacre everyone.'” Academy officials alerted the LAPD, and Dunn’s unit got a search warrant for the recruit’s home. “This guy was absolutely geared to go to war,” Dunn said. His arsenal included nearly a dozen semi-automatic handguns and assault rifles and a homemade explosive device. “Had there not been an intervention of some sort,” Dunn said—in this case, an arrest on a felony weapons charge—”I have no doubt that it would’ve resulted in an active-shooter scenario.” But cases often aren’t so clear. One of the biggest challenges for threat assessment teams is that sometimes the quieter, less outwardly threatening subjects can prove the most dangerous. “When there are individuals who prompt a sense of anxiety or fear but no law or policy has been broken,” Simons says, “that’s the real work.” Of the hundreds of subjects tracked by the FBI unit, he told me, only one went on to injure somebody. But measuring the effectiveness of threat assessment is tricky because ultimately there is no way of knowing whether someone would have otherwise gone on to attack. Meloy compares the challenge to fighting cardiovascular disease: Doctors can’t predict whether someone will have a heart attack, but they can do a lot to decrease the risk. “You try to lower the probability.” When the next shooting happens at a school, an office building, or a movie theater, the question will again be asked: “What made him snap?” But mass murder is not an impulsive crime. Forensic investigations show that virtually every one of these attacks is a predatory crime, methodically planned and executed. Therein lies the promise of threat assessment: The weeks, months, or even years when a would-be killer is escalating toward violence are a window of opportunity in which he can be detected and thwarted. A growing body of research has shed light on this “pathway to violence.” It often begins with an unshakable sense of grievance, which stirs thoughts about harming people and leads to the planning and preparation for an attack. Elliot Rodger, convinced that women were unfairly denying him sex, seethed for months and fantasized about a “day of retribution” before he bought firearms, scouted sorority houses, and went on to kill 6 people and injure 14 others near Santa Barbara, California, in May 2014. A confluence of behaviors can indicate that someone is poised to walk into a school or a shopping mall and open fire. These include an obsession with weapons, a fixation on images of violence, and a history of aggressive acts that aren’t directly related to the planned attack—possibly a way for the perpetrator to test his resolve. Almost a year before Rodger struck, he attempted to push some women off a 10-foot ledge at a house party. Some killers have mutilated pets before going on rampages. In fact, the vast majority of mass shooters signal their intentions in advance, though usually not directly to their intended targets. This “leakage,” as threat assessment experts call it, can be difficult to recognize. Before Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, he told a friend about his desire to kill people and start a race war. (The friend claimed he didn’t think Roof was serious.) Weeks before Rodger attacked, he posted disturbing videos that prompted his mother to alert a county mental health agency that he was suicidal. In response, sheriff’s deputies went to Rodger’s apartment to do a welfare check, interviewing him just a few strides from where he’d stashed three handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He persuaded them he was fine. “Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped,” he later wrote, “and the police never came back.” We know that many mass shooters are young white men with acute mental health issues. The problem is, such broad traits do little to help threat assessment teams identify who will actually attack. Legions of young men love violent movies or first-person shooter games, get angry about school, jobs, or relationships, and suffer from mental health afflictions. The number who seek to commit mass murder is tiny. Decades of research have shown that the link between mental disorders and violent behavior is small and not useful for predicting violent acts. (People with severe mental disorders are in fact far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.) That’s why sizing up a suspect’s current circumstances is crucial: Did he recently get fired from a job? Did he lose his kids in a nasty custody battle? Is he failing out of school or abusing drugs? Investigators also look for visible signs such as deteriorating hygiene or living conditions, which is why approaching someone directly and building rapport can be so important. “Most people who have a psychotic episode aren’t thinking violently,” explains Mario Scalora, a forensic psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. But for those who are experiencing psychosis—including 80 percent of stalkers who target public figures—intervention can head off disaster. Scalora describes the case of a student he calls Bob who experienced a psychotic break in his early 20s. Scalora’s campus threat assessment team grew concerned after getting a tip about Bob muttering to himself and making ominous comments. They sent plainclothes detectives to his residence, where on the wall of his room hung a grotesque theater mask whose mouth had been sewn shut with black string. Bob said that voices were commanding him to hurt people at the behest of God, and that he was scared. The detectives persuaded him to check into a psychiatric ward for evaluation. “This made him feel cared for,” Scalora says, “and gave us a mechanism by which we could continue to manage him. By building rapport with him, we’re learning a lot about him and getting rich assessment data, and in the meantime he’s not stalking people on our campus. It’s a win-win.” When the lead detective followed up with Bob a couple of days into his hospital stay, he asked her, “Can you go to my room and get the mask, and this big knife that’s under my bed? I don’t want them anymore.” The concept of cops and mental health experts working hand in hand to stop violent crimes before they occur is relatively new. Its origins trace in part to a summer morning in West Los Angeles. Shortly after 10 a.m. on July 18, 1989, a 21-year-old actress named Rebecca Schaeffer was getting dressed for a meeting with Francis Ford Coppola about a role in the next Godfather movie when her apartment buzzer sounded. The intercom was broken, so Schaeffer went to the front door, where a young man stood holding a shopping bag. Nineteen-year-old Robert Bardo had been trying to reach Schaeffer for two years, writing her fan letters and periodically taking a bus from Tucson to LA to look for her. He’d never been able to get onto the soundstage where Schaeffer filmed the sitcom My Sister Sam, but he’d finally found her address. Bardo had already dropped by that morning, according to his own account, and Schaeffer had chatted with him politely. But now she was anxious. “You came to my door again,” she said. “Hurry up, I don’t have much time.” Bardo later recalled, “I thought that was a very callous thing to say to a fan.” In his bag he had a letter and a CD he wanted to give her. He also had a .357 Magnum handgun. A neighbor heard Schaeffer scream as Bardo fired a single shot into her chest.  Until then, obsessive behavior that could turn violent was still widely viewed as a mental health issue beyond the purview of law enforcement, even after the attacks on John Lennon and Ronald Reagan and a spate of government workers “going postal.” But Schaeffer’s murder shocked Holly­wood, and studio heads called for action by the LAPD, which was already frustrated by its inability to stop a string of stalking murders of nonfamous women. The LAPD devised a plan for a multidisciplinary team that would aim to head off such crimes. The LAPD Threat Management Unit’s mission expanded in 1995 after a city electrician, angry about a poor performance evaluation, walked into the Piper Tech center downtown and shot four supervisors to death. “Piper Tech” became shorthand for the rising wave of workplace threats the unit began to confront. (It currently handles about 200 cases a year, roughly half of which are workplace related.) Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, the Secret Service had also been developing tenets of threat assessment, led by a former agent from Reagan’s security detail. But for most cops, close collaboration with mental health experts remained unheard of. And the idea of intervening before there was a crime to investigate went against everything they knew from their training. “It requires a paradigm shift,” says the LAPD’s Dunn. “So many in law enforcement don’t recognize how useful a tool this can be.” Then came Columbine. As they plotted for months to slaughter their classmates, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold weren’t just driven by rage and depression—they wanted to be immortalized and to inspire future school shootings. In diary entries and videos, the duo fantasized about Hollywood directors fighting over their story. They filmed themselves firing guns and yelling into the camera about killing hundreds and starting a “revolution.” Such “legacy tokens” now often include manifestos posted online by perpetrators. “They do this to claim credit and to articulate the grievance behind the attack,” says the FBI’s Simons. “And we believe they do it to heighten the media attention that will be given to them, the infamy and notoriety they believe they’ll derive from the event.” There has long been evidence that stalkers and mass murderers emulate their famous predecessors. Before Bardo gunned down Schaeffer, he sent a letter to Mark Chapman, imprisoned for the 1980 murder of John Lennon. When Bardo fled from Schaeffer’s building, among the items he discarded was a copy of The Catcher in the Rye, the novel Chapman infamously sat down to read after shooting Lennon. John Hinckley Jr. had a copy of the book and a John Lennon photo calendar in his hotel room when he tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Forensic psychologists describe this phenomenon as following a “cultural script,” or the “Werther effect,” referring to a spate of copycat suicides in 18th-century Europe after the publication of Goethe’s novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. The Columbine killers authored a grimly compelling new script at the dawn of the internet age. Sixteen years later, the Columbine legacy keeps reappearing in violent plots, driven in part by online subcultures that obsess over the duo’s words and images. “It’s a cult following unlike anything I’ve ever seen before,” says one longtime security specialist. To gauge just how deep the problem goes, Mother Jones examined scores of news reports and public documents and interviewed multiple law enforcement officials. We analyzed 74 plots and attacks across 30 states whose suspects and perpetrators claimed to have been inspired by the Columbine massacre. Law enforcement stopped 53 of these plots before anyone was harmed. Twenty-one plots evolved into attacks, with a total of 89 victims killed, 126 injured, and 9 perpetrators committing suicide. The data reveals some disturbing patterns. In at least 14 cases, the suspects aimed to attack on the anniversary of Columbine. (Twelve of these plots were thwarted; two attacks ultimately took place on different dates.) Individuals in 13 cases indicated their goal was to outdo the Columbine body count. And in at least 10 cases the suspects referred to Harris and Klebold as heroes, idols, martyrs, or God. At least three suspects made pilgrimages to Columbine High School—fulfilling the kind of “pseudocommando” mission that researchers have found mass shooters to be obsessed with. Two of them carried out rampages when they returned home—one at a college in Washington state and the other at a high school in North Carolina, using guns he’d decorated with pictures of the Columbine shooters. In another case, a 16-year-old from Utah flew to Denver without his parents’ knowledge, hired a driver to take him to Columbine, and met with the principal under the auspices that he was writing an article for his school newspaper. He was trying to elicit information on lasting trauma, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the case. “All he wanted to know about was what the students and staff felt like—how long it took them to recover and if they still thought about it,” the official says. The teen was arrested back home for plotting with a fellow student to bomb his own high school. These publicly documented cases are just the beginning. “There are many more who have come to our community and have been thwarted,” says John McDonald, the director of security for Colorado’s Jefferson County school district, where Columbine High School is located. “They want to see where it happened, want to feel it, want to walk the halls. They try to take souvenirs.” Some aspiring copycats have even come from overseas, says McDonald. “The problem is always on our radar.” Gene Deisinger, a threat assessment pioneer who led Virginia Tech’s police force from 2009 to 2014, explains that the copycat effect also plays out at sites like Virginia Tech and Fort Hood. “Lots of the places that have experienced high-profile acts of mass violence over the last decade or more face ongoing threats from outsiders who identify with the perpetrators, the acts, or the places,” he says. Major attacks motivate copycats in other ways. In April 2009, Jiverly Wong blocked the back exit of the building in upstate New York where he’d taken English classes and then used guns similar to those of the Virginia Tech shooter to kill 14 people and wound four others before shooting himself. “There was evidence that he had studied the attack at Virginia Tech,” a federal law enforcement official told me, “looking at the chaining of the doors there that had prevented both entry and exit.” It’s not just Americans who emulate the killers of Columbine or Virginia Tech. Shooters inspired by these events have struck in Brazil, Canada, and Europe—particularly in Germany, where nine school shootings occurred in the decade after Columbine. At least three German shooters drew inspiration from Harris and Klebold, including an 18-year-old who referred to them as God and attacked his former school wearing a long black coat and wielding two sawed-off rifles, a handgun, and more than 10 homemade bombs. When I asked threat assessment experts what might explain the recent rise in gun rampages, I heard the same two words over and over: social media. Although there is no definitive research yet, widespread anecdotal evidence suggests that the speed at which social media bombards us with memes and images exacerbates the copycat effect. As Meloy and his colleagues noted earlier this year in the journal Behavioral Sciences and the Law, “Cultural scripts are now spread globally…within seconds.” In late August, this phenomenon reached its logical next step when a disgruntled former TV reporter gunned down two former colleagues during a live broadcast in Virginia while filming the scene on a camera. As he fled, he posted the footage on Twitter and Facebook. The first “social media murder” went viral in less than 30 minutes, raising the grim prospect that others will aim for similar feats—knowing that the news media will put them in the spotlight and help publicize their grisly images. (The 26-year-old who would go on a rampage at Umpqua Community College in Oregon five weeks later reportedly commented online about the Virginia shooting, “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”) But just as digital media has created platforms for dangerous people seeking a blaze of notoriety, it has also become a valuable tool for identifying them. “We’re now seeing that shooters are announcing more frequently via social media just prior to attacking,” Simons says, noting that potential killers can otherwise be conspicuously withdrawn. “When people express violent ideation, what we’re looking for is: Who are they talking to? Who’s listening?” These days, he adds, “it’s possible they’re living more vividly online than in the physical world.” Erik Ayala could barely sleep. He hadn’t worked for months. He hardly ever talked to his two high school buddies anymore, even Mike, with whom he now shared an apartment in Portland. In the three years since he’d moved there in 2006, he’d struggled to hold down a job or find a girlfriend. Now 24 years old, he was no longer in touch with the teams who had watched over him in his hometown for nearly five years. He had become increasingly withdrawn and often holed up in his bedroom playing Resistance: Fall of Man and other first-person shooter games. On the morning of January 24, 2009, Ayala scribbled a note apologizing to his family and bequeathing his PlayStation 3, his car, and what little remained in his bank account to Mike. “I’m sorry to put all this on you buddy,” he wrote. “I know it’s not much consolation but as my friend and roommate you are entitled to everything that I own. Good luck in this fucked-up world.” Then he grabbed the 9 mm semi-automatic he’d bought two weeks earlier at a pawnshop and headed downtown. Just before 10:30 p.m., a group of teens waited in line outside the Zone, an all-ages dance club. Ayala didn’t know anyone at the club, but to him it was a hangout for the kinds of kids he despised. In a matter of seconds Ayala fatally shot two teenage girls and wounded seven people, most of them also teenagers. As a security guard moved toward him, Ayala put the barrel under his chin and pulled the trigger one last time. It was the worst mass shooting in Portland’s history. Experts also cite it as a prime example of both the promise of threat assessment and its limitations. “Ayala ended up acting out his ideas from high school on a similar, if not the same, target population almost a decade later,” Van Dreal says. That may suggest the two Oregon teams prevented Ayala from going on a rampage when he was younger, but it also reflects the daunting challenge of managing a potentially dangerous person over the long haul. Even if a troubled kid can be turned away from violence, how do you ensure he becomes a well-adjusted adult? What happens when he moves beyond the reach of those who have helped him? When is a case really over?  Others have fallen through the cracks, including James Holmes, who underwent threat assessment and psychiatric care at the University of Colorado-Denver before he dropped out, cut ties with the school, and carried out the movie theater massacre in Aurora. Jared Loughner, who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011, had been booted out of Pima Community College after its threat assessment team looked at his disruptive behavior. Many mental health professionals still lack the training to evaluate potentially deadly people, says Deisinger, who is a psychologist as well as a cop. And they may be resistant to threat assessment’s tactics and urgency. “There’s nothing more frustrating than hearing people say there’s no way to stop these mass shootings from occurring,” says Russell Palarea, a forensic psychologist and veteran of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service who now consults for private corporations. Like many in his field, Palarea believes the key is helping more people understand what threat assessment is and how it works—similar to the “see something, say something” campaign meant to help foil terrorist attacks. “The methodology is in place,” he says. “We just need to train the public, law enforcement, prosecutors, hospital clinicians, and other professionals on their roles in helping to manage the threats.” The science behind threat assessment is still young, but it is attracting growing interest; last year the American Psychological Association launched the Journal of Threat Assessment and Management. The ranks of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals are rising, and since Sandy Hook, more corporate leaders have taken an interest in the strategy. Three states—Virginia, Illinois, and Connecticut—now mandate threat assessment teams in their public colleges and universities. Virginia was the first to do so (after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007) and now also requires them in all K-12 public schools. (Read more about its model here.) But should a huge investment in threat assessment really be our only serious effort to stop mass shootings? Australia, another frontier culture with a deep attachment to guns, endured a slew of mass shootings starting in the 1970s. After a disturbed young man killed 35 people and wounded 18 others in 1996, the country invested heavily in gun buybacks and enacted stricter gun laws. Suicides and murders with guns declined dramatically, and Australia has had only one public mass shooting in the two decades since.  Possession of a firearm, of course, is not a meaningful predictor of targeted violence. But at the conference in Disneyland, virtually everyone I spoke with agreed that guns make these crimes a lot easier to commit—and a lot more lethal. “There are so many firearms out there, you just assume everybody has one,” Scalora says. “It’s safer to assume that than the opposite.” The presence of more than 300 million guns in the United States—and the lack of political will to regulate their sale or use more effectively—is a stark reality with which threat assessment experts must contend, and why many believe their approach may be the best hope for combating what has become a painfully normal American problem. In a sense, threat assessment is an improvisational solution of last resort: If we can’t muster the courage or consensus to change our underlying policies on firearms or mental health care, at least we can assemble teams of skilled people in our communities and try to stop this awful menace, case by case. Kyle Alexander remembers how he and Erik Ayala met as freshmen in the high school marching band: They were both introverts who loved video games and commiserated about being misfits. Hours before Ayala carried out his attack in Portland, his roommate, Mike, called Alexander, who was living in Seattle. “He’d found the note and he sounded very frantic,” Alexander recalls. “He wanted to see if I knew Erik’s whereabouts.” Alexander was worried but didn’t know what he could do from so far away. Mike was also at a loss. “At the time we thought Erik was just going through another bad cycle of depression,” Alexander says. “We never saw it coming.” Only recently did Alexander learn the full details of Ayala’s case, including that he had once been on Ayala’s hit list. “It was surprising, and scary to think about,” he says. “Erik would go through very dark moods, but given the special relationship we had I was often able to help him turn things around.” Alexander wishes he’d stayed closer with Ayala after high school. “The social relationship piece of it is big,” he says. “I think it could’ve made a difference in his life.” Alexander is now 32 years old and lives in Salem, Oregon, where he works as a school psychologist. He is trained in threat assessment and works with school-based teams in his district. His passion is helping at-risk kids.

(Photo: DonkeyHotey) Last week, Jeb Bush went on record as publicly dismissing the need for reining in the lethal legacy of a fanatical gun culture and rampant gun ownership in the United States. He was speaking in response to the Oregon mass shooting at a community college, in which nine students were executed. As an article in The Washington Post reported, ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think that more government is necessarily the answer to this,"" he said. ""I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's just, it's very sad to see. But I resist the notion -- and I did, I had this, this challenge as governor, because we have, look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Bush was speaking at a forum hosted by The Conservative Leadership Project, a group with ties to South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who moderated the event. His comments came the day after a shooter at an Oregon community college killed nine before being killed by police. Several others are recovering from injuries. When a reporter asked Bush whether the remark was a mistake, he replied: ""No, it wasn’t a mistake, I said exactly what I said, explain to me what I said wrong."" It would be easy to dismiss Jeb's callous belittling of a mass shooting as a reassurance to the NRA, which is a key financial and voting-block supporter of presidential candidates. After all, when Jeb was governor of Florida, he gave the NRA pretty much whatever it asked for in terms of signing pro-gun legislation. In fact, it was Jeb Bush who signed the infamous and racist Stand Your Ground law in Florida. As an NBC News article recalls, ""With major support from the National Rifle Association under a Republican state legislature during Gov. Jeb Bush's administration, Florida became the first state to enact a Stand Your Ground law on Oct. 1, 2005."" It was, of course, the Stand Your Ground law that was the basis of George Zimmerman being acquitted of stalking and shooting Trayvon Martin to death, for nothing more than walking while Black. After killing Martin, Zimmerman also escaped charges in a number of domestic violence incidents, signed autographs at gun shows and engaged in ongoing racist tweets. Most recently, he accused President Obama of having a lot in common with Christopher Harper Mercer, the Oregon shooter. Just a short time ago, Zimmerman proudly retweeted a photo of Trayvon Martin's body. Jeb Bush is not directly responsible for the killing of Trayvon Martin, or the violent actions and racist words of George Zimmerman. Still, Jeb signed the Stand Your Ground law knowing the racist motivations of the NRA. More significantly, Jeb and the politicians in his family have long perpetuated the institutional racism embodied in US culture - and particularly advocated by the Republican Party - including unqualified support for current policing policies. Jeb Bush recently exposed his core attitude toward the Black electorate when he boasted that Republicans would be a better choice for African-American voters, because Democrats just offer ""free stuff."" Columnist Charles Blow of the New York Times wrote of Jeb's remark, There it is! If you let people talk long enough, the true self will always be revealed. Not only is there a supreme irony in this racial condescension that casts black people, whose free labor helped establish the prosperity of this country and who were systematically excluded from the full benefits of that prosperity for generations, as leeches only desirous of “free stuff,” this line of reasoning also infantilizes black thought and consciousness and presents an I-know-best-what-ails-you paternalism about black progress. This brief commentary can only offer a peek behind the veil of the Bush family's affirmation of both guns and institutional racism. However, Jeb has explicitly endorsed his brother's and father's use of militarized violence during their administrations, to further the goal of expanding and protecting US empire. He even claimed that the Iraq War was a good decision. In fact, Jeb boasts about the military actions of his brother and father when prodded by reporters. The Bush policy of killing in the name of empire extends from US-sponsored wars and massacres in Central America during the Reagan-Bush administration to the countless deaths and displacements of people in the Middle East resulting from the invasion of Iraq. Of course, it shouldn't be forgotten that George Herbert Walker Bush was head of the CIA when Operation Condor – in which the military dictatorships of South America's Southern Cone nations were responsible for the torture, deaths and disappearance of tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists and leftists - was at its height, with covert US support. No, you cannot hold Jeb accountable for the involvement of his father and brother in militarized violence that has resulted, directly and indirectly, in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. However, you can judge him based on his support of the US's role as a militarized superpower, which regularly disregards the deaths of people around the world - not just deaths in domestic shootings such as the one in Oregon. Because, as Jeb noted, ""Stuff happens."" Not to be reposted without permission of Truthout.  Is democracy dissolving before our very eyes? Donate to order this gift now!

499,http://www.nationalmemo.com/bush-familys-war-on-english/,"And the Bush family’s War on English continues. You are, by now, familiar with the astonishingly tone-deaf response by Jeb Bush, the nation’s would-be 45th president, to last week’s shooting at a community college in Oregon in which a gunman killed nine people. “Look,” said Bush, “stuff happens.” Like a stink bomb in the flower bed, the dismissive-sounding words were buried in a longer comment about whether this latest massacre should spur new legislation. Said Bush: “…I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this … I had this challenge as governor, because we had … look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” When a reporter asked about the wording afterward — perhaps trying to spare Bush some grief — the former Florida governor turned attitudinal. “No, it wasn’t a mistake,” he said. “I said exactly what I said. Explain to me what I said wrong.” “You said, ‘stuff happens,'” said the reporter. Whereupon, Bush hunkered deeper into his snit. “‘Things’ happen all the time,” he said. “‘Things.’ Is that better?” Um … no. And the pasting that followed was entirely predictable. Bush was slammed by Hillary Clinton and President Obama. In Mother Jones, the liberal magazine, his words were called “callous.” In Salon, they were dubbed “tactless, graceless and ham-handed.” But let’s not miss what’s truly offensive here. At one level, after all, this is just a new round of the gaffe gotcha game where you strip clumsy language of inconvenient context so as to imply the candidate said or meant something he never said or meant. So let’s be fair: Bush was not being callous toward the Oregon tragedy any more than Barack Obama was denying small businesspersons their due when he said, “You didn’t build that.” Rather, Bush simply offered an inarticulate statement of GOP orthodoxy: There are no legislative responses to mass gun violence. And while that’s a point some of us would dispute, it is not what makes his words appalling. No, what makes them appalling is the surrender they imply. “Stuff happens”? That’s what you say about the hurricane or the earthquake, the hail storm or the flood, natural disasters beyond the power of humankind to prevent. It’s what you say about cancer or Alzheimer’s or dog droppings on the lawn, the major and minor challenges that are an inescapable part of being alive. To say “stuff happens” about a mass shooting is to suggest that mass shootings are somehow inevitable and unavoidable. But that is simply not true. This “stuff” doesn’t happen everywhere — not with the numbing frequency it does here. It doesn’t happen like this in Great Britain. It doesn’t happen like this in Brazil. It doesn’t happen like this in Israel. It doesn’t happen like this in Japan, where gun ownership is strictly restricted, nor in Canada, where gun ownership laws are more liberal and there are, by one count, about 10 million firearms in private hands. Ten million. Yet, you know how many gun homicides there were in Canada in 2013? A hundred and thirty-one. Even as we mourn this latest mass murder, another is taking shape. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week. That’s how predictable this “stuff” has become. So it would behoove us to try and figure out what other countries know that we do not, what it is about our laws and/or our national character that returns us inevitably to this nexus of tragedy and recrimination week after week. You see, Bush is only half right. It is not that “stuff happens.” No, stuff happens here. (Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald, 1 Herald Plaza, Miami, Fla., 33132.

500,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/20/donald-trumps-on-second-amendment-protecting-that-freedom-is-imperative-n2054625,"Last Friday, The Donald released his position paper on Second Amendment rights–and it wasn’t too bad. In fact, any freedom loving, gun rights supporter would support it. The vast majority of what’s in this policy paper is good. Mr. Trump voices his support for national right to carry, reforming our mental health system, ending gun-free zones on military bases and recruitment centers, and fixing the background check system.  He also called magazine and assault weapons bans ""total failures."" On background checks, Trump noted that we should do more to incorporate criminal and mental health records. The majority of states already provide mental health information to the National Instant Background Check System. The issue regarding expanding background checks to prevent the mentally ill from obtaining firearms is navigating through due process, the right to privacy, patient-doctor confidentiality, and constitutional rights to make sure this process is fair, legal, and effective. Not every person with mental illness commits a mass shooting, though the mentally ill tend to make up the lion share of mass shooters. Moreover, not every mental illness or disorder should prohibit a person from owning firearms. I don’t think Asperger’s syndrome is something that should prevent someone from exercising his or her Second Amendment rights. This is a huge part of the debate that the pro-gun control seems to view as anathema. Additionally, what if a person voices his plans to commit mass murder on any social media platform out there. Eliot Rodgers did so, he even wrote about it. It became so disturbing that authorities went to his residence to check up on him. Does law enforcement have the right to ask the person if he has firearms when they make threats of violence on social media (normal people don’t do this)? I’m leaning towards yes, but there the due process portion (again) remains to be debated. As for national right to carry and the end of gun-free zones on military bases, the Donald is right. On the Project Exile portion, in which he voices support for a mandatory minimum sentence on those prohibited persons who use a firearm in a crime, the results of the program were not as shining as the policy paper lays out. Moreover, Gun Owners of America noted that the record of success was mixed. As for the opposition for a new assault weapons ban, I’m glad the Donald has seen the light, though any gun owner and Second Amendment supporter should be wary. Trump supported an assault weapons ban (including other policies that place his diametrically opposed to the conservative movement) and longer wait periods for gun purchases prior to his decision to run for president, but Dr. Ben Carson and Gov. Chris Christie aren’t the strongest Second Amendment supporters either. Overall, on paper, Mr. Trump voices support for what most in the Second Amendment community agree upon, but is it authentic?   BACKGROUND CHECKS. There has been a national background check system in place since 1998. Every time a person buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer – which is the overwhelming majority of all gun purchases – they go through a federal background check. Study after study has shown that very few criminals are stupid enough to try and pass a background check – they get their guns from friends/family members or by stealing them. So the overwhelming majority of people who go through background checks are law-abiding gun owners. When the system was created, gun owners were promised that it would be instant, accurate and fair. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case today. Too many states are failing to put criminal and mental health records into the system – and it should go without saying that a system’s only going to be as effective as the records that are put into it. What we need to do is fix the system we have and make it work as intended. What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system. NATIONAL RIGHT TO CARRY. The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That’s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving – which is a privilege, not a right – then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege. MILITARY BASES AND RECRUITING CENTERS. Banning our military from carrying firearms on bases and at recruiting centers is ridiculous. We train our military how to safely and responsibly use firearms, but our current policies leave them defenseless. To make America great again, we need a strong military. To have a strong military, we need to allow them to defend themselves.

501,http://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/425025/hillarys-server-smoking-gun-jonah-goldberg,"Follow Us National Review EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg’s weekly “news”letter, the G-File. Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays. Dear Reader (including Kevin McCarthy, who may be too busy putting a cast on his Boehner, having stepped on it so badly), I feel like Donald Trump when asked to list all the reasons why he’s terrific; I have no idea where to begin. Lots of stuff has happened since my last “news”letter. Rather than approach this blank page with the sort of planning and care that you’ve come to expect from this well-crafted digital epistle, I’m going to throw care to the wind and, like Bill Clinton at a Saudi harem, I’m going to just jump right into it. Don’t Move On Speaking of Bill Clinton, by the end of his presidency, whenever critics said anything critical of him, the almost instantaneous response from his praetorians was to say (1) the critics  were “obsessed” or “haters” and (2) that it was time to “move on.” People forget that MoveOn.org began as a kind of non-partisan, No Labels-y, bit of marketing claptrap designed to make the Lewinsky scandal seem like old news. It was a mass-marketing version of the liberal habit of saying “the time for debate is over” — something liberals never say when the debate is politically helpful to them. Of course, once the country did in fact move on, MoveOn revealed what was always obvious to all of us “obsessed” “haters”: It was an entirely partisan, left-wing operation from soup to nuts. (Speaking of which, I wish someone would run for president under the name “Soup.” That way when writing about the polls I could write, “There’s a lot of interesting things happening among the really unconventional candidates from Soup to Deez Nuts.”) So it was of some small interest when I saw the coordinated response from Hillary’s posse immediately after her Meet the Press interview last Sunday. Here they all are, spontaneously saying the same thing: “time to move on.” What was so amusing was how they all seemed to pretend that this wasn’t a coordinated spin operation. Unfathomable Affection We all know the old rule of thumb for anyone who gets involved with Bill Clinton: “Get yourself tested.” A slightly less-well-known saying about Hillary Clinton: “There are no coincidences.” She didn’t just have a lucky run in the cattle-futures market, her billing records didn’t just show up in the West Wing, and Dorothy’s house didn’t simply land on her sister because of a freak accident. I’m sorry, that joke was uncalled for. But you do have to wonder what blind people think of Hillary Clinton when all they have to go by is that voice and that laugh. #share#Anyway, I’m really not obsessed with Hillary Clinton. In fact, one of the points I’ve been hammering like a zombie skull (if all I had to fight off zombies was a hammer) is that Hillary Clinton suffers from a charisma deficit, and by “deficit,” I mean a yawning chasm of charismalessness that descends into Stygian darkness to the point where if you dropped a stone — or even a 1978 AMC Pacer — into that metaphysical null set of charm, you would hear nothing but the subtle shushing of the wind as it vanished into the bottomless abyss. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton can be both fascinating and infuriating because he’s so damn smart. His ruthless ability to yoke both the angels and the demons swirling around him to the chariot of his political ambition makes him a worthy subject for biographers, psychologists, and secret monastic orders looking for signs of the End Times. So while Hillary holds no fascination for me whatsoever, Hillary adoration is endlessly intriguing. It is the Bronyism of the political world. (For those of you who don’t know what Bronies are, I’m sorry. After you click on this link, whatever esteem you had for mankind will be at least a little smaller. I think even the pope would allow a flicker of doubt of God’s plan after looking at it.) Look, she’s not dumb or weak. She’s not without talents. But, when I read, say, Lanny Davis’s suck-up e-mail to her — an e-mail of such profound sycophancy that it can really only be described in the vernacular of proctology — it makes me think of the “familiars” from the Blade movies. In the Blade universe, familiars are human servants of vampires, who will do anything to one day be rewarded with eternal life. Clinton’s sycophants aim a good deal lower. Lanny Davis wrote this: I consider you to be the best friend and the best person I have met in my long life. You know that from the dedication and appreciation of you I have always felt and expressed to you over four decades. And he even threw in this: Please please please * note there are *three pleases*: *Do not be bashful or concerned about saying no to my request. And here’s the amazing part: She still said no! Now, I’ve been through some rough moments in my life and my friends have been there for me (“I know you’re not talking about me” — The Couch). I’m not saying they’d take the rap for me if I killed someone or forgive me if it was revealed that I was the guy who cancelled Firefly. But you’d have to go pretty far down the list of my friends into the territory of Friendly Acquaintance Land, People I Held the Elevator Door Forsylvania, and Friends of Friends Whose Car I Puked In On Spring Breakstan before they’d refuse to say a nice word about me to a reporter if I begged them in a three page e-mail (never mind carried more water for them than Gunga Din for 30 years). And yet, like Frank Sinatra in  The Manchurian Candidate, I’m sure to this day if you asked Lanny what he thought about Hillary, he’d say “Hillary Clinton is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.” That’s weird man. And so are all the people who constantly insist that the “real Hillary” is charming and funny and all around awesome, as if someone in the limelight for 30 years could hide even a glimpse of this allegedly superhuman charm. The real Hillary seems as real to me as the Chess Team equipment manager’s horny Canadian super-model girlfriend. Bigfoot erotica makes more sense to me (and yes, that’s a real thing, too) because I at least know what they say about primates with big feet. The Smoking Server So why did I bring this up? Oh, right: this server story. I am getting a little obsessed with it. Perhaps not as much as my friend Shannen Coffin. Just the other night, his lovely wife called me in a panic because at Sunday dinner Shannen sculpted a perfect replica of Hillary’s server out of the mashed potatoes. #related#And as with Hillary fandom, what fascinates me is not the way Hillary lies constantly and with all the skill of John Candy on the parallel bars, but the way the Beltway establishment — led by her friends — is constantly looking for reasons not to see what is plainly in front of them. Take the constant refrain that each e-mail tranche contains “no smoking guns.” The other night on the Special Report online show I ranted about it with just a fraction of the energy stored in my splenetic-dilithium crystals, and Charles Krauthammer offered to write me a prescription for valium. I could go on all day about the layers of lies upon lies here. For instance: ‐There are plenty of smoking guns in every e-mail dump. The number of classified e-mails is now in the hundreds. ‐Hillary Clinton insisted in her first statement that she never sent or received any classified information. She knew this was a lie when she said it. Those were extremely prepared remarks. She only revised that to “marked” classified when the lie didn’t take. ‐The “marked classified” thing is a lie on the merits and in intent. Some e-mails were marked classified and it doesn’t matter if they were marked classified. The information was classified regardless of marking. She knew this. ‐She constantly says her system was allowed but never says who allowed it . . . because the person who allowed it was Hillary Clinton. She might as well have hung a banner over her desk that read, “Le département d’État, c’est moi!” (If one of you francophone pedants corrects my French here, I will drive out to your house and leave a burning bag of epoisses on your doorstep). But all this misses the point. I’m not normally an ALL CAPS kind of guy. So please forgive me for this: BUT THE SERVER IS THE SMOKING GUN! It’s all smokey-like, sitting right there in the FBI evidence room. I feel like the guy in the “To Serve Man” episode of The Twilight Zone shouting “It’s a cookbook” except that was at least a secret. To borrow a line from Thoreau, “Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk.” Hillary’s secret server is a trout bigger than the figurative Twinkee Egon Spengler described in Ghostbusters. And, I’ll just say it again, so as to avoid going bonkers: Saying there is no smoking gun is not a denial! If I accuse you of murdering your chiropodist and you immediately reply, “You have no smoking gun!” you’re basically admitting you did it. “There’s no smoking gun!” is the sort of rhetorical device used by serial killers in the Death Wish and Dirty Harry movies. “Ha ha! I’m going to get away with it!” And when I point this out to Clinton defenders who think “Hillary Clinton is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life,” they look at me with the same head-tilting bewilderment my dog displays when I patiently explain to her that a hexagon has six sides. Then after a long silence, they say, “It’s time to move on.” I gotta go make some mashed potatoes. After Oregon I didn’t intend to go on about all that for so long, so I will briefly chime in on a few of the other items in the news. I listened to Barack Obama’s remarks Thursday night about the Oregon shooting. I will say this in the president’s defense: He is obviously sincere. No decent person on either side of the gun-control debate isn’t weary and wounded in his or her soul after these mass shootings. I can only imagine how Obama feels when he has to offer his condolences to the victims and their families, particularly when he’s invincibly confident that he knows the solution to the problem. And that brings me to what makes him so infuriating. From the first days of his presidency, he has acted as if he has a unique and unimpeachable grasp of the right policy on every issue. When he says he’s open to ideas from other people, what he really means is he’s open to novel explanations for why he’s correct about everything. This certainty is dangerous for all sorts of reasons — a point George W. Bush’s critics used to wax sanctimonious about with mechanical regularity. But one of the reasons it is so vexing in Obama is that it lets him play games with the truth in order to get what he wants. For instance, he talked over and over again about how there are simple “commonsense” solutions that would protect gun rights. If only we could be like other advanced countries: We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. Well, do you know the state of gun rights in Great Britain and Australia? They are only marginally more robust than free-speech rights in Russia or Iran. He also said that there’s less gun violence in states with stricter gun-control laws. I don’t want to steal Charlie Cooke’s food bowl, but come on. Compare Washington, D.C., or Chicago to Burlington or Dallas. Yes, gun violence went down in New York City, but gun violence had been very high with the same gun-control laws. Stop and frisk, which liberals despise, had a lot more to do with declining gun deaths than gun control did. The most relevant gun-control rule in the Oregon shooting was the one that prevented law-abiding people from having guns on a “gun free zone” campus. So when he says it’s okay to “politicize” these tragedies, he means it in full. When Obama engages in politics, he distorts the truth, demonizes his opponents, and seeks any other weapon that may be near to hand. He does this because he sees politics not as a realm for compromise, but the means by which he achieves what he wants, because what he wants is the only right and just thing. Various & Sundry My column from yesterday is on the ongoing foreign-policy debacle that will continue to unfold until Obama leaves office. There’s an old rule in geopolitics which, if I remember correctly, dates back to Hugo Grotius. It goes something like this: When everybody starts quoting Fred Thompson in The Hunt  for Red October, it’s time to make sure the fecal guard protecting the rotor blades is in good working order. For some reason I think it works better in the original Latin. Still, if I were one of the companies hawking gold, silver, “food insurance,” or post-apocalyptic catheters on cable TV, I would be calling Fred Thompson right now begging him to be my pitchman for our next line of commercials. It’d begin with Thompson in a banker’s suit in front of an old-style TV. “Hello, I’m Fred Thompson. Remember this?” Cue footage of Admiral Painter in Red October on deck of aircraft carrier “Well, I’m here to tell you that this isn’t a movie. That’s why I think you should get a reverse mortgage today, take that money and buy some real security in the form of gold and meals ready to eat.”

502,http://www.nationalmemo.com/stuff-happens-jeb-and-trump-talk-down-gun-control/,"The two biggest-name Republican candidates clearly don’t like each other very much, but in the wake of the tragedy in Roseburg, Oregon they do appear to agree on one thing: There’s nothing we can do about mass shootings. During a phone interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Trump was asked what measures he would advocate for in order to prevent these events, such as more stringent background checks for gun purchases. “Well, first of all, you have very strong laws on the books — but you’re always going to have problems,” Trump answered. “I mean, we have millions and millions of people, we have millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world — and it does happen all over the world, by the way — but this is sort of unique to this country, the school shootings. And you’re going to have difficulty no matter what.” Upon some further questioning by panelist Willie Geist, as to whether Trump was saying that people will simply “slip through the cracks,” Trump agreed with that phrasing: “You are going to have difficulties. You are going to have difficulties with many different things — not just this. And that’s the way the world works — and by the way, that’s the way the world always has worked, Willie.” So who could possibly outdo Donald Trump in his blasé reaction to mass murder? Why, none other than his establishment GOP arch-nemesis, Jeb Bush. At a conservative forum in South Carolina on Friday, Jeb had this to say, after an audience member complained about liberals’ insistence on gun control. (The questioner also lamented that there weren’t prayer vigils at schools before these events happen — since that would be a more useful way to prevent school shootings.) We’re in a difficult time in our country, and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It’s just — it’s very sad to see. But I resist — I had this challenge as governor. We had — look — stuff happens — there’s always a crisis. The impulse is to do something, and it’s not always the right thing to do. The short version, “Stuff happens,” quickly went viral online. Here is video that’s been posted online. (Note: Audio quality is poor, with very low volume.) When asked afterward whether what he had just said was a mistake, Bush stood by it: “No, it wasn’t a mistake — I said exactly what I said. Why would you — explain to me what I said wrong… Things happen all the time — ‘things,’ is that better?” Well, at least it’s good to know that someone named Bush thinks it’s wrong, after a terrible crisis, for the government to take a drastic, unconsidered action simply to satisfy the impulse to do something. At President Obama’s press conference Friday afternoon, Jonathan Karl of ABC News read back a key part of Bush’s response, and then asked Obama for his reaction. “I don’t even think I have to react to that one,” Obama answered curtly, to laughter from the press corps. “I think the American people should hear that, and make their own judgments, based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.'” Know first. The opinions that matter. Delivered to your inbox every morning Jeff Danziger lives in New York City.

The outraged journalists at NBC, ABC and CBS on Wednesday slammed the “controversial,” “beyond insensitive” Ben Carson for his comments about last week’s shooting in Oregon. Their anger provides a strong contrast to controversial statements by Hillary Clinton in recent days. Carson urged people in a mass shooting situation to attack the gunman, prompting Today co-host Natalie Morales to rage, “It's beyond insensitive. It's hard to hear that.” Co-host Willie Geist huffed, “But my goodness, who would ever second guess people in that situation?” Tamron Hall agreed, saying, “I don’t understand it.”  An NBC graphic identified, “Ben Carson's Controversial Comments on Guns.” Over on Good Morning America, co-host George Stephanopoulos declared, “Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson feels the heat for comments on gun control.” Reporter Cecilia Vega knocked the “controversial comments.” Piling on, Vega also reminded, “Now, this is not the first controversial comment this candidate has made, George. You will remember Carson said he didn't think a Muslim should be president.” An ABC graphic turned a picture of the surgeon black and white, making him seem sinister. (See picture at right.) On CBS This Morning, Charlie Rose echoed, “Ben Carson is lighting up the gun control debate with controversial comments on mass shootings.” In an interview with the candidate, Gayle King lectured Carson from the left, insisting, “At the time of the Second Amendment though they were talking about muskets they weren't talking about the AK 47s and the high-powered rifles that we have today.”  In contrast, when Clinton made a controversial linking of Republicans to the Holocaust, suggesting they want to put illegals in “boxcars,” the networks ignored the remark. On Monday, when Clinton strongly came out for new gun control laws, it was not deemed controversial. Instead, the networks hailed the “emotional” Democrat who was “on fire” with a “tough new stance.” A transcript of the October 7 Today segment is below:  9:01am ET WILLIE GEIST: Let's jump into some presidential politics. Dr. Ben Carson is a guy who’s surprised a lot of people. He’s at or near many of the national polls, tied with Donald Trump in some of them. And he lit up the gun control debate with some new comments on mass shootings, of course, reflecting on last week's terrible day in Oregon. Here’s what Dr. Carson said on Fox & Friends about how he would have responded if a gunman asked him, “What religion are you?” BEN CARSON: Not only would I probably not cooperate with them, I would – I would not just stand there and let them shoot me. I would say, “Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me but he can't get us all.” [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: “I Would Not Just Stand There”; Ben Carson’s Controversial Comments on Guns] GEIST: He said that this morning – or yesterday morning, and then reiterated it had again when he was asked again and again. A lot of people taking great offense to someone stepping back from the comfort of a presidential campaign and saying, “Here's what I would have done,” as nine people were shot. Many of them reportedly asked what their religion was, when they said “Christian,” they were gunned down. NATALIE MORALES: Yeah. I mean, it's beyond insensitive. It's hard to hear that. TAMRON HALL: Well, Bill Kristol, the conservative columnist, obviously a legend in the conservative world, attempted to defend the remarks this morning on Morning Joe, the show that Willie’s on as well, and his point was that Dr. Carson was not saying that these victims did anything wrong. MORALES: Right. HALL: That he was pointing, for example, 9/11, with Flight – United Flight 93, when we know those passengers fought back. That's at least one person's explanation, perhaps, for Dr. Carson's remarks. MORALES: Right. HALL: But then he went on and made similar comments on another program, Dr. Carson did. GEIST: Yeah, I think just as a rule, don't explain what you would have done in a moment none of us could imagine in our worst nightmares. MORALES: You don't know how you're going to react, yeah. AL ROKER: I think if he wants to comment on it, good for him, but I think there are many people who would probably say, “You know what, I'm not in those people's shoes, I'm not going to even begin to presume.” HALL: And isn't it more important that we hear your policy proposals, potentially, on this conversation, a more substantive conversation, rather than if-then scenarios that certainly lead people to assume that you are saying that these poor people who lost their lives were passive and that you somehow would have been aggressive. , MORALES: And that wasn't the point I think he was intending to say, that you know, these people were not passive. I think it was just more his idea of if we, you know, work together and take down the shooter – but, yeah. HALL: But when the shooter's armed with a semiautomatic weapon – that wasn't the case in this Oregon shooting, but other times. But the bottom line, again, is one of those conversations that we have. I always think when we all watch the same video and the majority of people go, “What did he say?” That's usually not – we're not all crazy here. GEIST: Part of his explanation last night when he was asked again about it on a different show was that, “I want to plant the seed for the next victim so that they react in a different way.” But my goodness, who would ever second guess people in that situation? HALL: Yes, I don't understand it. GEIST: You mentioned policy. Part of it is here. Dr. Carson suggested in an interview with USA Today that if he had a child in kindergarten he would want school security guards and even possibly that child's teacher to be armed, saying, “If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I would be much more comfortable if they had – if they had one than if they didn't.” Later in the day he appeared on The View and was asked to clarify that comment. [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: The Gun Debate; Should Teachers in Schools be Armed?] CARSON: Not all kindergarten teachers, I said people who are trained and understand all the implications. And you obviously are not just going to have a weapon sitting on the kindergarten teacher's desk. And I know that’s- JOY BEHAR: So where would the weapon be? CARSON: It would be secured in a place where kids could not get to it. BEHAR: So if a gunman comes in – if a gunman comes in with an AK-45 or AR-15, how fast can that teacher go to the locked drawer and get that gun? CARSON: Well, I want that teacher trained. BEHAR: You want that teacher trained. CARSON: I want that teacher trained in diversionary tactics and whatever needs to be done in order to get there. GEIST: By the way, that's not an unpopular position. ROKER: No. GEIST: If you poll- MORALES: Yeah. There are a lot of people, yeah, who feel this way. GEIST: There's a strong argument to be made that you could employ a retired police officer or a veteran who’s looking for work to be in the parking lot in cat and be a security guard at a school. ROKER: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. HALL: But the other argument, guys, of that is that there were armed security people at Columbine. GEIST: Right. HALL: And so, again, that's a part of the substantive conversation that you can have, but it has to be an informed conversation, and when people say and support the statement from Dr. Carson –  and point out many people do – there is the other side of Columbine. MORALES: It's just such a sad commentary on, you know, where we are in the world today. HALL: Absolutely. We're desperate to find a safe way. MORALES: We’re having to have a conversation about arming our teachers and I think a lot of people are having that conversation now across the country. But at the same time, it just makes you, as a parent, sick to your stomach the thought that you have to think that way now. Now our schools have – you know, I know my school just put multiple security features on top of what was already there. And that’s the reality that we live in. HALL: I don't know if you saw this Oregon mom. Her daughter was inside the community college, Umpqua, when this happened, and she said very clearly that if her daughter had been armed she feels that her daughter could have helped out, and there she is a parent frightened to death that she lost her daughter. MORALES: Right. HALL: And she strongly believed, and to your point about, you know, this is something that many people support. She said, “If my daughter – I wish my daughter had been armed.” MORALES: Yeah. HALL: And that's a parent speaking. ROKER: We're not gonna solve this, obviously, but there's a lot of back and forth that's going to continue. The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

Yesterday morning, speaking on Fox and Friends, Ben Carson said of a mass-shooting situation, “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” The New York Times declared that his statement was “drawing widespread rebuke from his critics and reviving questions about his candidacy.” ABC News asked him to “clarify” his statement, leading to this rather amusing exchange: ABC: Dr. Carson can you clarify your statements on the Oregon shooting? Carson: What needs clarification? ABC: I guess there’s an implication that you’re saying that the students didn’t do enough to save themselves. Carson: No, I said nothing about them. I said what I would do. ABC: And can you say what you would do? Carson: I would ask everybody to attack the gunman because he can only shoot one of us at a time. That way we don’t all wind up dead. He then laughed and walked away. Later, on Megyn Kelly’s show, he said that he wasn’t laughing at the shooting but rather the “silliness” of the people asking the question. He said that he wanted to “plant the seed in people’s minds so that if this happens again they don’t all get killed.”  There was a time when the guidance for passengers in airplane hijackings could be summed up in one word: Cooperate. And on September 11, 2001, hijackers used that guidance to guarantee their control of three airplanes — the planes that later flew straight into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. But on one aircraft, the passengers learned that cooperation meant certain death, and they unilaterally changed the protocols. As a result, it’s now virtually unthinkable that American passengers will simply stand by and allow a hijacker to seize an airliner’s controls. RELATED: On Man’s Duty to Defend the Weak and Vulnerable To hail the passengers of Flight 93 is not to condemn the passengers of Flight 11, Flight 175, and Flight 77. In a terrifying situation, they were doing what they were taught to do. #share#The current guidance for victims in mass-shooting situations is just as passive as the original guidance for hijacking victims. “Shelter in place,” they’re told. In other words, hide and wait for rescue. Carson is urging a change in the paradigm, to immediate group resistance. The key word here is “group.” The sad stories of mass shootings are replete with tales of individual heroism, of the one man who charged the attacker only to be shot down. In Oregon, Chris Mintz resisted and was shot multiple times. At Fort Hood, Captain John Gaffney reportedly died charging Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. But where one man fails, two or three can succeed — just ask Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler, the three American men who foiled an August terrorist attack on a French train.  #related#Should the defining characteristic of Americans under fire — whether from terrorists or from depraved gunmen — be their eagerness to shelter or their courage to resist? And should a presidential candidate prioritize “sensitivity” over all other virtues? Carson is urging Americans to change their thinking, to take responsibility for their own defense. In a previous era, this would be called leadership. Now, all too many people just call it mean. As I’ve said before, none of us can truly know how we’ll respond to a crisis until we face that ultimate test, but aspiration is the first step to action, and we can and should urge our fellow Americans to fight — together, immediately, and viciously — when confronted by a mortal threat. “Shelter in place” is supposed to mean “wait for help.” All too often it means “wait to die.” Those are not American words. They are not in keeping with American culture. On Flight 93, the battle cry was “Let’s roll.” On a train in Belgium, it was “Let’s go.” Those are the right words — the American words — for defeating evil.

507,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/06/presidential_tantrums_wont_end_gun_violence_128312.html,"WASHINGTON -- Following the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, a ""smoldering"" (as one commentator put it) President Obama gave a revealing speech -- a clarification, a culmination, of much that had come before. ""What has become routine,"" he said, ""of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of commonsense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. 'We need more guns,' they'll argue. ... Does anybody believe that?"" ""This is a political choice we make,"" he claimed, ""to allow this to happen every few months in America."" The president's frustration, after delivering a sad series of similar speeches, is understandable. But his argument is still indefensible. Even if you support ""commonsense gun legislation"" (as I do), there was nothing in Obama's speech that effectively argued for it. No policy proposals or serious justifications. No one listening to the speech would be persuaded to take a position he or she did not already hold. Obama was saying, in essence, that it is obvious what we should do about mass gun violence, that evil people are blocking it, and that they have innocent blood on their hands. This is apparently what some liberal people think when anger releases them from civility and rationality. Obama speaks as if the gun laws he wants passed would put an end to these killings -- a position for which there is no evidence. I believe that more thorough background checks and further restrictions on the type and firepower of weapons, along with improved health services for the severely mentally ill, would be good for our society, apart from mass killings. I hope that, in the long term, this system might, just might, intervene before a prospective mass killer strikes (though such causality would be very hard to demonstrate). But I have no basis for the calumny that people who disagree with me are choosing to allow mass murder. This is the politics of moral posturing, not an argument rooted in social science. With his last election behind him, Obama is free to be Obama. And it appears that he is, deep down, a liberal commentator of the MSNBC variety -- perhaps providing a preview of his post-presidency. The only apparent purpose of his gun speech was to incite the faithful by expressing a seething arrogance. Obama would surely blame the other side for the sorry state of our politics. Didn't Mitch McConnell have it out for him from the beginning? Hasn't every attempted compromise been slapped away? But it matters when the president of the United States decides that democratic persuasion is a fool's game. It encourages the kind of will-to-power politics we see on the left and right. In this view, opponents are evil -- entirely beyond the normal instruments of reason and good faith. So the only option is the collection and exercise of power. When the main players in our politics give up on deliberative democracy, it feels like some Rubicon is being crossed. Our system is designed for leaders who make arguments for their views, seek compromise and try different policy angles to break logjams. And when they lose, their proper recourse is ... to make more arguments, seek other compromises and try different policy angles. At this time, gun control legislation would probably not pass. Because such a law would not directly prevent mass murders (even if the law had useful purposes). Because Obama doesn't know how to work with Congress. Because the National Rifle Association would oppose it. Because the political environment is not right. But someone who supports gun control should still argue for it, because that is what we do in a democracy. The spirit of our democracy is very much at issue. Donald Trump says we have a corrupt system run by stupid people. Obama says we have a corrupt system run by evil people. Both of them are part of the same problem. I really don't give a damn if they are disillusioned and fed up with democratic processes or not. If they are tired of the game, they should stop playing it, not engage in ideological commentary or entertain fantasies of personal rule. The best way to restore faith in our democratic structures is to spend a lifetime trying to make them work, like Hubert Humphrey did, or Jack Kemp did, or Henry Jackson did, or Ronald Reagan did, or Ted Kennedy did. But it is easier, and surely satisfying in its own way, to throw a tantrum when democracy disappoints you.

""Well this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic,"" President Obama insisted. A gunman killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, and injured seven more before being shot by police. As President Obama urged news organization to show the statistics of gun deaths and deaths caused by acts of terrorism for a side-by-side comparison, and called on Americans to hold their lawmakers accountable for inaction on what he called an epidemic, presidential candidates on the 2016 trail have taken strikingly different positions on the prevention of gun violence. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders took decidedly different tones addressing the 45th school shooting this year -- the 994th mass shooting in just the last three years, but seemingly arrived at remarkably similarly grim conclusions about the likelihood to affect change. ""We're tired of sending condolences and we know that it could happen tomorrow, it could happen again a month from now,"" Sanders told MSNBC's Chris Hayes, echoing President Obama's sentiments. “I know him well enough to know that this was very personal for him,"" Sanders said of President Obama, who delivered his 15th national address in the aftermath of a mass shooting. ""He is disgusted, he is angry, he is sick and tired — as we all are — of sending our condolences to the families of people who have been murdered in cold blood.” But when Sanders was pressed by Hayes on his vote against the Brady bill and past endorsement from the NRA, Sanders offered this bit of nuance: I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is. What we do know is the current situation is not tenable. It is clearly not working. And as the president indicated, we can and must do a lot better … You can sit there and say I think we should do this and do that. But you’ve got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.  Rather than sounding impassioned to act following news of the shooting, the normally blustery Trump took on a more resigned tone. ""So many of these people, they're coming out of the woodwork,"" Trump told the Washington Post's Phillip Bump.""It's happening more and more. I just don't remember -- years back, I just don't remember these things happening. Certainly not with this kind of frequency,"" Trump said, calling this latest incident ""another mental health problem."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty and that will be for the next million years, there's going to be difficulty and people are going to slip through the cracks,"" Trump said. Trump argued that ""we have to really get to the bottom of it,"" but seemed to dismiss the need for any further regulations on gun ownership, eventually endorsing no plan of action. ""First of all, you have very strong laws on the books,"" Trump said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""[B]ut you're always going to have problems. We have millions and millions of people, we have millions and millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world and it does happen all over the world, by the way. But this is sort of unique to this country, the school shootings. And you're going to have difficulty no matter what."" Rival Jeb Bush was actually the first 2016 candidate on either side to comment on the shooting, offering his prayers on Twitter without even referencing the mass shooting: A host of other Republican presidential candidates followed suit, offering their condolences via Twitter while staying far away from talk of guns or gun control: Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley called out his fellow presidential aspirants on the Republican side: Speaking with local Boston reporter Janet Wu, Hillary Clinton pledged to lead the formation of a pro-gun control group to rival the NRA. ""I'm going to try and do everything that I can as president to raise up an equally as large and vocal group that is going to prove to be a counterbalance,"" Clinton said. The campaigns of Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie haven't even commented on the shooting at all. Rubio, if you recall, was notably mum following this summer's gun massacre in Charleston: At least Ohio Governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich had the decency to accurately describe the tragedy as a shooting: Other Republican candidates did tackle the issue of gun control, but only to knock down the idea. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson happened to be on right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt’s program following news of the shooting and promptly denied that gun control could help to prevent such an incident. “Obviously, there are those who are going to be calling for gun control,” Carson said. “Obviously, that’s not the issue. The issue is the mentality of these people.” He argued that instead of focusing on guns, “early warning clues” should be heeded by people closer to the shooter in order to prevent such shootings. Bobby Jindal also offered his condolences during the ""Hugh Hewitt Show"" while the news was breaking but quickly touted his NRA endorsement to fend off talk of further gun control and to denounce the so-called politicization of gun deaths: I’m not for additional restrictions on law abiding citizens. What we’ve done in Louisiana, and this is endorsed by the NRA, we passed a law a few years ago that made sure that the mental health records of those that for example have been forcefully admitted into a mental hospital, those that have been through a process, whether it’s a judicial process or another process, that those records are entered into their national background check system, because there are folks that are, under our current laws, you know, if they didn’t do that process, if a court has decided that they’re not supposed to have guns, they’re not allowed to buy those guns. And we did that law to make sure those records were entered into the system. What I’m not for, too many times politicians try to use these tragic events as an excuse to pursue their agendas when it comes to gun control. I’m not for restrictions on law abiding Americans’ right to have guns. I think we’ve got to be very careful. There needs to be a due process. There needs to be, and in this case, there is. We passed a law to make sure those records would be entered into the national background check system. Desperate Mike Huckabee went with the tried and true attack on President Obama for being ""quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda,"" in his latest Facebook rant. Huckabee did at least offer up one ""solution"" -- albeit one that would allow for more, not less guns -- suggesting the prohibition of gun free zones. ""Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants, but it's clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones,"" he wrote:  We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy - What kind of gun was used?

510,http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/donald_trumps_cold_blooded_genius_how_fatalism_on_gun_violence_plays_right_into_the_nras_hands/,"Whenever there's a mass shooting, we can count on two things to happen. First, nothing. Nothing will happen. No matter how horrendous the shooting happens to be, the National Rifle Association has rendered Congress entirely impotent, ensuring nothing will happen to prevent another would-be gunman from easily purchasing firearms. Not even the cold-blooded murder of 20 kindergarteners or the live on-air murder of two journalists has successfully shaken our political leaders from their NRA-induced torpor. Second, the NRA's flying monkeys inevitably fan out across the country, disbursing the usual talking points about mental health, arming schoolteachers and outlawing gun-free zones, all as a distraction from the real issue, which is, of course, ridiculously easy access to firearms. The mental health issue, in this context, is horseshit. In spite of how often they lean on this particular button in the wake of a shooting, the Republicans haven't done a damn thing about addressing mental health. Ever. In fact, it was a Democrat, the late Paul Wellstone, who championed the notion of making mental illness a legitimate health matter. It was also a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president who included mental health coverage as an Obamacare mandate -- covering nearly 4 million Americans who previously didn't have mental health insurance. The Republicans, on the other hand, have voted to repeal Obamacare upward of 60 times, while attempting to block the Wellstone amendment. If they were really concerned about mental illnesses contributing to gun massacres, you'd think there'd be something in the works to mitigate the problem by delivering more medical care to the people who need it the most. Nope. Not a chance. So, leave it to Donald Trump to shift an already badly skewed debate from mental illness to, somehow, evil geniuses. Yes, Trump blamed gun massacres on shooters who are ""geniuses in a certain way."" They're masterminds, he said, who can ""break the system."" “No matter what you do, you’re gonna have problems,” Trump told NBC News in an interview that aired Sunday. “Because you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they’re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.” Not only are the shooters geniuses, but there's really nothing we can do to stop them, said Trump. Gone are Trump's usual over-the-top superlatives about how he has a ""terrific"" plan to stop gun violence -- that there's going to be so few kindergarteners shot when he's president, our heads will spin. None of that. Trump's reaction? Oh well. He might be a complete fraud, but he sounds a hell of a lot like a Republican here. It's frankly worse than Jeb Bush's unfortunate ""stuff happens"" reaction. Indeed, Trump went one step further by suggesting that stuff happens and nothing can be done about it because mass shooters are basically Batman villains who can ""break the system,"" apparently using green laughing gas and an entourage of anonymous, masked henchmen. Contra Trump, what we absolutely shouldn't be doing now, especially given how one mass shooter happens to inspire the next mass shooter, is stroking the apparent intelligence of these murderers. Whether true or not, the last thing we ought to be doing is pointing to guys like Adam Lanza or Chris Harper-Mercer and treating them like MENSA candidates. More from Trump: “It’s a horrible thing to say,” he added. “And it’s not even politically correct. But it’s common sense. You’re going to have problems no matter how good, no matter what kind of checks you do, you know, what kind of laws.” No matter what we do, Trump said, stuff will still happen. Fascinating coming from a front-runnner for the presidency who thinks a border fence -- complete with a ""beautiful big door"" -- will end the allegedly immigrant-based violence in Baltimore and Chicago. So, evidently, there's an actual solution to gun violence as long as it includes vilifying brown people with a new Berlin-style wall. But when it comes to preventing these mostly white mass shooters from easily stockpiling obscenely large arsenals of firearms, whatevs. Trump possesses neither a conscience nor any core values whatsoever, making him capable of blurting literally anything. This blurt, in particular, is especially egregious. But it fits nicely within his contradictory, half-assed positions on the Second Amendment. One of those positions, as published on his website, states that we shouldn't expand background checks until we fix what he believes is a broken system. This is not unlike suggesting that a professional football team shouldn't sign better receivers until the quarterback recovers from a mildly strained hamstring, but OK. Yet, at the same time, he declared that it really doesn't matter how strong the system is because the geniuses will always find a way around it. Put another way: Trump thinks we should fix the broken system, but it doesn't matter if we do because ""you're going to have problems, no matter how good"" the system is. As infuriating and insensitive as it might be, Trump's gun position is precisely the GOP position, only he doesn't mind blurting it out loud, nor does he mind sounding like a self-contradicting nincompoop in the process. And rest assured, Wayne LaPierre is perched in his underground lair, writing a series of campaign contribution checks to Trump as we speak. All told, Trump has managed to top the old ""mental health"" excuse in the wake of various gun massacres. Even if we address mental health, he believes, the shooters will still break the system. It's a line we should expect the rest of the GOP to embrace presently because it's kind of, in a sinister way, also genius. There's an increasing sense of futility on both sides of the gun debate, and Trump's position plays directly into it. Why bother? Nothing will happen. Sure it won't, because the system is broken and there's nothing we can do about, so we might as well take our toys and go home. And if that happens, the NRA wins. Flawless victory.

Carson was responding to a question about whether the recent mass shooting in Oregon had changed his views on the Second Amendment, and he also had this to say: “The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda. To me, that is also devastatingly sad.” To recap, here are the things Ben Carson believes are more devastating than violent death: Carson also informed USA Today on Tuesday that if he had a child in kindergarten, he would feel “much more comfortable” if their teacher was armed. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if Ben Carson retreated to an Assisted Living Home for Addled Former Geniuses, but we can’t all get what we want this election season.

518,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/u5nlXYlajT8/,"Left-of-center media outlets began attacking the local sheriff from the Oregon county where the recent mass shooting occurred almost immediately after the tragedy. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence jumped in, and now the full weight of CNN has joined the dog-pile attack. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin was first attacked for his pro-Second Amendment views, then the Brady campaign and CNN began attacking him for a Facebook post he allegedly made nearly three years ago. Yes, that means they targeted the sheriff and did opposition research on a leader currently handling a mass shooting in his county. First, CNN did a segment attacking the sheriff and giving attention to the pro-gun control Brady Campaign’s effort to attack the sheriff in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. That segment was followed up by CNN’s Jake Tapper. In general, Tapper has been widely heralded as fair and reasonable–and rightfully so–for his work. He was the moderator during a recent Republican presidential debate who fairly pointed out that no other country in the world has birthright citizenship before he asked a question about birthright citizenship. Nearly no other journalist working for a left-of-center outlet would have so fairly set up the question. Unfortunately, the past couple of weeks has seen Tapper begin to venture into advocacy journalism; he made sure viewers noticed his anger and outrage at comments made by Republican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson as he castigated him for saying that he wouldn’t want a Muslim as president. He then engaged in the attack on Sheriff Hanlin–again making sure that viewers could determine his own perspective on the matter. It is interesting to note that Tapper’s showing emotion for left-of-center causes began immediately after his remarkably fair handling of the Republican debate–a fairness he likely took immense heat over. The details of the Tapper segment that stood out as being the most unfair pertain to a subtle shift in assertions of fact, allowing an assertion that support of the Second Amendment was “extremist” to go unchallenged, and the fact that the sheriff is being researched and targeted in the first place to go unchallenged. Tapper began by questioning whether the sheriff made a controversial post, but then the segment began to assert that the sheriff had made the post as though it was a fact. In my experience, most sheriff’s allow staff to run their social media–making it likely the sheriff was telling the truth when he said to CNN that he didn’t post it. In addition to this, Tapper allowed a representative from the Brady campaign to assert that the sheriff held “extremist” views for supporting the Second Amendment. Tapper did not challenge the guest on that assertion. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the segment that makes it an “attack” is in the fact that Sheriff Hanlin’s personal views and support for the Second Amendment are being discussed at all. What did these views have to do with the fact that a Christian-hating mass murderer decided to kill 9 people in Douglas County? What justified deep opposition research of a sheriff who is currently handling a recent mass shooting in his community? Readers can watch CNN’s Tapper coverage of Sheriff Hanlin below.

520,https://patriotpost.us/posts/38022,"There was one particularly important line in his anti-gun screed Thursday. There was one particularly important line in Barack Obama’s anti-gun screed Thursday: “We know other countries in response to one mass shooting have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours, Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. As National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke notes, ""This is remarkable. Customarily, Democratic politicians react to mass shootings by calling for pointless around-the-edges reforms: ‘universal’ background checks, hard limits on the size of commercially available magazines, rules that determine how certain rifles may look, etc. Since 2012, in fact, Obama has tended to take this approach himself. Now, however, the president is openly praising two countries that confiscated — yes, confiscated — firearms. That matters — and a great deal. Why? Well, because the president’s defenders like to mock those among his critics who argue that he wants to ‘take their guns away.’ As of today, they will no longer be able to do so.” That isn’t to say they won’t try, but Obama’s comments were definitely revealing.

523,http://nypost.com/2015/10/05/republicans-cuomo-is-using-oregon-tragedy-to-promote-his-own-agenda/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Fredric U. Dicker Submit October 5, 2015 | 12:01am Republicans are accusing Gov. Cuomo of using the Oregon community-college massacre to boost his own national image and they’re saying if he’s serious about stopping gun crimes, he’ll seek tougher penalties here and not look to Washington. “Cuomo callously is using the tragedy in Oregon to promote his own national political ambitions, saying, ‘Look at me! Look at me! We ought to shut down the government to do a great gun law like I did in New York,’ ’’ charged state GOP Chairman Ed Cox. “If Cuomo wants to make this the issue of the 2016 presidential race, he should start by making increased penalties for crimes committed with guns an important issue in his State of the State Address,’’ Cox told The Post. Cuomo, long rumored to harbor presidential ambitions, suggested on Friday, in the wake of Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., that congressional Democrats “shut down the federal government or threaten to shut down the government if we don’t get real gun-control legislation.’’ Cuomo, whose anti-gun “SAFE Act’’ was rammed through the Legislature in January 2013 after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre also suggested that stricter gun control should be a central theme for Democrats in next year’s presidential campaign. “When there are issues of war and peace out there in the world and we have an economy that’s not really working, to make this THE issue of 2016, as he’s trying to do, means it’s all about his ambitions,’’ insisted Cox. Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove, a potential GOP candidate for state attorney general, contended that if Cuomo were serious about a crackdown, he would propose that the Legislature sharply stiffen penalties for the criminal use of firearms. Abelove advocated a “substantial increase’’ in mandatory sentences for the criminal use of a weapon, doubling to 15 years the minimum sentence for the use of a loaded handgun in a crime by someone with a prior violent-felony conviction. “This is going to be a test of seriousness for Gov. Cuomo when he delivers his State of the State Address in January,’’ Abelove told The Post. Abelove’s comments came just days after he publicly chastised acting Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas, a Democrat, for barring her assistant district attorneys from obtaining handgun permits. Abelove said that not only would he encourage his ADAs to “exercise their Second Amendment rights’’ by obtaining permits, he would use his office funds from nontaxpayer sources, such as asset seizures, to pay the costs. Senate Democrats are fearful that Cuomo is reneging on his pledge to help elect his handpicked candidate to the seat of former Sen. Tom Libous of Binghamton. Cuomo’s choice in the November special election is Barbara Fiala, his former motor-vehicles commissioner, and his summertime pledge to support her was supposed to signal a change-of-heart for a governor who has been accused by Democrats of favoring continued GOP control of the Senate. But Cuomo has done nothing to raise significant cash or mobilize Democrats and independents on Fiala’ s behalf, Democratic insiders say.

525,http://www.breitbart.com/tag/trolling/,"The UK Government will police “harmful” content online including “extreme pornography”, “trolling” and the spreading of “disinformation”. If you’re criticizing the makeup of this task force on any issue other than competence, then you’re just a sad, little troll. President Donald Trump taunted would-be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday evening, urging Democrats not to distance themselves from their unpopular House of Representatives caucus leader because she is a “wonderful person” who “should definitely be given a 4th chance.” Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom taunted President Donald Trump on Wednesday, one day after finishing first in the California primary for governor, daring him to campaign in the state for Republican rival John Cox. John Podesta launched a furious series of tweets after President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday morning from the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany: “Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!” The BBC has revealed it will use people “personal information” to “stop” them being “disruptive” or “offensive” online, as well as threatening to inform users employer if they are perceived to have broken the law. Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, wore a Gucci blouse to the second presidential debate that is called a “pussy bow.” Trump has conquered the media, burned its corpse, and salted the earth of its grave. I couldn’t be more erect. Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager in 2008 until the Iowa caucuses, admitted on Friday that a Clinton campaign staffer had, in fact, circulated the Birther conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and therefore potentially ineligible to serve in the presidency. Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos appeared on ABC Nightline to discuss his Twitter ban, Leslie Jones, and why trolling is a good thing. Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos managed to troll Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones and comedian Amy Schumer on national television during an ABC Nightline feature on … trolling! ABC’s Terry Moran launched a full scale attack on Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos as part of a feature for ABC News Nightline, calling Yiannopoulos an “idiot,” “revolting” and comparing him to a “13-year-old” child. A politically incorrect Twitter user has been “harassed” by an official London police account, which allegedly stalked his social media presence and/or police databases to identify his family members by name and threaten on the social media site. The office of London’s first Muslim mayor has secured millions of pounds to fund a police “online hate crime hub” to work in “partnership with social media providers” to criminalise “trolls” who “target… individuals and communities.” Liberal comedian Eric André interrupted Breitbart News’ live coverage of the Republican National Convention Monday afternoon, stepping onto the set during a live broadcast in what was ultimately a failed attempt to troll Breitbart California Editor Joel Pollak and senior investigative reporter Lee Stranahan. The UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will prosecute web users who impersonate others or use fake online profiles to “harass” them under new guidelines for England and Wales published today. In an article entitled “How Breitbart Unleashes Hate Mobs To Threaten, Dox, And Troll Trump Critics,” The Daily Beast accused Breitbart News of encouraging an eye-popping range of Twittercrimes, ranging from anti-semitic abuse to death threats, against members of the conservative establishment. If someone told me they were from Australia and their name was “Sandy Beaches,” I might suspect that a prank was underway. Not so for The Mary Sue, the home of “geek and pop culture feminism” on the internet, who were convinced to run two hoax articles from an Australian man posing as a feminist woman. The victim of an internet troll who agitated for a conviction for “writing malicious blogs” has found himself before the same judge for sending “malicious tweets” of his own, moments after his abuser was sentenced. The bizarre demonstration of the UK’s growing President Obama says modern politics are overly loud and obnoxious – suggesting that’s part of the reason Donald Trump is getting so much attention. Some call him Ben “One Man Klan” Garrison. To others, he is “Zyklon Ben.” Elsewhere, he is known as Ben “Not White? Shoot On Sight” Garrison. And those are just his milder nicknames. At a time when people can stand in front of the United Nations and proclaim that people being mean on the internet constitutes violence, a lone insurance company has decided to do exactly what the proponents of criminalizing disagreement are doing: monetize it. The Associated Press (AP), the New York Times, and CNN’s Anderson Cooper were suckered by an online troll who claimed to be an eyewitness of the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. With the exception of Mrs. Clinton and her email scandal, few presidential candidates of either party have been moved during their campaigns to discuss technology at length. That changes today, as Donald Trump gives an exclusive interview to Breitbart Tech about hacking, cyber-warfare and artificial intelligence. California Gov. Jerry Brown sent a letter to Republican presidential contender Dr. Ben Carson on Thursday, along with a flash drive containing the latest science on climate change, challenging him to “review the material.” Did you know that Donald Trump was once a liberal on important policies? And a “germaphobe” that is afraid of shaking hands with other people? Jeb Bush wants you to. America Leads — a Super PAC supporting Gov. Chris Christie’s (R-NJ) presidential campaign — was trolling fellow GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina’s event in New Hampshire, attempting to get personal information from her supporters, according to a Breitbart source. At least one Turkish columnist, described as pro-government by the newspaper Hurriyet, is blaming an aggressive Internet strategy to smear critics of the majority AK Party for its own losses during Sunday’s parliamentary election. The office of Ron O’Brien, prosecuting attorney for Columbus, Ohio, was deluged with emails and phonecalls that “wasted time and resources” following an online campaign whipped up by Brianna Wu, a controversial video game developer. Wu published a widely-shared article on The Mary Actress and devout feminist Ashley Judd published a lengthy essay Thursday to further explain her reasoning for taking legal action against what she perceives as “gender-based violence” on Twitter.

526,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-klans-vile-post-charleston-recruiting-spree,"SEARCH Days after the massacre at a black church, towns across the country have reported the appearance of KKK fliers with bags of candy on residents’ lawns. Senior Reporter Days after the massacre at a black church in South Carolina, some Americans woke to a vile surprise: KKK fliers with candy on their lawns. The propaganda—stuffed into plastic baggies with pieces of peppermint and Tootsie Rolls—included a phone number for the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Planted under the cover of darkness, the fliers were distributed in California, Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. It’s not something local police departments are taking lightly, and some have even reached out to the FBI for assistance. The Rockdale County sheriff’s department in Conyers, Georgia, collected more than 80 fliers and is investigating whether anyone can be charged with criminal trespass or littering. “Whether it was a joke or from an organization doesn’t matter to me,” Sheriff Eric Levett told The Daily Beast. “The fact that it was done during this time is ignorant and cowardly.” A message on the hate-spewing hotline, based in North Carolina, salutes 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who was charged with murder for the killing nine people in Charleston. Roof penned a racist manifesto before the June 17 mass shooting and wanted to start a “race war.” “We in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK would like to say hail victory to … Dylan S. Roof who decided to do what the Bible told him,” a man chirps in the recording. “An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. They [black people] have spilled our blood too long. It’s about time someone spilled theirs.” “If it ain’t white, it ain’t right,” the message concludes. “White power!” Robert Jones, of the Royal White Knights in North Carolina, told The Daily Beast that the Klan is undergoing a national recruitment drive that coincidentally started around the time of the South Carolina murders. “We’re doing this from the East Coast to the West Coast, just to let people know the Klan’s in their community,” said Jones, the grand dragon of the hate group based in Pelham, N.C. “Especially with all the stuff that’s in the news—in South Carolina they’re wanting to take the Confederate flag down.” Jones told The Daily Beast that he supports Roof’s crime, but preferred that he “shot the correct people,” such as minority drug dealers rather than churchgoers. “It’s a racial war against our people,” Jones said. “The more the media pushes multiculturalism down our throat, the more you’re going to see killings like this.” In Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, the Klan also recently caught cops’ attention when it got personal—naming and urging a boycott against local Mexican restaurants. The fliers from the Northeastern Oklahoma Klavern warned of the same supposed “black on white” violence that spurred Roof’s militancy, and pushed “civil ways to discourage these animals from our community,” the Pryor Daily Times reported. “Stop going to Maggie’s Mexican Kitchen … [she] thinks she can talk trash about white people in Spanish, thinking none of us will understand her anti-American, anti-white rhetoric,” read the flier discovered on Father’s Day. “Or, El Humilde Mexican Restaurant, which takes your money while employing illegals and sending our American currency back to their homeland.” Captain Rod Howell of the Mayes County sheriff’s department in Pryor told The Daily Beast that “the timing’s not a coincidence.” “They’re doing it for a reason,” Howell said. “They’re trying to get as many people as possible to put some fuel in the fire. With the political climate the way it is today, it’s really tough right now.” Meanwhile, Alabama residents were horrified by the racially-charged hate bags filled with candy. “I didn’t even know the KKK was alive and well,” Shannon Phillips of Lake View told local news station WIAT. “I certainly didn’t know it was in our area. It disturbed me that they put Tootsie Rolls in here trying to appeal to children. I mean that’s just pathetic, sick, disgusting.” Phillips said she and other neighbors scrambled to pick up the bags before kids could find them. “Why would they put a piece of peppermint candy in here? There’s no sweetness involved in this group,” fumed another resident, Charley Buckland, to ABC 13. “This is a very sad, sad situation when you find these in your yards. It’s very disheartening.” Cops in nearby Bessemer, Alabama, filled a 30-gallon bag with the bulletins, which officers collected from one church and more than 60 homes. “If we find out who has done it, we’ll deal with it,” Police Chief Nathaniel Rutledge Jr. told The Daily Beast. “For right now, it’s criminal littering at the very least.” After the fliers were found in Topeka, Kansas, the police chief there called the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI and held a press conference with the city’s Black Ministers Association. Other fliers were found as far as Fullerton, California, a city of 135,161 in Orange County. Proclaiming “Save our land, Join the Klan,” some of the baggies—anchored by rocks and candy so they wouldn’t blow away—misspelled “California.” “It’s just wrong. There’s no words,” Fullerton resident Alia Cass told CBS Los Angeles. “Racism isn’t born. It’s taught.”",2015-09-15 11:10:58,The Klan’s Vile Post-Charleston Recruiting Spree,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

On Thursday, NBC’s Today joined CNN in promoting the latest issue of People magazine, which demanded congressional action on gun violence. At the top of the morning show, co-host Savannah Guthrie heralded: “People gets political. The glossy magazine known more for its celebrity scoops and red-carpet fashions wades into one of the most controversial issues in America. Is the magazine taking sides?” Later, while introducing a nearly three-minute segment on the topic, Guthrie declared: “The entertainment magazine has a call to action of sorts.” Correspondent Stephanie Gosk followed: “People magazine has a message for the people, rise up, reach out, and tell Congress to do something.”  A soundbite ran of People’s editor Jess Cagle proclaiming: “One thing is very, very clear, and that is as a country, we are not doing enough about gun violence.” Gosk touted: “People posted and published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the Senate and the House, along with this fact: Over 10,000 people have been killed this year alone by guns.” After noting how Cagle “was inspired by President Obama's speech following the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon,” she laughably asserted: “Cagle says this is not about an agenda.” Cagle professed: “I think that any time you try to start a conversation, some people take it as, ‘You want to take away my guns or you want to take away my liberties.’ I was very careful not to even take a side.” Moments later, Gosk added: “Cagle says he is tired of the rhetoric.” Cagle lectured: “Let's hold our representative's feet to the fire and let’s let them know that these kind of routine responses are just not going to cut it anymore.” Gosk mentioned “applause mixed with vows to cancel subscriptions” on social media in response to the magazine’s activism.

The magazine has actually published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the House and Senate, urging readers to contact them, obviously to grab the reader’s attention....They’ve got a huge readership and they want to call – they say this is not a call to one side or the other of the issue, they just want people to start talking about it in a civil way. Here is a full transcript of Gosk’s October 8 report: 7:00 AM ET TEASE: SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: People gets political. The glossy magazine known more for its celebrity scoops and red-carpet fashions wades into one of the most controversial issues in America. Is the magazine taking sides? 7:31 AM ET SEGMENT: GUTHRIE: Let’s begin this half hour with the latest issue of People magazine. If you pick it up, you might notice a different headline on the cover. The entertainment magazine has a call to action of sorts. NBC’s Stephanie Gosk has more on that story this morning. Steph, good morning to you. [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: “People’s” Call to Action; Magazine Wades Into Gun Control Debate] STEPHANIE GOSK: Good morning, Savannah. Well, the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week has reignited the debate over one of the most contentious policy issues of our generation, gun violence. President Obama will travel there on Friday to visit with families of the victims. But the trip has angered locals, who say Obama is not welcome because he is using his visit to gain support for his gun control agenda. Now People has launched itself into the debate as well. People magazine has a message for the people, rise up, reach out, and tell Congress to do something. JESS CAGLE [EDITOR, PEOPLE MAGAZINE]: One thing is very, very clear, and that is as a country, we are not doing enough about gun violence. GOSK: People posted and published the contact information for all 535 voting members of the Senate and the House, along with this fact: Over 10,000 people have been killed this year alone by guns. Editor Jess Cagle says the idea was inspired by President Obama's speech following the shooting in Roseburg, Oregon. BARACK OBAMA: Somehow, this has become routine. CAGLE: I was watching President Obama give his speech, and when he got up to speak, I rolled my eyes and I thought, “Oh, here he is again. There has been nothing done about the last mass shooting.” GOSK: Cagle says this is not about an agenda. CAGLE: I think that any time you try to start a conversation, some people take it as, “You want to take away my guns or you want to take away my liberties.” I was very careful not to even take a side. GOSK: The sides are already well staked out, echoed over and over on the campaign trail this week. HILLARY CLINTON: The idea that you need more guns to stop people who are committing mass shootings is not only illogical but offensive. JEB BUSH [CBS EVENING NEWS]: Name a case where gun rights being restricted out of Washington would have changed the course of any of those cases. GOSK: Cagle says he is tired of the rhetoric. CAGLE: Let's hold our representative's feet to the fire and let’s let them know that these kind of routine responses are just not going to cut it anymore. GOSK: But like it or not, People's call to action has thrown the magazine into the political fray. On social media, there was applause mixed with vows to cancel subscriptions. Proof that when it comes to guns, everything is political. Inaction on Capitol Hill after a mass shooting is what many have come to expect. People magazine's editor is hoping to move the needle, but will voter outcry be loud enough to overcome political reality? Savannah? GUTHRIE: Interesting story, Steph. Thank you very much.

528,https://www.bustle.com/articles/115636-why-are-gun-sales-rising-theres-a-significant-pattern-for-when-people-buy-more-firearms,"News  It seems like a paradox at first glance: When people die from guns in this country, more people go out to buy guns. Data repeatedly shows gun sales have risen after every mass shooting in recent years. Gun purchasers spent $4.1 billion in 2014 and sales are expected to rise to over $5 billion by 2020, according to CNBC. CNN reports gun stocks are up as much as 70 and 80 percent in 2015 for major companies Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. This is nothing new. Sales for major gun companies rose to record numbers after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2012 and after the protests at Ferguson, Missouri. Why is this happening? In a sentence, it is because the right to own guns under the Second Amendment has become a highly political issue. After shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Tuscon, pro-gun control politicians made calls for tighter restrictions on civilian gun purchases. In reaction, hoards of people bought guns because they feared these possible legislative restrictions. The New York Times reported that after Obama announced his visit to Roseburg, Oregon, to meet with the families of the victims of this latest tragedy at Umpqua Community College, some local residents were less than thrilled. Some accused the president of capitalizing on their grief to push his own gun-control agenda. As David Jaques, publisher of a conservative newspaper in Roseburg, told Bill O'Reilly, ""Our Douglas County commissioners, along with our Douglas County-elected sheriff, who is very popular, and our chief of police all came to a consensus language about him not being welcome here for political grandstanding."" This is consistent with the way mass shootings have been politicized in this country. Despite evidence that legal gun purchases caused more mass shootings than illegal ones, the gun lobby prevents any real progress, such as restricting the sale of highly dangerous automatic weapons, by sponsoring Congress members who support their interests. Gun owners have lived in fear of Obama ""taking away their guns"" for years, and so far they have not lost them. Gun sales rose when President Obama was first elected in 2008, especially when the NRA warned gun lovers that his election would result in a sweeping ban on guns. During the 2008 election, the organization circulated fliers that misleadingly alerted readers to ""Barack Obama's 10-Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment."" Repeatedly, the president has clarified his fairly moderate position on gun ownership. He wants to restrict access to assault weapons, which he has said exist only ""to kill people."" Given the NRA's infamously powerful lobby in Washington, D.C., it is likely that the debate over guns will continue to be a major political issue as the 2016 election season approaches. Hillary Clinton has vowed to tighten civilian access to guns through executive order if necessary. In Florida on Friday, Clinton asked ""What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers?"" Directly after her statement, guns shares rose slightly over the weekend, as CBS News shows. When anti-gun politicians publicly decry the existing accessibility of guns, sales rise. It seems almost a lose-lose situation: Politicians can't talk about passing gun control laws without accidentally encouraging people to buy guns. Will we ever be released from this vicious cycle? Time will tell. But a largely pro-gun Congress does not seem to be interested in restricting access to guns to save lives. Despite the fears of gun lovers, the Second Amendment will not be reversed any time soon. And every time it is challenged, people flock to buy guns. It just might take a drastic action like Clinton's proposed executive order to prevent another tragedy like last week's in Oregon.

(Photo by Rick Diamond/Getty Images for Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum) Rick Diamond/Getty Images  On Friday, October 2nd, just one day after a gunman on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people and injured several others, singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash took to her Facebook page, calling on readers to sign a petition urging the White House to reinstate the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons. That call to action touched off widespread debate from the singer-songwriter’s Facebook followers, with Cash writing an additional post calling for commenters to be more respectful of other’s opinions. The first of Cash’s writings came just hours after the massacre, which was reportedly the 264th mass shooting of the year (on the 274th day of 2015). In her original post, Cash wrote, “If you are as sick of gun violence in this country as I am, then let’s stop talking about it and just do ONE simple thing.” Related

						25 Best 'Friends' Episodes Cash explained that the petition was created by her daughter, Chelsea Crowell (a contributor for Rolling Stone Country), and would require 100,000 signatures for it to be reviewed. As of Tuesday afternoon, the petition has nearly 3,600 signatures. That initial post from Cash received thousands of “likes” and was quickly shared by Facebook users — it also spawned hundreds of comments representing all sides of the thorny issue. The following day, Cash posted a link to a New York Times essay on gun control, which was accompanied by her own comment that read, “I feel as strongly and as passionately about this issue as all of you, but I won’t stoop to insults. Please, do unfollow or unlike if you can’t maintain basic courtesy.”  By Sunday morning, Cash had clearly had enough of the negative comments, posting another link to an essay on the issue and telling fans and followers, “This is my page and I do have a right to my beliefs and convictions, as all of you do. I was raised to have the courage to stand behind those convictions and it’s too late in life for me to sacrifice my integrity by keeping the most passionate of them secret. Those who tell me to ‘stay out of politics and stick to music,’ or, in other words ‘keep your mouth shut,’ are perhaps so obsessed with the Second Amendment that they haven’t noticed the First.” The singer and activist, who for a decade served on the board of PAX, an organization dedicated to preventing gun violence among children, added, “I have as much concern for the safety of my children as any mother alive and if that makes me ‘political,’ so be it. I don’t hurl insults because I think some of you have a bewildering attachment to military-grade weapons and a refusal to consider mandatory background checks. I’d appreciate the same civility.” While serving as a representative of PAX, Cash attended the 2000 Million Moms March on Washington, D.C., penning an essay in Rolling Stone about that experience. “At the end of the day, my friend Patty Smyth, who marched alongside me with Bette Midler, Emmylou Harris, Raffi and many, many more, said, ‘If nothing else, we helped carry the burden of the grieving mothers for one day,'” she wrote in the Facebook post. “I was full of expectation that our elected officials would rise to the occasion and enact basic gun safety legislation like background checks, safety locks and a ban on military-grade weapons. It turned out that, in fact, all we did was help carry the burden for a day. Nothing changed.”  Explaining that she eventually left the PAX board (which has since merged with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence) after “ten years of meeting grief-stricken parents of children killed by guns,” the mother of four also revealed that her daughter Chelsea had once been held up at gunpoint while working in a jewelry store. Cash closed the lengthy post writing, “If one classroom of first graders can be saved just by requiring background checks and a ban on military style weapons, wouldn’t it be worth it? One teenager in a movie theater, one student nurse, one pastor in the pulpit, one little pre-schooler? If the answer is no, or the answer is just more vicious rhetoric, then we should be ashamed. That child could be yours. It was almost mine. So don’t tell me to keep my mouth shut.” In This Article:

530,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/christie_blasts_nj_democrats_for_gun_veto_override.html,"TRENTON -- In the wake of last week's deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Gov. Chris Christie repeated a call Sunday that he's made after similar incidents: Rather than passing stricter gun control laws, the U.S. needs to do ""some tough things on mental health."" But this time, the Republican presidential candidate also admonished the Democrats who control New Jersey's state Senate, criticizing them for recently trying to override his veto of a mental health-related gun bill instead of considering his suggestions to strengthen it. Christie made the comments on ABC's ""This Week"" four days after a shooter killed nine people and wounded nine others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday. The governor called the incident an ""an awful tragedy."" ""It's terrible,"" he said. Host George Stephanopoulos asked Christie if there's a correlation between the fact that New Jersey has the second-toughest gun control laws in the U.S. and one of the nation's lowest murder rates. A 2014 study by the Violence Policy Center that found New Jersey had the fifth-lowest gun death rate of any state. MORE: Trump says world was better off with Hussein and Gadhafi Christie said he doesn't think there's a connection and pivoted the conversation to mental illness. ""I'm very concerned about the mental health side of this,"" he said. ""And I put forward a proposal to the Legislature last year and then again just about seven or eight weeks ago in response to a bill they sent saying: Let's do some tough things on mental health. Let's make involuntary commitment of people who speak violently easier for doctors."" The bill Christie referenced drew controversy in the state Senate two weeks ago. In March, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the measure, which would require that police be alerted when people seeking a gun permit in New Jersey ask a judge to expunge their commitment to a psychiatric hospital from their record. No Republican members of the Senate voted against it. But Christie vetoed the bill and instead proposed a new standard for involuntary commitment of patients who are not necessarily deemed dangerous ""but whose mental illness, if untreated, could deteriorate to the point of harm."" Democratic leaders in the Senate tried to override Christie's veto on Sept. 24 -- but the attempt failed, with only two of the Republican senators who voted for the bill in March voting in favor of the override. Republicans said they sided against the override because they are working on an alternative reform package based on Christie's suggestions. A report by the FBI in 2014 found that even though homicides have fallen overall in the U.S., mass shootings have risen drastically over the last seven years. Stephanopoulos asked Christie on Sunday what is ""so unique about American culture and American psychology"" that contributes to that rise. The governor repeated his message about mental illness. ""It's a really complex problem, but I think it's about the mental health issues, George, and I don't think we're as aggressive as we should be,"" Christie said. ""And that's why I put the proposals for New Jersey. ""And here's the bad thing about the politics of this,"" he continued. ""I've put this proposal forward twice and my legislature -- a Democratic legislature in New Jerse --  has ignored it. You know why? Because it doesn't create headlines. It's not taking away anybody's guns. It doesn't create a headline. So they don't want to deal with it. ""They tried to override a veto of -- of a bill that I put forward when my substitute bill was to get tougher on mental health,"" Christie added. ""Maybe this morning, the legislature in New Jersey will see what happened in Oregon and get tougher on the mental health issues to help these folks. We don't want to involuntarily commit them, to put them away. We want to protect others and get them the help they need."" Gov. Chris Christie appears in Camden recently. State Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) has said he will continue put the override up for a vote until it passes. In a statement to NJ Advance Media, Sweeney said that though ""we don't yet have all the information"" about the Oregon shootings or a ""full understanding of the shooter's profile, background or motives,"" the incident is ""another senseless act of violence."" He added that Democrats were determined to pass the bill to ""keep firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous people who try to get their mental health records expunged so they can purchase a gun."" ""The courts asked for this bill, the law enforcement community supports it and every Democrat and Republican who was present voted for it before it was vetoed,"" Sweeney said. ""It's a common-sense bill that would improve public safety. I will bring it up for another vote and give every legislator who reversed themselves another opportunity to do the right thing and vote for the override."" In a passionate speech at the White House hours after the shooting Thursday, President Obama called for tighter gun control legislation. ""I've had to make statements like this too many times,"" Obama said. ""Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times."" But many of the Republicans running for their party's 2016 presidential nomination said tougher laws are not the answer and that the focus should be on treating mental health. Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who is leading the GOP race in the polls, said during a rally in Franklin, Tenn., on Saturday criticized the ""gun-free zone"" at Oregon college where the shooting took place. ""If you had a couple of teachers with guns in that room you would have been a hell of a lot better off,"" said Trump, a former Atlantic City casino tycoon.

Chris Pietsch/ZUMA  People magazine, one of the country’s largest publications, with a circulation of more than 3.5 million readers, just threw its weight behind the push for increased gun control by publishing contacts for every member of Congress, and urging their readers to lobby for action. In an editorial on Wednesday, the magazine’s editorial director Jess Cagle explained the unprecedented decision to enter the gun debate after the latest mass shooting at a community college in Oregon. As President Obama said, our responses to these incidents—from politicians, from the media, from nearly everyone—have become “routine.” We all ask ourselves the same questions: How could it happen again? What are we doing about gun violence in America? There are no easy answers, of course. Some argue for stricter gun laws, others say we should focus on mental health issues, some point to a culture that celebrates violence. But this much we know: As a country we clearly aren’t doing enough, and our elected officials’ conversations about solutions usually end in political spin. In this issue we pay tribute to the nine Oregon victims, as well as 22 other men, women and children who’ve lost their lives in mass shootings—incidents where a murderer has opened fire on a crowd—in the U.S. during the past 12 months. The move by People is remarkable considering the magazine—a staple at every newsstand and doctor’s office in America—is traditionally associated with celebrity gossip and general human interest stories that carry little risk of being offensive or overtly political, meaning its message could reach many more Americans outside the DC echo chamber, in which action on gun violence has completely stalled.

533,http://www.ibtimes.com/republicans-mass-shooting-response-focuses-not-gun-control-mental-health-reform-2125119,"Four years ago, when Adam Lanza opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 26 people, Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed calls for increased gun control, instead declaring a need for greater focus on the mentally ill. ""We should look for ways to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill prone to misusing them, but I oppose legislation that will be used as a vehicle to impose new Second Amendment restrictions on responsible, law-abiding gun owners,""  Rubio said in a statement a few months after the mass shooting. ""We should work to reduce tragic acts of violence by addressing violence at its source, including untreated mental illness, the lack of adequate information-sharing on mental health issues, and the breakdown of the family."" But in the years since, Rubio has not authored a single piece of legislation to expand services for mentally ill people while he has consistently voted against proposed gun restrictions. This lack of follow-through places Rubio in a crowded camp. In recent years, as mass shootings have become a familiar tragedy in American life, the reactions have generally adhered to a consistent script: Republicans coalesce around the position that guns are not to blame while urging that attention be paid to the dangers posed by failing to treat mental illness. Then they go back to what they were doing before, voting down gun control bills while offering little to follow-through on their calls for increased attention to mental health care.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's record is similar to Rubio's when it comes to gun rights and mental health legislation. The only time the two presidential hopefuls have come close to a bill addressing mentally ill people was when they joined a group of 24 cosponsors on an amendment introduced by Chuck Grassley to a gun control bill from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Neither the amendment nor the bill was successful. Other Republican presidential candidates have similarly offered little in the way of legislation that expands treatment for the mentally ill. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has also sponsored no legislation relating to mental illness, and former Governors Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee are both remembered more for laws protecting the Second Amendment than for mental health initiatives during their tenures. Even when Republicans have tried to take action on mental illness legislation, doctors and mental health experts often worry this can do as much harm as good. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been a vocal advocate of addressing gun violence through mental illness reforms. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 Christie vetoed proposed gun control legislation and instead suggested reforms to the state’s mental health treatment. His proposals have involved new standards for involuntarily committing patients who are not necessarily dangerous “but whose mental illness, if untreated, could deteriorate to the point of harm.” While some medical experts applaud lawmakers' greater attention to the mental health care system, others worry about potential misguided legislation in the wake of mass shootings. When New York passed a sweeping gun law in early 2013 that required mental health professionals to report patients who they thought were likely to seriously harm themselves or others, many experts objected. Paul Appelbaum, the director of the Division of Law, Ethics and Psychiatry at Columbia University, and Jeffrey Lieberman, former president of the American Psychiatric Association, wrote a piece in the New York Times in January 2013 arguing that targeting mentally ill people as a way to reduce violence “is a strategy fraught with risk.” “People troubled by suicidal or homicidal thoughts might avoid treatment, or be inhibited from speaking frankly about their impulses, if they knew they could be reported to state authorities,” they said. Evidence shows mentally ill people are not usually violent and are far more likely to harm themselves than other people. In fact, some studies have shown that less than 3 percent to 5 percent of U.S. crimes involve someone who struggles from a mental illness. That means the high-profile cases we hear about, including many recent ones where the shooter struggled with their mental health, are not the norm. But these men also shared another similarity: Many of them purchased their guns legally. The gunman who killed nine people Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Oregon  had 13 guns, all of which he or his family members had obtained legally. The gunman at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, this past summer also legally purchased his gun, as did the shooter at UC Santa Barbara in 2014, and the one in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2013. The man who killed nine worshipers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June should not have been able to purchase the gun but did because of a clerical error. U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (right) spoke at a news conference held by the groups Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Feb. 12, 2014.

Chris Murphy. Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst This pattern has generally not been called out by Republicans, who have instead focused on mental health as a cause. This stance reflects basic political realities in the U.S.: For many Republican voters, positions on issues surrounding gun rights serve as a litmus test. Almost all the 2016 Republican presidential candidates hold nearly identical views on the issue, consistently arguing against restrictions on gun ownership. Many of the leading candidates hold A-range grades from the National Rifle Association, which assesses politicians based on how they vote on gun legislation. Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee all hold A+ ratings from the nonprofit gun rights group, while Rubio, Paul and Sen. Lindsey Graham have received A grades and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina  has a qualified A (since she does not have a legislative record). The NRA has not graded Donald Trump or Ben Carson. Even the outsider candidates fall in line with the Republican positions on gun rights. After a man shot two journalists on live television in August, Trump said he was opposed to tightening gun laws. ""This isn't a gun problem; this is a mental problem,""  he said on CNN. Trump also released a  policy paper last month about protecting Second Amendment rights that included a call to address the country’s mental health system. Fiorina and Carson each criticized President Barack Obama’s emotional call to action after the Oregon shooting Thursday.  Carson said Thursday in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt that he worried about increased calls for gun control in the aftermath of the Oregon shooting. “Obviously there are going to be those calling for gun control, but that happens every time we have one of these incidents. Obviously that’s not the issue,"" Carson said. ""The issue is the mentality of these people. And we need to be looking at the mentality of these individuals and seeing if there are any early warning clues that we can gather that will help us as a society be able to identify these people ahead of time.” Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush spoke during the second official GOP debate of the 2016 campaign at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, Sept. 16, 2015. Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters These talking points espoused by the 2016 Republican field are often similar to those used by the NRA itself. The group, which has a strong political arm and lobbies aggressively, is known for supporting candidates through its political action committee, the National Rifle Association of America Political Victory Fund. Many of the GOP candidates have received donations from the group -- if not to their current campaigns then to past ones when they ran for the Senate or governorships. Cruz received $9,900 from the NRA during his 2012 Senate campaign and Rubio received $4,950 during his run for the Senate in 2010. Christie got a donation  from an NRA lobbyist in 2013 around the time he was also receiving criticism for “shallow” anti-gun-violence proposals after Sandy Hook. Bush, meanwhile, has several NRA employees and lobbyists among the donors to his presidential campaign and his super PAC, called Right to Rise. John Green, a lobbyist who has lobbied on behalf of the NRA, and his wife, each gave $2,700 to Bush’s campaign June 30. Joe Scofield, another lobbyist, gave $2,700 June 18, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Even when the NRA itself doesn’t give money to candidates, the group and its cause can wield significant influence simply through its domination of Republican views. Cruz’s main super PAC for his presidential run, for example, was jumpstarted by an $11 million donor named Robert Mercer, who is the CEO of Renaissance Technologies. Mercer is a member of the NRA and  has been described as a “hardliner on cultural issues.” Despite the relatively limited progress that has been made on federal legislation around mental health care and gun control in recent years, the latest mass shooting is  not likely to change much in either area. The media typically  loses interest in the gun control debate not long after each mass shooting, and with the 2016 election approaching quickly, neither Republicans nor Democrats will want to compromise too much and risk losing support from voters who have strong opinions about guns. Obama talked about needing a change during his speech after the Oregon shooting Thursday. “I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,” Obama said. “But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. And it can change.”",2015-10-05 12:55:57,Republicans' Mass Shooting Response Focuses Not On Gun Control But On Mental Health Reform,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

        Ruby Cramer Posted on October 2, 2015, at 4:57 p.m. ET The day after the shooting that killed nine people at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, Hillary Clinton called for a ""national movement"" strong enough to rival the National Rife Association, which she described as ""an intense, dedicated group"" of gun lobbyists who ""scare politicians and say, 'We will vote against you.'"" Clinton, who has made new gun restrictions a regular feature of her speeches on the campaign trail, addressed the shooting at a rally in Florida on Friday. In other recent appearances, Clinton has advocated specifically for universal background checks on gun-buyers — an initiative that failed in Congress under President Obama. The deaths in Oregon on Thursday amounted to the 45th school shooting this year, according to the gun control group Everytown. At her campaign event in Florida, Clinton invoked past mass shootings, saying, ""People should not have to be afraid to got to college like this one, or go to the movie theater, or go to bible study."" ""What is wrong with us that we can’t stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers that they represent?"" she said to cheers from the crowd. ""Here's what the other side counts on,"" Clinton said. ""They count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, ‘We will vote against you.’"" Republicans, she told supporters, ""put the NRA ahead of American families."" Clinton promised that, if elected, she would ""never relent"" in trying to pass new gun measures. She acknowledged that passing new measures — which Obama was unable to do even in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School — would be what she called ""a political mountain to climb."" ""But you don’t get anything done in this country if you don’t start by calling it out,"" Clinton said. ""We need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listened to the gun lobbyists instead."" What Democrats need, she said, is a ""national movement"" to pass ""new, effective gun control measures,"" like her husband President Bill Clinton's in the '90s. ""There are a lot of ways for us to have constitutional, legal gun restrictions. My husband did. He passed the Brady bill, and he eliminated assault weapons for 10 years. So we’re gonna take them on. We took them on in the '90s. We’re gonna take them on again."" Contact Ruby Cramer at ruby.cramer@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) held a rally outside the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to support the oppressed Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang province. The group promoted the rally under the social media hashtag #CallItGenocide. Donald Trump needs allies in the House of Representatives, said former Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), commenting on congressional campaign. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) described September 11, 2001, as the “one of the most horrific terrorist attacks that we have lived through” in a video posted on the 19th anniversary of the attacks, over one year after describing 9/11 as a day “some people did something.” A new initiative promoted by nearly 150 left-wing organizations calls for a large scale boycott of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) — the historic U.S.-based NGO established to fight hatred, bigotry, and antisemitism and whose stated mission is to secure “justice and fair treatment to all.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) demanded that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) resign on Monday, after a controversy in which he was misquoted as saying slavery was a “necessary evil.” In fact, he said the Founders thought so. Lawyers representing Laura Loomer, a candidate for the Republican congressional primary in Florida’s 21st district have filed an appeal against a dismissal of a case against the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which alleges the Muslim advocacy organization’s pressure campaign caused the candidate’s permanent ban from Twitter. A federal judge, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, has blocked American communities and states from stopping refugee resettlement — a power that President Trump granted to them through an executive order last year. Islamic organizations say they are “thrilled” about nearly 40 state governors, including 17 Republicans, approving more refugee resettlement for their states thus far. A Minnesota Muslim woman who was forced to strip and remove her hijab while being arrested for a traffic violation in 2013 received a $120,000 settlement. A Muslim woman in Denver says that she went to an NBA game to see her daughter sing the national anthem, but was told to that she would have to remove her hijab in order to watch the performance. Protesters gathered at the Capital to demand that the United States admit 95,000 refugees into the United States in Fiscal Year 2020. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) “demands” to be the “arbiter” who decides if a Center for Security Policy (CSP) official is allowed to continue to own a minor league baseball team in Connecticut, Frank Gaffney revealed this week. The owner of a Minor League baseball team in Connecticut took heat for refusing to meet with members of the Hamas-Linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). An event featuring conservative commentator Pamela Geller will proceed as scheduled, despite being blacklisted by the ticketing service Eventbrite over supposed violations of the platform’s “community guidelines.” The group had been using the platform as its main source for organizing ticketing for the event. Ticketing service Eventbrite has blacklisted an event featuring conservative commentator Pamela Geller over supposed violations of the platform’s “community guidelines.” The ticketing service then warned the group planning to host Geller that any further attempts to create an event listing featuring the conservative commentator and free speech activist could result in the group’s account being banned from the platform. Banana Republic is the latest major retailer to sell hijabs, the Islamic head covering for women. Although the company has been praised for its new products by CAIR, it also faces backlash from the Islamic community for showing models in hijabs dressed in short-sleeved t-shirts and other clothing not in line with Islamic dress codes. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) is a “terrorist supporter” and “terror sympathizer,” said former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Independent filmmaker Michael Hansen has a new documentary out, Killing Free Speech. It features an exclusive interview with an official at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), who struggles to answer questions about the status of women in Islam. Independent filmmaker Michael Hansen has a new documentary out titled Killing Free Speech. It features internal emails from a New Jersey school showing teachers pushing political propaganda in the wake of President Trump’s travel ban. The United States Army War College canceled an event featuring a speaker that has criticized Islam. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) spoke on Saturday at a Washington branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraiser in Seattle, Washington, where security was tight and protesters showed up in support of Omar and others came to condemn her antisemitic remarks. ACT for America founder and terrorism expert Brigitte Gabriel slammed Facebook for taking her words out of context and placing her on a list of potential “Hate Agents,” as Breitbart News exclusively reported Monday evening. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is demanding that Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti apologize for agreeing with the Trump administration’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem on a recent trip to Israel. A Georgia prison guard who recently converted to Islam alleges that the state Department of Corrections has barred her from wearing a hijab while on the job. Seattle School District Urges Teachers to Follow CAIR Guidelines on Blessing Muslim Students During Ramadan TEL AVIV – The executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Los Angeles compared “apartheid” Israel to Nazi Germany in a speech he gave to students at the University of California, Irvine on the eve of Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day last Wednesday. Jihad in Philadelphia — among children: “We will chop off their heads, and we will liberate the sorrowful and exalted Al-Aqsa Mosque … and we will subject them to eternal torture.” Conservative journalist Laura Loomer has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Twitter and CAIR over her 2018 blacklisting from the social network. Jim Riches, the father of an FDNY firefighter killed in the terror attack of September 11th, 2001, doubled down on his criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Tuesday, demanding the freshman congresswoman apologize to him for downplaying the tragedy, according to a report. Protect Yourself From Big Tech! Thank You!

By 10/05/2015 10:02 AM EDT Presented by With help from Sarah Karlin and Doug Palmer BREAKING THIS WEEKEND: TPP NEGOTIATORS SEAL A DEAL ON BIOLOGICS —Talks were still ongoing as PULSE was filed early this morning, but negotiators finally eked out a deal on biologics protection yesterday. Pro's Doug Palmer has the details: ""Countries would be required to provide at least five years of data protection for biologics under a compromise reached by the United States and Australia and then face a decision on two different systems of potentially providing additional protection."" Both the U.S. and Australia had been gridlocked over protections for the new class of drugs, and top negotiators finally worked out a compromise after two and a half days of meetings that finally culminated at 3 a.m. Sunday in Atlanta. The U.S. had initially hoped to win 12 years of market exclusivity for biologics, as exists under current law, but Australia and other countries worried about rising health care costs that could result from a delay in the introduction of copycat versions of biosimilars. TODAY: THE SUPREMES KICK OFF THE TERM — The Supreme Court is set to officially open its new term today, and the health set has its eyes on two cases with major implications for women's health policy. First on the list, as Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn previewed, is a case over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors. (More on that one here:
http://politi.co/1M38lMx.) The Court will also consider eight separate petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing birth control under the Affordable Care Act. POLITICO's Josh Gerstein has more on that, in a preview of the biggest cases the Court could take up this term: ""Prominent judges are effectively begging the Supreme Court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-Catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others."" The story:
http://politi.co/1M38Ciw THE BIG PICTURE: INSURERS ARE OUTRAGED — Insurers are still reeling from an Obama administration decision last week to pay them just a fraction of the $2.9 billion they were counting on from the risk corridors program. And it's not just number shock: ""The timing means insurers have no ability to change their rates for 2016 to make up for any funding shortfalls [ahead of the upcoming third enrollment season] - and that's going to be particularly hard on the Obamacare co-ops and other smaller state and regional insurers,"" Pro's Paul Demko reports. — Big plans might miss earnings projections thanks to the meager payouts, but it will be much harder for small, regional plans and co-ops — many of which are already struggling. Even plans who weren't planning to see all the money they expected overestimated what they'll actually be getting this year, Paul reports. The full story,

DRIVING THIS WEEK: WHO WILL LEAD THE HOUSE? — Washington is in for a whirlwind week as Republicans jostle to see who will replace House Speaker John Boehner. Leadership elections are currently set for Thursday — at least for now, after rumors swirled this weekend that House Speaker John Boehner might delay the vote for the No. 2 and No. 3 slots in his conference. Adding complication to an already complicated fight: Now Rep. Jason Chaffetz is preparing a campaign for House speaker. Chaffetz, of course, is currently leading the House Oversight Committee's investigation into Planned Parenthood. — And Chaffetz is not pulling punches. The races have gotten increasingly bitter, with former allies sniping at each other in public. Chaffetz, a former ally of favorite Kevin McCarthy, decried his leadership this weekend. “We need a speaker who speaks,” Chaffetz said. “We lose the communication war time and time again, and I think the conference wants a proactive communicator.” McCarthy is promising a more inclusive style, with fewer decisions concentrated at the leadership level.

THIS WEEK: CLINTON HEADS TO IOWA TO TALK HEALTH CARE — Hillary's heading to Davenport, as well as Mount Vernon and Council Bluffs, on Tuesday and Wednesday to talk with Iowans about ""her plans to make health care more affordable, and answer questions on her proposals to create an economy where all Iowans can get ahead and stay ahead,"" per a press release. She's already laid out her plans to address prescription drug costs and out-of-pocket health spending, but her campaign has pledged additional ideas on delivery system reform, too. THE LATEST ON P'P: RICHARDS RESPONDS TO FIORINA: The Planned Parenthood president on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" attacked Carly Fiorina for her false description of what's on those Center for Medical Progress videos. ""It is extraordinary that someone running for President would lie in that way. This has been completely discredited by every reputable news source. And yet Carly Fiorina seems to continue to repeat the same lie."" — Richards also talks about her organization's support for Sen. Susan Collins, her decision not to relieve executive Deborah Nucatola of her duties following the first video's release, and the organization's efforts to reevaluate its donation practices surrounding fetal tissue.

http://nbcnews.to/1M3aacl — AND DAVID DALEIDEN'S SET TO TURN OVER THE TAPES: The anti-abortion activist told a California judge on Friday that he's going to turn over the tapes he has this Wednesday, unless the judge intervenes. Chairman Chaffetz subpoenaed the tapes as part of the House Oversight investigation into the Planned Parenthood sting videos, despite a District court ruling that barred Daleiden from releasing them. Chaffetz told Daleiden last week that Congress's subpoena power supersedes judicial orders and that giving the videos to his committee doesn't constitute ""public disclosure."" — Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are appealing to Speaker Boehner to end the ""political theater"" that the tapes have created. Eighteen members asked him in a letter, led by Sen. Patty Murray, to end the effort to create a special committee to investigate Planned Parenthood, especially after the House Oversight hearing last week that they saw as ""singularly political in nature."" That letter:

ARE FLORIDA'S INSURANCE PLANS CURTAILING ACCESS TO HEP C DRUGS? — An analysis of Florida's Silver 2015 qualified health plans reveals discriminatory plan designs that are keeping hepatitis B and C drugs out of reach by placing them on high cost tiers, The AIDS Institute announced today. ""The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to discriminate against beneficiaries based on their illness or perceived health care use through plan benefit design, but that is what these plans are doing,"" Deputy Executive Director Carl Schmid said in a statement. — One interesting caveat: the group says that the high patient cost sharing can't be attributed to new hepatitis C medications like Sovaldi, since the plans were designed before most of those drugs were approved. Three of 12 of the silver plans it analyzed do not cover any of the new curative hepatitis C drugs. Both the federal government and Florida have warned insurers that placing all or nearly all drugs to treat a certain condition on the highest cost tier will be considered discriminatory, the group notes, and we should know in a few weeks if they follow through and enforce these laws for 2016 plans.

        BuzzFeed News Posted on October 2, 2015, at 8:38 a.m. ET HERE ARE THE TOP STORIES “This is something we should politicize,” Obama said in an angry response to yesterday’s shooting at Umpqua Community College on the fourth day of class. “This is not something I can do by myself,” Obama said as he urged all Americans to take action and condemned the U.S. Congress for its refusal to pass a gun reform law. President Obama pauses as he speaks in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Thursday. The shooter — who has not been officially named by authorities, was identified by multiple media outlets as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer — opened fire around 10:30 a.m. local time at the rural campus. He killed nine people and injured seven others, authorities said. The shooter was among the 10 killed on the campus yesterday after a shootout with law enforcement officers, authorities said. Officials said they would wait 24 hours to identify the victims late Thursday afternoon. Here’s what we know about the shooter. Mercer reportedly asked people about their religion before shooting them. And a look at other high-profile shootings in the Pacific Northwest. This is a developing story. For the latest news and updates, download the BuzzFeed news app or follow BuzzFeed News on Twitter. A candlelight vigil for the victims of yesterday’s shooting after a gunman opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. And a little extra. Mass shootings, incidents that involve four or more casualties from gun violence, have become very frequent in the U.S. “Mass shootings have happened hundreds of times over the last several years. In fact, during President Obama's second term, a Sunday-to-Saturday calendar week has not passed without a mass shooting incident,” the Washington Post writes. On average, there’s a mass shooting almost every day in the U.S., Vox writes. Here are seven clips from yesterday’s press conference in which Obama asks for gun law reform. This is at least the 15th time that President Obama has given remarks on a mass shooting. He says he can't guarantee it will be his last. On Thursday, Obama called them “routine” — this was at least the 15th time he has had to respond to one while in office. While Virginia was legally allowed to perform the execution around 9 p.m., states usually wait until all legal matters are resolved before they do so, BuzzFeed News' Chris Geidner writes. Prieto's lawyers had a Supreme Court request still pending when the 49-year-old serial killer’s death was announced at 9:17 p.m. local time. Lawyers had tried to delay the execution — which a federal judge denied on Thursday — because they argued the drugs that would be used to execute Prieto were unsafe. “The drugs were given to Virginia from the Texas prison system, and both states have passed laws to keep the source of their execution drugs secret,” the Guardian writes. It was the first execution in Virginia under Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The state's most recent execution was in January 2013. Image above: Undated photo provided by the Virginia Department of Corrections / AP Photo And a little extra. Virginia is only one of two states to ever execute an inmate before U.S. Supreme Court justices are done deliberating. Last year, Missouri executed Herbert Smulls 13 minutes before the justices denied a final plea for the delay of his death. “He was executed just moments after reportedly being hauled away by prison guards while he was in the middle of a telephone call discussing his appeals with one of his attorneys,” The Atlantic wrote in a 2014 story about the matter. Expect to be talking about the death penalty in the U.S. over the coming months. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear five cases that relate to the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and four that revolve around the death penalty. And last week, conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the Supreme Court ended the death penalty, even though he believes it’s allowed under the U.S. Constitution. WE’RE KEEPING AN EYE ON Russia had claimed earlier that all its strikes were aimed at ISIS, but so far, they’ve been centered on “other rebel groups fighting [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad], a longtime Russian ally,” BuzzFeed News' Mike Giglio and Munzer al-Awad write. Both the U.S. and Russia aim to defeat ISIS, but the U.S. opposes Assad. Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said that Russia was ”pouring gasoline on the fire” in Syria. Both the U.S. and Russia aim to defeat ISIS, but the U.S. opposes Assad. Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said that Russia was ”pouring gasoline on the fire” in Syria. BuzzFeed News spoke to some of the U.S.-backed rebels who said they're afraid of Russian attacks. “We were surprised because they attacked groups that get support from the U.S., but now we realized that they are fighting the U.S. through us,” Hassan Hamada, the head of a U.S.-backed rebel battalion, told BuzzFeed News. “They sent a message to the U.S. that says that we will protect Assad, even if you don’t accept it.” What’s next? Russia's involvement in the Syrian conflict has Western powers worried. U.S. ally France — after launching its own airstrikes five days ago — and Russia are now planning to hold talks in Paris “amid fears Russia is carrying out 'indiscriminate' airstrikes in Syria,” BBC News writes. On this footage taken from Russian Defense Ministry official website on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015 a bomb explosion is seen in Syria. Russia’s launch of airstrikes in Syria is prompting discussions within the Pentagon about whether the U.S. should use military force to protect U.S.-trained and equipped Syrian rebels if they come under fire by the Russians.

Russia’s airstrikes at anti-Assad rebels could drive more people in Syria toward extremism, “because such an air campaign would demonstrate that Russia had opened a war on Syrian people as opposed to a mutual enemy in ISIS,” The Guardian writes. Here’s a look at who’s fighting whom in Syria’s brutal civil war, which has been ongoing for more than four years. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? Narcotics officers from Oxford, Mississippi, made violent threats against at least one person while persuading him or his girlfriend to serve as informants, according to a 2012 audio recording obtained by BuzzFeed News. As an April BuzzFeed News investigation detailed, [Mississippi’s Lafayette County] Metro Narcotics relies heavily on the use of college-age confidential informants. The recording, “offers a glimpse” into the practices these agents use to build a network of confidential informants, “including intimidating suspects and exaggerating the potential legal consequences they could face,” BuzzFeed News' Albert Samaha writes. Here’s Samaha’s story about Chris Bland, a known drug dealer in the county, who says he murdered a college-aged informant for “being a snitch.” The Environmental Protection Agency set a new limit for ozone smog from cars and smokestacks: 70 parts per billion (ppb) concentration in the air, down from the 75 ppb limit the Bush administration set in 2008. Ozone is the most widespread air pollutant and the main ingredient in smog. It’s known to be a lead cause for asthma and premature deaths from lung ailments. The EPA says the tighter rules would “result in 230,000 fewer asthma attacks and 160,000 fewer lost school days for kids nationwide,” BuzzFeed News’ Dan Vergano writes. “It’s a step in the right direction, but parents need to know that a lower standard would be much healthier for their children,” Paul Billings of the American Lung Association in Washington D.C. told BuzzFeed News. Other critics complained the new rules would increase costs for businesses and lead to lost jobs. Overall, ground level ozone has declined 33% since 1980, according to EPA statistics.

WEEKEND READS Our special guest this week is Simon Crerar, editor of BuzzFeed Australia, sharing some of his favorite stories recently. “Spring has sprung in the land Down Under, with temperatures soaring towards the mid-90s through a holiday weekend many will spend at the beach unwinding. But beneath the surface, tensions are bubbling,” Crerar writes. Here are his picks: Australia is currently wrestling with the rise of far-right anti-Islamic groups. In The Weekend Australian Magazine, Cameron Stewart tells the tale of The Battle For Bendigo, an ugly fight over plans for a new mosque on the city's fringe that has seen the country Victorian town's 300 Muslims locking themselves inside their homes during a violent protest march in August. Sydneysiders have spent the last weekend swarming around the newly opened harbourside park at “monster development” Barangaroo. On Guardian Australia, Bridie Jabour unpicks a rapacious tale of billionaires, prime ministers casinos, $40,000 a night hotel rooms, and the southern hemisphere's first $100 million apartment. “It is the ultimate Sydney story,” writes Jabour. In the Coal Crash in October's The Monthly, Paul Cleary examines coal producers' continuing enthusiasm for what rock icon turned enviro-warrior Jimmy Barnes calls “a dying industry,” at a time when the global trade in coal looks increasingly uncertain, and the world's major economies face a “do or die” cut to greenhouse gas emissions at the Paris climate change summit in December “Racism, real estate, and resources: the three R's that dominate Australia's political and cultural conversation,” Crerar writes. Dating is super tough. And adults claim to be the experts. But maybe, we should pay a little closer attention to the world’s middle schoolers. The Atlantic asked a group of very mature kids to talk about dating in middle school and they dropped some serious truth bombs. “I mean, we’re in middle school. So relationships may not even carry on that long,” one boy said. Boys are too busy (sports, Hebrew school, ~other stuff~) and the girls are fed up. Why? One middle schooler broke it down perfectly: “they’re all really immature.” This letter was edited and brought to you by Claire Moses and Millie Tran. You can always reach us here.

541,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/ljN4dZOW0vo/,"On Friday’s “NewsHour” on PBS, New York Times columnist David Brooks and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne reacted to this week’s mass shooting in Oregon and discussed any potential government policy that could prevent these types of incidents. While Dionne applauded Obama for his aggressive effort politicize the tragedy, Brooks cautioned viewers that given America’s history with guns, eradicating them won’t likely happen. “Oregon happens to be a place with pretty tight gun control legislation,” Brooks said. “The criminals — the people who are in criminal gangs do get the guns illegally, but there are so many guns in this country. We can’t — we’re not going to deport 12 million immigrants. We’re also not going to get rid of 250 million guns. There are just practical realities.” “One in three American households has a gun,” he added. “There is a history of 300 years going back. And that’s why it touches such a nerve. And so we just have a legacy of a lot of guns in this country and that’s been true because of the nature of the settlement of the country.” Partial transcript as follows: JUDY WOODRUFF: So here we are yet again, another mass shooting. They seem to be happening every few weeks. David, the president said yesterday at his news conference that he thinks the country’s grown numb, that these are happening so often. Is he right? DAVID BROOKS: I actually don’t think so. The reaction certainly among the people I have spoken to is one of impatience and growing frustration. And so I don’t think we have grown numb to them. I don’t think we have taken a practical and a pragmatic approach to trying to prevent them. Obviously, as we heard earlier, they’re phenomenally hard to prevent. I’m for gun control laws, as I have said so many times. We have gone through a ritual on this program. JUDY WOODRUFF: We have. DAVID BROOKS: And I don’t think they will do much good. They might do a little good, just because there are 250 million guns in this country. I think it’s just very hard to control the ones, but they might erect a barrier. There’s obviously problematics with getting a list of people who have had mental health issues to run against a registry. That’s obviously a problematic thing to do. I have emphasized the make-believe function, that the profile of these guys who do it is very similar, and it is in this case, alienated young guy with loneliness issues and self-worth issues. And if we looked around for young men like that in our society, maybe we could do something there. I guess I would invite people to de-ideologize it, if that’s a word and to think pragmatically about the many steps we could do to hopefully make some dent, but it’s going to be hard to make a dent in this, I think. JUDY WOODRUFF: It is hard, E.J., and yet, as the president said, something has to happen, something has to happen. What is the something to change? E.J. DIONNE: I must say, I loved seeing his anger about this, because I think he reflected the anger of a lot of people. And I actually liked it when he said this is something we should politicize, because the barriers to de-ideologizing it, as David said, are political barriers. And I was so struck by some of the responses of the Republican candidates to this. Ben Carson, you’re not going to handle it with more gun control because gun control only works for normal — the normal law-abiding citizens. Well, all laws only work for normal law-abiding citizens. Only with guns do we hear these arguments. Same with Marco Rubio, gun crime is committed by criminals. Criminals ignore the law. Well, yes. But, again, that’s an argument against all law. We have to try some things. There are no free and democratic and wealthy countries in the world that have our rate of gun violence. You know, David is quite right that we have to worry about loners and alienated people. We have to do better on mental health. But we’re not the only country in the world with loners and alienated people. And I think we have to be willing to take some steps on guns. And I don’t know what’s going to shake us to get there, but I think the president is saying we can’t just sit here anymore. I think there is an anger that’s growing out there that may at some point get conservatives in particular, who ought to be in a different position than they are on this issue. JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, as we heard from the two guests we talked to a few minutes ago, it is hard. And yet maybe there is a way to identify some of these young men — most of them are young men — who are deeply troubled and try to prevent them from getting access to them. DAVID BROOKS: Maybe. And I think the way — if we’re going to have any political process, it’s not to have a big fight about guns, which we have had a million times, but it’s to come up with a comprehensive package of reforms that would include some gun control things, but also some mental health things and a range of other things that creative policy-makers could come up with, and to de-ideologize it. To have the same fight again, I don’t see the point in it. On gun control, as I say, I’m not against them. But most of the guns that these guys get, they get legally. Oregon happens to be a place… JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was the case this time. DAVID BROOKS: And Oregon happens to be a place with pretty tight gun control legislation. The criminals — the people who are in criminal gangs do get the guns illegally, but there are so many guns in this country. We can’t — we’re not going to deport 12 million immigrants. We’re also not going to get rid of 250 million guns. There are just practical realities. E.J. DIONNE: But there are practical approaches to that. Australia had a massive gun buy-back program, 700,000 guns, which would translate into about 40 million here, which is a start. We are so hemmed in on the gun issue that we right now can’t do a thing. I’m all for doing more on mental health. I don’t think there is a real problem with that. The problem, the ideological part, is on guns. DAVID BROOKS: Yes. We have our history. We saw the graphic earlier in the program. One in three American households has a gun. There is a history of 300 years going back. And that’s why it touches such a nerve. And so we just have a legacy of a lot of guns in this country and that’s been true because of the nature of the settlement of the country. JUDY WOODRUFF: If history repeats itself, we talk about it for a few days and then we move on to the next thing. DAVID BROOKS: I agree with that.

Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, will announce the new proposals in separate town-hall-style events in New Hampshire, a state with a Democratic senator who has voted for some gun-control measures but where there is a thriving gun and hunting culture. The proposals will come just days after Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” to counter the National Rifle Association, after another mass shooting, this time at a college in Oregon, left nine people dead. Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a constant in her campaign speeches since the Charleston, S.C., shootings in which nine black congregants were killed. The proposal most likely to generate controversy is using executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole, if efforts to pass new measures in Congress do not succeed, according to a campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, who asked for anonymity to lay out the plans before the candidate does. Most of the ideas would face a steep battle with the Republican-led Congress, and efforts to pass new gun restrictions in the wake of the murders of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Since then, there have been a number of mass shootings, including the most recent, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., last week. But her proposals are in sharp contrast to the Republican presidential hopefuls, and she is making them as her main rival in the primary polls, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has gained ground against her, but has also come under scrutiny among Democrats for some gun control policies he has opposed in the past. A central issue in Mrs. Clinton’s proposals are the background checks on prospective gun buyers, which are required for retailers at stores. But under federal law, they are not required at gun shows or over the Internet with private sellers. Under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, she would use administrative powers to make anyone selling a substantial number of guns declared “in the business” of firearms dealing, and subject to the same rules as retailers, if Congress does not act, according to the campaign aide. It was not immediately clear what the bar for being declared “in the business” would be. And use of executive action in connection with guns is certain to face criticism from staunch supporters of the Second Amendment. It is also likely to be applauded by Democrats who have grown weary of gridlock in Congress. Earlier in the evening, another Democratic candidate, Martin O’Malley, urged Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to embrace policies he supports, including a reinstatement of the lapsed federal assault weapons ban. That does not appear to be among those she will suggest. Mrs. Clinton will suggest urging Congress to end another loophole, by which people with felony records who should be barred from obtaining a gun can get one if their background check is not completed within three days. That loophole was how Dylann Roof, the accused killer in Charleston, obtained his weapon despite a felony conviction for a drug arrest. Since the Charleston shooting, Mrs. Clinton has frequently talked about gun control, but her comments have grown stronger. On Friday, a day after the shootings in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” that would counter the National Rifle Association. “Here’s what the other side counts on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, ‘We will vote against you.’ ” Advertisement",2015-10-05 08:00:00,"To Curb Gun Violence, Hillary Clinton Has a Plan for Possible Executive Action",,1,http://nytimes.com

Friday, 02 October 2015 12:46 PM The gunman stormed into a classroom in Snyder Hall on campus, shot a professor at point-blank range, then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before he shot them one by one, according to survivors' accounts. Seven people were hospitalized, three of them listed as critical. The killer died after exchanging gunfire with two police officers who confronted him. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin vowed never to utter the shooter's name calling the killings 'a horrific act of cowardice.' In a photo posted on what was believed to be his MySpace profile, a young man with a shaved head and dark-rimmed eyeglasses stares into the camera while holding a rifle.

During the shooting, students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave. ""We  began to run,"" student Hannah Miles said. ""A lot of my classmates were  going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I  turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building."" At  least nine people were killed and seven others wounded Thursday, the  fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber  town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent  Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with  about 3,000 students. ""I suspect this is going to start a  discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare  themselves for events like this,"" former college president Joe Olson  said. Mercer lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester,  where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff  John Hanlin said Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would  be released later, he said. A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The  Associated Press that Mercer ""seemed really unfriendly"" and would ""sit  by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."" Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer's mother also lived upstairs and was ""crying her eyes out"" Thursday. Social  profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA,  frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass  shootings. There didn't seem to be many recent connections on the  social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing  two friends. In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to  have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account  and a blog. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to  belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads  included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at  Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged  readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two  former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented  materialism as preventing spiritual development. A MySpace page  that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics  of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a  rifle. Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of  Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as  uncommunicative. His father, Ian Mercer, said late Thursday that  it's been a ""devastating day"" for him and his family, and he has been  talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV  and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana,  California. Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn't make sense. ""All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,"" she told KCBS-TV. Hanlin, the sheriff, said Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter's name because that's what he would have wanted. ""I  will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably  sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,"" said a visibly angry  Hanlin. Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" was played. Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities. ""That's all I could think about today. There's 10, 9 kids who won't get those doors opened,"" he said. Roseburg  is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the  Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it's no stranger  to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and  wounded a fellow student in 2006. At the White House, a visibly angry President Barack Obama challenged Americans across the political spectrum to press their elected leaders to enact tougher firearms-safety laws. He lashed out at the National Rifle Association gun lobby for blocking reforms and lamented how common mass shootings had become. ""Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine,"" he said. ""We've become numb to this."" Residents at an apartment house a short distance from campus where the suspect lived recognized him from photos and described him as edgy. A man identifying himself as Ian Mercer, the gunman's father, spoke briefly to a throng of reporters and camera crews outside his home in Los Angeles on Thursday night. ""It's been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,"" he said, according to a transcript provided by KNBC-TV. Authorities offered no motive for the shooting. Hanlin, the county sheriff, said an investigation was underway by homicide detectives and federal agents. Residents of Roseburg, about 260 miles (420 km) south of Portland, were left to ponder the how and why of the violence. ""ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?"" Accounts from survivors were chilling. Stacy Boylan  told CNN his daughter recalled seeing her professor being shot point blank as the assailant stormed into the classroom. ""He was able to stand there and start asking people one by one what their religion was,"" Boylan said, relating the ordeal as described by his daughter. ""'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them. ... 'If you're a Christian, stand up. Good. Because you're a Christian, you're going to see God in just about one second,' and he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line, doing this to people.""

Another family member,  Autumn Vican,  described to NBC News what her brother J.J. witnessed in the room where the shootings occurred. According to NBC: “Vicari said at one point the shooter told people to stand up before asking whether they were Christian or not. Vicari’s brother told her that anyone who responded ‘yes’ was shot in the head. If they said ‘other’ or didn’t answer, they were shot elsewhere in the body, usually the leg.” Scores of people huddled at a somber candlelight vigil in a park on Thursday night. ""We need to start loving each other as people ... or our nation is going to start falling apart,"" said Michael Sprague, 35, a businessman who lives in the Roseburg area. The violence in Roseburg was the latest in a flurry of mass killings in recent years across the United States and the deadliest so far in 2015. It surpassed the nine killed in a gun battle between motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the nine who died in the rampage at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June. Not counting Thursday's incident, 293 mass shootings have been reported this year, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The violence has fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and for better care for the mentally ill. Those grieving at Thursday night's vigil said they were still trying to understand the tragedy. ""You know, there's all this stuff in the news and with politics going on about the Second Amendment and gun control,"" said Ken Shemel. ""It's like, 'Come on, guys, just give us a second to breathe,' you know?""   © 2021 Thomson/Reuters.  All rights reserved. Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

552,http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2015/10/04/25000-strong-in-boston-for-bernie-not-much-on-taxes/,"Reports I have read on the Bernie Sanders rally at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center yesterday indicate attendance of 25,000, a five block line waiting to get in and thousands left out in the cold.  I can at least partially confirm some of that.  The room in the expo center was very big and very full.  My place in the line seemed to be a couple of blocks away from the center and there were plenty of people behind me and the retired school superintendent I had car pooled with.  It wasn't really cold though - more blustery.  Two other observations.  The crowd was very young and pretty white.  My big disappointment was that there was not that much on taxes, but maybe that is something of a tax story.  We'll get to that. BOSTON, MA - OCTOBER 3: Supporters of Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders listen during... [+] a rally at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) Getting In We'd been warned to get there early and had.  Frank and I met up in Westborough at 3:00 and were at the Center not much after 3:30 for the event that was slated to start at 6:00. I sprung the extra ten bucks for valet parking.  Then we had to hike to the end of the line, which was already a considerable distance although we were assured that we still had a good chance to get in.  While waiting people came along trying to sell us buttons and get us to sign petitions. There were a couple of requests for signatures for  a ""millionaires tax"" that would tack an additional 4% in state income tax onto people with incomes over $1,000,000.  The Massachusetts income tax rate of 5.15% is pretty middle of the road and by the state constitution has to remain flat, which is why the ballot question is needed to change it.  The thing about Massachusetts is that unless you stay on the East West thoroughfares like the Mass Pike and Route 20, you can't drive much over forty miles without crossing a state line, which might makes millionaire flight pretty easy. The other thing about the proposal is that it made me pine for the good old days when ""millionaire"" meant someone with a net worth of a million dollars, which I might actually aspire to soaking wet after a full meal with the wind at my back. We mostly chatted with an official of the ironworkers local who said that his local is all for Bernie, but the national union is not on board yet.  He told us that he is a third-generation ironworker with roots in Newfoundland.  Apparently the maritime tradition of climbing up on masts and the like translates into ironworking. Who knew? BOSTON, MA - OCTOBER 3: Supporters of Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders listen during... [+] a rally at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) The Warm-up After we finally got into the venue, there was a pretty long period of standing around as the room filled.  The traffic direction was handled pretty smoothly by the volunteers. Several hours of standing on a hard floor is tough on old guys like me and Frank, but the youth did not seem to be disturbed.  I wandered off after agreeing that we would meet under the huge American flag.  It might have been a mistake, since Frank and I had had a prime vantage point and I ended up far enough away from the lectern that I did not get any decent pictures.

Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) I ended up mostly chatting with some Harvard students.  They were interesting guys, attorneys who are getting Harvard LLMs, all from other countries - Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Pakistan.  The thing that bothered them most about Bernie is that, from their perspective, he is weak on gun control.  The Aussie told me that there had been one mass shooting in Australia and that was it they rounded up all the guns.  I didn't do a very good job of explaining why that would not be something worth trying in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Finally Symone Sanders, Bernie's new National Press Secretary, a young African American woman, took the stage, perhaps an indication that future crowds might not be so dominated by the melanin deficient.  (I didn't catch the name of the fellow who had come on before her.)  Prior to the main event she introduced four speakers who nicely linked his outreach to organized labor and concern about health care, students and the environment. Karen Higgins, President of the National Nurses Union spoke about ""breaking the class ceiling"" and Bernie being for education not incarceration and the that he would be the President of the 99%.  Jimmy O'Brien President of the Boston Carmen's Union spoke about a move to privatize parts of the MBTA.  They were followed by Jillian Brownsford, a nursing student at UMass-Boston and environmental author Bill McKibben, who took off his hat to show us he was as gray as Bernie.

[+] the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. Thousands of people attended the rally, one of the biggest in recent state history for a politician. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) It sometimes seems to me that Republicans when at all possible want to be seen as running against the IRS and Lois Lerner.  Bernie Sanders wants to be seen as running against Citizens United and the Koch brothers.   He let us know that he does not represent the billionaire class and does not want their money.  Although I found this intriguing group called Patriotic Millionaires who are in favor of higher taxes, something tells me  Billionaires for Bernie, will not be a thing, so the image of him spurning their money will probably remain hypothetical. I think ""Koch"" may have been the only name he mentioned more than once and it was always good for a rousing boo.  There were some interesting zingers as when he talked about Republicans being in a parallel universe and being a national embarrassment as a political party that refuses to believe science when it comes to climate change.  He talked about how as husband, father and grandfather that he supports family values, but just does not think that that includes interfering with how women control their own bodies and preventing gay people from marrying one another.  Pretty  sure that part rated the biggest cheers. We heard about the grotesque level of inequality and the impossibility of surviving on $7.25 per hour.  He also called for amnesty and a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people living among us. On Taxes Much to my disappointment, the only mention of taxes was in the part about providing tuition-free public education.  It would be financed by a ""tax on Wall Street speculation"".  For whatever it is worth Tim Worstall in his piece - Bernie Sanders And His Adventures With The Magic Money Tree - argues that scored dynamically the Financial Transactions Tax being floated by Sanders is a revenue loser.  I don't think too many people in the crowd have read that.  Personally, I remain agnostic on the Final Transactions Tax, although every time I have mentioned it I have heard that it would turn lower Manhattan into a ghost town or something like that. So I remain waiting for the other shoe to drop on the Sanders tax plan.  The high points of the unofficial summary I received from the campaign were lifting the cap on earnings subject to social security tax and taxing dividends and capital gains the same as ordinary income.  There was not mention of an increase in the top marginal rate.  Given his interest in rebuilding the middle class, it might be worth reflecting that in any given year, some of the high incomes and capital gains are middle-class people having a brief moment in the sun when a small business or rental building tended for decades is sold.  Maybe they are thinking about that in crafting their plan.  We can hope. How Many People Are Feeling The Bern? Yesterday is pretty good evidence that there is quite a bit of enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders.  Several of my Jewish friends have told me that the country is just not ready for a Jewish President, but I really think that that ship has sailed.  If the Sanders campaign can craft a tax plan that could conceivably pay for everything without squashing real entrepreneurs, he might find support in all sorts of odd places.  Oddly enough, Jeb Bush with his proposal to eliminate the deduction for business interest may have failed in that regard.  I just hope that Sanders doesn't go crazy with the top marginal rate. We'll see. If you don't believe I was really there.  The evidence is at 00:15 on this clip.  I have been a CPA for over 30 years focusing on taxation.

554,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/atf-thomas-brandon-acting-head-demotion-214542,"ATF agents inspect an apartment building in Los Angeles after a raid. The White House will opt to leave the top job at the ATF vacant, avoiding a potentially difficult nomination battle amid a larger ongoing debate over gun control. | AP Photo The move is aimed at avoiding a confirmation battle at the scandal-plagued agency blamed for the 'Fast and Furious' gun-running operation. By SARAH WHEATON 10/08/2015 08:56 AM EDT Updated 10/08/2015 11:15 AM EDT The White House thinks the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is doing such a great job, they’re planning to demote him. The unusual move allows the administration, which has said fighting gun violence is a top priority, to avoid a nasty confirmation hearing for a troubled agency. The Obama administration has no plans to name a permanent director for the agency, and career agent Thomas Brandon has been serving as the acting chief since April. But by law, he can’t hold that interim title for longer than 120 days, and that clock runs out on Oct. 27. Brandon confirmed to POLITICO that he has agreed to stay on while re-assuming his previous title of deputy director – but still serving as the agency’s highest-ranking official. “We're not going to nominate you, but we have full confidence in you if you stay at the ATF,” Brandon said, recounting the explanation he received from the White House. ""If they don't nominate anybody and I revert back to just the deputy director, but I'm still the CEO, I will give the taxpayers what I've always given them: a hard day's work,'' Brandon said in an interview Wednesday following a summit on violent crime hosted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The arrangement would leave the federal agency in charge of regulating the firearms industry and investigating illegal guns without an official leader indefinitely, even as gun violence has once again become an administration priority. President Barack Obama has vowed to do all he can to reduce gun violence in the wake of last week's college shooting in Roseburg, Oregon -– where he plans to travel to pay respects to the victims on Friday -– all while continuing to castigate Congress for refusing to pass new gun control laws. By BURGESS EVERETT and SEUNG MIN KIM A White House official did not deny that Brandon's title would be changing even as he remains the ATF's top-ranked official, adding that he “is currently fulfilling the role and is providing the outstanding leadership the Bureau needs at this time.” The ATF has faced chronic vacancies since 2006 when Congress started requiring that appointees win Senate approval for the top position, which oversees 2,500 agents charged with enforcing federal laws on alcohol, tobacco and firearms. In recent years, the bureau has faced continuing accusations of scandal and mismanagement, most notably the “Fast and Furious” gun-running operation in which the agency sold weapons to Mexican drug cartels in an effort to track them. In fact, the ATF has only had one permanent director under Obama: B. Todd Jones. His confirmation became a priority as part of a flurry of executive activity to reduce gun violence in early 2013 in response to the mass shooting of 20 schoolchildren and six educators in Newtown, Conn. But Jones left on March 31 to take a job at the National Football League. Brandon, then Jones’s deputy, has been serving as acting director since. Over the summer, the administration showed signs that it planned to nominate Brandon to the position permanently, but it later reversed course. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, who would oversee any ATF confirmation hearings, has stepped up his criticism of the agency recently. On Sept. 14, he wrote to Lynch expressing concerns about whistleblowers’ claims of sexual harassment at the bureau -- and their accusation that Brandon and Jones were both aware of the allegations. Grassley said on Wednesday that such issues would definitely come up in confirmation hearings for a future ATF director. “There’s no question that anybody nominated to lead the ATF will face difficult questions about the agency and its future,” Grassley said in an email. “There are far too many questionable activities going on at the agency like the alleged sexual harassment and discrimination that the Judiciary Committee is investigating.” Brandon joined the ATF in 1989, after spending four years in the Marines. He spent most of his career in the Detroit field division, rising to the top rank there before taking charge of the Phoenix field division in the wake of Fast and Furious. But he was only there for about two months before moving to Washington to be the bureau’s deputy director in October 2011. Brandon, 55, could have retired five years ago. “But I’m a public servant and remain that,” he said. The mission of the ATF is “in my blood,” he said, saying he is committed to the ATF “troops” and holds respect for the Justice Department’s top officials. To keep up morale in the face of the leadership vacancy, Brandon said he plans “a lot of internal messaging, and I do know that the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, and the White House have said they want to show a lot of support to me.” He also said he expected the current political emphasis on guns would ensure that ATF remains a top administration priority. But gun control advocates aren’t so sure. Congress By BURGESS EVERETT “As a matter of policy and politics, it's clear that President Obama should nominate an exceptionally well-qualified law enforcement veteran to be the nation's top cop in the fight against illegal guns,” said Arkadi Gerney, a senior vice president of the Center for American Progress who has also advocated folding the ATF into the FBI. “If the Republican-led Senate, which claims to want to enforce the laws on the books, fails to confirm the nominee -- well, then it's on them."" The ATF has long suffered something of an identity crisis, growing out of an agency first created by the Treasury Department to collect taxes on tobacco and liquor in the late 1800s. Guns became part of the portfolio in the 1930s, and they became its main focus in the second half of the 20th century. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the ATF moved under the umbrella of the Justice Department. Brandon was philosophical about being asked to take a drop in stature while holding the same authority, paraphrasing a quote from Gen. Colin Powell: ""Don't align the position so close to your ego that your ego goes with it."" The agent currently serving as acting deputy director, Ronald Turk, would remain Brandon’s No. 2. It’s unclear what his job title would be, Brandon said, but Turk would be the equivalent of the Chief Operating Officer to his chief executive role. “We’re in uncharted waters here,"" Brandon said, ""and looking long-term.""

Monday, 05 October 2015 04:41 PM Clinton detailed proposals Monday aimed at closing gun-sale loopholes and holding sellers more accountable for how the weapons are used. President Barack Obama last week said he would pressure Congress to enact legislation that would curb firearms violence after a gunman killed nine people in Oregon. “There’s a joke in the firearms industry that President Obama is the world’s best gun salesman and there is data to support increased purchases of firearms heading into the 2008 and 2012 elections,” said Andrea James, an analyst with Dougherty & Co. “Of course, Hillary Clinton is vying for the same job.” Smith & Wesson, whose brands also include M&P and Thompson/Center Arms, surged 7.3 percent to close at $17.81 in New York, the biggest one-day jump since Aug. 28. Sturm Ruger, maker of Ruger American, Gunsite Scout and Hawkeye weapons, increased 2.6 percent to $57.93. Retailers that sell firearms also benefited. Cabela’s Inc. gained 2.9 percent to $45.40, while Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. increased 2.5 percent to $52.28. Past Surges The gunmakers’ shares have seen gains in recent years in the wake of mass shootings that have led to increased calls for gun-ownership restrictions. Both companies also have seen sales rise in response to the politicians’ demands for tougher legislation. Those efforts have all fizzled. “The threat of legislation can cause temporary buying surges,” said James, who has a buy rating on both gunmakers. “The best thing for firearms demand is to have the constant threat of legislation without ever actually having the legislation.” James estimated that firearms sales will rise at about two times the U.S. gross domestic product, as more women, young people, and urban dwellers want personal protection and as target shooting increases in popularity. “Target shooting is basically the new bowling,” James said. The Oregon mass shooting occurred Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg. The gunman then killed himself, authorities said.  © Copyright 2021 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

560,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/VasQ0CebjGA/,"Liberal documentarian Michael Moore praised President Obama’s response to the horrific mass shooting in Oregon this week, calling Obama’s renewed calls for gun control “awesome” and expressing hope that the president would take action before he leaves office. The director’s comments came Friday afternoon at the New York Film Festival premiere of his new documentary Where to Invade Next, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film follows Moore as he “invades” other countries to explore what America could learn from them. “I am, as I said in the film, an optimist. I’m not a cynic, I don’t think it’s all f***ed,” Moore told the audience after the screening. “I feel like that sometimes, especially when things happen like yesterday’s shooting in Oregon, what do we do about that? [President Obama’s response] was awesome, and he inches his way toward that place where he needs to go. I hope he goes there. He’s got a year left.” Of course, Moore’s position on gun control is not exactly a surprise; the director’s 2002 film Bowling for Columbine, a critical look at gun culture in the United States, won him a Best Documentary Oscar and cemented his status as America’s premiere progressive documentarian. Moore couldn’t help but refer to his earlier film while discussing the shooting deaths in Oregon: “We’re like, ‘what’s the point of making that film? Here we are, 13 years later.’ But we know that’s the rabbit hole not to go down, because as I said at the end of the film, we know things can change and will change.” “I said after Newtown — and I didn’t say this glibly and it’s upsetting to think about — if they actually showed the crime scene photo of 20 first graders with their heads blown off, how long would the NRA stay in power?” he added. Moore also weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, saying he doesn’t believe a Republican could win the White House because of the country’s shifting demographics. “Seventy-nine percent of the United States are either women, people of color or between the ages of 18 and 30,” Moore explained. “Young people. That’s the block you have to win to get elected. That’s 79 percent of the country! Women, people of color, young people. Donald Trump has none of those blocks! He can’t win the majority of any of those blocks.” He continued: “The candidate [who will win] will appeal to the issues that women care about, that young people care about, and acknowledge that black lives matter and there are people of color in this country that have made it what it is. When they debated the GOP [and say] the American people, they’re thinking of the white guy, or the angry white guy, and that’s just not America anymore. That America is over. It is more of the melting pot… To just ignore that or to not address that or to say that you have the right to regulate a woman’s uterus but not guns? It’s like, I think the only safe place for guns is in a woman’s uterus, then they would be regulated by our Republican Congress!” While his new film examines so much of what America has gotten wrong, Moore thinks America has gotten things right in at least one respect: “In terms of public policy, we elected Barack Obama over John McCain — that was a good idea, I think. I think that saved us a little bit… There’s a lot of great things about us.” Where to Invade Next will be distributed by a new joint venture formed by former Radius-TWC executives Tom Quinn and Jason Janego, and Alamo Drafthouse CEO Tim League.

562,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/10/03/time-to-retire-the-phrase-trigger-warning/#disqus_thread,"America’s college campuses have been dominated by the political left for decades. The latest manifestation of that dominance is the “trigger warning”–a signal to students and faculty that they may be about to hear a politically incorrect idea that might cause some discomfort, or provoke (heaven forbid!) an unusual or unexpected thought. Yet after yet another mass shooting on campus, the time may have come to retire the phrase “trigger warning” itself. The disconnect between the violence that students have actually faced, and the sort of imagined psychological harm they are thought to risk in what used to be called academic debate, is beyond jarring. Words have meaning, and the use of violent imagery to describe the non-violent process of higher learning is offensive–not ban-this-word-lest-any-potential-members-of-a-victimized-group-feel-uncomfortable, but just repulsive, as in poor intellectual taste. We are shielding students from thoughts, but not from weapons. It is well past time to recognize that the common denominator in recent mass shootings is the fact that most of the targets were unguarded. The Umpqua Community College reportedly had one guard, who was unarmed. It seems easier and more effective to make sure someone at school can deter a would-be shooter, rather than trying to pry handguns away from millions of law-abiding citizens. The left is obsessed with pursuing campus “rape culture” and creating “safe spaces”–emotionally and intellectually safe, that is. Little thought seems to have gone into the physical protection of students, whether at colleges or high schools. Since there is virtually no gun law–short of repealing the Second Amendment–that would have stopped the shooter at Umpqua, perhaps it is worth exploring a fewalternative proposals? Or does that idea need a trigger warning? 2nd AmendmentEducationLocalacademiaMass ShootingsNRApolitical correctnessrape culturetrigger warningUmpqua Community College .

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS – “Bill Clinton’s mission creep: The ex-president is stepping up his campaign work for Hillary,” by Gabe Debenedetti in Boston, with Glenn Thrush: “Bill (a.k.a. ‘The Big Dog’ in Clintonland) gradually is expanding his influence, ... using media interviews about his charity work to make the case for his wife’s candidacy and ... participating in high-level discussions about 2016. ‘He’s such a battery charger,’ explained one longtime Clinton friend ... changing the metaphor in mid-sentence to reflect the campaign’s summer swoon. ‘He’s like paddles on the heart.’ ... “Bill — still a force of political nature — is just too important to remain sidelined. His wife raised a mere $2 million more than Sanders in the last three months, fueling doubts about a campaign that was once seen as a waltz to the nomination, if not the White House. And he’s become increasingly restive ... as his wife faces declining poll numbers and a Vermont-based insurgency by a challenger who wasn’t on their radar a year ago. ... “The recent conclusion of the Clinton Global Initiative meetings in New York marks an acceleration in Bill’s political activity, starting with three closed-door fundraisers in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan. ... [P]eople close to the campaign — including donors and aides — are seeing the former president invoked increasingly in email chains ... “[H]e will likely slowly start ramping up his own political travel, ... particularly in places like West Virginia, where the local party infrastructure has fallen on hard times ... [H]e will likely begin to raise money for Priorities USA.” http://politi.co/1RjPIEc BUZZ – “Bush donors pitch ‘long haul’ after ... ‘shock and awe,’” by AP’s Julie Bykowicz and Tom Beaumont: “Using phrases like ‘go the distance,’ ‘marathon’ and ‘long haul,’ [Bush strategists] argue that [he] is uniquely positioned to outlast, ... regardless of the fundraising number he posts for the third quarter. ...

Because dealers can shop a customer’s loan application to dozens of lenders, they can usually find better rates than consumers can on their own. Dealers can also offer discounts that lead to even lower interest rates and greater savings. But the CFPB wants to eliminate dealer discounts, making car loans more expensive for consumers. The Wall Street Journal estimates that the CFPB’s proposed changes could cost some consumers nearly $600 over a four-year loan.

          / AP WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are preparing a legislative push to curb guns, a week after a mass shooting at an Oregon community college refocused attention on the nation's toll of firearms deaths. Republicans controlling Congress have shown scant interest in restricting guns and the Democratic effort has little chance of success. But their drive could keep the issue alive during next year's elections and complicate Republican senators' re-election campaigns in some closely divided states. Democrats plan to eventually demand votes on their proposals and use procedural delays to thwart legislation if Republicans refuse to do so, a Democratic aide said Wednesday. The aide wasn't authorized to discuss the plans publicly and requested anonymity. Democrats said their effort would include broadening background checks, now required only for sales by federally licensed firearms dealers, to cover all sales at gun shows and online. A bipartisan version of that plan was blocked in 2013 by Republicans and a few Democrats, months after the fatal shooting of 20 students and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. They said they would propose making it harder for people to buy guns if their background check, which is run by the FBI, is not completed. Currently, if a background check is still not complete after three days -- often because the FBI is awaiting information from local law enforcement agencies -- the sale is allowed. Democrats said they would extend that period but didn't yet know for how long. They also said they would seek to add all domestic abusers to the list of those prohibited from purchasing firearms, and make it a federal offense to be a straw purchaser, or someone who buys a firearm for somebody else. The plans were described in a letter to Democratic senators written by Sens. Chuck Schumer and Debbie Stabenow, leaders of Senate Democrats' messaging efforts. A gunman killed nine people last week at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Authorities said Wednesday that the shooter, Christopher Harper-Mercer, killed himself in a room where many of his victims lay after he was wounded by plainclothes detectives. President Barack Obama plans to travel to Roseburg on Friday to meet with victims' families. As he has after several mass shootings, he has called on Congress to strengthen gun restrictions but expressed frustration with lawmakers' inaction.

570,http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/05/not-naming-the-oregon-shooter-helps-gun-control-enthusiasts/,"The horrific shooting of a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, has pushed America to look for answers. As what is too often the case for any mass shooting, many of America’s leaders have decided guns are ultimately responsible for the deaths of nine innocent people. At the same time, guns are getting the brunt of the blame. The actual shooter, Chris Harper-Mercer, is getting relatively little attention when compared to previous mass murderers. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, the chief local law enforcement official in Roseburg, has made it clear to reporters that they “will never hear me mention his [Harper-Mercer’s] name.” Hanlin’s said that his decision to not utter the shooter’s name is due to the sheriff’s desire to deny Harper-Mercer’s wish to gain fame through the slaughter. The Oregon sheriff does have a point in not wanting to give the killer more attention. From what has been revealed so far, Harper-Mercer had a marked interest in mass shooters like Vester Flannigan and Adam Lanza and could’ve been potentially been inspired to kill by such heinous acts. It also appears that the Roseburg shooter felt like he was a nobody who could only achieve notice through violence. So it’s a reasonable, and even commendable decision for Hanlin to not indulge the killer’s twisted wish. But it is not commendable for the media and political leaders to overlook the fact that a human being killed nine people, especially in light of the renewed calls for gun control. Refusing to discuss the shooter, his background and what drove him to kill in favor of hyperbolic talk on how dangerous guns are is asinine. The responsibility for this murder is being taken away from Harper-Mercer and placed on a disembodied gun that somehow wandered into the school on its own accord. Failing to scrutinize the man who pulled the trigger allows the conversation to center entirely on guns, which is exactly how President Obama and others want it to play out. Even though none of the proposed gun restrictions would have likely prevented the shooting, plus the massacre took place in a state with some of the most stringent restrictions on firearms in the country, those facts don’t matter. (RELATED: Obama: We Need More Gun Control) Before the public had known any concrete details of the shooting, Obama made a speech placing the blame squarely on guns and called for “common sense gun safety laws” in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Liberals have already set their sights on exploiting the shooting to try to push gun legislation — forgetting the man behind the trigger helps them in this task. It’s a great irony that the sheriff who’s largely responsible for calling upon the media to not focus on the shooter has publicly spoken out against gun control. The media framing also leads to this incredulous softball interview with Harper-Mercer’s father. The killer’s dad, Ian Mercer, abandoned his child at an early age and was by all accounts a terrible parent. But instead of accepting some blame for the tragic shooting or saying how his troubled son was ultimately responsible for the carnage, the elder Mercer said guns were the primary perpetrator and absolved his son of responsibility. (RELATED: Chris Mercer’s Dad Wants To Know Where He Got Those Guns) I guess guns have the power to possess humans, and Harper-Mercer had no agency when he kept pulling the trigger. This situation is very different from how the media treated the Charleston, S.C. church shooting back in June. Then, once it was realized that it was more politically favorable to blame “white America” and the Confederate flag for the murder of nine people, the media zeroed in on the killer and was happy to announce his name from sea to shining sea. Dylann Roof, somehow, was transformed into the living embodiment of every sin committed by white people throughout the centuries. His parents were not given softball interviews and were not able to deflect blame onto firearms. The reason why Roof got intense scrutiny is because his identification as a white supremacist made it easy to turn his crime into a cornucopia of left-wing advocacy. Harper-Mercer, on the other hand, appears to have no political affiliations and was raised by his African-American mother. So it’s hard to say he was a neo-Nazi or tea party extremist — except the media has already managed to imply the mixed-race shooter was somehow a white supremacist. The Los Angeles Times reported on Friday that Harper-Mercer had “white supremacy leanings” — whatever the hell that means. Several news outlets reported that his parting message was “full of hate,” a subtle allusion it was the kind of “hate” the left loves to associate with the right. If the public was made more aware of the killer’s background, these silly assertions would not be able to be passed off as fact. However right it may seem to not mention Harper-Mercer’s name, it comes at the price of understanding the situation and is an open invitation to the media to frame the shooting the way they want to frame it. And we wonder why the Roseburg narrative centers entirely around inanimate objects instead of the sick men who use them to kill innocent people.

""This is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together,"" Obama said, speaking hours after the shooting at an Oregon community college that reportedly left at least 10 people dead and several others injured. ""This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America."" The shooter, identified as a 26-year-old male named Chris Harper Mercer, opened fire earlier in the day at Umpqua Community College. Police said the shooter was among those who died. For Obama, reacting to a shooting has become an all-too-common occurrence. Thursday's 13-minute statement constituted the 15th time during his presidency that he has responded to a mass shooting, according to CBS's Mark Knoller. According to The Washington Post, meanwhile, a full calendar week has yet to pass without a mass-shooting incident during Obama's second term in office. According to the group Everytown for Gun Safety, Thursday's shooting in Oregon was the 142nd school-shooting incident since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The last time he made a statement from the White House — on the shooting that left nine dead at a historically African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina — he lamented that he has had to ""make statements like this too many times."" This time, he used language that went even further. He stood dismayed at the numbness of the ""routine"" that has developed in the aftermath of shootings, saying the ""thoughts and prayers"" commonly offered are ""not enough."" ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium is routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it — we've become numb to this,"" Obama said.

He mocked what he imagined as press releases being drafted by certain members of Congress that call for ""more guns"" to solve the problem. ""How can you, with a straight face,"" Obama said, ""argue that more guns will make us safer?"" And he asked voters to step up — to vote out of office members of Congress who refuse to support popular measures to curb gun violence, such as an expansion of federal background checks on gun buyers. ""Each time this happens, I'm going to bring this up. I am going to say that we can actually do something about it,"" he said in closing his remarks. He added: ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experiences as president, I can't guarantee that, and that is a terrible thing.""",2015-10-01 18:21:00,OBAMA LASHES OUT: 'This issue should be politicized',,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

We have to do a much better job with mental health.” Citing violence in Chicago and Baltimore, Trump said “a lot of the places where you have the biggest problem is where they have the strongest laws,” but he demurred when pressed on national gun laws. Asked how he would address mental health as president, Trump suggested “better services, better doctors,” but also warned against institutionalizing too quickly when a patient “hasn’t done anything yet.” By LAUREN FRENCH The billionaire New York real estate developer and entertainer also said he supported the local sheriff’s decision in Oregon to not say the shooter’s name, while criticizing the media for using it, which Trump said creates “copycats.” “Wouldn't it be wonderful if you wouldn't cover it?” Trump said. “Because I think that's part of the problem.” NBC host Chuck Todd also pressed Trump on myriad other issues, including his new tax plan, cuts to federal agencies and streamlining military spending. “I'm gonna build a military that's gonna be much stronger than it is right now,” Trump said. “But you know what? We can do it for a lot less.” Asked if he would cut defense spending, Trump said he wouldinstead tackle waste and fraud. Reminded by Todd said that politicians always say they'll end “waste, fraud and abuse,” Trump replied, “But I’m not a politician.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

579,http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/07/the-problem-isnt-guns-or-white-men/,"The media act as if they’re performing a public service by refusing to release details about the perpetrator of the recent mass shooting at a community college in Oregon. But we were given plenty of information about Dylan Roof, Adam Lanza, James Holmes and Jared Loughner. Now, quick: Name the mass shooters at the Chattanooga military recruitment center; the Washington Navy Yard; the high school in Washington state; Fort Hood (the second time) and the Christian college in California. All those shootings also occurred during the last three years. The answers are: Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, Kuwaiti; Aaron Alexis, black, possibly Barbadian-American; Jaylen Ray Fryberg, Indian; Ivan Antonio Lopez, Hispanic; and One L. Goh, Korean immigrant. (While I’m here: Why are we bringing in immigrants who are mentally unstable?) There’s a rigid formula in media accounts of mass shootings: If possible, blame it on angry white men; when that won’t work, blame it on guns. The perpetrator of the latest massacre, Chris Harper-Mercer, was a half-black immigrant, so the media are refusing to get too specific about him. They don’t want to reward the fiend with publicity! But as people hear details the media are not anxious to provide, they realize that, once again: It’s a crazy person. How long is this going to go on? When will the public rise up and demand that the therapeutic community stop loosing these nuts on the public? After the fact, scores of psychiatrists are always lining up to testify that the defendant was legally insane, unable to control his actions. That information would be a lot more helpful before the wanton slaughter. Product manufacturers are required by law to anticipate that some idiot might try to dry his cat in the microwave. But a person whose job it is to evaluate mental illness can’t be required to ascertain whether the person sitting in his office might be unstable enough to kill? Maybe at their next convention, psychiatrists could take up a resolution demanding an end to our absurd patient privacy and involuntary commitment laws. True, America has more privately owned guns than most other countries, and mass shootings are, by definition, committed with guns. But we also make it a lot more difficult than any other country to involuntarily commit crazy people. Since the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s, civil commitment in the United States almost always requires a finding of dangerousness — both imminent and physical — as determined by a judge. Most of the rest of the world has more reasonable standards — you might almost call them “common sense” — allowing family, friends and even acquaintances to petition for involuntarily commitment, with the final decision made by doctors. The result of our laissez-faire approach to dangerous psychotics is visible in the swarms of homeless people on our streets, crazy people in our prison populations and the prevalence of mass shootings. According to a 2002 report by Central Institute of Mental Health for the European Union, the number of involuntarily detained mental patients, per 100,000 people, in other countries looks like this: — Austria, 175 — Finland, 218 — Germany, 175 — Sweden, 114 — England, 93 The absolute maximum number of mental patients per 100,000 people who could possibly be institutionalized by the state in the U.S. — voluntarily or involuntarily — is: 17. Yes, according to the Treatment Advocacy Center, there are a grand total of 17 psychiatric beds even available, not necessarily being used. In 1955, there were 340. After every mass shooting, the left has a lot of fun forcing Republicans to defend guns. Here’s an idea: Why not force Democrats to defend the right of the dangerous mentally ill not to take their medicine? Liberals will howl about “stigmatizing” the mentally ill, but they sure don’t mind stigmatizing white men or gun owners. About a third of the population consists of white men. Between a third and half of all Americans have guns in the home. If either white men or guns were the main cause of mass murder, no one would be left in the country. But I notice that every mass murder is committed by someone who is mentally ill. When the common denominator is a characteristic found in about 0.1 percent of the population — I think we’ve found the crucial ingredient! Democrats won’t be able to help themselves, but to instantly close ranks and defend dangerous psychotics, hauling out the usual meaningless statistics: — Most mentally ill are not violent! Undoubtedly true. BUT WE’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANOREXICS, AGORAPHOBICS OR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVES. We were thinking of paranoid schizophrenics. — The mentally ill are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence! I’ll wager that the percentage of the nation’s 310 million guns that are ever used in a crime is quite a bit lower than the percentage of mentally ill to ever engage in violence. As with the “most Muslims are peaceful” canard, while a tiny percentage of mentally ill are violent, a gigantic percentage of mass shooters are mentally ill. How can these heartless Democrats look the parents of dead children in the eye and defend the right of the mentally deranged to store their feces in a shoebox, menace library patrons — and, every now and then, commit mass murder?

Do they think passing a law against murder will stop murder? Do they think passing a law against X will stop X from happening?” Limbaugh asked on his Friday show, one day after the shooting. “Of course not. So what’s so magic about gun control? And there you realize. There you learn that it isn’t about stopping things like this. What they are really pushing for is not stopping things like this because we’ve already demonstrated that we can’t, given their policy. They take instances like this and they rub their hands together in near glee and think of the opportunity to disarm even more Americans,” he said. Limbaugh, who previously discussed CNN’s Wolf Blitzer’s remarks that Obama was “embarrassed” in front of the world when the school massacre happened, went on to say: Now, within the subset of liberals I can guarantee you there are some buffalo’ed, innocent, ignorant, standard, ordinary, every day Americans who mistakenly believe in the goodness of their hearts that taking guns away from people will make us safer. I’m not accusing them. Now all of them are wrong and shortsighted, but the people who spearhead things like this, like Obama, and whenever there are elected Democrats, they run out there at the first sign of trouble and try to politicize it in capitalize on it. That’s the right word. Why would anybody want to capitalize on it? Who does? You need to ask yourself who is it trying to capitalize on it? I can guarantee you the vast majority of them will have a D– a capital D next to their name if they are on the ballot. Obama embarrassed for his country? Wants more gun control? The guy just cleared the decks for Iran to get a freaking nuclear weapon and he’s embarrassed of this country? Obama said of the gun control issue during a White House press conference Friday, “I’m going to talk about this on a regular basis. And I will politicize this. Because our inaction is a political decision that we’re making.” He added, “Unless we change that political dynamic, we’re not going to be able to make a big dent in this problem.” “The people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and organized and adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists, who think that any gun safety measures are an assault on freedom, or communistic, or a plot by me to take over and stay in power forever, or something,” he said.

But when asked if it was too late for Vice President JOE BIDEN to jump into the race, Obama remained positive about his right-hand man but non-specific. “I love JOE BIDEN and he’s got his own decision to make and I’ll leave it at that,” he said. “In the meantime, he’s doing a great job as vice president and has been really helpful on a whole bunch of issues.” http://politi.co/1FLCxej Happy Friday, and welcome to the 2016 Blast, where we try to never cancel on you.

Send your tips, complaints, and hottest hot takes to: [email protected] TRAIL MIX: Here’s what’s popping on the campaign trail In today’s campaign news, HILLARY CLINTON’s donors get a pep talk, even while some defect to JOE BIDEN. BERNIE SANDERS may have to talk about his record on guns at a particularly inopportune time. DONALD TRUMP cancels, MARCO RUBIO talks Russia, JEB BUSH has another problematic phrasing, and BOBBY JINDAL has a home state problem. THE DAILY CLINTON PEP TALK: POLITICO’s Kenneth P. Vogel reports David Brock, “one of HILLARY CLINTON’s leading liaisons to big-money Democrats on Thursday privately relayed a simple message to major donors who might be concerned about the struggles of their party’s leading presidential candidate: ‘buck up and chill out.’ ‘We can’t let the garbage get in the way of electing the best candidate in this race and the first woman president,' Brock told donors, according to the source.” http://politi.co/1OdaAyw PROBLEM SPOT: Washington Post looks at a new Suffolk/USA Today poll that shows HILLARY CLINTON dropping support with African-Americans, a potentially very problematic development for her campaign: http://wapo.st/1QNliJN INDIANOPLACE LIKE HOME: The Indianapolis Star has fresh fall out from HILLARY CLINTON’s emails: Apparently she referred to the Hoosier State as Indianaoplace in emails, riling up some locals (Though she does plug the state’s love for basketball): http://indy.st/1OMOK58 WALSH WAITS: Boston Herald says Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he had “No comment right now,” and didn’t offer an endorsement after appearing with her at event on Thursday. http://bit.ly/1JKG4nR THE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE BIDEN BACKERS: The Wall Street Journal reports that some who have already given money to HILLARY CLINTON “are defecting to JOE BIDEN, resisting entreaties from the Democratic front-runner’s campaign to stand by her despite declining poll numbers. A few of the fundraisers have gone public … Others have quietly decamped and signaled their intentions to the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC that is working to prod the vice president into the race for the White House.” KEY QUOTE: “Instead of being ready for Hillary, we’re waiting for Joe,” said Bill Bartmann, the founder and chief executive of CFS2 Inc., and onetime donor to Mrs. Clinton’s friendly super PAC. GUN ISSUE: NPR looks at BERNIE SANDERS’ fairly conservative record on guns and concludes it is an inopportune moment for him to have to focus on the issue. “Even though the progressive socialist is to the left of Clinton and his other primary competitors on nearly every issue, he's walked a delicate line as a lawmaker from Vermont, where 2nd Amendment rights are popular.” http://n.pr/1KQY2Jr LATINOS FOR BERNIE: POLITICO’s Daniel Strauss reports BERNIE SANDERS’ campaign announced on Friday that Arturo Carmona would serve as the campaign’s director of Latino outreach and its Southwest political director. He was previously executive director of Latino advocacy group Presente.org. http://politi.co/1Gp9mbz TRUMP ON THE STUMP AWKWARD: POLITICO’s Ben Schreckinger reports DONALD TRUMP’s Texas state director recently called him “a joke.” “I don’t know of anyone in the party who looks at him like a fellow Republican. He’s an entertainer,” Republican consultant Corbin Casteel said of Trump in an August article in the San Antonio Express-News. “I believe it’s a universal view that DONALD TRUMP is a joke.” http://politi.co/1hgpJRf NOTED: “Casteel is not the first Republican to disparage Trump before joining up with the businessman’s campaign, which pays staffers well.” HISPANIC SNUB: CNN reports DONALD TRUMP claims he never agreed to appear in front of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce while the group said they had a firm agreement for him to appear on Oct. 8 — which Trump now says won’t happen. “I never agreed to do an event,” Trump said. http://cnn.it/1hgm99L CROWNING CARLY MARKETING MAVEN: The New York Times’ David Brooks looks admiringly at how CARLY FIORINA’s style suits the 2016 campaign. “In such a giant field of candidates what matters most is the ability to grab the spotlight. The era of YouTube and FaceTime video links has further magnified the power of a candidate who can create significant moments. Fiorina is great at it, perfectly suited to this environment.” http://nyti.ms/1QPKzTJ BUT: Brooks also offers this warning: “Opposing the political class is not an agenda. Unless Fiorina can become a lot more creative and sympathetically connected to working-class voters, she’ll fall to an opponent who will turn to her in debate and ask, 'Where’s the beef?’” RATINGS DRAW: Fortune says that CARLY FIORINA and DONALD TRUMP have been huge (or as Trump might say HUGE!) ratings draws for late night TV: http://for.tn/1j5MUiM JEB’S JOURNEY STUFF HAPPENS: POLITICO’s Daniel Strauss reports that a day after a massacre at at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., that left nine dead and seven injured JEB BUSH “said ‘stuff happens’ but that does not mean gun restrictions should be tightened. ‘We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's very bad to see,’ the former Florida governor said. Then he added: ‘Look, stuff happens and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do.’” http://politi.co/1KR20lg GAFFE PATROL: Bush’s growing list of unfortunate comments: http://politi.co/1KWqNSR CASH DASH: POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reports: “JEB BUSH — looking to keep his fundraising coffers afloat as he takes a tumble in the polls -- will attend 17 fundraisers over the next three weeks in a grueling cross-country fundraising push. According to a fundraising schedule released by Bush’s campaign on Friday and obtained by POLITICO, the foray includes fundraising receptions in California — where on Oct. 20 he will attend events in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Woodside — and in New Orleans, where he will make an Oct. 26 appearance. The former Florida governor will also be boosted by his brother, former President George W. Bush, who this month will host events in Arkansas, Colorado and Washington, D.C. Next week, former first lady Laura Bush will host two receptions in Florida — one in Palm Beach, the other in Winter Park.” KASICH’S CASE CLIMATE ISSUES: Huffington Post: “JOHN KASICH says he believes in the concept of climate change, but not necessarily the actual science … Kasich said there are 'natural cycles of science,' but that he didn't know enough about the subject to say how much humans are causing it. 'Do I believe there is something called climate change? I do. Do I think that human beings affect it? I do. How much? Not enough for me to go out and cost somebody their job,' said Kasich.” http://huff.to/1iRRNeK GUN STANCE: NBC: JOHN KASICH “took a solidly Republican position on guns in the aftermath of a mass shooting at an Oregon Community College Thursday.” Kasich told NBC News that “stripping law abiding people of their guns … I don't believe it will get the job done.

During an appearance at a national security forum in Iowa, the Florida senator called Russian President Vladimir Putin a 'gangster and a thug,' adding 'I stand by that phrasing.'"" http://bit.ly/1O9zVI6 WHITE HOUSE SHOT: CNN: MARCO RUBIO ripped the White House position on Russian airstrikes in Syria, calling it “‘absurd’ and contrary to the reality on the ground. The White House has said that Russia’s airstrikes in Syria this week … have been ‘indiscriminate’… Rubio said the attacks were actually quite discriminate and targeted.” http://cnn.it/1M6UikM WE AGREE ON TRUMP: POLITICO’s Nick Gass reports MARCO RUBIO proclaimed DONALD TRUMP “doesn't know what he's talking about"" when references Rubio’s relationship with JEB BUSH. Rubio said he has “great admiration for Governor Bush. We're friends. We're running for the same office. I'm not running against him, I'm running for president. It doesn't change my feelings towards him as a person.” http://politi.co/1JJI4wL TRACKERGATE: POLITICO's Marc Caputo reports: ""The Florida family feud between JEB BUSH and MARCO RUBIO took a surprising turn on Thursday night when a tracker for a super PAC supporting the former governor tried to slip into an Iowa event for Rubio, whose staff quickly spotted and removed him."" http://politi.co/1MN6UAq SURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE DOWN ON THE BAYOU: The Advocate reports on a poll it conducted with WWL-TV that shows Louisiana voters would choose HILLARY CLINTON over their home state Gov.

Following Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, James addressed the topic at the Cleveland Cavaliers' training camp on Friday, saying, ""There's no room for guns."" James originally reacted on Twitter on Thursday, following a report that a baby had been fatally shot in Cleveland on Thursday night. On Friday, James spoke more broadly on the issue, saying (via Joe Vardon of the Northeast Ohio Media Group): ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out, I don't know how you can do that. There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves."" James said the news of the child's shooting hit him on Thursday when he looked at his kids. He added that he believes his foundation, LeBron James Family Foundation, which monitors children from grade school to graduation and keeps them in school, is helping keep kids away from guns and violence. Again, this is not the first time James has spoken up on hot-button issues. Last winter, James and his teammates wore shirts that read ""I can't breathe"" in pregame warm ups against the Brooklyn Nets in tribute to the death of Eric Garner. James also spoke up about the ruling on Michael Brown's case and spoke up about the racist comments from ex-Clippers owner Donald Sterling.",2015-10-02 00:00:00,LeBron James calls for more gun control after mass shooting at Oregon community college,,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

587,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/WJFGK-hXrP4/,"ThinkProgress published a factually incorrect piece in the immediate aftermath of the mass shooting at an Oregon community college. Pundits and experts mentioned that the campus was a gun-free zone and ThinkProgress wasted no time in publishing, “UCC Was Not A ‘Gun-Free Zone’ Because Public Colleges in Oregon Can’t Ban Guns.” The apparent pro-Democratic Party front group mistakenly assumed that the community college in question was somehow under the same guidelines as state universities. The school, Umpqua Community College, was, in fact, a gun-free campus. An archived copy of their student code of conduct shows:  In addition to the written policy of the community college, the university’s president, Rita Cavin, stated in a press conference that the university is a gun-free campus and there are “no plans” to change security policy. The ThinkProgress piece asserted: On Thursday, a shooter reported killed at least 13 people and injured many others at a community college in Oregon. Just minutes after the incident, commentators sought to attribute the incident to the fact that Umpqua Community College was a “gun free zone.” “The gun free zones are the areas that tell licensed gun owners that you are not allowed to carry your weapon in this facility…If you’re going to perpetrate some act, you know that most people are not going to be armed,” CNN “military analyst” Rick Francona said a few minutes after the shooting. A retired Navy Seal, Jonathan Gilliam, also appearing on CNN, went even further. Blaming the “gun free zone” for the scope of the tragedy and adding “the only thing that’s going to stop a gun is another gun.” Umpqua Community College, however, was not a gun free zone. A 2011, state court decision prohibited public colleges from banning guns on campus. The decision stemmed from a suit filed by the Oregon Firearm Education Foundation, a gun rights group. There was an effort to pass a new law to reinstate the ability of public colleges to ban guns. That measure was defeated by gun rights advocates. Breitbart News will update this article to reflect that ThinkProgress corrected their false assertions if they do so.

591,http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/08/hillary-compares-the-nra-to-the-iranians-and-communists-video/?utm_source=akdart,"Hillary Clinton took aim at the National Rifle Association in Iowa on Wednesday, hitting the group for what she claims is its “absolutist” stance on gun rights and comparing it to “the Iranians and Communists.” Clinton drew the connection to the gun rights group and murderous tyrants after a woman in the audience at a town hall meeting in Mount Vernon noted that President Obama seemed defeated during his remarks on gun control following last week’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. “How are you going to keep from being sad and tired?” the woman asked Clinton. “I think by being angry and determined,” Clinton said to applause. The Democratic front-runner reiterated a plan she laid out earlier this week in which she said that if elected president she would take executive action to increase background checks on private sellers of guns if Congress fails to do so. (RELATED: Clinton: I’ll Use Administrative Actions To Implement Gun Control Plan) Clinton has claimed that the action would close what gun control advocates call the “gun show loophole” by requiring background checks for all guns bought at sold at gun shows and on the internet. Gun rights supporters claim that opponents exaggerate the number of guns obtained through those means and that the change would do little to cut gun crime. But beyond changes to federal law, Clinton asserted in her remarks that achieving true gun control requires replacing the NRA, the largest gun rights group in the U.S. (RELATED: Hillary Clinton Blames NRA For Mass Shootings) “The real answer to this, is for gun owners to form a different organization that supports the Second Amendment, supports their rights to own guns, use guns, go hunting, goes target shooting, but stands against the absolutism of the NRA,” Clinton said. “You know, the NRA’s position reminds me of negotiating with the Iranians or the Communists,” she added. WATCH (at 28:00):  Clinton also laid out her theory of how the “cynical” NRA maintains its massive base of support. “The NRA tries to keep gun owners — the ones who are members — really upset all the time so they can keep collecting their money, because they tell them they’re the only thing that’s going to stop the black helicopters from landing on the front yard and people’s guns being seized,” she said. “That’s the argument they make. And it works with some people, and it has turned a lot of people into absolutists themselves.” Clinton also criticized Republican presidential candidates who argued after the shooting in Oregon that relaxed gun laws could have either prevented the attack or saved lives. “The idea that you need more guns to stop people who are committing mass shootings is not only illogical but offensive,” Clinton said Wednesday. Though Clinton is calling for unilateral executive action to create new gun laws now, as a presidential candidate in 2008 the then-New York U.S. Senator spoke out against setting “blanket rules” governing guns at the federal level. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: In 2008, Hillary Clinton Spoke Out Against Feds Setting ‘Blanket Rules’ On Guns) “You know, we have a set of rules in New York City and we have a totally different set of rules in the rest of the state. What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana,” Clinton said during an April 2008 debate with then-Illinois U.S. Sen. Barack Obama. “So, for the federal government to be having any kind of, you know, blanket rules that they’re going to try to impose, I think doesn’t make sense.” Chuck on Twitter Follow Chuck on Twitter",2015-10-08 08:00:00,Hillary Compares The NRA To âThe Iranians And Communistsâ [VIDEO],,18775,http://dailycaller.com

Tuesday, 06 October 2015 07:15 AM From playing bartender Val on Saturday Night Live to pushing back on Republicans’ politicization of Benghazi to elaborating on her plans to regulate gun sales, Clinton is aiming to convey in the days leading up to the first Democratic debate that she offers the right mix of personality, politics, and policy to be the nominee and to be elected president. Clinton is in the midst of one final round of visits to the key primary states ahead of the Oct. 13 debate in Las Vegas and, nine days later, her testimony before the Benghazi committee. Clinton spent Monday in New Hampshire discussing her views on guns, and will be in Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday to talk up the Affordable Care Act and her ideas for strengthening it. While she still refuses to engage in direct attacks on Sanders and answers questions about Biden’s decision like a former colleague rather than a future rival, Clinton’s begun, nearly six months into her campaign, to define herself in contrast to others in the Democratic race. And she's kept up her attacks on Republicans, focusing her attention on her Oct. 22 public hearing before the House committee created to re-investigate the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, approaches. “This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans,” Clinton said Monday during an early-morning town hall in Hollis that aired on the Today show. “I would have never done that, and if I were president and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.” She also offered some wishful thinking, saying that she's looking forward to testifying before the Benghazi committee “if they're going to have it still running” at the end of the month. Continuing to try to capitalize on House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's boasting of the political damage that the committee has done with the help of more than $4.5 million in taxpayer money, the Clinton campaign has released a 30-second spot that features footage of the California Republican's comments from last week. “Republicans have spent millions attacking Hillary because she’s fighting for everything they oppose,” a voiceover says. It will begin airing Tuesday on CNN and MSNBC. (House Democrats have come to her aid, too, pushing Monday for the release of transcripts of closed-door interviews that the panel has conducted with Clinton State Department aides including her then-chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.) At a town hall at Manchester Community College on Monday, Clinton unveiled a set of policy proposals on guns that show her willingness to act in the face of tragedy while also reminding voters and the media that her record is further to the left than Sanders’s. Clinton said she supports the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects gun sellers and manufacturers from legal liability if their products are used to commit crimes. “Nobody else is given that,” she said. While serving in the Senate in 2005, Clinton voted against the law. Sanders, then in the House, voted for it. Clinton acknowledged that her proposals aren’t groundbreaking and said—in a swipe, intentional or not, at President Barack Obama and Biden, who led the administration’s post-Newtown guns task force—what’s different is that she’ll make them happen. “There's nothing unique about them, other than I am so determined to do everything we possibly can,“ she said. She also injected a jab at the reactions that Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush had to last week's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. “Mr. Trump was asked about it, he said something like ‘You know, things like that happen in the world,’” she said. “Governor Bush said, ‘Yeah, stuff happens.’ No, that's an admission of defeat and surrender to a problem that is killing 33,000 Americans.” Left unmentioned Monday was where Clinton stood on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Sanders wasted little time in blasting the deal after the United States and 11 other nations announced earlier in the day that it had been finalized. “I am disappointed but not surprised by the decision to move forward on the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that will hurt consumers and cost American jobs,” Sanders said in a statement. Even as Sanders continues to post strong fundraising numbers and Clinton’s numbers have dropped in Iowa, New Hampshire, and nationally, Wall Street has remained bullish about the prospect of a Clinton presidency. As she pitched her gun proposals on Monday, shares of Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. and Sturm, Ruger & Co rose amid industry speculation that gun sales would spike ahead of tighter regulation by Clinton. Last month, some biotech stocks fell after Clinton chastised a drug company for drastically raising its prices on an AIDS medication. For all the strength that Clinton is projecting on policy and politics, she's also working to show what the New York Times described last month as “humor and heart.” After the mother of a victim of the Sandy Hook shooting told her story at the Manchester town hall, Clinton sounded choked as she thanked the woman for fighting for gun safety. Earlier in the day, she flipped pancakes at the Today town hall. Confident that her appearance on Saturday Night Live hit the right note, poking fun at her sometimes reserved style and voicing liberals’ frustrations that she wasn’t faster to take preferred stances on same-sex marriage and the Keystone XL pipeline, Clinton embraced her character. “Or you can call me Val!” Clinton told the crowd.

593,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-gun-control.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by By Thomas Kaplan After the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Senator Bernie Sanders said that gun control was a matter best left resolved in state capitals. In the aftermath of the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, Mr. Sanders voiced support for new gun control measures, but also noted that the rights of law-abiding gun owners “must be protected.” In fact, Mr. Sanders sounded downright skeptical of the push for tighter new laws. “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen,” he told Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Vermont. Mr. Sanders’s statements on gun control, while less forceful than those of some other Democrats, did not seem out of place for a senator from a state where hunting is prevalent. But with last week’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon stirring debate about America’s gun laws, Mr. Sanders’s attitudes toward gun control and the Second Amendment are facing fresh scrutiny as his presidential bid gains steam. While Mr. Sanders has outflanked Hillary Rodham Clinton by appealing to liberals, his record on gun-related issues could be a potential vulnerability in a Democratic contest in which he is not accustomed to facing doubts about his liberal credentials. transcript NA Campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday, another Democratic rival, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, called on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to support a series of proposals he had laid out to address gun violence. And on Monday, Mrs. Clinton detailed a gun  control plan, a mix of legislative and executive action that included an expansion of background checks. “How much longer will we just shrug?” Mrs. Clinton asked at a town hall gathering in New Hampshire. For Mrs. Clinton, the issue is an opportunity to present herself as the most proactive Democratic candidate on gun control, and provide a contrast with Mr. Sanders, who has been gaining on her in national polls. Mr. Sanders, for his part, is trying to balance representing a state where guns are mainly used for recreation against the need to appeal to a Democratic electorate increasingly agitated over mass shootings and demanding stricter gun control laws. As he focuses his message on economic inequality, Mr. Sanders has seemed less than eager to discuss the issue of gun control. At a rally on Saturday in Boston, he waited until an hour into his speech to allude to the Oregon massacre. Mr. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in the 1990s, requiring background checks, when he was in the House of Representatives. And in 2005, he voted in favor of a bill to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. (Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against that bill, and is pledging to repeal it as part of her gun control plan.) History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. After the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Mr. Sanders, by then a senator, voted for expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. His positioning has not endeared him to those on either side of the issue. When he last ran for re-election in 2012, the National Rifle Association gave him a D-minus rating. This summer, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. O’Malley released an ad that concluded, “Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.” “I think it’s a little bit unfair to call him pro-gun,” said Bertram Johnson, the chairman of the political science department at Middlebury College in Vermont. “I think it would be fairer to say he’s more in line with what the state thinks about this.” Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, defended the senator’s record on Monday, saying he has supported banning assault weapons and requiring background checks since he was first elected to Congress in 1990. Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders opposed the Brady Bill because of the waiting period it imposed. After the Oregon shootings, Mr. Sanders issued a statement calling for a “comprehensive approach” to deter mass killings, including “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.” In an interview on MSNBC, he took a pragmatic approach. He said the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue of guns and added, “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.” “You can sit there and say, well, I think we should do this and do that,” he said. “But you got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.” In a statement on Monday, Mr. Sanders said his campaign was assembling a package of proposals to address gun violence. He expressed support for closing the so-called gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons, among other things. Mr. Sanders has also tried to draw attention to the different role of guns in his state compared with more densely populated areas, where guns are often associated with violence, not recreation. “The people of my state understand, I think, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles,” he said in July on CNN. Vermont has a high level of gun ownership compared with other states in the Northeast. It also has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. At the same time, Vermont has few murders committed with firearms. “It’s a different life situation up here, and I think Senator Sanders has tried to explain that,” said Evan Hughes, a vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. “His voting record has reflected the Vermont reality.” Ann Braden, the president of Gun Sense Vermont, a group that formed after the Newtown shootings and advocates new gun laws, said Mr. Sanders’s focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands — but not attacking the mere idea of gun ownership — was “how you can actually make change.” “There are many, many responsible gun owners,” she said, “and it’s important to have someone who understands that.” Advertisement",2015-10-06 08:00:00,"Bernie Sanders, a Hunting-State Senator, Treads Lightly With Guns",,1,http://nytimes.com
594,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/harry-reid-gun-control-background-checks-charleston-shooting-119336,"M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO By SEUNG MIN KIM and BURGESS EVERETT 06/23/2015 04:15 PM EDT Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is pushing for a vote on gun-control measures, including expanded background checks, in light of the mass shooting last week at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which nine people were killed. “My personal feeling is that we have to take a hard look at this,” Reid told reporters Tuesday, adding that “even though we may not be able to win that vote,” many Americans are demanding action. “How many more of these tragedies are we going to have to come and try to explain away here?” Reid said. The Senate’s top Democrat also touched on the issue in a floor speech earlier Tuesday, citing several mass shootings in the United States within the past six years. He called for background checks that would prevent the mentally ill and people with criminal records from buying firearms. “Is that asking too much? Couldn’t we at least do this little thing to stop people who are mentally ill, people who are criminals from purchasing guns?” Reid said on the Senate floor. “The people support it. It has bipartisan support. Americans overwhelmingly agree that those who are mentally ill or are felons should not be able to buy guns. We should act to save lives by expanding background checks.” In April 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate failed to advance a bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) to expand background checks on gun sales after most Republicans joined with a handful of red-state Senate Democrats to block it. Also on POLITICO BURGESS EVERETT and SEUNG MIN KIM Gun control legislation has been scarce on Capitol Hill since, and any measures putting more restrictions on firearms would be a major uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Congress. President Barack Obama, speaking Friday in San Francisco, also alluded to the issue of gun control, although he acknowledged that it was unclear whether legislation mulled by Congress would have stopped Dylann Roof, whom authorities say shot and killed nine people who had gathered for Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Law enforcement officials told NBC News that Roof’s purchase of a .45-caliber Glock handgun was legal under current statutes, although the 21-year-old is currently facing a drug charge. “If Congress had passed some common-sense gun safety reforms after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom — reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported — we wouldn’t have prevented every act of violence, or even most,” Obama said then. “We don’t know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston. No reform can guarantee the elimination of violence. But we might still have some more Americans with us.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

596,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/S9s9SHyJTNc/,"State officials have estimated that between 7 and 13 people have been killed at a mass shooting the Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Media outlets have drawn a link between the shooter and /r9k/, a board for social recluses on the 4chan imageboard, based on an anonymous post made there the day before the shooting. A number of outlets including Ars Technica, Jezebel, and the UK’s Daily Mail have drawn attention to posts on the 4chan imageboard the day before the shooting, in which an anonymous poster warning board users “not to go to school in the northwest tomorrow” because “some of you are alright.” Aside from the coincidental timing, there is no evidence to link the anonymous post to the shooter. With the shooter now reported to be dead, it is unlikely that any such evidence will be forthcoming. Nonetheless, federal law enforcement officials are currently looking into the 4chan thread, according to the New York Times. Some commentators and journalists have taken the opportunity to launch an attack on 4chan as a whole. The Daily Mail’s report, for example, calls the site an “internet cesspool” used to spread “the most vile material.” The article also links the site to the “sinister mask-wearing international vigilante hacking group Anonymous.” As has now become typical in the aftermath of U.S. mass shootings, the opposing sides of the gun control debate have begun gearing up for a new stand-off. The White House has already called for more gun control laws. Activists on social media have begun gearing up for a different battle – how far online platforms should police speech and communication. Rumours of the shooter’s posts on 4chan’s “r9k” or “robot 9000” board have incensed activists who believe that unmoderated, uncensored speech ultimately leads to hatred and harm. The /r9k/ board is a point of congregation for posters who have problems with social awkwardness. Similarly to every other board, the board is a mix of people who have genuine problems functioning in society, and those who are there for the “board culture” – the mix of memes and in-jokes that characterise every 4chan board. Distaste for the “normies” – well-adjusted members of society – is one of the board’s defining in-jokes. Silicon Valley social justice warrior Faruk Ates blamed internet platforms for their “hands-off approach to regulating speech” which allowed “hate speech to thrive” and “mass killing plans to get egged on.” A post on anti-men’s rights blog We Hunted The Mammoth expressed horror that 4chan users could be seen laughing and joking about the shooting in its aftermath. Game developer Zoe Quinn, who recently spoke at the launch of a U.N. report recommending state-led censorship of the web, called on website owners to “moderate your f***in platforms before the government steps in.” It appears many have assumed that the posts were legitimate – despite the fact that 4chan users could be seen openly planning to prank the media by tweeting fake suspects to journalists. They also assume that the “egging on” of the shooter that can be seen in some of the archived threads is meant to be serious. “Trolling” – leading people on with exaggeration, provocation, and deception – is a key element of 4chan culture. The famous “navy seal copypasta” is an example of the absurd, empty threats that are made on imageboards on a daily basis. The poster claims to have “graduated top of his class in the Navy Seals” who would threaten to “wipe you out with the precision the likes of which as never been seen before on this Earth.” 4chan has always been a mix of deliberately offensive humour, deception, and absurd claims. A warning on the top of one 4chan board specifically warns people that “only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.” It’s a warning that many today have apparently ignored.

By 10/08/2015 10:00 AM EDT Presented by With help from Brianna Ehley, Rachana Pradhan, Nancy Cook and Sarah Karlin SIGNED AND SEALED — President Barack Obama signed into law a measure that makes the ACA expansion of the small group health insurance market optional for states. The market had been slated to expand to businesses with between 51 and 100 employees; both the House and the Senate passed the fix last week — a rare quick bipartisan ACA fix. BYE-BYE BOEHNER: WHO'S UP NEXT? — House Republicans hold elections to replace House Speaker John Boehner this morning, and so far, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is projecting some sunny confidence, POLITICO reports. Though that was before the House Freedom Caucus injected some drama by endorsing Rep. Daniel Webster. KY GOV NOMINEE: LET'S DRUG TEST MEDICARE RECIPIENTS — Next month's Kentucky governors race, already shaped by stark differences over the ACA, now has a Medicare twist. Republican Matt Bevins suggested in a recent debate that Medicare beneficiaries are ""on the draw"" and doubled down on his support for random drug testing for anyone who receives social benefits. Democrats are hitting him hard. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the drug-testing idea a ""new low"" for Republicans.

HERE WE GO AGAIN: ANOTHER PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEARING — The House Judiciary Committee is holding its second hearing on Planned Parenthood's abortion practices this afternoon. We're not expecting the fireworks that the Oversight Committee got with its interrogation of PPFA President Cecile Richards, but a former Planned Parenthood manager could make waves. Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the hearing is meant to shed light on the ""horrific details involved in late-term abortions and what is required in order to harvest baby body parts."" Planned Parenthood has repeatedly said the accusations that it profits from the sale of fetal tissue are false. — The House also voted Wednesday to establish a special committee, with subpoena power and broad authority to investigation abortion and fetal tissue donation practices. It will be overseen by the Energy and Commerce Committee and will have up to 13 members — to be named later. None of the investigations into Planned Parenthood thus far have revealed any wrongdoing. More from Pro's Rachana Pradhan,

ARKANSAS PRIVATE OPTION DEBATE CONTINUES — The consultant working for Arkansas’ health reform task force — a group of legislators tasked with weighing the future of its Medicaid expansion model, among other things — on Wednesday released its highly anticipated report. Overall, it’s seeming less and less likely that Medicaid expansion would end altogether after 2016, but the state may make changes to appease conservatives. Some of the highlights from the Stephen Group’s final report:
http://bit.ly/1RugjP7 — Interestingly, the firm outlines two different buckets of recommendations to reform the so-called Medicaid “private option,” depending on who is in the White House. The “in the box solution” includes modest changes they believe the Obama administration would be willing to approve, including some enhanced cost-sharing for beneficiaries, a mandated work referral system, ending the existing “Health Care Independence Accounts,” and cutting off enrollees who don’t make required monthly payments. The second “out of the box” solution is outlined with a Republican administration in mind post-2016: enrollees would be subject to a 20-hour weekly work requirement, sliding scale premiums for people below the federal poverty line, and benefit limits similar to TANF. The task force has to make its recommendations to Gov. Asa Hutchinson by the end of the year. GUN CONTROL PROPOSAL AS SOON AS TODAY — Senate Democrats are expected to unveil a new gun-control proposal today — one week after the latest deadly mass-shooting. BATTLE BREWING OVER MENTAL HEALTH REFORM — And this one involves the House lawmaker pushing for reform — Rep. Tim Murphy — and groups that receive funding from SAMHSA. Murphy’s reform bill essentially dismantles SAMHSA — and he's now claiming that such groups are “creating a whole cloud of lies” because they fear losing their money. At a Wednesday forum, an audience member told Murphy that she had heard his bill requires states to mandate involuntary outpatient treatment for seriously mentally ill people (It does not.) Murphy suggested SAMHSA is telling the organizations to speak out against his bill. A SAMHSA spokesperson wouldn’t comment on the specific allegations but told PULSE that the agency is monitoring the reform efforts in Congress. WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS CADILLAC TAX — Just days after Hillary Rodham Clinton backed scrapping the excise tax, President Obama's chief economist called it one of the ACA's ""most important tools"" for both bringing down costs and improving the quality of care. In a data-filled presentation at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, Jason Furman called repealing or delaying the Cadillac tax ""deeply problematic."" He argued that it lowers health care costs, increase workers' wages, and reduces the federal deficit by $90 billion over the next decade (and by half-a-trillion dollars over the next 20 years, according to White House calculations). And, these changes, he argued, will spill out across the health care system and provide employers with a ""little more incentive to exercise their market power to slow the cost of health care.""

Some 30 percent said at least one of their plans would be impacted in 2018 — and half of the remaining employers said they'd have a plan that would be affected by 2023.

Only one region generated savings in excess of those fees — saving Medicare $10.8 million and earning just $500,000 in shared savings payments.

Hours later, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is contemplating his own presidential run, stood before the same organization and praised Americans who have fought for gay rights. “Love is not a political matter; it’s a basic human right,” Mr. Biden said to a gathering of members of the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday night. “The fact that we recognize that, it’s because of you.” Mr. Biden’s potential candidacy has loomed over Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, and the speeches on Saturday presented a rare occasion for these two former Senate colleagues and potential rivals to showcase their zeal and style on gay rights, one of the most galvanizing issues for Democratic primary voters and donors. In her address, Mrs. Clinton focused on policies she would enact with a promise to make lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues central to her presidency. Mr. Biden said government had not been the driver of the rapid change in gay rights, and gave credit to the people in the crowd and the Americans across the country who came out about their sexuality. Both speeches drew roaring applause and enthusiasm from the crowd. Mrs. Clinton, who addressed the organization on Saturday morning, emphasized transgender rights, which are seen as the next front in the gay rights movement in America. “Transgender people are valued, they are loved, they are us,” Mrs. Clinton said. She vowed to do more to curb violence against transgender people, particularly African-American women, and urged the military to reverse its policy and allow transgender Americans to serve in the armed forces. “Having the world’s strongest military, she said, “doesn’t just mean having the best-trained forces or the biggest arsenal.” “It means,” she added, “being a leader on issues like this.” Mr. Biden called transgender rights “the civil rights issue of our time” and also expressed his support for allowing their service in the military. (In an aside, he also called for increased gun control measures in light of the mass shooting in Oregon.) The speeches allowed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden to address an important constituency and powerful donor base of prominent, politically active lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from across the country who will be critical in the 2016 presidential contest — a group that largely views both Democrats exceedingly favorably. “I see the injustices and dangers that you and your family still face,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I am running for president to end them once and for all.” Mr. Biden did not offer any hints about his presidential ambitions (even amid the occasional chant of “run Joe, run!”). He echoed much of what Mrs. Clinton said in her speech, calling on Congress to pass the Federal Equality Act and urging more attention to human rights abuses against gay, lesbian and transgender people abroad. The Human Rights Campaign, led by a former aide to President Bill Clinton from Arkansas, Chad Griffin, has deep ties to Mrs. Clinton and had invited her to deliver the keynote address at its gathering Saturday night. But Mrs. Clinton had a scheduling conflict — she was to appear on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” — so the group added a breakfast at which she could speak. The organization also honored Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who recently came out as gay. History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. The group has started its endorsement process, with questionnaires sent to candidates, but it does not typically back a candidate until the general election. In her address, Mrs. Clinton delivered a pointed attack on Republican presidential candidates who oppose same-sex marriage and other equal protections. “You turn on the TV and you see a Republican candidate for president literally standing in the courthouse door in Kentucky,” she said, referring to Mike Huckabee’s support of Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Both Mr. Biden’s and Mrs. Clinton’s attacks on Republicans were delivered with some levity that played well in the crowds at their two appearances on Saturday. “Ted Cruz slammed a political opponent for marching in a pride parade,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He clearly has no idea what he’s missing.” Mr. Biden, in talking about how the vast majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, appeared to deliver an off-the-cuff line. “There are homophobes still left, most of them are running for president, I think,” he said. Some gay activists say Mrs. Clinton offered a relatively delayed and cautious embrace of same-sex marriage. Mr. Biden’s surprising expression of support for same-sex marriage in 2012 was widely seen as prodding President Obama to take the same position days later, which was not lost on the crowd on Saturday. Of his 2012 comment on “Meet the Press” about same-sex marriage, Mr. Biden said, “Folks, I was just answering in a straightforward, direct way, what I’ve known my whole life,” and told a story of learning tolerance as a teenager growing up in Delaware. “I absolutely love Joe Biden,” said Brad DiFiore, a 46-year-old who works in the aviation industry in Atlanta and was in town for the gathering. He said that he had never been a supporter of Mrs. Clinton but that she impressed him with her remarks that morning. “She was more impressive in person and had such a natural ease in that environment,” he said. Mrs. Clinton has in recent years rejected two policies from her husband’s administration that were seen as setting back the gay rights movement — a position she reiterated on Saturday. “ ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’ is over,” Mrs. Clinton said about the legislation enacted by her husband that prevented gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military. “But that doesn’t change the fact that more than 14,000 men and women were forced out of the military for being gay.” Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden expressed support for the Obama administration’s policy that reverses dishonorable discharges given to people because of their sexual orientation. “I think she’s been very good on L.G.B.T. issues, but always in the context of politics,” said Seth Kalish, 48, a graphic designer. “It’s typical for someone wanting to get to the White House to be cautious.” Others blamed Mrs. Clinton’s husband for her mixed experiences on same-sex issues. “That was Bill, and it was a different time,” said Ellen Griffith, 54, a consultant who married her wife, Mary Ellen Garrity, last year. “That was some unfortunate legislation,” Ms. Griffith said of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and “don’t ask, don’t tell.” “But the important thing is that she admits it.” Advertisement",2015-10-04 08:00:00,"Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, in Dueling Speeches, Focus on Transgender Rights",,1,http://nytimes.com

          / CBS/AP The gunman behind a deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college left a note behind and investigators have it, CBS News has learned.  Law enforcement sources say the ""manifesto"" was several pages long and in it, the 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer made statements suggesting that he may have been depressed and angry. Sources told CBS News' Senior Investigative Producer Pat Milton  the multi-page typed note was a philosophical rant of someone who was mad at the world. The source said the note was focused a great deal on the suspect's low opinion of himself. Milton reports that throughout the writings, the suspect obsesses about himself and his place in the world, which he apparently did not think was very good. Mercer had also apparently taken a creativity or writing course at Umpqua Community College. There is no indication that the suspect was affiliated with any group. And his motive is still unclear. Authorities investigating the shooting say they have found a number of firearms at the gunman's apartment and CBS News correspondent Jeff Peques reports that one of the guns recovered at the scene of the shooting is not registered to the gunman. Officials  say Harper  opened fire at Umpqua Community College Thursday, killing nine people and wounding nine others others before dying during an exchange of gunfire with officers.  Authorities said Friday that 13 weapons had been recovered - six at the scene of the shooting and seven at the gunman's residence. Friday evening, Hanlin released the names of the victims, saying they were five men and four women who ranged in age from 18 to 67 years old. The victims were identified as Lucero Alcaraz, 19; Treven Taylor Anspach, 20; Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18; Quinn Glen Cooper, 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59; Lucas Eibel, 18; Jason Dale Johnson, 33; Lawrence Levine, 67; and Sarena Dawn Moore, 44. A statement from Eibel's family says he volunteered at a wildlife center and animal shelter. He was studying chemistry and loved to play soccer.	Cooper's family says he was funny and compassionate and loved dancing and voice acting.	A statement from Johnson's family says he was a Christian and recently enrolled in school. ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez said at a news conference Friday that all of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years. She says investigators also found a flak jacket next to a rifle at the school, which contained steel plates. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said  early Friday that investigators were at the college and Mercer's nearby apartment throughout the night. Pegues reports that the guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland, as well as body armor. Investigators are still trying to determine how the gunman obtained a .556 caliber rifle, which is similar to an AR-15, Pegues reports. A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that it is unclear if the gunman was actually wearing the bullet-proof vest when he was fatally  shot or had it with him. Hanlin also says investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment to try to learn more details. Peques reports that a receipt from the campus store was also found at the shooting scene and investigators believe it belonged to Mercer. The U.S. Army said Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008. Lt. Col. Ben Garrett, an Army spokesman, said Mercer was in service at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, starting on Nov. 5, 2008. But by Dec. 11, 2008, he was discharged for failing to meet the minimum administrative standards. Social media profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. Carmen Nesnick, the stepsister of Mercer, said her stepbrother was not a religious nor anti-religious person and that her family is Christian. ""All he ever did was put everybody before himself. He wanted everyone to  be happy. No matter if he was sad or mad, he would always try to cheer  up everybody,"" she said. There didn't seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. He appeared to have at least one online dating profile. On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development. In one post on the blog about Flanagan, Mercer apparently wrote, ""I have noticed that so many people like [Flanagan] are alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems like the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."" A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle. Meanwhile, a doctor said one victim of the deadly mass shooting will likely be released from a hospital Friday. Dr. Jason Gray of Mercy Medical Center says the hospital in Roseburg, which is 180 miles south of Portland, received 10 patients Thursday - one died, two were quickly treated and released and three were transferred to a hospital near Eugene for a higher level of care. Of the four remaining patients, one was discharged late Thursday, and one was expected to leave Friday. Gray says the other two are expected to survive, but one remains in critical condition. The three patients who needed additional care were transferred to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend. The Eugene-area hospital said Friday that two patients were stable, one was moving out of the ICU and all three were expected to survive.

In the aftermath of the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, Mr. Sanders voiced support for new gun control measures, but also noted that the rights of law-abiding gun owners “must be protected.” In fact, Mr. Sanders sounded downright skeptical of the push for tighter new laws. “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen,” he told Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Vermont. Mr. Sanders’s statements on gun control, while less forceful than those of some other Democrats, did not seem out of place for a senator from a state where hunting is prevalent. But with last week’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon stirring debate about America’s gun laws, Mr. Sanders’s attitudes toward gun control and the Second Amendment are facing fresh scrutiny as his presidential bid gains steam. While Mr. Sanders has outflanked Hillary Rodham Clinton by appealing to liberals, his record on gun-related issues could be a potential vulnerability in a Democratic contest in which he is not accustomed to facing doubts about his liberal credentials. transcript NA Campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday, another Democratic rival, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, called on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to support a series of proposals he had laid out to address gun violence. And on Monday, Mrs. Clinton detailed a gun  control plan, a mix of legislative and executive action that included an expansion of background checks. “How much longer will we just shrug?” Mrs. Clinton asked at a town hall gathering in New Hampshire. For Mrs. Clinton, the issue is an opportunity to present herself as the most proactive Democratic candidate on gun control, and provide a contrast with Mr. Sanders, who has been gaining on her in national polls. Mr. Sanders, for his part, is trying to balance representing a state where guns are mainly used for recreation against the need to appeal to a Democratic electorate increasingly agitated over mass shootings and demanding stricter gun control laws. As he focuses his message on economic inequality, Mr. Sanders has seemed less than eager to discuss the issue of gun control. At a rally on Saturday in Boston, he waited until an hour into his speech to allude to the Oregon massacre. Mr. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in the 1990s, requiring background checks, when he was in the House of Representatives. And in 2005, he voted in favor of a bill to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. (Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against that bill, and is pledging to repeal it as part of her gun control plan.) History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling. After the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Mr. Sanders, by then a senator, voted for expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. His positioning has not endeared him to those on either side of the issue. When he last ran for re-election in 2012, the National Rifle Association gave him a D-minus rating. This summer, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. O’Malley released an ad that concluded, “Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.” “I think it’s a little bit unfair to call him pro-gun,” said Bertram Johnson, the chairman of the political science department at Middlebury College in Vermont. “I think it would be fairer to say he’s more in line with what the state thinks about this.” Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, defended the senator’s record on Monday, saying he has supported banning assault weapons and requiring background checks since he was first elected to Congress in 1990. Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders opposed the Brady Bill because of the waiting period it imposed. After the Oregon shootings, Mr. Sanders issued a statement calling for a “comprehensive approach” to deter mass killings, including “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.” In an interview on MSNBC, he took a pragmatic approach. He said the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue of guns and added, “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.” “You can sit there and say, well, I think we should do this and do that,” he said. “But you got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.” In a statement on Monday, Mr. Sanders said his campaign was assembling a package of proposals to address gun violence. He expressed support for closing the so-called gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons, among other things. Mr. Sanders has also tried to draw attention to the different role of guns in his state compared with more densely populated areas, where guns are often associated with violence, not recreation. “The people of my state understand, I think, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles,” he said in July on CNN. Vermont has a high level of gun ownership compared with other states in the Northeast. It also has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. At the same time, Vermont has few murders committed with firearms. “It’s a different life situation up here, and I think Senator Sanders has tried to explain that,” said Evan Hughes, a vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. “His voting record has reflected the Vermont reality.” Ann Braden, the president of Gun Sense Vermont, a group that formed after the Newtown shootings and advocates new gun laws, said Mr. Sanders’s focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands — but not attacking the mere idea of gun ownership — was “how you can actually make change.” “There are many, many responsible gun owners,” she said, “and it’s important to have someone who understands that.” Advertisement",2015-10-06 00:00:00,"Bernie Sanders, a Hunting-State Senator, Treads Lightly With Guns - The New York Times",,1,http://nytimes.com

611,http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/13789424/jeremy-guthrie-native-roseburg-oregon-calls-shooting-unimaginable-loss,"ABC News' Lana Zak talks about the latest news out of Oregon on the shooting that killed at least nine people and injured several others. (1:32) CHICAGO -- Calling it ""an unimaginable loss,"" Kansas City Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie offered condolences to those affected by the mass shooting Thursday in his hometown of Roseburg, Oregon. Guthrie, a 12-year major league veteran, was born in Roseburg and lived there until he was 12. He said he was alerted to Thursday's shooting by a friend who also grew up the Pacific Northwest town of about 22,000 residents. Although he still has ties to the area, Guthrie said his family was not affected by Thursday's tragedy. That didn't stop him from making a plea for a more caring society. ""We obviously all have the ability to go out and do harm, whether it's with a gun or whether it's through other forms of violence; that's never the answer,"" Guthrie said before the Royals' game against the Chicago White Sox. ""Unfortunately, we've seen too many people resort to that in recent times. All of us go through struggles; all of us have our challenges. Maybe we can show a little more love and compassion to those who are going through other things. Hopefully the end result is that we can stop having to witness these types of tragedies."" Guthrie said that in the summer, he would spend time in the pool at Umpqua Community College, where the shooting took place, and that he attended athletic events on the campus. He declined to talk about gun rights, saying, ""I don't have an opinion on that."" But he does consider gun violence an issue that needs to be addressed. ""There are issues,"" he said. ""How do you deal with those? Those are the tough questions that many people have varying opinions on. The ultimate thing, if we can do it, is show love and live like we expect people to treat us. That would be the answer that would help resolve all issues. Unfortunately, it just doesn't happen that way.""",2015-10-01 20:51:06,"Oregon native Guthrie: Need love, compassion",,4451,http://espn.go.com/

But in interviews after the incident, he explained why he did not attempt to intervene and take down the killer himself. In fact, he says, a police officer on the scene agreed with his decision to stay out of the fray.""I told the officer about the gun on my hip,"" Parker said, in a Huffington Post report. ""He searched me, took the gun, escorted me back to my car and gave me my gun back and told me to have a nice day.""Less than two hours after news of the shooting broke on Thursday, some television commentators — for example, CNN military analyst Rick Francona — stated that a ""gun free zone"" on the Umpqua Community College campus was responsible for the allowing the mass shooting to occur. ""The gun free zones are the areas that tell licensed gun owners that you are not allowed to carry your weapon in this facility,"" Francona said. ""If you're going to perpetrate some act, you know that most people are not going to be armed."" Oregon mass shooting suspect Chris Harper-Mercer. A retired Navy SEAL, Jonathan Gilliam, made similar comments. ""We see that the only thing that's going to stop a gun is another gun,"" Gilliam said. But the UCC campus is not a gun-free zone because Oregon state law makes it legal to carry concealed weapons on college campuses. It was because of that law that Air Force veteran John Parker was able to carry a concealed handgun on the campus. The college has banned guns inside school buildings, but the school is not able to bar licensed gun owners from carrying their weapons on the campus. But Parker told MSNBC that his military training had conditioned him ""to go into danger, not just run away from it."" Although he did consider taking action to intervene in the Oregon mass shooting, he ultimately decided that to do so would be a bad idea.""When we found out there was an active shooter on campus, we were going to go and see if we could intervene,"" he said, referring as well to other students who also carry concealed weapons on the campus. ""If there was something we could do, we were going to do it. Luckily, we made the choice not to get involved.""Parker went on to explain that he was ""quite a distance away"" from the building where gunman Christopher Harper-Mercer was shooting students. Not knowing what was going on in the building, Parker said that he could have opened himself and others to becoming ""potential targets"" of the shooter if they were to attempt to approach the building and intervene. Parker also noted that the SWAT team on the scene could have easily mistaken him, or anyone else with a drawn weapon, for a shooter — a mistake which likely would have resulted in police shooting him. ""If we had our guns ready to shoot they could think we were the bad guys,"" Parker said in the interview. Candlelight vigil for victims of the Oregon shooting Thursday. The magazine, Mother Jones, conducted a study of 62 mass shootings over a 30-year period, but they found no evidence that any of the shooters in the horrific incidents chose targets based on whether or not guns were banned in those areas. In fact, the magazine discovered, many of the mass shootings — as did the Oregon shooting — took place in areas where carrying concealed weapons was legal. But in no case did an armed civilian do anything but what John Parker did — in other words, they chose not to intervene.

Gabrielle Giffords, who was injured in a mass shooting, is the founder of Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group in favor of tighter firearm restrictions and appeared on Sunday’s “State of the Union” on CNN. In reaction to the Oregon shooting, Kelly told host Jake Tapper that the United States has “loopholes” that make it “easy” for the mentally ill and felons to get their hands on guns. When Tapper asked him what gun laws would have prevented the Oregon shooting or the other recent mass shootings, Kelly explained that there “isn’t a specific law,” but a combination of “some really common sense things that Americans support,” like requiring background checks or identifying the mentally ill. “You know, with individual events, sometimes there isn’t a specific law that you can point to that would prevent a tragedy like this from happening, but with a combination of some really common sense things that most Americans support, you know, stuff like let’s require a background check before anyone gets a gun and let’s try to get people identified as mentally ill if they are dangerously mentally ill, then let’s get that information to the National Criminal Background Check system, which is managed by the FBI. Often in the case of these mass shootings, if there were a couple components, if we did things better, some of these tragedies could be prevented.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent 2nd AmendmentClipsCNNCNN State of the Uniongun controlMark KellyOregon Shooting .

616,http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetstemwedel/2015/10/01/congress-still-bans-cdc-scientists-from-studying-gun-violence/,"In the wake of another mass shooting (among many this year), we are asking again: What causes gun violence? Is there a causal relationship between gun ownership and gun violence? We might know the answers to these questions, or at least have a body of empirical evidence getting us closer to the answers, if government scientists were allowed to study them. But they’re not. In June, the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives rejected an amendment that would have repealed a ban on scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducting research to study the relationship between gun ownership and gun violence. Supporters of the ban, including current House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) argue that the CDC shouldn’t study these questions because “a gun is not a disease.” Photo credit: AP Arguably, though, CDC researchers have studied other kinds of environmental factors that play a role in human health and in human behaviors with implications for human health. Are alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs of abuse diseases? Is a faulty ventilation system, of the sort that might provide a hospitable environment for the bacterium that causes Legionnaire’s disease? Is a hurricane?  If you think, given its scientific mission, that the CDC is the wrong group of government scientists to study the connection between gun ownership and gun violence, fine. Allocate funding to the right government scientists, those working in the appropriate scientific disciplines to conduct the research. Establish research grants to support academic scientists studying this question. Do something to mobilize scientists to address this problem. Or, admit that the point of the ban is that you don’t want scientists to work on these questions at all. Why wouldn’t you want scientists to look into connections between gun ownership and gun violence? Perhaps you think the question has already been decisively answered by existing research. This would make spending additional money, on research to answer an already-answered question, wasteful. If this is where you stand, show us the study. Maybe you don’t think it’s possible for scientists to conduct good research on this question. Possibly you think the methods they would need to study it haven’t been developed yet, or that scientists are incapable of designing an unbiased study of this particular question. If that’s the case, the onus is on you to show why this question is so uniquely impervious to scientific study. It requires an argument and evidence to support your claim that research here would be pointless. It might be that you don’t think there’s any value to finding a scientific answer to the question of how gun ownership and gun violence are connected. Again, this seems like a stance in need of an argument. Why would this be a frivolous question to investigate? Why would the knowledge built in such an investigation be useless knowledge for people to have when deciding whether or not to be gun owners? Or maybe you don’t want the scientific knowledge to be built because, if it is, there might be a moral imperative to take it into account when making policy. That could be politically inconvenient, putting legislators between constituents who want to reduce gun violence and donors and lobbying groups who want to protect the interests of gun manufacturers. If you are confident gun ownership has no causal connection to gun violence, either show us the study that underwrites your confidence or let researchers do the studies that may vindicate your belief. If you oppose such studies because you oppose restrictions on gun ownership no matter what its causal connection to gun violence may turn out to be, have the courage to be intellectually honest and say that — to say such research funding would be wasted because we will support the current gun policies no matter what the facts turn out to be. Claiming that there’s no plausible connection between gun ownership and gun violence while holding back the research that would let us know for sure is the coward’s way out. Having government scientists and then preventing them from building useful knowledge for the public’s interests — especially if you're preventing this knowledge from being built simply to protect your own political interests — is unethical.

Monica Almeida/The NY Times/Redux If you’re ever the victim of a gunshot wound, surely you’d rather have a highly successful surgeon like Ben Carson working to save your life than a writer like me. But when it comes to preventing bodies from being riddled with bullets in the first place, trust me when I say you don’t want Carson anywhere near the policy-making apparatus of the United States. Carson took to Facebook Monday night to answer a question about whether the recent mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, changed his thoughts about the Second Amendment. “There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking,” Carson wrote, “but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” Related

						25 Best 'Friends' Episodes Try, for just one moment, to put yourself into the mind of the man who wrote that. According to the same Facebook post, he’s seen first-hand the devastation bullets can do to the human body. Imagine seeing those bodies, operating on them, sewing them up, watching some of them die – and then saying that taking away a gun is somehow more devastating than gun violence itself.  Every time we see a tragedy like Roseburg, we watch politicians like Carson twist themselves into pretzels of illogic to justify their near-religious worship of guns. Faced with multiple dead bodies and powerful calls for action, they argue – contrary to all available evidence – that restrictions on gun ownership would do nothing to prevent these mass murders. They’d rather throw up their hands and do nothing, except maybe put a few more guns out on the street to compound the deaths. “The Left would prefer to use these tragedies to advance a political agenda,” Carson wrote on Facebook – and he’s not wrong. President Obama called on the American people to elect representatives who would finally take action on gun control legislation, after his calls for this Congress to do something fell on deaf ears. Of course we should politicize these tragedies; politics is how we try to solve problems. How do we not point to the dead bodies in a place like Roseburg and beg our elected officials to do something – anything – to stop violence like this from happening again and again? How could anyone look at a tragedy like this one, or at the 20 dead children in Newtown, Connecticut, or the nine dead in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and not want to take action? How could anyone’s first instinct – or second or third – be to protect the guns that caused the deaths, instead of preventing the next shooting? Ben Carson looks at the people who died, and their grieving families, and decides the most important thing is keeping the Second Amendment intact. The surgeon who’s actually operated on the bodies of gunshot victims. He’s stopped their bleeding; he’s sewn them shut. And the carnage he faced is somehow less ugly to him than taking steps to keep guns out of the hands of people responsible for that carnage. He accuses “the Left” of playing politics, and indeed we should – we should do whatever it takes to keep Carson and anyone else who denies the human suffering caused by this nation’s senseless gun laws out of the White House.

By DANIEL STRAUSS 10/02/2015 04:22 PM EDT Updated 10/02/2015 05:51 PM EDT A day after a massacre on a U.S. college campus, Jeb Bush said ""stuff happens"" but that does not mean gun restrictions should be tightened. ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's very bad to see,"" the former Florida governor said. Then he added: ""Look, stuff happens and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" His comments came during an appearance in Greenville, South Carolina where the 2016 candidate was discussing gun control and urging caution before pushing new laws and regulations. He first said that in Florida ""we believe that concealed weapons permits is a proper thing."" ""All sorts of rules that are appropriate for Florida may not be appropriate for other places but the basic right is embedded and it's a personal right to bear arms but that shouldn't be infringed,"" he said. Bush also said the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, that left nine dead and seven injured was ""just heartbreaking."" Bush, in a question-and-answer session with reporters after he made the comments, said he was referring to tragedies in general, not specifically gun violence or the Oregon shooting. He also said states should look at gun laws to make it harder for the mentally ill to have access to weapons. The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza asked if Bush made a mistake with the phrasing. ""No, it wasn't a mistake, I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong?"" Bush said. Lizza responded, ""Well you said 'stuff happens.'"" ""'Things' happen all the time. 'Things,' is that better?"" Bush said. ""A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools,"" Bush said. ""Well it may not change it or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event and the cumulative effect of this is in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people, burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder for people to protect liberty, and that is, the whole conversation today was exactly about that."" Later on Friday, the Bush campaign blasted what they called liberals' unwarranted criticism of the former Florida governor's comments. “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions,” said Allie Brandenburger, a Bush spokewoman, in a statement. Asked to react to Bush's comment, President Barack Obama was blunt. ""I don’t even think I have to react to that one, I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting,” Obama said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""They can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happens.'"" Missing out on the latest scoops?

623,https://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/barack-obama-gun-control-laws-single-issue-voting-214392,"President Obama reacted to Gov. Jeb Bush's comments on gun violence in America. “I’m going to talk about this,” Obama said, “and I’m going to politicize it.” By SARAH WHEATON 10/02/2015 05:01 PM EDT Updated 10/02/2015 05:52 PM EDT President Barack Obama urged Americans who want to see tighter gun laws to become “single-issue voters.” At a press conference on Friday, Obama predicted that there will be little action in Congress to prevent mass shootings like the one that took place in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday until Americans hold elected officials accountable at the polls. “Here’s what you need to do: You have to make sure that anybody that you are voting for is on the right side of this issue,” Obama said. If politicians oppose gun safety measures, he continued, “Even if they’re great on other stuff, you’ve got to vote against them.” At the same time, Obama compared his passion for gun control laws to Republicans' devotion to abortion restrictions -- and said they had no place in budget discussions. Obama’s ongoing call for action was in contrast to Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who responded to a question on Friday about gun control. By LAUREN FRENCH “I had this challenge as governor,” Bush said in South Carolina. “Look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's necessarily the right thing to do.” When a reporter read Bush’s remarks to Obama, the president said, “I don’t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting, and make them decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.’” While Obama said he’d directed his staff to look for more ways to take executive action and enforce existing laws, the president said he plans to use his bully pulpit on the issue for the rest of his presidency.  “I’m going to talk about this,” Obama said, “and I’m going to politicize it.” Intended or not, Obama’s call for single-issue voting could have consequences in the race among Democrats to succeed him. Consistent support for gun control is one of the few areas where Hillary Clinton is positioned to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders, who comes from a rural state, was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his first run for Congress, and he has voted against the Brady Bill and other gun control measures. Obama drew a distinction, however, between how he thinks voters should make decisions and how elected officials should approach governing, especially as budget and debt ceiling negotiations threaten to cripple the government and economy. Obama acknowledged that some Republicans feel strongly about defunding Planned Parenthood. However, he continued, ""You can’t have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy, any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence. I feel just as strongly about that, and I think I’ve got better evidence for it.” If he were to shut down the government and refuse to lift the debt ceiling unless Congress assented to new gun laws, Obama added, ""that would be irresponsible of me, and the American people rightly would reject that.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

With a gridlocked Congress that refuses to fund any research on the causes of gun violence or the benefits of gun control, reducing America's incidents of gun violence may require some creative thinking.Â While there may not be any clear way forward for gun control, despiteÂ Obama's continued insistence on the importance of the issue, there are several actionable ways to lower rates of gun violence in America, many of which Congress and severalÂ 2016 presidential candidates have addressed in some way. Several studies have found the single greatest indicator of a person's risk of committing an act of violence isÂ substance abuse. In a 2013 analysis published in Homicide Studies, researchers foundÂ ""48% of homicide offenders were reportedly under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offense."" Other research has foundÂ chronic alcohol abuse elevates the risk of homicide, suicide and violent death. Those with five or more symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence have been shown to be between about 1 to 4Â times more likely to commit a criminal offense. Just 11% of the 22.7 million Americans living with drug or alcohol dependency received treatment in 2013, according to USA Today. AÂ 2015 report from Community Catalyst states ""people from all walks of life struggle with substance use disorders,"" however ""access to treatment options is limited by income.""Â While some low-cost rehabilitation options charge only $7,500 per month, some high-end luxury programs can run a recovering addict as much as $120,000 per month. Health insurance covers the many steps of recovery â assessment, detox, outpatient and inpatient treatment â to varying degrees.Â Hillary Clinton has said the federal government should improve drug treatment access, laying out a plan in September to spend $10 billion to combat addiction. Sen.Â Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has saidÂ that ""we are unprepared for the epidemic in terms of our mental health capacity to treat people who need treatment."" Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina shared the story of losing her child to drug addiction at the second GOP debate, though did so to argue against marijuana decriminalization. Unfortunately, the lack of access to treatment and rehab often means people with alcohol or drug abuse problems end upÂ in prison, where their problems can become exacerbated. For those who are shuffled in the U.S. prison system âÂ the largest prison system in the worldÂ â the result is a process of dehumanization that often leads people toÂ feelings of trauma. Prison is no longer about rehab. In fact, manyÂ nonviolent offenders emerge from prison more violent after being subjected toÂ an inhumane culture of violence. ""The experience of being locked in a cage has a psychological effect upon everyone made to endure it,"" Mika'il DeVeaux, executive director of Citizens Against Recidivism, wrote in theÂ Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review.Â ""No one leaves unscarred.""Â The main culprit of the problem isÂ ""mandatory minimum"" sentencingÂ for drug offenders, which require ""automatic, minimum prison terms"" for certain crimes, especially drug crimes. Drugs traditionally associated with the black community also haveÂ harsher sentences. Congress sets these mandatory minimums, not state governments. A recent deal in the Senate on criminal justice reform legislation did not go as farÂ as some advocates had hoped in addressing mandatory minimums.Â According to theÂ Department of Justice, among nonviolent offenders released, ""about 1Â in 5Â were rearrested for a violent crime within three years of discharge.""Â ""Someone whose only crime is using a drug does not necessarily have any criminal tendencies, but when they come out of prison and can't find a job because of their record, many turn to crime,"" wrote former Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Stephen DowningÂ in a 2014 op-edÂ in the Huffington Post. ""Almost two-thirds will reoffend within three years, clearly indicating that our current form of punishment is not a deterrent.""Â Though the National Rifle Association has responded to recent school shootings by suggesting armed police officers be stationedÂ in every school, students of color stand to suffer from this move. Increased police presence in schools disproportionately affects students of color and fuels the school-to-prison pipeline:  While black children make up 16% of children in schools nationwide, they make upÂ 31%Â of in-school arrests. Citing aÂ Brown University study,Â Think ProgressÂ wrote,Â ""Young offenders who were incarcerated were a staggering 67% more likely to be in jail (again) by the age of 25 than similar young offenders who didn't go to prison. Moreover, a similar pattern held true for serious crimes. [The researchers] found that incarcerated youths were more likely to commit 'homicide, violent crime, property crime and drug crimes' than those that didn't serve time.""Â Congress held the first hearing on ending the school-to-prison pipeline in 2012, though few, if any, action items have been proposed since then. Presidential hopeful Sanders proposed a government job opportunity program to curb the pipeline, while other candidates have largely avoided the issue.Â After the shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, many journalists and even ClintonÂ were commenting on the way institutional racism influenced gun violence in America. However, one need not look to Charleston for evidence that America's gun epidemic is fueled by racial inequality.Â Between 2000 and 2010, 53,850 black men lost their lives to gun violence in America, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy. Eighty-five percent of these homicide victims were under age 40. The center projects another 68,000 will lose their lives to gun violence by 2025 if no progress is made to address gun violence.Â Though the majority of America's poor are white, poor whites do not live in areas of concentrated poverty like their black counterparts, according to CLASP. People who lives in areas with concentrated poverty are more likely to experience violence and to be the victims of violence.Â Most black male homicides in America occur in areas with high rates of concentrated poverty:  ""Communities of concentrated disadvantage have long lacked the infrastructure and resources to make them viable places to live, work or raise a family,"" CLASP reports. ""The stress of poverty and absence of opportunities for a solid education and economic self sufficiency makes growing up in these neighborhoods difficult for young people, in particular young black males.""Â There have been very loud cries for structural racism to become a political issue.Â Sanders has spokenÂ about it, and Clinton said ""we must dig deeper"" to address structural racism.Â The U.S. may have some of the worst problems with income inequality in the world. Cross-analyzing data from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime and the U.N. Human Development Index, CityLab's Richard Florida and his colleague Charlotta MellanderÂ mapped a clear link between income inequality and homicidal violence.Â But why? Elizabeth Stoker wrote about several studies linking income inequality and homicides for The Week.Â ""[S]ince much of the violent crime we see among young men appears to be the result of the hopelessness and frustration brought on by the lack of status available to men at the bottom, strides can be made toward reducing the impetus for those crimes simply by raising the bottom up and reducing the gap between the worst and best off,"" she writes. ""A policy as simple as a universal basic income could accomplish that neatly.""Â Both Clinton and Sanders have commented on the idea of a universal basic income and a minimum wage. Clinton gave a tepid response to a Facebook chat question, while Sanders advocates a $15 minimum wage, though that still may not be enough.Â We know that gun violence can be deadly for American women, but even more than specific instances of violence, a culture of gender inequality can be indicative of a culture of violence. Florida and MellanderÂ showÂ that countries with higher gender inequality â worse rates of education attainment, political representation and reproductive health â have higher rates of homicides, as well.Â Florida, writing for the Atlantic, also points to the regional American ""cultures of honor"" as inculcators of higher rates of violence. These are cultures in which people ""place an extraordinary value on personal reputation, family and property."" In his book Culture of Honor, Richard E. NisbettÂ wrote that ""southerners, as compared to northerners, are more inclined to favor violence when it is for protection of property, or as a response to an insult, or as a means of socializing children."" Three of the five states in the U.S. with the worst records of gun violence are in the South. Sanders has spoken out against attacks on women's health, equal pay for equal workÂ and 12-week paid family leave. Clinton called equal rights for women and girls the ""great unfinished business of the 21st century.""Â Gun ownership is a problem in the United States, but gun ownership does not happen in a vacuum. The root causes of violence â inequality, poverty and trauma â are also the root causes of gun violence. Taking these steps to make America less violent will also ultimately allow us to confront gun violence â without having to wait for Congress to move on gun control.

625,http://time.com/4058269/oregon-shooting-community-college/?xid=homepage,"Hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil in Roseburg, Ore., late Thursday following a mass shooting at a community colleague that claimed at least 10 lives, including the gunman, and left seven others wounded. “We don’t know why this happened, we only know that we were called together as a community to banish fear and share love,” Oregon Governor Brown told those congregated at Roseburg’s Stewart Park. “In our sorrow, we will remember and honor those lost here today, and this way they will live forever in our hearts.” The gunman, identified by local officials as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, opened fire after walking into the city’s Umpqua Community College, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. The office said it received a 911 call about the shooting at 10:38 a.m. local time. Officers located the gunman in a building and exchanged gunfire with him, according to Sheriff John Hanlin, and the shooter was killed. “It’s been a terrible day,” Hanlin said. Witnesses say the shooter was wearing body amour, reports CNN, while four guns, including three pistols and one long gun, as well as a large amount of ammunition, were recovered from the scene. The chaos of the shooting brought conflicting reports of the casualties. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum previously said there were 13 people killed and 20 people injured. Hanlin said Thursday night that his office would likely not release the identity of the shooter and the victims for at least another 24 to 48 hours. Student Kortney Moore, 18, said the gunman shot her teacher in the head, then asked others in the classroom about their religion before shooting again, according to the News-Review, a local newspaper. The father of another student, Anastasia Boylan, relayed his daughter’s eyewitness account of the shooting to CNN based on her description before going into spinal surgery. After he shot the teacher, the gunman reportedly asked students to stand up if they were Christian. “Good, because you’re Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second.” he then said before killing them, according to Boylan’s father Stacy. Roseburg is a small community in the southern part of Oregon, about 180 miles south of Portland. Nearby Mercy Medical Center said on Twitter that it had received a total of 10 patients from the shooting. Four would remain there overnight, the hospital said, and all were likely to survive. Students and staff described a tense situation as soon as gunshots rang out across the campus. “We locked our door, and I went out to lock up the restrooms and could hear four shots from the front of campus,” UCC Foundation Executive Director Dennis O’Neil told the News-Review. Tina Jensen, a student who said she started school at UCC on Tuesday and was standing next to the building where the gunman opened fire, said she was “shocked” at the incident. “There was about five of us standing right next to that building and it just went absolutely crazy,” she told CNN, adding that they mistook the first gunshot for the sound of a heavy textbook falling on the concrete floor. “Everybody started running and we were still a bit confused, and then it just became chaos,” before Jensen jumped into a stranger’s car who promptly drove her off the campus. “We didn’t know what else to do,” she said. “We were just trying to get out of the way.” A spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office said that there was “no more threat” from the shooting as of early Thursday afternoon, adding that students were being bussed to the Douglas County Fairgrounds, where counselors were waiting. Mercer reportedly lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, which was locked down and being investigated by law enforcement authorities late Thursday. The alleged assailant used to “sit by himself in the dark balcony with this little light,” a neighbor named Bronte Hart told local television station KATU. Hart also said a woman living in the building who she assumed to be Mercer’s mother was “crying her eyes out” on Thursday, according to KATU. Federal investigators are reportedly looking into a conversation posted on anonymous message board 4chan for links to the shooting. While it’s unclear if it’s linked to the shooting, a 4chan user posted late Wednesday night warning people not to go to school if they are in the Northwest. Umpqua Community College has about 3,000 students. It had a single unarmed security officer on duty at the time, according to the Associated Press. The college tweeted that it would remain closed until Monday and that all weekend activities would be cancelled. “We are holding the community of Douglas County in our hearts today” said Oregon Governor Kate Brown at a press conference. President Barack Obama called the Roseburg a community of “really good people” and said the victims and his families were in his thoughts and prayers in a speech at the White House. With visible anger, he called once again for gun reforms, and said that mass shootings have become commonplace in America. “Somehow this has become routine,” he said. “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this.” Douglas County Commissioner Chris Boice insisted that people of the community focus on supporting and remembering the victims and their families rather than the perpetrator, echoing the county sheriff’s refusal to give the latter any importance. “This is not about the shooter,” Boice told the crowd. “I challenge you all never to utter his name.” Hanlin, the local sheriff, has been an active opponent of gun-control laws, according to the AP, and once sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the Newtown, Conn. shootings urging him against new regulations.

Gun violence is often among the leading causes of death (homicides and suicides) and non-fatal injuries among youth, and affects families and communities across the US. Gun violence has created a major and unique public health problem for the US, compared to other developed countries. In order to protect youth, the governments and adults in other developed countries such as France have made it difficult for youth to access handguns. However, a recent study showed that about a quarter of US adolescents reported they had easy access to a gun in their home. Meanwhile, the majority of young respondents told researchers they wished to live in a society where it is impossible for teens to obtain guns. Sandro Galea: There have been 45 school shootings in America this year alone. Mass shootings have been occurring with regularity in the US for years now. More than 32,000 people die from firearms every year, as many as die from car accidents. This is clearly a public health issue, and one with a solution – the control of widespread gun availability. Q: If the US committed to ending mass shootings, what does research suggest would be the best strategy? Sandro Galea: Control over availability of weapons, as has been done in countries like Australia, has been shown to work. Ziming Xuan: The best and longest-lasting approach involves comprehensive policy changes. We must also shift the community norms to be more consistent with the public health nature of this problem. Q: Oregon – where Thursday’s shootings took place – is one of seven states that allow guns on college campuses. What impact will ‘campus carry’ laws have on gun violence? Sandro Galea: Wider availability of firearms is associated with more firearm-related injury. Allowing guns on campus is the wrong strategy toward reducing firearm injury. Ziming Xuan: Published research has shown that states with weak laws and more guns are associated with more gun violence in the forms of suicide, homicides and other injuries and accidents. Q: What else should people know to understand gun violence in the US? Ziming Xuan: Considering the magnitude of the gun violence problem in the US, gun-related research is limited in part because there is virtually no funding from the federal government to advance our understanding about the nature and mechanism of gun violence or to identify and evaluate effective prevention strategies. Parents definitely need to teach their children to be responsible with risky and lethal products such as alcohol, guns, cars and so on. However, parents sometimes do not understand fully about child and youth development, impulsiveness or curiosity. A recent study shows that what parents report about their children’s access to guns often contradictschildren’s reports; the kids reveal that they know the location of guns in the house and have handled the gun, while parents reported they did not. For injury prevention, it is far more effective and long-lasting to change the environment by changing modifiable policies and norms than to change the child. Sandro Galea: Firearm deaths are driven principally by availability of firearms. While frequently after these events we link them to mental illness, the evidence is very clear that this is a negligible part of the problem. People with mental illness are much more likely to be victimsthan perpetrators of firearm violence. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

Mike Sullivan/Roseburg News-Review/AP The gun rampage at Umpqua Community College has reportedly killed at least 13 and injured some 20 more. The shooter, according to the state’s attorney general, has been “neutralized.” The college serves the area of Roseburg, Oregon, a small city in center-west Oregon, 180 miles south of Portland, a good haul beyond Eugene down Interstate 5. This act of campus terror is just the latest mass shooting in America’s epidemic of gun violence. October 1 is the 274th day of 2015; Umpqua college represents at least the 264th mass shooting in the country this year, according the Gun Violence Archive. (For the record: a “mass shooting” is defined as involving at least four gunshot victims, excluding the shooter.) Related

It is a level of carnage that our national political system will not and cannot address, because of the strength of the NRA – as I explored in the aftermath of Newtown in a piece titled The NRA vs. America:  “Today’s NRA stands astride some of the ugliest currents of our politics, combining the ‘astroturf’ activism of the Tea Party, the unlimited and undisclosed ‘dark money’ of groups like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, and the sham legislating conducted on behalf of the industry through groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. ‘This is not your father’s NRA,’ says Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, a top gun-industry watchdog. Feldman is more succinct, calling his former employer a ‘cynical, mercenary political cult.'” But it’s clear that not even sensible gun laws can fully shield Americans from attacks like these.

The president expressed disgust and frustration after Thursday's mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, bemoaning the routine nature of such incidents and his own routine and fruitless calls for Congress to sharpen the nation’s gun laws. “This is not something I can do by myself,” Obama said. But gun control advocates say he has by no means exhausted the possibilities for executive actions and -- echoing gun-rights hardliners – that there’s more the administration could do to enforce existing gun laws. “Attention of the administration has shifted away from guns since the background check vote” in 2013, said Arkadi Gerney, a senior vice president at the Center for American Progress who was part of a band of gun control advocates working with the White House on its push for new legislation after the Sandy Hook shooting. In response to that massacre, Obama announced 23 executive actions -– reporting “to have completed or made significant progress” on each of them by December of 2013 -– and followed up with two more last year. By NICK GASS But the administration is already back where they started on one of their most concrete accomplishments: nominating and winning confirmation for a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The Senate confirmed B. Todd Jones in July 2013 – making him the first permanent director of the 2,500-agent division in more than six years – but he left in April to take a job at the NFL. Jones won praise for shoring up the agency after scandals like the “Fast and Furious” gun-running mission and refocusing the agency on violent armed criminals. But gun-rights groups were enraged by his effort, shortly before his departure, to ban armor-piercing .223-caliber bullets. The departure has once again left a “leadership vacuum,” said Gerney, who has called for the whole agency to be folded into the FBI. The White House has announced no plans to nominate a permanent director. ""Acting Director Thomas Brandon is currently fulfilling the role and is providing the outstanding leadership the bureau needs at this time,"" a White House official said. Another of Obama's moves was a new regulation released last year that broadened restrictions on gun purchases to include people who have been ordered by the court to receive outpatient treatment for mental illness -– not just those who have been involuntarily committed to an institution. Hundreds of thousands more people are likely barred from buying a weapon as a result. But the Justice Department isn’t using all the tools it has to ensure that the mental health background check system is complete. A 2007 law –- responding to the Virginia Tech shooting –- offered states new money as inducement to contribute to the database, and it has since ballooned, growing from 300,000 mental health records to 3.7 million. But there are more than 10 states that have submitted fewer than 100 records, and the attorney general has the power to punish them by withholding money, Gerney said. That hasn't happened. “That is something the attorney general could do right now with a stroke of a pen,” he said. Photo Essay By Diana D'Abruzzo 08/26/15 08:39 PM EDT Updated 06/22/16 04:13 PM EDT The administration has also been sitting on a proposed regulation since January that would let mental health providers share information with the FBI database - a delay cheered by some privacy and mental health advocates. Gun control activists have also called for Obama’s Justice Department to do a better job of tracking people who “lie and try” to buy a gun by putting false statements on background check forms -- and prosecuting them. The Justice Department referred questions to the White House on Friday morning, which did not immediately comment beyond pointing to a roundup of 2013 progress. Ultimately, however “the onus is on Congress,” said Mark Prentice, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was nearly killed in a mass shooting in 2011. “We think the president and the administration have done a very good job of enforcing the laws on the books,” Prentice added. “Congress has shown itself to be pretty comfortable doing the bidding of the gun lobby.” Though hardly sweeping, there is a chance new gun restrictions could make it through Congress this session, as part of a bipartisan criminal justice reform package introduced in the Senate on Thursday, hours before the shooting. While much of the bill involves limiting the use of mandatory minimum sentences, it would actually increase mandatory minimums from 10 years to 15 years for certain categories of armed career criminals. It also includes measures to fix incomplete or inaccurate criminal history records in the FBI’s background check system. Missing out on the latest scoops?

It has been corrected since it first published. The week began with an attempted massacre of Planned Parenthood in Congress and ended with another horrific mass shooting in Oregon. Conservatives grilled the head of the organization that provides healthcare to poor women as if she were a criminal, and then threw up their hands saying nothing can be done about gun violence. Poor healthcare and random gun deaths are just the price you pay for freedom, they say. Or as Jeb Bush so brilliantly articulated: ""Stuff happens."" Here are five low-lights from the week that was: 1.  Bill O’Reilly: We can’t do anything about gun violence. I really can't think of a single thing. In the wake of another sickening mass shooting, Papa Bear O’Reilly had this sage advice for his flock: Be sad and do nothing. Do not delude yourselves that there is something that can be done, because there is nothing.  Because freedom. And guns. That's the American way. O’Reilly seemed most concerned that these shootings might be hurting America’s reputation in the world. Here is Papa’s hollow sounding sadness: This is another black mark for all Americans. People around the world must wonder what's going on in the land of the free. And it is our freedom that allows insane individuals to kill so many people. Guns are legal in America under the Second Amendment. Tonight, President Obama delivered an impassioned anti-gun remark speech, which we'll discuss later. Then he went on to discuss it anyway, mostly his gambit to nip any discussion about gun control in the bud: The mass murder today could not have been prevented by any legislation in my opinion. Roseburg, Oregon is about as normal as it gets. A rural area that enjoys the stunning nature Oregon provides, and a relatively simple lifestyle centered on family and community. I worked in Oregon, I visited Roseburg. It's a calm place. But it's also gun country, as hunting is big in the area and the rural setting means folks must protect themselves with firearms, as police protection is far away for many people. Really, people must protect themselves with firearms? Are you sure about that Papa Bill? It pains me to report stories like this because I know how much personal damage is caused to the people and families affected by murder. The country itself takes a massive hit whenever this kind of thing happens. Thirty-two people killed at Virginia Tech, 27 slain at Sandy Hook. Thirteen murdered at Ft. Hood, 13 dead in Binghamton, New York, 12 murdered in Aurora, Colorado, the same number at the Navy Yard in Washington. Charleston, South Carolina just last June, nine shot dead in a church. There is no rational explanation for all the carnage, none. And no public policy will stop it. So, this is progress, if in a microscopic way. The small admission that there just might be a problem with gun violence, and that other countries don't seem to have this problem. But we can’t solve it. It’s too hard. Or too distasteful and would hurt our backers. So why bother? And anyway, we don’t really want to. 2. Jeb Bush’s deep and consoling thought on Oregon shooting: ‘Stuff happens.’ Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush reportedly told a South Carolina crowd on Friday that gun control is not the answer to reducing gun deaths in the U.S. because ""stuff happens."" ""I had this challenge as governor. Look, stuff happens,” Bush shrugged in response to a question of whether the time is right for some sensible gun control. “There's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Asked later if he wanted to rephrase or clarify his remark, if he perhaps spoke too cavalierly, was mistaken or misquoted, Bush doubled down: ""No, it wasn't a mistake, I said exactly what I said. Explain to me what I said wrong. Things happen all the time. Things. Is that better?"" So irritating for him, to have to try to use more sensitive language. Stuff! Things! This political correctness thing is so out of control, it’s oppressive! 3. Sean Hannity is hopping mad that the president ‘politicized’ the shootings. The Oregon community college shootings were horrible, but what really had Sean Hannity angry was that President Obama spoke about them, and had the audacity to suggest there might be something we can do to prevent such tragedies. How dare he! “I was really disgusted with the president’s comments tonight,” Hannity said angrily on his show, “His race to politicize this.” Hannity and his idiotic guest, former cop turned right-wing personality Bo Dietl, proceeded to not politicize the tragedy at all by talking about how wrong any sort of gun control arguments might be, and how the president is the only one who is politicizing it. “When the president said today, ‘This is a political choice we’ve got to make, that we make to allow this to happen,’ that is a gross lie by this president!” Hannity sputtered. He then unpolitically advocated putting armed guards in schools to keep kids safe. See, Mr. President, that’s how un-politics are done! Also, unpolitically, Hannity brought up the rumor that the shooter might have been a Muslim terrorist. Nope, no politics anywhere to be seen on apolitical Hannity's show. 4. Dr. Ben Carson, man of science, is not so sure about gravity. Former pediatric neurosurgeon, top-tier Republican hopeful Dr. Ben Carson has taken his hilarious science denial act on the road, and he’s testing it out on lucky crowds all over this great country. Carson has previously expressed doubts about the Big Bang, evolution (which he speculates might be from the devil—ha ha! Stop Dr. Carson, you’re making our stomachs hurt from too much laughter), climate change, vaccine science and the biological roots of sexuality. This week, he free-associated on the weighty topic of gravity while on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. And frankly, he’s not so sure about it. “Gravity, where did it come from? I mean, there are so many things,” he said, in a riff on his skepticism regarding the ‘Big Bang’ theory vs. Biblical creation. “I don’t denigrate the people who say ‘Eh, eh, whatever, somehow it happened.’ I don’t denigrate them. I just don’t have that much faith.” This semi-coherent aseemblage of sort-of sentences issued forth when an audience member asked him if he really does not believe in climate change. Carson responded that, of course climate is changing, “At any point in time, temperatures go up and down. When that stops happening, that’s when there is big trouble.” That’s about as unscientific as you can be on that topic since, of course, he is confusing weather and temperature with climate, a rookie mistake. Carson went on to say that of course, we should take care of the environment, and there is “no reason to make it a political issue,” forgetting perhaps that the issue has been politicized by right-wing science deniers and ignoramuses. So, yeah. WTF is he talking about? 5. Republican Congressman: Planned Parenthood is not necessary, because as a guy with great health insurance from the taxpayers, I don't need it. During this week’s Planned Parenthood hearings, the tin-eared award goes to Republican Congressman Glenn Grothman, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin who told the CEO of the women’s healthcare provider that he just does not find her organization necessary. As a man enjoying great government-funded health insurance, he has plenty of other options. Bully for him. When I look at cities around me that have a Planned Parenthood clinic … usually in those cities, as a guy, I could go to many clinics locally that have all the machines that one would need, all these clinics as far as I know take Medicaid dollars, so you could go to any of those clinics to get any medical service you could. . . . I guess what I’m getting at is if Planned Parenthood disappeared tomorrow in those towns, there would still be three or four or five clinics or hospitals providing all the … medical care you would want. Grothman's general outlook on Medicaid is almost as dim as his view of Planned Parenthood. He has claimed in the past that people who use the public safety net are fleecing taxpayers by living high on the hog, and not having to pay deductibles like those with private insurance do.

Alex Wong/Getty James Brady’s death last year was ruled a homicide. After he was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan’s life, the president’s press secretary spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair. When he died 33 years later, the coroner declared it was the original gunshot that killed him. Brady spent those years, along with his wife Sarah, fighting for stricter gun control laws. The federal law requiring background checks for gun purchases – rife with exceptions – bears his name. So does the press room where President Obama had to, once again, stride to the podium to express sympathy and grief for the families of people brutally murdered in yet another mass shooting. The president sounded familiar notes: He thanked the responders. He honored the victims and offered prayers for their families. But something was different in this speech. Related

						20 Greatest Best Song Oscar Performances This time, he was angry. His anger wasn’t directed at Chris Harper Mercer, the murderer who hadn’t been named yet by the media when Obama spoke. His anger was for you. And me. And every other citizen in this country who has allowed shooting after shooting to destroy countless lives while our government refuses to act.  “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction…. “So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren’t so fortunate, I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.” Obama’s frustration was visible on his face, palpable in a way it hasn’t been in the past. And no wonder. He was president when James Holmes killed 12 people in a movie theater. He was president for 20 dead children in Newtown, Connecticut, and nine dead black parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina. He was president when one of Congress’ own was shot in the head.  We’ve watched him plead and cajole Congress to take action. And Congress has done nothing. After the 20 dead kids, there was a limp attempt to pass a neutered background check, but even with the names of a conservative Republican and the Senate’s most conservative Democrat attached, the bill died an ignominious death, six votes short of breaking a filibuster. Twenty dead kids, and nothing. Once Congress couldn’t act after Sandy Hook, what would make them act? Not Charleston. Not Lafayette, Louisiana. And certainly not Roseburg, Oregon, where nine people died yesterday at Mercer’s hands. President Obama has read the writing on the wall: Gun control legislation will not happen during his presidency, no matter how many dead bodies pile up. And he knows why – because America never puts this issue on the front burner when election season rolls around. His speech continued: “And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.”  We elect Democratic politicians who say they support reasonable regulations on guns but do nothing to push them once they’re elected. We elect conservative Republicans who fight any gun laws tooth and nail. Poll after poll shows overwhelming majorities of Americans, even gun owners, support what Obama called “common-sense gun-safety laws,” but we don’t hold our elected officials accountable for failing us on this issue again and again. Obama is furious with us, and he’s right to be. We should be furious with ourselves. We should still be screaming about those 20 dead children, and the hundreds of bodies that have followed them. President Obama stood in a room named for a man who gave three decades of his life to making the nation safe from guns, and he told us nothing would happen until we took action, until we replaced a do-nothing Congress with one that would do something, anything to stop the killings. He’s right; it’s on us. In This Article:

638,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/obama-oregon-shooting-umpqua-community-college-gun-control.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by transcript NA By Gardiner Harris and Michael D. Shear WASHINGTON — President Obama’s rage about gun massacres, building for years, spilled out Thursday night as he acknowledged his own powerlessness to prevent another tragedy and pleaded with voters to force change themselves. “So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren’t so fortunate,” the president said in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named for a man severely wounded by a would-be assassin’s bullet, “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up.” Mr. Obama admitted that he was unable to do anything to prevent such tragedies by himself. And he did little to try to hide the anger and frustration that have deepened as he returns again and again to the White House lectern in the wake of a deadly mass shooting. transcript na Mr. Obama took a veiled swipe at the National Rifle Association, which has successfully fought most limits on gun use and manufacture and has pushed through legislation in many states making gun ownership far easier. “And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt for sport, for protecting their families, to think about whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that suggests it is speaking for you,” he said. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to respond to Mr. Obama, saying that it was the organization’s policy “not to comment until all the facts are known.” Wayne LaPierre, the organization’s executive vice president, declared after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” On Thursday night, Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass shootings, people had “become numb to this.” “And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” Mr. Obama said. “Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ‘We need more guns,’ they’ll argue. ‘Fewer gun-safety laws.’ ” A selection of President Obama’s comments after mass shootings. “Does anybody really believe that?” he asked, his voice rising. Mr. Obama sought to answer that question years ago. After the massacre in 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislative changes that polls suggest were widely supported. “Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?” Mr. Obama asked then. Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul the nation’s gun laws that would have included universal background checks and a spate of other measures he deemed “concrete steps” aimed at preventing more mass shootings. “This is how we will be judged,” he said in January 2013. The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from both parties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president’s gun control agenda. At the time, and also visibly upset, Mr. Obama stood in the Rose Garden to denounce the opponents of new gun measures even as he acknowledged the futility of his efforts. transcript NA He called it a “shameful day” in Washington and promised that eventually, “I believe we’re going to be able to get this done.” In a Twitter message on Thursday, Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama until this year, remembered that afternoon as “the most frustrated I ever saw President Obama in 8 years.” With each massacre since, Mr. Obama has been forced to help the country grieve, as presidents are called upon to do in national tragedies. Thirteen dead at the Washington Navy Yard; three dead at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex.; nine dead in a church in Charleston, S.C. And with each massacre, his sense of powerless anger and frustration has built. But what was different this time was that the president did not announce any new initiative or effort to fix the problem. Instead, he pointed out that there is “a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer?” States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths than those that do not, he said. “So we know there are ways to prevent it,” he said. This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters by insisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety, and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts. But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federal government even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notion that the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons. He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed by terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the number killed by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions of dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively few terrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far greater number of gun deaths. And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority. “If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views,” he said. A selection of articles from New York Times series about weapons and mental health. Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant. His speeches since being elected in 2008 have sometimes seemed like lectures from the constitutional law professor he once was. But he is also a father, one who insists on eating dinner with his daughters. Shootings, particularly at schools, have seemingly brought together his roles as president and father in ways nothing else has. And that combination brings forth the kind of raw emotion he almost never betrays. His eulogy in June for the victims of the massacre in Charleston, for instance, was widely considered one of his most impassioned, and included singing the opening refrain of “Amazing Grace.” Thursday night, he had little of the soaring language and certainly none of the hope he expressed in Charleston. But he promised to continue hammering away at this issue for the rest of his presidency. “Each time this happens, I’m going to bring this up,” he said. “Each time this happens, I’m going to say that we can actually do something about it.” Advertisement",2015-10-02 08:00:00,"Obama Condemns ‘Routine’ of Mass Shootings, Says U.S. Has Become Numb",,1,http://nytimes.com

Following yet another mass shooting — this time at a community college in Oregon that left 10 dead — Obama took the podium at the White House press room. He delivered an impassioned, at times angry address criticizing opponents of stricter gun laws. ""This is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together,"" Obama said. ""This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America."" ""How can you, with a straight face argue that more guns will make us safer?"" After years of ducking presidential-campaign battles over gun laws out of fear of the powerful gun lobby, it appears that Democrats are finally ready to politicize the issue and go on the offensive. Democrats are becoming more and more outspoken about gun violence in the wake of seemingly ever-increasing mass shootings, despite the fact that the American public remains as opposed as ever to many gun-control measures. And the increase in mass shootings has guaranteed that candidates will have to address the issue on the campaign trail, setting it up to become a major issue in the 2016 presidential election. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, for example, set the tone early in her campaign after a mass shooting at a historically African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. She has become much more vocal in her calls for stricter gun laws, making it a recurring feature in her stump speeches and addressing the issue bluntly when confronted by reporters. Following the Oregon shooting on Thursday, Clinton immediately told CNN's Dan Merica that it was yet another reason why she supported universal background checks. ""It is just beyond my comprehension that we are seeing these mass murders happen again and again and again. And as I have said, we have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe,"" Clinton told CNN on Thursday. Clinton's increased calls for gun control mirror President Barack Obama's recent shift to refocus on gun laws in the wake of a slew of mass shootings. In addition to the Oregon incident, there have been high-profile mass shootings at military facilities in Tennessee, an historically African-American church in South Carolina, and a movie theater in Louisiana. Obama has labeled the failure of Congress to pass new gun laws the biggest frustration of his tenure. He has spoken out multiple times recently on the subject, including after the Charleston shooting that killed nine people. ""I've had to make statements like this too many times,"" Obama said after the Charleston shooting. ""At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other developed countries."" This is a major shift from 2008, when both Clinton and Obama were criticized for failing to talk about the issue. During the heat of the 2012 campaign, Obama was reluctant to bring up the topic of guns even after the mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater. Passing gun-control measures, Democrats have long argued, had helped lead Democrats to overwhelming losses in the 1994 midterms, which swept Republicans into power in Congress. The new focus, then, is an interesting political calculus — because many signs actually show that Americans' support for gun rights is growing. A widely cited Pew study published in December showed that support for gun rights has surpassed Americans' support for gun control, though some analysts have pointed out that the phrasing of Pew's question might have led more Americans to appear friendlier to guns. Gun-rights advocates have also experienced success in state legislatures, beyond helping to block Democrats' federal legislation that would have expanded background checks on gun purchases. In almost three years since the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, 70 of 109 state gun laws have actually loosened restrictions, according to The New York Times. But gun-safety groups say that below the surface, there is growing support for certain goals. Citing broad support for background checks and a few legislative wins in the 2014 midterm elections, Everytown — the group co-chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — argued that opposition to gun-rights groups like the National Rifle Association is much more organized and motivated even than it was in 2008 when Clinton last ran for president. Lamb acknowledged that in the past, gun-rights groups have scared lawmakers into silence. Now, she said, high-profile horrific shootings have forced candidates to talk about the dangers of guns more frequently. ""I worked here in 2012, and I know how hard it was to get the candidates to address gun violence,"" Lamb said. ""The candidates have been talking about guns far more than they did then."" But if increasingly strong rhetoric from Clinton and financial backing from Bloomberg worries gun-advocacy groups, it doesn't show. Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, provided a reminder that President Bill Clinton himself admitted that threatening gun rights can be a perilous issue politically. ""Hillary Clinton is repeating the error her husband made in 1994 — pushing for gun-control legislation. He realized his mistake and said so,"" Pratt told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""Hillary is so ideological that she seems oblivious to the reality of gun-control politics. She seems doomed to repeat her husband's political error."" For their part, Republican candidates aren't backing down. They have argued that if more citizens were armed, more mass shootings could be prevented. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) railed against ""gun free"" zones earlier this year, suggesting that a well-trained citizen with a gun could've stopped a shooting at a Louisiana movie-theater. Following the Connecticut shooting that left 20 children and six others dead in 2012, Huckabee wrote on Facebook that not all victims of shootings want stricter gun laws imposed, pointing to a survivor of a mass shooting who now advocates for more relaxed gun laws. Other candidates have tried to use shootings to remind voters of where they stand on certain issues. That's what former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (R) did following the Charleston shooting, claiming that the shooting was part of a larger attack on religious freedom. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), meanwhile, said that even in the wake of a tragedy, government is not the answer. And after the Oregon shooting, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) rejected calls for new gun measures. ""The people who are going to commit crimes or have problems are always going to have the guns. And I think more and more people feel like, 'I'd like to be able to protect myself,'"" he said in an NBC interview But mass shootings, which tend to dominate news cycles, are occurring more and more frequently. As Mother Jones points out, the number of days between mass shootings has dropped dramatically in recent years, from 220 between 1995 and 2005 to 99 between 2005 and 2015. There are 401 days until Election Day.",2015-10-03 08:00:00,The dark reason why guns are virtually guaranteed to be a major issue of the 2016 campaign,,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. Everything in that statement is wrong. What happened in Oregon is tragic, and the nation should comfort families and look for reasonable and practical ways to stem violence, but there is only one murderer. Now, if government somehow bolstered, endorsed, or “allowed” the actions of Chris Harper-Mercer — as it might with, say, the deaths of 10,000-plus viable babies each year or the civilian deaths that occur during an American drone action — a person could plausibly argue that we are collectively answerable as a nation. Then again, when the president asserts that Americans are collectively answerable, what he really suggests — according to his own broader argument — is that conservatives who’ve blocked his gun-control legislation are wholly responsible. The problem with that contention, outside of the obvious fact that Republicans never condone the use of guns for illegal violence (in fact, these rampages hurt their cause more than anything), is that Democrats haven’t offered a single bill or idea (short of confiscation) that would impede any of the mass shootings or overall gun violence. This is not a political choice, because it’s likely there is no available political answer. The Left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills — because no person can be evil. For the liberal, every societal problem has a state-issued remedy waiting to be administered over the objections of a reactionary Republican. But just because you have a tremendous amount of emotion and frustration built up around a certain cause doesn’t make your favored legislation any more practical, effective, or realistic. It doesn’t change the fact that owning a gun is a civil right, that the preponderance of owners are not criminals, or that there are 300 million guns out there. And if it’s a political argument you’re offering — and when hasn’t it been? — you’ll need more than the vacuousness of “this is bad, so we have to do something.” That’s because anti-gun types are never able to answer a simple question: What law would you pass that could stop these shootings? Many liberals see the Second Amendment as tragically misinterpreted or useless and guns as abhorrent, so they do not believe that any legislative imposition is a trade-off — even an ineffective law. Many conservatives view guns as a civil right, so this is an unacceptable trade-off. Some don’t even view mass shooting as primarily a gun problem. Now, that doesn’t mean guns have nothing to do with it, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it well responding to a Slate piece: One can simultaneously believe that the high volume of firearms contributes to our high homicide rate and that these laws aren’t good ideas. It’s actually pretty easy to believe both of these things at once, since none of the regulations at issue would do much at all to reduce our high volume of firearms.  Jeb Bush took a lot of heat for asserting that “stuff happens” (out of context). Now, horrific stuff happens, and we should do what we can, balanced with a host of other concerns, to stop these shootings. But it’s worth pointing out that less stuff has been happening. Despite all the Obama administration’s fear-mongering and as horrifying as any shooting is, gun violence has precipitously declined over the decades without any meaningful federal law being enacted. This most likely tells us there are a number of other social currents driving this kind of violence. The Left believes that the number of guns is at fault rather than social ills — because no person can be evil. So the debate takes on the same old contours, and we focus on firearms and nothing else. That kind of political debate only makes it less likely that anything good will happen. When we politicize a tragedy, it is immediately sucked into a broader ideological conflict. Then conservatives (at least when out of power) will see (rightfully, I believe) an intrusive agenda that is a perpetual slippery slope. (Can you blame them when they hear this? “No, we don’t want confiscation, but look at what the Australians did! They confiscated guns. We don’t want confiscation, but isn’t that Second Amendment interpretation so stupid?!”) Trust me, it’s not unreasonable to treat liberal policies as if they have a tendency for mission creep and unwieldy expansion.

""This is something we should politicize.

The shooter, identified as a 26-year-old male named Chris Harper Mercer, opened fire earlier in the day at Umpqua Community College. Police said the shooter was among those who died. For Obama, reacting to a shooting has become an all-too-common occurrence. Thursday's 13-minute statement constituted the 15th time during his presidency that he has responded to a mass shooting, according to CBS's Mark Knoller. According to The Washington Post, meanwhile, a full calendar week has yet to pass without a mass-shooting incident during Obama's second term in office. According to the group Everytown for Gun Safety, Thursday's shooting in Oregon was the 142nd school-shooting incident since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The last time he made a statement from the White House — on the shooting that left nine dead at a historically African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina — he lamented that he has had to ""make statements like this too many times."" This time, he used language that went even further. He stood dismayed at the numbness of the ""routine"" that has developed in the aftermath of shootings, saying the ""thoughts and prayers"" commonly offered are ""not enough."" ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium is routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it — we've become numb to this,"" Obama said.

Like clockwork, before anyone had time digest the horror of the latest mass shooting, the left started finger-pointing and demanding more gun control – whether it would have prevented the crime or not. From President Obama on down, they immediately began railing against the NRA and gun owners. Not surprisingly, entertainment industry liberals were among the most vocal. That also made them among the most hypocritical. TV, movies and music videos thrive portraying – and often glamorizing – violence, and gun violence in particular. And while actors were demanding gun control, the top 10 movies in theaters this past weekend were awash in violence – 334 separate violent acts, 121 of them involving guns. The on-screen body count was 39 dead out of 142 victims. But on Twitter we heard from the big names of Hollywood – Judd Apatow, Alyssa Milano, Minnie Driver, Patton Oswalt, Rose McGowan and Mia Farrow. Actress Julianne Moore had a nauseating Twitter conversation with Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett in which the two congratulated each other for being against gun violence. Moore:
		Thank you @vj44 for amplifying conversation on gun violence. We all must do more & creative community is committed. #StopGunViolence Jarrett:
		Thanks @_juliannemoore for lending your voice to this effort to #StopGunViolence. Please encourage others to join us That would be this Julianne Moore.  As far as we know, neither Liam Neeson nor Quentin Tarantino has chimed in this time, but we know their phony positions. Tarantino, the “pornographer of violence” would no doubt tell us “Obviously, the issue is gun control and mental health.” Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight is due out soon. It will be interesting to see if it tops the 69 victims of violence crammed into his last flick, Django Unchained. Neeson, who’s personal on-screen body count now runs to the hundreds, would say “There’s too many [expletive] guns out there. Especially in America.” He said that earlier this year while flogging his hyper-violent Taken III. Neither Neeson nor Tarantino currently has a movie out, but Hollywood is doing just fine without them. As MRC Culture showed in 2013, just weeks after the Sandy Hook massacre, the top five movies in theaters featured 65 scenes of violence (38 involving guns) with 185 individual victims. This time, MRC Culture analyzed the top 10 films in current release. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, Black Mass, Sicario and others filled the screen with at least 334 violent acts, 121 acts of gun violence and 39 dead. That’s despite the fact that Everest, The Martian and The Intern contained no violent scenes at all. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials led the way with at least 78 incidents of violence – mostly with teens either fighting or being the victims, and even one suicide. Crime stories Sicario and Black Mass came in close behind. Some of the scenes were so filled with violence that they were hard to count, so the number is likely far higher. The Perfect Guy, a thriller about a woman being stalked, featured 46 violent scenes with three fatalities. Horror film The Visit took violence to a whole new, disturbing level. Not because it was graphic, but because it involved the elderly in 24 separate violent acts that claimed four lives. Even the Christian movie The War Room contained six violent acts. Black Mass, the biopic about Boston mobster Whitey Bulger, showed 64 acts of violence, 22 of them involving guns. In one scene, Bulger (Johnny Depp) graphically shot a victim over and over at least 13 times. In Sicario the drug wars at the U.S.-Mexico border come to very graphic life. Among the 67 violent acts were 39 using guns, including a firefight in a smuggling tunnel where at least 90 shots were exchanged, and a scene in which a character shoots a man’s wife and son in front of him before killing him too. And those numbers hardly indicate the core of violence within the movie – from photos to dead bodies.  Even Hotel Transylvania 2 mustered its share of on-screen, but animated violence. But at least it contained no gun violence, which Hollywood is allegedly against. The result is that in any given week American movie theatres are charnel houses. But it isn’t just movies. From its obsession with serial killers to “ripped from the headlines” crime shows, TV is incredibly drenched in blood. In 2013, a week before the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, there were 39 gun deaths among 145 violent acts in just 14 popular shows. More recently, when two journalists were gunned down on live TV in Virginia in August, USA Network postponed the season finale of its popular show Mr. Robot because it contained a graphic scene too similar to real life. When it aired the following week, a character shot himself on-camera, spraying blood on the window behind him. The whole incident was shown on-screen, in graphic detail. It would be nice for once, when a gun-related tragedy like Roseburg occurs, for Hollywood hypocrites to go off script. At the very least, they could mix some honest introspection into their demands for gun control. The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

646,http://www.nj.com/south-jersey-voices/index.ssf/2015/09/we_need_a_balance_between_gun.html,"Al Kelly (Photo provided) By Albert B. Kelly Recently, I came across a study that said the United States far outpaces the rest of the world in mass shootings. To be clear, there is no universal definition of what constitutes a ""mass shooting."" Certain reports put out by the FBI consider it a mass shooting if there are more than four victims. Regardless of whether we call it a mass shooting or we insert the word ""spree"" somewhere in the narrative, we're the leader of the pack. MORE: We are just 5 percent of the world's population, yet we account for 31 percent of the world's mass shootings since 1966. Of course it was right around that time that a guy named Charles Whitman climbed into the bell tower at the University of Texas with a rifle and killed 16 people. It seems like the prospect of the mass shooter has been with us ever since. In fairness to us, other countries have their share of mass shootings. The Philippines, Russia, Denmark, Yemen and France all have had mass shootings over the same period, but if you add up all the mass shootings collectively from these countries they still don't come close to the United States. This information comes courtesy of the University of Alabama and criminologist Adam Lankford. Of the 178 countries Lankford studied, the United States ranked first in per-capita gun ownership. His 2007 survey found 270 million firearms in civilian households- an ownership rate of 88.8 per 100 people. The next closest country was a third world country, namely Yemen with a rate of 54.8 percent, which is remarkable considering that someone's overthrowing the government there every other week. In light of these dramatic stats, perhaps we as a country need to stop talking at and past each other and decide once and for all that we will do something collectively and substantially on gun control as opposed to waiting for the next mass shooting with the handwringing and spin that comes for a couple of weeks afterward before we move on to other things. There was a time once when mass shootings were a rare thing, now it seems to be a fairly common occurrence. I'm not sure what it takes to get us to that place where we're willing to find the sweet spot, the balance between basic rights and access. I expected progress after Patrick Purdy killed 5 and wounded 30 others at a Stockton California schoolyard in 1989. I thought the same in 1997 after 14-year-old Mike Carneal shot up his Kentucky high school killing 3 and injuring five. I was wrong. Still nothing after 15-year-old Kip Kinkel killed his parents and 2 others while wounding 22 in May 1998. But certainly I thought we would make some progress after Columbine in April 1999. But maybe that was ancient history. So I figured we might do something after Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 and wounded 17 at Virginia Tech in April 2007. After Jared Loughner killed 6 and wounded 13, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tuscan in January of 2011, I assumed this would spur her fellow lawmakers to act. I was wrong again. That's why I didn't hold out hope after James Holmes walked into a movie theater in Aurora Colorado in July of 2012 and killed 12 while wounding 70 more. But I managed to find a little hope in December 2012 in the days after Adam Lanza killed 20 first graders and 6 adult staff at a Newtown Connecticut elementary school. I thought surely the execution of a classroom full of 5 year-olds would shake us and move us on some profound level and we would find a way to get something done about guns and access and violence and madness. But here we are and not a lot has changed. The shooters change and the scenery changes so that maybe it's not a movie theater or a school; but a kid like Dylann Roof in an AME church in Charleston South Carolina on a Wednesday night offing 9 people at a Bible Study. I don't know what the answer is or what it is in American culture that translates into the type of carnage we've seen over the last few decades.

The 26-year-old shooter stockpiled 14 guns in his apartment. ""We have not so much a gun problem, we have a problem with sin and evil,” the former Arkansas pastor declared, insisting that a rush to discuss gun control measures in the wake of America's 294th mass shooting in 2015 was misguided. Huckabee, like nearly all of his Republican rivals, twisted to simultaneously express condolences for an event that has become all too commonplace in American society while at the same time shrugging off its prevalence. “There is no law which prevents people from doing things that are violent. There are a lot of crimes that nobody sees coming until it’s too late,"" Huckabee offered before arguing against gun-free zones. “Every one of these shootings happened in a gun free zone,” he said, referring to school shootings. “We can say we’re going to have more gun free zones but that ends up being the worst thing because it just gives the shooter real confidence that he walks into that environment and he’s the only one armed.” ""How do we move forward thinking that we can send our school and that this won't happen,"" a frustrated Alisyn Camerota pushed Huckabee. There have been 45 school shootings in the United States this year alone. ""Well, the fact is,"" Huckabee began, ""sending your kids today is much safer than sending my kids to school thirty years ago when they went. It's a safer place,"" he insisted before blaming the 24-hour new cycle for creating a heightened and reactionary sense of fear. So much for his earlier argument that gun-free zones have made schools less safe. “Seven hundred people a year get killed because somebody beats them up with their fist,” Huckabee later observed. “We don’t make a big deal out of that because there’s a lot of people that get killed in a lot of ways, but a gun crime gets most of the attention."" “We could stop most of the car wrecks if we restricted speeds down to 25 miles per hour. There would be very few car accidents if no care was allowed to go faster than 25 miles per hour,"" Huckabee offered to push-back against tighter gun restrictions.

Mike Sullivan/Roseburg News-Review/AP The gun rampage at Umpqua Community College has reportedly killed at least 13 and injured some 20 more. The shooter, according to the state’s attorney general, has been “neutralized.” The college serves the area of Roseburg, Oregon, a small city in center-west Oregon, 180 miles south of Portland, a good haul beyond Eugene down Interstate 5. This act of campus terror is just the latest mass shooting in America’s epidemic of gun violence. October 1 is the 274th day of 2015; Umpqua college represents at least the 264th mass shooting in the country this year, according the Gun Violence Archive. (For the record: a “mass shooting” is defined as involving at least four gunshot victims, excluding the shooter.) Related

Feldman is more succinct, calling his former employer a ‘cynical, mercenary political cult.'” But it’s clear that not even sensible gun laws can fully shield Americans from attacks like these.

649,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/john-hanlin-gun-control-constitutional,"A sheriff who’s vocally opposed to stricter gun control legislation and has been linked to a fringe “constitutional sheriffs” organization found himself thrust into the spotlight Thursday following a deadly mass shooting at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon. Douglas County, Oregon Sheriff John Hanlin told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Friday morning on “New Day” that he was focused on investigating the shooting, in which a 26-year-old gunman massacred at least nine people and injured several others, rather than on talking about his position on the gun control debate. When Cuomo pointed out that Hanlin previously said gun laws aren’t the answer to mass shootings, the sheriff responded: “I want to stay focused on completing this investigation and focus on the families of the victims The discussion over firearms and control of firearms will occur. I’ll dime in at a later time but now is not that time.” Cuomo cited a 2013 letter Hanlin wrote to Vice President Joe Biden asking him to preserve the Second Amendment and informing him that Hanlin would refuse to enforce “unconstitutional regulations or orders”—meaning executive actions on gun control—in Douglas County. The letter came a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre, when Washington was abuzz with talk of enacting stricter gun control measures. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote in the letter. “Any actions against, or in disregard for our U.S. Constitution and 2nd Amendment rights by the current administration would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people.” Afterward, Hanlin was one of hundreds of sheriffs cited by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA) as a law enforcement official who “vowed to uphold and defend the Constitution against Obama’s unconstitutional gun control measures.” The CSPOA, founded by former Graham County, Arizona sheriff Richard Mack, is like the loosely-organized militia group Oath Keepers in that its members tout an oath to “uphold and defend” the Constitution. It was unclear if Hanlin was a member of CSPOA. Mack did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TPM. Hanlin, a 26-year veteran of the force in his second term as sheriff, has spoken out against gun control measures at the state level as well. He was one of several sheriffs who testified before Oregon legislators in April and urged them to reject SB 941, a bill that would expand background checks to gun sales and transfers:  “This law is not going to protect citizens of Oregon, in that it is going to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. It will not do that,” he said. “We have laws that prohibit the possession of other things, like methamphetamine, and it doesn’t stop it.” Hanlin added that because of budget constraints it would be “nearly impossible” for his agency to enforce the expanded background checks. But the bill ultimately passed and was signed into law by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) in May. Cuomo, the CNN anchor, repeatedly pressed Hanlin on those previous stances against gun control legislation after the sheriff declined to address the issue. “Why am I pushing you on this, sheriff?” Cuomo said. “It’s not because I don’t want to respect the victims. It’s because you’ve weighed in on it in the past. I want to know if your perspective is different now that you’re knee deep in one of these situations than just being someone who’s seeing it from abroad.” “Well, my position on it has not changed,” Hanlin responded. “So you still believe that it’s not about gun laws, it’s not about uniform background checks,” Cuomo pressed. “None of those things would help, sir?” “Again, I want to stay focused on this investigation and the welfare of the community and the welfare of the families and the victims in this horrific incident,” Hanlin responded. “I’m not going to waste the time today, or any time in the real near future, having the firearm debate.” Watch part of the exchange between Hanlin and Cuomo below:  “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?” It’s a question that, in recent weeks, has become a mainstream rallying cry among the MAGA… A group of attorneys who sought to overturn the 2020 election doubled down on the effort in a sanctions hearing… Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro suggested that he would sue to block subpoenas issued as part of a state senator’s… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

650,http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/lebron_james_gun_control.html,"lebron-media-day.jpg LeBron James called for expanded gun restrictions in the wake of recent, fatal shootings of children in Cleveland. (John Kuntz) INDEPENDENCE, Ohio - LeBron James said there is ""no room for guns"" as he bemoaned a rash of child shootings in Cleveland Friday and stated his support for stronger gun laws in America. James, the Cavaliers' superstar who hasn't shied away from hot-button political issues over the past few years, reacted on social media Thursday to the first reports of a fatal shooting of 5-month-old Aavielle Wakefield on Cleveland's east side. About the time James was posting his thoughts on the shooting - the third killing by gunfire of a child in Cleveland in a month - President Barack Obama was calling for Americans to thinks of way ""to think about how they can get our government to change"" and strengthen gun laws, in response to a mass, fatal shooting Thursday on a community college campus in Oregon. James said he didn't hear Obama's speech, but ""I know what I see. I know how I feel. ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out, I don't know how you can do that,"" James said. ""There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves."" James didn't specify if he was calling for stricter gun laws at the federal or state level. But his statements nevertheless represent perhaps the most pointed political stance James has taken on any issue over the years, even though he has a history of speaking out against violence toward unarmed African-Americans. In 2012, James led the Miami Heat in a protest of the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, a protest in which the team posed for a photo wearing hooded sweatshirts with the hoods pulled on their heads. Last season, James and Kyrie Irving wore ""I Can't Breathe"" t-shirts before a game, to protest the death of New York man Eric Garner, who was suffocated by a police officer. When James has made political statements in the past, he hasn't challenged or otherwise criticized police, and he has routinely urged against rioting in communities. This time, James took a stance on an issue that divides the country. James said he saw news of the child Wakefield's shooting break across his phone while he was sitting at home with his three children and ""it automatically just hit me."" In American politics, Democrats typically, though not always, push for expanded gun control, while Republican politicians tend to view that expansion as an infringement on second-amendment rights. Gun lobbies have successfully pushed for fewer restrictions on gun ownership in many states, including Ohio, where guns are now permitted in bars and restaurants, and fought background checks in Congress. Jim Irvine, president of the Buckeye Firearms Association, said the kind of gun control for which James is calling is an ""abject failure."" Irvine said Ohio actually lags several states in training children on the dangers of guns and how to use them. He said that was a more effective, responsible approach. ""Bottom line, when we get training, we become more responsible,"" Irvine said. James also said he believes the work he's doing through the LeBron James Family Foundation in Akron Public Schools, where his charitable organization is mentoring at-risk youths from the third grade through graduation, is tangentially keeping children away from guns and the streets by keeping them engaged in positive activities. ""I think what we're doing is controlling some of the violence,"" he said. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

651,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/science/mass-killers-often-rely-on-past-perpetrators-blueprints.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Erica Goode and Benedict Carey As mass shootings have become ever more familiar, experts have come to understand them less as isolated expressions of rage and more as acts that build on the blueprints of previous rampages. Experts in violence prevention say that many, if not most, perpetrators of such shootings have intensively researched earlier mass attacks, often expressing admiration for those who carried them out. The publicity that surrounds these killings can have an accelerating effect on other troubled and angry would-be killers who are already heading toward violence, they say. The killing of nine people at an Oregon community college last week was a textbook example. Before opening fire, the gunman, Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, reportedly uploaded a video about the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The perpetrator of the Sandy Hook murders was himself a student of earlier shootings — in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado, where 13 people were killed, and in 2011 in Norway, where 77 people were killed. And three days after the Oregon shootings, the F.B.I. warned colleges and universities in Philadelphia of a threat posted on the same website used by Mr. Harper-Mercer. The potential for cultural contagion, many experts say, demands a public health response, one focused as much on early detection and preventive measures as on politically charged campaigns for firearm restrictions. But in some cases, efforts to identify and monitor potentially violent people can raise concerns about civil liberties. “You’re balancing public welfare and personal privacy,” said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist in San Diego who consults on threat assessment for schools and corporations. Some people have also suggested changes in the way the news media covers mass attacks. “If you blast the names and faces of shooters on news stations and constantly repeat their names, there may be an inadvertent process of creating a blueprint,” said Dr. Deborah Weisbrot, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Stony Brook University, who has interviewed hundreds of mostly teenage boys who have made threats. Experts emphasize that many factors, including mental health issues, may motivate a mass killer. But anyone interested in the mechanics of such killings can reconstruct them easily through a quick Internet search of news reports, websites and social media. One website lists rampage killings around the world. The gunman who killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012 had a fan club on Tumblr. “You’d have a hard time finding someone who didn’t do some research about those who went before,” said Robert A. Fein, a psychologist whose specialty is targeted violence and an author of a 2002 report by the Secret Service on school shootings. In a study of nine school shootings in Germany, Dr. Meloy and his colleagues found that a third of the killers had “consciously imitated and emulated what had happened in Columbine.” Other mass killers have visited Columbine or written online of their admiration for the two perpetrators there. A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. It is easy to see why Mr. Harper-Mercer might have identified with the Sandy Hook shooter. Both young men lived with their mothers, with whom they shared a passion for guns and even went to firing ranges to shoot. Mr. Harper-Mercer’s mother said he had Asperger’s syndrome; the Sandy Hook killer had received a similar diagnosis. “The more they identify with the characteristics of the story, the more it will increase their level of risk,” said J. Kevin Cameron, the director of the Canadian Center for Threat Assessment and Trauma Response, who has consulted on school shootings in the United States. At least one study suggests that mass killings, like teenage suicides, may “cluster,” with one highly covered case quickly followed by others. In a recent analysis of hundreds of killings from 1997 to 2013, researchers found that the probability of another attack was highest in the two weeks after a killing hit the news. Some in law enforcement have begun to suggest that the news media adopt standards in reporting about such events that are similar to guidelines in place for reporting on teenage suicides. Pete Blair, the director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, has started a campaign, endorsed by the F.B.I., called “Don’t Name Them” — a policy that Sheriff John Hanlin of Douglas County, Ore., asked the news media to follow in the Oregon case, with little success. Dr. Meloy said that it might be more important to avoid photographs and phrases like “lone wolf” that “convey a certain cool pose to young people.” This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. The New York Times ran a photograph of Mr. Harper-Mercer on its front page and featured it prominently online. Matthew Purdy, a deputy executive editor, said such images were not meant to glorify the perpetrators. “Our job is to explain and explore, and these images help to do that,” he said. Most mass killers “leak” their intentions, dropping hints in conversation or on social media. Mr. Harper-Mercer, for example, reportedly wrote in a blog post, “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.” Parents, teachers, classmates, friends and others are in the best position to pick up on these clues, but they often dismiss or ignore them. So “see something, say something” strategies, like those developed in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, can help encourage people to speak up, Dr. Meloy said. Equally important is breaking down barriers among local agencies — law enforcement and mental health departments, for example — and developing a system to monitor threats and determine if the people who made them are simply troubled or “on a path to violence,” experts in threat assessment said. Several localities have adopted broad and coordinated prevention measures. In Los Angeles County, law enforcement, the county mental health department and educational institutions share information and train staff members to recognize and report worrisome behavior. The county has intervened in numerous cases in which students had weapons and elaborate plans to use them, said Tony Beliz, a consultant to schools and corporations on violence prevention who for many years ran the mental health side of the effort. In the weeks immediately after a mass killing, they closely monitor young people they believe pose a risk. Frequently asked questions about gun policy and public opinion. After the Sandy Hook shootings, for example, they checked on a 16-year-old boy who liked bomb-making chemicals and who had told the county workers two years before, “I have to get rid of the bad people in this world.” They also called the mother of a teenager who was fascinated by weapons and killing, had access to firearms and had extensively researched school shootings. Yet such programs can sometimes collide with individual rights, especially when no crime has been committed. Dr. Beliz and other experts said that mental health professionals and educators were often reluctant to share information about students or clients who exhibited worrisome behavior, under the misapprehension that privacy laws prohibit such disclosures. Part of the task, they said, is to educate teachers, principals and therapists, explaining the provisions in the laws that allow information to be shared if public safety is involved. Dr. Beliz said there had been no school shootings in places where the Los Angeles program operated. But, he added, “unfortunately, some campuses and law enforcement agencies are still in this state of denial where they don’t believe it’s going to happen in their community.” The biggest obstacle experts may have to overcome, though, is the reluctance of people to recognize and report signs that someone they know might be dangerous. After Columbine, “we believed that the biggest problem we were going to deal with was overreaction to minor situations,” Mr. Cameron said. “But the biggest problem we still deal with is underreaction to often blatant indicators that someone is moving on a pathway to violence.” Advertisement",2015-10-07 05:00:23,Mass Killings Are Seen as a Kind of Contagion,,1,http://nytimes.com

The journalists on the Today show, Friday, touted how “emotional” Barack Obama became in his push for more gun control. In the wake of a mass shooting in Oregon, Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie cited statistics from liberal organizations and allowed no conservative, pro-Second Amendment voices to appear on the show. Matt Lauer recapped the President’s comments: “ An emotional President Obama spoke about the shootings. He challenged reporters to go back and tally up the number of Americans who died in terrorist attacks in the last decade versus the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence.”  Without any ideological label, Lauer recounted how a liberal website took up the President’s assignment: MATT LAUER: A reporter from Vox.com did just that, tweeting his findings to the President, revealing that from 2001 to 2011 more than 10,000 Americans were killed each year by gun violence compared with the few hundred killed each year by terrorist attacks with the notable exception of 9/11. Guthrie promoted the group Everytown for Gun Safety. She neutrally referred to it as simply “a group whose mission it is to reduce gun violence.” In fact, it’s a Michael Bloomberg-created pro-gun control organization. According to journalist Peter Alexander, Obama “delivered [his remarks] with unprecedented emotion.” Later, Chuck Todd lobbied the President to take up the cause, saying, “ It's not just us in the media. He probably has to go grab this and campaign around the country around as if he wants to refocus Washington on this issue.” It’s not just us in the media? The only time any hint of opposition came was at the end of Alexander’s news report. The journalist quickly cited Mike Huckabee: PETER ALEXANDER: Mike Huckabee, running for president, blasted President Obama calling his comments shameless and ""ignorantly inflammatory, adding that the President in his words can exploit any tragedy that he wants, but it's clear that gun-free zones,"" Huckabee said, ""are sitting duck zones."" Of course, Today failed to actually bring anti-gun control voices to the show. In 2012, in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado mass shooting, journalists rushed to push gun control. According to the Media Research Center’s Geoffrey Dickens, “Stories advocating gun control outnumbered those in favor of gun rights by a 10 to 1 ratio.” Partial transcripts of the October 2 segment are below:  7:32 SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: Some numbers really put this into perspective. There have been 41 school shootings this year alone. That’s according to Every Town. That’s a group whose mission it is to reduce gun violence that. That group also reports that this is the 142nd school shooting since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School back in December 2012. MATT LAUER: This morning’s Daily News, New York Daily News, puts the number of shooting deaths since that tragedy at more than 87,000. As we reported on Thursday, an emotional President Obama spoke about the shootings. He challenged reporters to go back and tally up the number of Americans who died in terrorist attacks in the last decade versus the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence. A reporter from Vox.com did just that, tweeting his findings to the President, revealing that from 2001 to 2011 more than 10,000 Americans were killed each year by gun violence compared with the few hundred killed each year by terrorist attacks with the notable exception of 9/11. ... MATT LAUER: Chuck Todd is moderator of Meet the Press, as well as NBC's political director. Chuck, good morning to you. The President in his remarks yesterday at the White House said this has become routine. We are all numb to this. Take me inside the atmosphere in Washington. It seems to me there is a short-term reaction to these incidents and a longer term reality. CHUCK TODD: No, there is, and it is a routine reaction. So what you have is you have folks on the left who want more gun control. They say similar things to what the President did. On the right those who are — don't — who believe that it isn't a gun control issue say, “oh, let's focus on mental health” and then it does this for about 48 hours and then everybody moves on because the fact of the matter is you have a whole bunch of political leaders, who don't want to deal with the politics of this, who are afraid of the NRA who the President mentioned and not by name. And the President himself succumbed to gun politics in his first term. It is interesting to note that he has —  and I think Sandy Hook absolutely sort of changed him on this, but he's succumbed to the politics of this in the first term. He avoided the gun issue and when Eric Holder, the then-attorney general, wanted to pursue an assault weapons ban, he got slapped down by the White House in the first term, because they were afraid of the politics of this. So the President is not alone on this front, and he's also — when he lectures everybody, he probably has to look in the mirror, too. And I think that he does regret not pushing this now in hindsight, so I guess my question is going to be what is he going to do in the next week or two? Does he throw down the gauntlet? He did so after Sandy Hook. He sounded like a guy who was going to do that. But that's what it's going to take. It's not just us in the media. He probably has to go grab this and campaign around the country around as if he wants to refocus Washington on this issue.

654,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/02/chris-harper-mercer-first-details-emerge-of-oregon-college-killer,"Umpqua college shooter, who was born in England according to media reports, had a varied online presence that indicated support for the IRA First published on Fri 2 Oct 2015 04.57 BST The Umpqua shooter has been named as Chris Harper Mercer, a 26-year-old who lived with his mother at an apartment only a few miles from the college. American media reports said he was born in England and moved to the US at a young age: his stepsister, Carmen Nesnick, told CBS Los Angeles that he travelled to the US as a young boy. Other accounts report that Nesnick specified that Harper-Mercer was born in England.  Harper-Mercer was the son of Ian Mercer and Laurel Margaret Harper. Mercer and Harper filed for divorce on 6 June 2006. He appears to have left an online footprint that hints at interest in mass shootings as well as apparent support for the IRA. He also appears to have been a prolific user of the file-sharing system Bittorrent. An email address, “ironcross45@gmail.com”, was found to be associated with a Chris Harper Mercer of Winchester, Oregon, via a public records search. That address is linked to an account on the torrent upload site kat-ph.proxy-x.com, which bears the username “Lithium_Love”. The final video uploaded by Lithium_Love to the torrent site, just three days ago, was a BBC documentary called Surviving Sandy Hook about the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. Other uploads include PDFs of the occult magazine Phenomena, conspiracy-themed documentaries including Lost Secrets of the Illuminati, and assorted soft pornography. There is also a blog attached to the upload account. The first entry was posted on 6 July 2015 and is titled “The material world is a lie.” It says: “Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone ... I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. “Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery. This is my first blog post, there will be more to come.” Other blogposts complain about the uploading habits of other users. Another bemoans the death of horror filmmaker Wes Craven. A Myspace page bearing Mercer’s name is filled with pictures of masked gunmen and references to the IRA, including a picture of the front page of a the Irish republican newspaper An Phoblacht, bearing the headline “British Army Could Not Defeat IRA”. Another photo to the page carries the words “IRA undefeated army”. The page gives Mercer’s home location as Torrance, California. A Whitepages page – which tracks addresses and phone numbers – gives two addresses for Mercer: one in Torrance, California, and the other in Winchester, Oregon. The latter is also the address associated with the registration of the “ironcross45” email address. Using that email address, Mercer also appears to have advertised for penpals on the website Morgue Pals, which describes itself as “the hippest place for pen pals who identify with any sort of alternative culture”. In his advertisement, Mercer, then aged 20, said he was looking for email pals and described his hobbies as “music movies and news”. In his profile, he described himself as: “I’m 20 years old, in college, I like to listen to music, mostly goth/punk/industrial/electronic, and I love to watch movies, Horror movies are the best, but i also like some action films, depending on the type, and I like crime dramas as well.“ He added: “I’m looking for penpals who are similar to me, but anyone is welcome to email me.” A posting on the Spiritual Passions dating and social networking site uses a picture that appears to be Mercer under the user name IRONCROSS45, which Mercer also used as his email. He described himself on the site as a 26-year-old, mixed-race “man looking for a woman”. He said he was “not religious, but spiritual”, and was a “teetotaler” living with his parents and a conservative Republican. Socially, he said, he was “shy at first” and “better in small groups”. He described himself as “always dieting” and looking for “the yin to my yang”. The email address Ironcross45@gmail.com is also associated with a crowdfunding webpage to help the user pay for uploading and storing bittorrent files for downloading videos as well. According to the cached version of the webpage, the most recent video uploaded was Collection Of Hot Lesbians (Nudes) Vol. 8. Two phone numbers associated with the name appeared to have been disconnected. A profile on the site belonging to Mercer on the website Spiritual Singles, which advertises itself as “a free online dating & social networking site specifically for spiritual singles,” and bears a picture of the same person as Mercer’s Myspace page, the alleged killer describes himself politically as a “conservative, republican” whose hobbies are “internet, killing zombies, movies, music, reading” and who lives with parents.  In the profile, the personality type he is looking for is “intellectual, punk, introvert, loner, lover, geek, nerd” with an “individuality” of “piercings, psychic, tattoos, vampire”. His preferred religious views are “Pagan, Wiccan, Not Religious, but Spiritual” as well. On the image-sharing message-board 4chan, rumours were flying on Thursday night that the killer may have been one of their own. In an anonymous post at 1:19am on Thursday morning on the /r9k board – all posts to 4chan are anonymous – someone said “Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest.” There is no way of verifying that the post came from the shooter. A spokesperson for the Douglas County sheriff’s department, which is handling the investigation, said it could “neither confirm nor deny” at this point that they were investigating the post, though federal officials reportedly told the New York Times that they were doing so. It is not known if Mercer was affiliated with the college, but his name was listed as a production assistant for an upcoming production of the Noel Coward play Blithe Spirit at Umpqua. The gunman’s father, Ian Mercer, said he was “just as shocked as everybody” at his son’s actions. Speaking from his home in the US, he told reporters: “I’ve just been talking to the police and the FBI and all the details I have right now is what you guys [reporters] have already. “I can’t answer any questions right now, I don’t want to answer any questions right now. It’s been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family. Shocked is all I can say.”",2015-10-02 07:47:58,Chris Harper Mercer: details emerge of Oregon college killer,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
655,https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/obama-were-going-have-change-our-gun-laws-and-not-something-i-can-do-myself,"(CNSNews.com) - Without offering any specifics, a grim President Obama on Thursday insisted that Americans can ""actually do something"" to prevent the kind of mass shooting that took place at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon.""And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up,"" Obama said. ""Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.""  A 26-year-old man, reportedly hoping for notoriety, shot and killed nine people and wounded seven others, some critically, before officers shot and killed him on the rural campus of Umpqua Community College.""Our thoughts and prayers"" for the victims are not enough, President Obama said late Thursday afternoon.""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.""When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.""So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn't make sense.""The president did not explain what he means by ""modest regulation."" But it should be noted that as of August, Oregon has a law requiring universal background checks, something Obama is known to support.Obama on Thursday asked the American people ""to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.""The president also blasted ""those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation.""""Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?"" he asked, insisting that polls indicate ""the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.""He also took a swipe at the National Rifle Association, which advocates lawful, responsible gun ownership, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution:""And I would particularly ask America's gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you.""Following the on-air murder of a young television reporter and her cameraman in Roanoke, Va. in August, the NRA noted that none of the legislation being pushed by gun control advocates would have stopped the Roanoke gunman from doing what he did.""For decades, the National Rifle Association has been calling for meaningful mental health reform, so those suffering from mental illness who are found to be a danger to themselves or others will not have legal access to firearms,"" wrote Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, in a September 9, 2015 op-ed in the Washington Times.""If anti-gun politicians were really interested in solving problems instead of using tragedy to push a political agenda, they would have to work to address the underlying problem,"" he said. In his ""Talking Points Memo"" Thursday night, Fox News's Bill O'Reilly also expressed the view that no legislation can stop someone bent on violence. ""As a journalist it pains me to report stories like t his,"" O'Reilly said, listing some of the nation's worst mass shootings. ""There's no rational explanation for all the carnage, none. And no public policy will stop it. We are living in a very dangerous time, when deranged human beings feel murder is an entitlement.""  Later, directly addressing President Obama, O'Reilly criticized the president for politicizing high-profile mass shootings such as the one in Oregon while ignoring the carnage taking place in Chicago -- Obama's home state. ""You're not going to change the Second Amendment. I have a right to protect myself, all right, because there are crazed animals like the guy in Oregon. There are people like that who will come after innocent people for no reason. ""And you're going to deny me protection, if I live out in a rural area, like Douglas County, Oregon, where the nearest cop is 40 miles away? I can't have a gun in the house to protect my family? Come on!"" O'Reilly suggested making all gun crimes federal crimes with mandatory minimum sentences. ""That will cut down on gun crime right away. But it'll never stop the individual nuts -- ever!""

656,http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13794219/there-no-room-that,"ESPN Cavaliers reporter Dave McMenamin explains why LeBron James chose to speak out about the death of 5-month-old Aavielle Wakefield. (5:25) INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- With the country reeling from a mass shooting in Oregon, LeBron James focused on the death of a 5-month-old girl, Aavielle Wakefield, who was shot in the chest on Thursday during a drive-by shooting in Cleveland as another example of gun violence run amok. Like seriously man!!!! A baby shot in the chest in Cleveland. It's been out of control but it's really OOC. Ya'll need to chill the F out. C'mon man let's do and be better!  Don't fall into the trap. This can't be only way. Accept more from yourselves. #TheLand #TheNation James was asked about what prompted him to take to Twitter to bring light to Wakefield's story and speak out against the societal pitfalls behind her death after Cavs practice Friday. ""It's the quickest way to get my voice out there, first of all, social media. Obviously it's not the first time that it's happened, but it's been happening a little bit too much recently,"" James said. ""I think it happened like in the last four weeks, four kids under the age of 5 or 6 years old have been shot and killed or very badly injured or whatever. It's just, there's no room for that."" Wakefield was the third child in the Cleveland area gunned down in a drive-by shooting since early September, according to Cleveland.com. Five-year-old Ramon Burnett and 3-year-old Major Howard also lost their lives. James showed a similar social consciousness last season, commenting on the deaths of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, while also donning an ""I can't breathe"" T-shirt before playing a game in Brooklyn to show solidarity with supporters of Eric Garner, another African-American man who was killed during a confrontation with police. While James' messages last season were mostly centered on peace, part of his words on Friday were aimed at public policy. Specifically, James called for greater gun control laws in the U.S. ""I know what I see. I know how I feel,"" James said. ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out, I don't know how you can do that. There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big-time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves."" James said he did not see President Obama's gun control-themed speech following the tragedy at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Thursday, when a lone gunman killed nine people and wounded nine others before dying in a gun battle with local police. ""There's no room for guns, first of all, but then for violence towards kids or anybody,"" James said. ""But, having kids of your own, I see the news go across my phone and I'm sitting there in front of my three kids, so it automatically just hit me. Just getting my voice out there and letting a lot of people know, it's not just in Cleveland. If you seen my message I also hash-tagged '#TheNation' as well, so it's also the whole nation that goes through this as well. We all hurt from it."" He was then asked whether he would develop a program through his LeBron James Family Foundation to specifically address gun violence in the Northeast Ohio community. ""Maybe,"" James said. ""I'm using my voice through social media and that's what I always do when something goes on that I feel like it's important. I will speak upon it. ""My foundation is doing some [good work]. We're kind of focused on something right now, don't want to veer off on that, obviously you guys know the education program we're going through right now. Part of the education program we're doing is keeping those kids off the street and keeping their situations that [are] maybe bad and turning them into good."" James explained that his foundation is focusing on preventative measures -- providing a positive influence to children and teaching them life skills to grow into successful adults -- rather than reactionary efforts after a tragedy has occurred. ""I think what we're doing is controlling some of the violence,"" James said. ""Some of these kids might be in violent situations, violent areas or violent homes and we're trying to keep them away from that by having that program that I've set up through my foundation, through the University of Akron, through the Akron Public School system and so on and so on. I feel like if we can do our part, through my foundation and what we do, then maybe it can possibly bring the number of percentages [of at-risk youth] down from, I don't know, 20 percent to 15 to 10. Hopefully we'll continue to do that.""",2015-10-02 16:37:09,LeBron on gun violence: &apos;No room for that&apos;,,4451,http://espn.go.com/
657,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/08/america-s-mass-shooting-capital-is-chicago.html,"SEARCH People living in Chiraq’s worst neighborhoods are more likely to be killed than citizens of the world’s leading murder capitals. CHICAGO — Four men and two women were shot on April 5 last year, then five weeks later a 15-year-old boy and two men were shot. Another 15-year-old boy and two men were shot in July. Three men were shot on August 21. Three men and a 73-year-old woman were shot in September. Again in September, two boys ages 12 and 16 were shot along with an 18-year-old man. Two women and one man were shot on that same block on Nov. 19. These mass shootings didn’t happen in Roseburg, Lafayette, Charleston, or Chattanooga but in Chicago’s worst neighborhoods, where—by one measure—it is more dangerous to live than the world’s most-murderous countries. West Garfield Park, population 18,000, had 21 murders last year, which makes for a homicide rate of 116 per 100,000 people. The world’s leader in murders, Honduras, has a homicide rate of 90, according to the United Nations. Following West Garfield Park in lethality was West Englewood and its 73.3 murder rate, more than second-place Venezuela with its 53.7 rate. Chicago’s Chatham (58) beats Belize (44.7); Englewood (52.6) outdoes El Salvador (41.2); South Chicago (48) tops Guatemala (39.9). The United States as a whole has 4.5 murders per 100,000. Chicago’s 411 homicides don’t look like a lot compared the city’s 2.7 million residents, but that’s the misleading part of this grim numbers game: Determining a city’s level of violence by looking at its overall per capita rate doesn’t tell you shit if you don’t examine numbers in the hood. And West Garfield Park is certainly that. The neighborhood has an average annual income of just more than $10,000; 40 percent of households live below the poverty line. West Garfield Park ranks near the top of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods on the city’s “hardship index,” which is calculated by taking into account those living in crowded housing, and unemployment rates among teens and adults, among other factors. The higher the number, the more difficult life will be, according to the statisticians. West Garfield Park and its 96 percent black residents scores 92 on the hardship index. Many of those killed last year in West Garfield Park were men in their twenties. But there were others whose deaths are perhaps less dismissable. Shamiya Adams, an 11-year-old killed by a bullet to the head as she sat in a friends bedroom making s’mores, could be one. Or 21-year-old Shambreyh Barfield, killed by gunfire intended for someone else as she sat on her front porch with a friend, might be one to pick out as a particularly tragic death. And for every person killed by gunfire in Chicago, another four are shot and survive. Last year the city had more than 2,000 shootings and has surpassed that total in 2015. West Garfield Park’s per capita shooting rate was a staggering 411 per 100,000 people, followed closely behind by West Englewood’s 391.5. The media and politicians don’t really care about that though. The new “epidemic” is mass shootings, they say, just a few months removed from the previous epidemic of police killings. Those clamoring for change in the wake of another unexpected gun massacre are right: Mass shootings are a problem—in Chicago. The city saw 107 mass shootings last year, defined as having three or more victims. As of July 25 of this year, there have been 192 mass shootings, according to the Chicago Tribune. When a crazed gunman shoots up innocents on a tree-lined campus in a sleepy Oregon town, calls to action are loud and forceful. But when six people are shot in the 4300 block of West Wilcox in Chicago—as they were last year—there is silence. It can be hard for readers to keep up—let alone for people to contemplate—the daily massacres on Chicago’s streets. Just last week, a grandmother, her pregnant daughter, and the woman’s 11-month-old son were shot in a drive-by in Chicago’s Back of the Yards neighborhood. The child lived; his mother and grandmother did not. “You would think that the attention would be tremendous, but it really wasn’t,” Pastor Corey Brooks said. While he was surprised to hear that some Chicago neighborhoods near his own trumped per capita murder rates of violent South American countries, Brooks wasn’t that surprised. “We keep telling people about the magnitude and seriousness of the issue, but we’re obviously not getting people to hear the message,” the anti-violence pastor and rare black Republican said. “I think what’s going on is it’s expected, that people think it’s a way of life on the South Side of Chicago. And people have been desensitized.” With 6,000 shootings since 2012, perhaps that’s to be expected. *** It should be obvious why there are so many shootings in Chicago: guns. An illegal gun is recovered every 75 minutes by Chicago police, they say. Mississippi sent 4,000 illegal guns to Chicago in the last decade. Nineteen percent of guns seized by police between 2009 and 2013 came from Indiana, which does not require background checks for firearm purchases online or at gun shows. Straw purchasers buy up the guns, take a short drive over the state line, and sell them on the streets. The city may have strict gun laws—less strict than gun nuts would claim—but they’re doing next to nothing to stem the tide of illegal guns from states with weak gun laws. The Chicago Police Department does not break down homicides and shootings by neighborhood. Instead, The Daily Beast compiled the figures on West Garfield Park and West Englewood based on publicly available data and the help of a private, anonymous citizen who runs a Chicago crime website. Furthermore, there is no way to compare the neighborhood shooting rates to those at the national level, because there is no national shooting data. The best the feds can do to keep up with the hail of bullets is to estimate how many people get shot based on how many are admitted to the hospital each year with non-fatal gunshot wounds, which can be from suicides, accidents, or attempted homicides. An uptick in shootings and homicides this year is one of the reasons the Chicago City Council’s Black Caucus called for Superintendent Garry McCarthy’s head on Monday. Lorenzo Davis, a former Chicago police commander who went on to blow the whistle against his former department over whitewashed police shootings, is quick to criticize McCarthy and the force. Guns are a massive problem, Davis said, but so is the lack of black cops and officials in the department, which doesn’t help relations with the community. Complacency among police and prosecutors, reduced manpower, unwillingness on the part of victims and witnesses to identify suspects—all lead to a street culture that often results in killers going free. “When I was a police commander there were a handful of guys who killed five or six people,” Davis said. “They would kill someone, then they would kill the witnesses.” Jedidiah Brown, a pastor who works to mediate conflicts between gang members and others who often look to settle scores with shots fired, said guns are part of broader issues within street culture. “We have civilization and we have education, but we also have a Wild West mentality,” said Brown. Brown isn’t alone. Tio Hardiman, president of the Violence Interrupters, regularly works in West Garfield Park to prevent minor beefs from turning into mass shootings. Hardiman says he has personally saved eight lives in the past few years. “A lot of people talk a lot of good talk, but the only way to stop the killing is, you have to know the killer,” Hardiman explained. “You have to have a relationship with the killer to stop them at that moment in their life.” That means having deep roots in the streets. Hardiman doesn’t work with police, who distrusted by many in West Garfield Park and other majority black neighborhoods. “Our job is to prevent retaliation and stop it on the front end,” he said. Hardiman’s corps include some men in their twenties, others nearing 60. Too much contact with the police and “they’d lose their street credibility,” he said. “We cannot be satisfied with people’s lives being taken prematurely, especially when you’re dealing with a lot of children,” said Brooks, the South Side pastor, and drove home the point: “These are children that are killing one another.” Street connections are key to resolving disputes and preventing more deaths and shootings—a never-ending job in West Garfield Park and elsewhere. That’s because the nature of gun violence has changed drastically since the crack-fueled gang turf wars of the late ’80s and early ’90s. Even in those violent years, when annual homicides approached and passed 1,000, there was a sense of order, Askari Ali said. Hierarchical gang structures provided guidance—and rules. Now, chaos reigns. “Back in the day, what you did, it was accounted for,” said Ali, a community organizer who was born and raised in Chicago’s violent Austin neighborhood. “If we used to see on the news that you shot a pregnant woman or a kid back in those days, a gang would come and get you.” A self-described black nationalist, Ali works from the street level up—eschewing affiliation with groups like the Nation of Islam and others who attach a religious or political agenda to anti-violence efforts. The more-structured gang culture of the ’80s and ’90s “would make a young person more conscious of what they were doing,” Ali told The Daily Beast. “Now, if you go shoot up a McDonald’s and a child dies, nine times out of 10 people are gonna say, ‘You a savage, you go hard.’” The impact of so many people being killed along with their counterparts who live through shootings seems impossible to determine. “You can do the numbers and discover that murder is big business, and that murders are driving up a lot of costs,” said Brooks, the South Side pastor. “But what they’re not paying attention to is the trauma that families are experiencing, that children are experiencing. These children are growing up in war-like conditions.” The constant violence creates an atmosphere of fear and lack of self-respect; both Ali and Hardiman refer to the phenomenon as “self-hatred.” “A lot of the young guys will tell you, ‘Well, I don’t like him because he lives on different block,’” said Hardiman. “And when you ask why, the answer is, ‘I just don’t like him.’” This adds to the chaos, according to Hardiman. “They’re killing babies, shooting mothers, shooting kids… The mentality is, ‘If I don’t like myself there’s no way I’m gonna like you.’” Askari Ali puts it more bluntly. “They don’t appreciate life because they feel like their life not shit,” said the 26-year-old of kids coming up now. “So they got no problem taking your life.” Both Hardiman and Ali suggested a slew of fixes for the systemic violence plaguing their communities, which neighbor one another on the city’s West Side: jobs programs, community centers, intervention from people who can speak the same language as the 13- and 14-year-olds with no hope and easy access to guns, drugs, and street life. “A lot of these young people, all they have is their respect. They have nothing else,” said Davis. “And if someone disrespects them, they settle the score with guns.”",2015-10-08 01:00:00,America’s Mass-Shooting Capital Is Chicago,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
658,http://www.factcheck.org/2015/10/gun-laws-deaths-and-crimes/,"By Lori Robertson Posted on October 4, 2015 President Barack Obama claimed that “states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.” Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, meanwhile, has made nearly the opposite claim, saying states with stringent gun control laws have “the highest gun crime rates in the nation.” In looking solely at the numbers of gun deaths and gun crimes, the data back up Obama, not Fiorina. But both politicians imply a causation that’s impossible to prove — that gun control laws lead to fewer or greater gun crimes or gun deaths. Obama talked about gun deaths, while Fiorina said “gun crime rates,” which could include aggravated assault and robberies. Let’s start with gun deaths. The president made his comments on Oct. 1 after a mass shooting that day at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, left 10 people dead, including the shooter. Obama, Oct. 1: We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don’t work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals [to] still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes statistics on firearm deaths and the death rate, which would be a fairer measure in comparing states of various populations. The death rate is the number of deaths per 100,000 people. The CDC also gives age-adjusted death rates, since such rates are influenced by the age of the population. This levels the comparison between different groups. For 2013, the 10 states with the highest firearm age-adjusted death rates were: Alaska (19.8), Louisiana (19.3), Mississippi (17.8), Alabama (17.6), Arkansas (16.8), Wyoming (16.7), Montana (16.7), Oklahoma (16.5), New Mexico (15.5) and Tennessee (15.4). The 10 states with the lowest firearm age-adjusted death rates were, starting with the lowest: Hawaii (2.6), Massachusetts (3.1), New York (4.2), Connecticut (4.4), Rhode Island (5.3), New Jersey (5.7), New Hampshire (6.4), Minnesota (7.6), California (7.7) and Iowa (8.0). Firearm deaths, however, include suicides, and there are a lot of them. In 2013, there were a total of 33,636 firearm deaths, and 21,175, or 63 percent, were suicides, according to the CDC. Homicides made up 11,208, or 33 percent, of those firearm deaths. The rest were unintentional discharges (505), legal intervention/war (467) and undetermined (281). Homicide data for 2013 don’t give us a clear picture of homicides only by firearm; however, 70 percent of homicides for the year were by firearm. The 10 states with the highest homicide rates were: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, New Mexico, Missouri and Michigan. That lists includes six states that also have the highest firearm death rates. The 10 states with the lowest homicide rates are: North Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Utah, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon. The number of homicides that occurred in the first three states were so low that their death rates were zero. Wyoming is an interesting case, because it has one of the highest firearm death rates but a homicide rate of zero. What role do gun control laws play in these statistics? It’s difficult to say. One news report that compiled these same CDC numbers on firearm death rates, by 24/7 Wall Street and published by USA Today, listed several reasons besides gun laws that these states might have high rates of gun deaths (suicides included). Many of the states also have higher rates of poverty, lower educational attainment and perhaps more rural areas that make getting to a hospital in time to save someone’s life difficult. But that report also noted weaker gun laws were common among the states with higher gun death rates: “In fact, none of the states with the most gun violence require permits to purchase rifles, shotguns, or handguns. Gun owners are also not required to register their weapons in any of these states. Meanwhile, many of the states with the least gun violence require a permit or other form of identification to buy a gun,” reporter Thomas C. Frohlich wrote. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, both groups that advocate for strong gun laws, published a scorecard on state gun laws in 2013, giving higher letter grades to states with stronger gun laws. Nine of the 10 states with the highest firearm death rates, according to the CDC, got an “F” for their gun laws, and one of them got a “D-.” (Note that most states — 26 of them — received an “F.”) Seven of the states with the lowest firearm death rates got a “B” or higher; two received a “C” or “C-“; and one — New Hampshire — got a “D-.” But again, that’s a correlation, not a causation. And the homicide rate statistics don’t show the same pattern. Eight of the 10 states with the highest homicide rates and eight of the 10 states with the lowest homicide rates all got “D” or “F” grades from the Brady Campaign analysis. We have written before about gun control issues, and the inability to determine causation between gun laws and gun violence. As Susan B. Sorenson, a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in 2012, “We really don’t have answers to a lot of the questions that we should have answers to.” And that’s partly because a scientific random study — in which one group of people had guns or permissive gun laws, and another group didn’t — isn’t possible. When we asked the White House about Obama’s claim, a spokesman sent us links to other studies that found states with more gun restrictions had fewer gun deaths, backing up Obama’s claim that “states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.” But it doesn’t back up his claim that “the evidence” shows there is a link between the gun deaths and gun laws. Researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health looked at gun laws and gun deaths in all 50 states from 2007 to 2010, concluding that: “A higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state, overall and for suicides and homicides individually.” Their research was published in JAMA Internal Medicine in May 2013. But the study said that it couldn’t determine cause-and-effect. One of the authors, Dr. Eric Fleegler, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Boston Children’s Hospital, told the Boston Globe that “[i]n states with the most laws, we found a dramatic decreased rate in firearm fatalities, though we can’t say for certain that these laws have led to fewer deaths.” Fiorina made her claim on Sept. 24 in a speech in Greenville, South Carolina, when asked about her views on guns (see the 43:40 mark). She said that the gun laws currently on the books aren’t enforced. “That is why you see in state after state after state with some of the most stringent gun control laws in the nation also having the highest gun crime rates in the nation. Chicago would be an example,” she said. We asked the Fiorina campaign for support for that claim, and to clarify whether she meant states or cities, since she mentioned Chicago. We have not received a response, but we will update this article if we do. Fiorina said “gun crime rates,” not just “gun deaths,” as the president claimed. The FBI has statistics on violent crimes committed with a firearm, including murder, robbery and aggravated assault, though its data come from voluntary reporting from law enforcement agencies. When we last researched firearm deaths, experts advised us to use the CDC data, since it came from required death-certificate reporting. But what about robberies with a firearm, or aggravated assaults? We calculated firearm robbery rates for the states, using the FBI data for 2014, and the states with the highest rates are Nevada, Mississippi, Georgia, Maryland and Louisiana. Four out of five of those states received an “F” from the groups that advocate tougher gun laws. (We discounted Illinois, which reported limited data to the FBI.) We then did the same rate calculation for aggravated assaults with a firearm in 2014. The top five states: Tennessee, South Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Delaware. The last state was the only one not to receive an “F.” As for Chicago, the Pew Research Center published a report in 2014 that found that while Chicago had seen a lot of murders in raw numbers, smaller cities had a higher rate, adjusted for population. Using FBI data — with the caveat that it is reported by local police agencies and not always consistently — the Pew Research Center determined that the top cities in 2012 for the murder rate were Flint, Michigan; Detroit; New Orleans; and Jackson, Mississippi. Chicago came in 21st. An August 2013 CDC report looked at rates for gun homicides in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas. It found that for 2009-2010, the top gun murder rate areas were, in order: New Orleans, Memphis, Detroit, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Six of those cities are in states with poor scores for their gun laws, while the other four get a “C” or better. Chicago, which placed last in the top 10, had a ban on handguns at the time. There’s no discernible pattern among those cities, nor clear or convincing evidence in these statistics that shows more gun laws lead to more or less gun crime. — Lori Robertson Q: Can employers, colleges and universities require COVID-19 vaccinations?

So we know there are ways to prevent it.” “Australia” is Obama’s preferred euphemism for that most cherished of gun-control ideals: mass confiscation of the citizenry’s weapons. You will notice that the president doesn’t exactly spell out what following Australia’s model would entail. He speaks instead of “commonsense gun-control legislation,” “closing the gun-show loophole,” and “universal background checks.”
In the last 24 hours, New York magazine, CNN, and NBC have also sung the virtues of the Australian model.
But the Australian 1996 National Agreement on Firearms was not a benign set of commonsense gun-control rules: It was a gun-confiscation program rushed through the Australian parliament just twelve days after a 28-year-old man killed 35 people with a semi-automatic rifle in the Tasmanian city of Port Arthur. The Council of Foreign relations summarizes the Aussie measure nicely:

The National Agreement on Firearms all but prohibited automatic and semiautomatic assault rifles, stiffened licensing and ownership rules, and instituted a temporary gun buyback program that took some 650,000 assault weapons (about one-sixth of the national stock) out of public circulation. Among other things, the law also required licensees to demonstrate a “genuine need” for a particular type of gun and take a firearm safety course.

Among other things, the law also required licensees to demonstrate a “genuine need” for a particular type of gun and take a firearm safety course. The council’s laudatory section on Australian gun-control policy concludes that “many [read: gun-control activists] suggest the policy response in the wake of Port Arthur could serve as a model for the United States.” Two questions should be asked and answered: (1) Did the post–Port Arthur laws lead to a clear reduction of gun violence, and (2) What would an American version of the “Australian model” look like? Gun-control activists claim that the Australian model directly resulted in a pronounced fall in the gun-suicide rate and the gun-homicide rate. But these claims are disputable. In August, Vox’s German Lopez wrote a piece that included a chart attempting to show a causal relationship between the Australian gun-confiscation regime and a reduction in the Australian suicide rate. “When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides,” Lopez wrote. I noted at the time that: While the chart does show a steady decline in gun-related suicides, the reduction occurred at the same time as an overall reduction in the Australian suicide rate. What’s more, firearm-related suicides had been declining in Australia for nearly ten years before the 1996 restrictions on gun ownership. Vox’s own chart does not appear to show a causal link between gun control and a reduction in suicide rates in Australia.  Moreover, a look at other developed countries with very strict gun-control laws (such as Japan and South Korea) shows that the lack of guns does not lead to a reduced suicide rate. Unfortunately, people who want to kill themselves often find a way to do so — guns or no guns. Did the Australian model at least reduce gun-related homicides? That is hotly disputed. University of Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi concluded their 2008 report on the matter with the statement, “There is little evidence to suggest that [the Australian mandatory gun-buyback program] had any significant effects on firearm homicides.” “Although gun buybacks appear to be a logical and sensible policy that helps to placate the public’s fears,” the reported continued, “the evidence so far suggests that in the Australian context, the high expenditure incurred to fund the 1996 gun buyback has not translated into any tangible reductions in terms of firearm deaths.” A 2007 report, “Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?” by Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran similarly concluded that the buyback program did not have a significant long-term effect on the Australian homicide rate. The Australian gun-homicide rate had already been quite low and had been steadily falling in the 15 years prior to the Port Arthur massacre. And while the mandatory buyback program did appear to reduce the rate of accidental firearm deaths, Baker and McPhedran found that “the gun buy-back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia.” Would an American version of the “Australian model” perform any better? #related#In all likelihood it would fare worse. The Federalist’s Varad Mehta set down the facts in June: Gun confiscation is not happening in the United States any time soon. But let’s suppose it did. How would it work? Australia’s program netted, at the low end, 650,000 guns, and at the high end, a million. That was approximately a fifth to a third of Australian firearms. There are about as many guns in America as there are people: 310 million of both in 2009. A fifth to a third would be between 60 and 105 million guns. To achieve in America what was done in Australia, in other words, the government would have to confiscate as many as 105 million firearms.  And an American mandatory gun-confiscation program — in addition to being unconstitutional — would be extraordinarily coercive, and perhaps even violent. There is no other way around it: The mandatory confiscation of the American citizenry’s guns would involve tens of thousands of heavily armed federal agents going door-to-door to demand of millions of Americans that they surrender their guns. That. Is. Not. Going. To. Happen. If the president and gun-control activists want to keep saying “Australia” in response to every shooting in America, they should at least be honest about what exactly they are proposing. —Mark Antonio Wright is an assistant editor at National Review.

661,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/chris-harper-mercer-umpqua-community-college-shooting.html?smid=pl-share,"Advertisement Supported by transcript N/A By Jack Healy and Ian Lovett ROSEBURG, Ore. — Christopher Harper-Mercer was withdrawn and quiet as he grew up in southern California, spending most of his time indoors at his mother’s apartment and deflecting neighbors when they asked him how he was doing, or why he always wore the same outfit of combat boots and green Army pants. But there was one subject that got him to open up: guns. Mr. Harper-Mercer collected handguns and rifles, and he regularly went to a shooting range with his mother, said neighbors in Torrance, Calif., where the two lived until moving to Oregon in 2013. At a barbecue shortly before they left, Mr. Harper-Mercer spent hours talking with a next-door neighbor about guns and how he and his mother were excited to leave Los Angeles and get a fresh start. “When we talked about guns and hunting, he was real open about it,” said the neighbor, Louie Flores, 32. “But anything about what was going on in his life, he really didn’t say too much at all.” But two years after that fresh start, the authorities say, Mr. Harper-Mercer, 26, carried out the worst shooting rampage in this state’s history at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning, killing nine people in the writing class where he was enrolled and wounding others. He was armed with six guns, a flak jacket and spare ammunition magazines, suggesting he expected a long siege. He had seven more guns at his apartment, officials said. For investigators searching for his path to mass murder, he left behind a typewritten manifesto at the scene and a string of online postings that showed he had become increasingly interested in other high-profile shootings, angry at not having a girlfriend and bitter at a world that he believed was working against him. Mr. Harper-Mercer appeared to have a particular animus against organized religion, and some survivors’ families have said he asked the victims whether they were Christians before shooting them. Just this week, on Tuesday, using the handle lithium_love, he commented on a post titled “How many girlfriends have you had?” by saying “0. Never had anyone.” When pressed further by another user, he responded “Well, it means I’ve never been with anyone, no woman nor man (nor dog or animal or any other).” Then, on Wednesday, responding to a comment that he “must be saving himself for someone special,” he said, “Involuntarily so.” It was a day before the killings. “He did not like his lot in life, and it seemed like nothing was going right for him,” a law enforcement official said, describing the writings found at the crime scene. “It’s clear he was in a very bad state of mind.” He retreated to online message boards to express his thoughts about commercialism, other shootings and the infamy that accompanied the gunmen who carried them out. On a blog post linked to Mr. Harper-Mercer’s email address, an Aug. 31 entry expresses sympathy for Vester Lee Flanagan II, a dismissed television reporter who killed two former colleagues during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Va.: “I have noticed that people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are.” The entry continues, “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.” After his parents divorced when he was about 16, he lived with his mother, Laurel Harper, a nurse who fiercely protected him from, among other things, the neighborhood sounds of loud children and barking dogs. Once, neighbors said, she went door to door with a petition to get the landlord to exterminate cockroaches in her apartment, saying they bothered her son. “She said, ‘My son is dealing with some mental issues, and the roaches are really irritating him,’ ” Julia Winstead, 55, said. “She said they were going to go stay in a motel. Until that time, I didn’t know she had a son.” A gunman opened fire on a teacher and students on Thursday morning at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. He was listed as a 2009 graduate of the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, a private school for students with learning disabilities, emotional issues and other special-education needs. Officials from the school declined to comment on Friday. Mr. Harper-Mercer joined the Army for a month in 2008 but was discharged before finishing basic training. Rosario Lucumi, 51, rode the same bus in Torrance as the young man when she went to work. She said he always wore earphones and listened to music on the rides. She said he and his mother lived for less than a year in a small one-bedroom apartment in Torrance. “They were always together,” she said. His parents struggled financially over the years, filing for bankruptcy in 1992, and his father, Ian Mercer, filed again in 2002. California records show that Ms. Harper had been a licensed vocational nurse. She is now a licensed practical nurse in Oregon. She apparently contributed to online forums dealing with health issues. In one exchange, a writer who appeared to be Ms. Harper offered assistance to the mother of a child with Asperger’s syndrome, saying, “I’m a nurse and also have an Aspergers kid.” Neither of his parents could be reached for comment, but his father told television reporters outside his California home on Thursday night that he was shocked by the events. Mr. Harper-Mercer appeared to have sought community on the Internet, leaving hints behind of his passions, his loneliness, his likes and dislikes. A picture of him holding a rifle appeared on a MySpace page with a post expressing a deep interest in the Irish Republican Army. It included footage from the conflict in Northern Ireland set to “The Men Behind the Wire,” an Irish Republican song, and several pictures of gunmen in black balaclavas. A dating profile published more than three months ago with his email address on the website Spiritual Passions, and featuring photos of Mr. Harper-Mercer, appeared to broaden the portrait. “Looking for someone who shares my beliefs, and is similar to me,” it said. It said he enjoyed horror movies, and under hobbies, it listed “killing zombies” along with the “Internet” and other pursuits. The profile described Mr. Harper-Mercer as “Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual,” and it said he belonged to a group called “Doesn’t Like Organized Religion.” On a file-sharing forum where illicit content is often shared, blog posts linked to his email address expressed sympathy for Mr. Flanagan, who killed two former co-workers in August. “People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned them,” the user wrote days after the Roanoke shooting. “His family described him as alone, no partner/lover. A victim not only of his own perception but also of our social media soaked environment.” In a post published in September, after the shooting death of Darren Goforth, a suburban Houston police officer, at a gas station, the user with Mr. Harper-Mercer’s email address said it was the inevitable result of the Black Lives Matter movement. “In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests,” the user said. The user, who posted under the name lithium_love, shared pornography, as well as movies like “Illuminati Secrets” and “UFO Secrets of the Third Reich.” Bryan Clay, 18, a neighbor from Torrance, said he once asked Mr. Harper-Mercer why he wore “a military get-up” every day. This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. “He kind of just didn’t want to talk about it” and changed the subject, Mr. Clay said. “He didn’t say anything about himself,” he added. Derrick McClendon, 42, another former neighbor, said Mr. Harper-Mercer was so timid and ill at ease that on occasion Mr. McClendon would ask him if something was wrong. “I would say, ‘Hey, man, you all right?’ ” Mr. McClendon said. “He would say, ‘Hi,’ but that’s it. He was really shy.” Rosario Espinoza, 33, was once a neighbor and moved into the apartment that the mother and son shared when the two moved from Torrance a couple of years ago. She said that the two “kept to themselves,” but that from time to time Mr. Harper-Mercer’s mother would complain that Ms. Espinoza’s young children were playing too loudly and bothering her son. “They’re normal children that play, but she would get really upset,” Ms. Espinoza said. “It was during the daytime. But I guess the noise would really upset him, the son.” One night, the Flores family, the next-door neighbors, were watching a movie when Mr. Harper-Mercer knocked on the door. transcript na “He said: ‘Can you turn that down? Your TV is really loud,” Esther Flores said. “And he just had that look. No smile, nothing. And he just turned and walked away. My husband didn’t even have a chance to respond.” Other neighbors said the mother would confront them about their barking dogs when they returned from work. “She would wait till they got home and knock on their door,” Kim Hermenegildo, 48, said. Ms. Espinoza said that she heard Mr. Harper-Mercer’s mother got a job in Oregon, prompting the family’s move north. In Winchester, Ore., Mr. Harper-Mercer and his mother shared an apartment in a dun-colored building that sat roped off behind police tape on Thursday evening, guarded by sheriff’s deputies who shooed away reporters. Bronte Hart, a neighbor who said she lived in an apartment below Mr. Harper-Mercer’s, described a more assertive young man than his former neighbors in California did. Far from avoiding social interaction, she said, he frequently shouted at her for smoking on her balcony. “He yelled at us, me and my husband,” said Ms. Hart, who lives with her husband and father. “He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.” Investigators are still piecing together Mr. Mercer-Harper’s conversations and actions in the days leading up to the shooting. But that path ended at Snyder Hall at 10:30 a.m., when he shot his way into his classroom and, according to some, interrogated his classmates about their faith as he killed them. When the police reached Mr. Harper-Mercer, they shot and wounded him, a law enforcement official said. He was able to run away and then shot himself. He died in the ambulance en route to the hospital. It was not clear which shot was the fatal one.

Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin has opposed Oregon's new law expanding background checks to private gun sales. Prior to that, in the heated debate over new gun measures in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that took the lives of 20 children, Hanlin was one of several Oregon sheriffs who wrote the White House to warn he would not cooperate with federal officials on any new laws he deemed an unconstitutional restriction on the right to bear arms. Hanlin is cooperating with officials now as they investigate the deadliest shooting in Oregon's history. A 26-year-old-man with at least three guns stormed onto the campus of Umpqua Community College Thursday and killed nine people and wounded several before being killed by police. Advertisement Hanlin did do one laudable thing. He told the media he would not name the shooter, so as to ""not give him the credit he probably sought, prior to this horrific and cowardly act."" But that novelty means nothing in the face of his — and America's — cowardice on guns, no matter how horrific the massacre. And no matter the number of massacres. From 1982 to 2011, a public mass shooting occurred every 200 days, according to researchers at Harvard and Northeastern universities. But since then, public mass shootings — defined as four or more people being killed in public areas by an assailant largely unknown to victims — now occurs more like every two months. The tragedy in Oregon comes after this summer's massacre of nine African-Americans in a historically black church by an allegedly racist assailant. According to the FBI, the number of ""active shooter"" incidents, defined as ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area,"" more than doubled from 6.4 a year in 2000-2006 to 16.4 a year in 2007-2013. Those active-shooter incidents claimed the lives of 468 people and left 557 others wounded. Advertisement No other developed nation in the world has this madness. And this does not even touch the everyday insanity of homicides and suicides. In a new CNN compilation, 316,545 Americans died from gun violence from 2004 to 2013, more than 1,000 times the 313 Americans who have died from terrorism, and still 10 times more than the toll of 9/11. We've gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq fighting terrorism, yet there remains no fight against the deadliest terror we actually face. We allow the NRA and the gun lobby to wield power like developing-country dictators, impoverishing intellectual discourse and celebrating jubilantly at every legislative defeat of gun control as blood flows on streets, campuses, military bases, and in lonely bedrooms where depressed people who might otherwise survive a pill overdose instead put a bullet to the head. That was driven home to me Thursday when, by coincidence, my wife and I saw ""O Beautiful"" at Emerson Stage. An intense student production, the play was significantly about right-wing talk shows fueling gun ownership in suburbs despite their relative safety, and how that contributed to the suicide of a bullied teenager who got his hands on a family gun. Advertisement That was on my mind when I read President Obama's response to the Oregon massacre. Reduced to mourner-in-chief by the defeat of universal background checks after Sandy Hook, he  rightfully pleaded for Americans to think about the families who have lost children to gun violence and ""think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up."" When will the we finally allow young people to grow up in a nation with serious gun control? Columbine did not make the nation answer that question. Neither did Virginia Tech or Sandy Hook. Will Umpqua Community College help us think about changing laws, in a county where the sheriff vowed to ignore them? It could, if people like Hanlin come to see their interpretation of the Constitution as a delusion. Derrick Z. Jackson can be reached at jackson@globe.com.

                    PBS NewsHour The trial for accused shooter James Holmes got underway with opening arguments nearly three years since the mass killing at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering 12 people and injuring dozens more by reason of insanity. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Judy Woodruff learns more from Mary MacCarthy of Feature Story News. JUDY WOODRUFF: It's closing in on three years since a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, left 12 people dead and 70 others injured, making it the largest number of casualties from one shooting on American soil. Today, the trial of the man accused, James Holmes, got under way. He's been charged with 166 counts for attacks that took place on July 20, 2012. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Opening arguments began this afternoon and prosecutors immediately challenged the insanity argument. GEORGE BRAUCHLER, District Attorney, 18th Judicial District: There were two psychiatrists, about a year apart, asked to do independent assessments and evaluations of him. They were picked by the Colorado Mental Health Institute of Pueblo, the state mental hospital, at the direction of the court. And both of them say the same thing, that that guy was sane when he tried to murder all those people in that theater back in July of 2012. JUDY WOODRUFF: Shortly after prosecutors began their case, I spoke with Mary MacCarthy of Feature Story News. She was at the courthouse earlier today. Mary MacCarthy, welcome. First of all, describe the scene in the courtroom today. MARY MACCARTHY, Feature Story News: Well, to say that this is a long-awaited trial is an understatement. It's been over two-and-a-half years, just over 1,000 days, since that fateful night in an Aurora movie theater where a gunman opened fire. So, here, the Denver community, the community of victims, and anybody following this trial has really been on edge waiting for a long time. So it's lots of media here, international media, people following the case closely, in the courtroom, of course, many victims, victims' families and their friends, a packed courtroom. And just to give an example of the scope of this trial, the courtroom itself had to be built out to make for a larger jury box. Normally, a juror — would have 12 seats in the jury box. Here, they have 24 seats for the 12 jurors, the 12 alternates. The judge wanted 12 alternates because the trial is likely to last so long that they wanted to make sure that if someone gets sick, in any contingency, they have enough jurors that will last until the very end of this high-profile trial. JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you hear from the prosecution today in their opening argument? MARY MACCARTHY: Well, some of the biggest questions about this trial, about the evidence were in fact revealed just in the very few first minutes of the opening statement by the district attorney, George Brauchler, who is known for his very eloquent, concise and hard-hitting opening statements. He revealed just within the first few minutes that in fact the two mental health evaluations of James Holmes carried out by the state, that both of those evaluations found Mr. Holmes to be sane. There had been much speculation and expectation that perhaps one of the doctors who evaluated him had found him to be insane, the other sane, and that the trial would come down to the jury having to decide between those two state-mandated doctors and deciding which doctor they'd agree with. The fact is that it almost makes it seem like a relatively easy case for the prosecution because both of those doctors did find James Holmes to be sane. The other big — one of the biggest mysteries going into this was that notebook that Mr. Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist at the University of Colorado the day before the shooting. To this point, we didn't know the contents of the notebook. Now after the opening statement of the prosecution, we have seen many pages of that notebook with Mr. Holmes' own handwriting, a cursive script that is somewhat childlike, in which he lays out his plans to kill. Very clearly, he lays out his various methodology and even, in fact, some of his reasoning. He said, for example, that his message, when he hoped to some day carry out a killing, was that there would be no message, a very nihilistic point of view. He said that he thought about carrying out a mass murder, a mass killing at an airport, but that could be construed as a terrorist message. He didn't want that. He wanted his point to be that this killing has no meaning, that life has no meaning. JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly, what do you expect to hear from the defense?  They're going to be trying to prove that he's mentally — was mentally ill? MARY MACCARTHY: That's right. Knowing that the state-mandated experts both found Mr. Holmes to be sane, that means that the defense's case will hinge on the testimony of their own mental health experts. They, of course, called in several. We know that several of theirs, perhaps all, several of them at least anyway, have found him to be insane. But we also know that those experts spent significantly less time with the defendant than the state's experts did. So, again, the defense's case will hinge on those experts. At this point, it looks like it will be a battle of the testimony between those experts called in strictly by the defense and the state experts whose point of view agrees with the prosecution. JUDY WOODRUFF: Mary MacCarthy on this trial in Colorado that has now gotten under way after, as you said, more than two-and-a-half years, we thank you.

                    Megan Crigger No matter how you define a mass shooting, one thing is clear: data suggests this brand of violence has grown worse in the United States. In 2015 alone, there have been 299 shootings that killed or injured 1,487 people, according to Mass Shooting Tracker data, which counts at least four people wounded by gunfire as a mass shooting. This year, 381 people died this way, according to the data. These shootings occurred at night clubs and children’s birthday parties, when long-time friends watched college football on TV and when churchgoers gathered for a weekly Bible study. These incidents have happened in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and happened at a rate of more than one shooting per day. The largest recent mass shooting occurred one week ago and  left 10 people dead, including gunman Chris Harper Mercer, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, adding one more tally to a bleak list of places marked by gun violence. Early Friday, law enforcement authorities said Steven Jones opened fire near a student dormitory at Northern Arizona University‘s Flagstaff campus, leaving one person dead and three injured. There’s debate, however, about how to define a mass shooting. In 2014, a Federal Bureau of Investigations report studied all mass shootings that involved an active shooter, or incidents where a person used firearms to kill or try to kill others “in a confined or populated area.” Between 2000 and 2013, 486 people died in 160 active shooter incidents nationwide, the FBI report said. That’s about 11 such incidents per year, and the trend only increased over time. Overall, seven out of 10 incidents occurred a business, workplace or school. And unlike Mass Shooting Tracker data, the FBI’s assessment included incidents where fewer than four people were shot, explained Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama. However, the FBI data doesn’t include shootings of multiple people that occur in a home or other uncrowded setting. These definitions shape the problem’s scale and pose a challenge in trying to better understand the factors that produce mass shootings, he said. “However you talk about the problem, or type of shooter or shooting, that defines your results,” he said. It’s too soon to know if 2015 will signal a turn in mass shootings, Lankford explained, but looking at more than a decade of data from the FBI, the outlook is grim. “They found these incidents are clearly on the rise. That’s pretty strong evidence,” he said. Editor’s Note: This post and its map has been updated to include the Oct. 9 shooting at Northern Arizona University campus that left one person dead and three more injured as well as other shootings to date, according to Mass Shooting Tracker data.

665,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/1uA2yn5XnvQ/,"Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James called for more gun control in the aftermath of Thursday’s mass murder at an Oregon community college and the killing of a five-month-old in Cleveland by a drive-by shooter. King James decreed to the press, “There’s no room for guns.” The four-time MVP initially reserved his frustration for the drive-by shooting in Cleveland that resulted in the death of a baby. He called for more restraint and accountability. C’mon man let’s do and be better! Don’t fall into the trap. This can’t be only way. Accept more from yourselves. #TheLand #TheNation — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015 Like seriously man!!!! A baby shot in the chest in Cleveland. It’s been out of control but it’s really OOC. Ya’ll need to chill the F out. — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 1, 2015 “Obviously you’re not going to be able to take every gun out,” James told the press on Friday. “I don’t know how you can do that.” James, a relatively apolitical figure early in his basketball career, has increasingly waded into controversies since the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012. He appeared with his Miami Heat teammates wearing hoodies in tribute to Martin in the aftermath of the teen’s killing and wore an “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt memorializing Staten Island singles-cigarette salesman Eric Garner who died as a result of a physical altercation with police. “There’s so many around now, today,” James said of guns on Friday. “But if there’s some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.” Cleveland enacted new, strict gun-control provisions earlier this year. Umpqua Community College expressly prohibits the possession, use, and brandishing of firearms on its campus. 2nd AmendmentSportsLeBron James .

          / CBS News In the wake of a fatal shooting at an Oregon community college that left ten dead and several more injured, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush pushed back against calls for stricter gun control legislation. ""Whenever you see the tragedy take place, the impulse in the political system - more often at the federal level, but also at the state level - is to do something,"" Bush said Friday at a conservative forum in Greenville, South Carolina. ""And what we end up doing lots of times is to create rules on 99.999 percent of human activity that had nothing to do with tragedy."" ""I had this challenge as governor,"" Bush continued. ""Look, stuff happens. There's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" Bush's remarks mirror other statements from the GOP field. Donald Trump told MSNBC Friday morning that ""You're going to have these things happen and it's a horrible thing to behold, horrible."" ""It's not politically correct to say that, but you're going to have difficulty, and that will be for the next million years, there's going to be difficulty and people are going to slip through the cracks,"" Trump said. ""What are you going to do, institutionalize everybody?"" In a press conference Friday, the president responded to Bush's comment, saying that ""the American people should hear that and make their own judgment based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting."" They can decide, Mr. Obama said, whether or not such massacres constitute ""stuff happening."" The president called again for the politics behind gun control to change, and for the ""behavior of elected officials"" to shift. ""Our inaction is a political decision we are making,"" he said. He also placed the brunt of the blame on interest groups that ""fund campaigns, feed people fear."" ""Unless we change that political dynamic,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We're not going to make a big dent in this problem."" First published on October 2, 2015 / 5:05 PM © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

A gunman opened fire Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killing at least 9 people and injuring several more, according to local authorities. The shooter, who is among the 10 total dead and has been identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, was killed after exchanging fire with police, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin confirmed in a press conference. ""It's been a terrible day,"" Hanlin said Thursday afternoon. ""At this point, it's a very active scene. It's a very active investigation."" Officers first responded to reports of a shooting at the college around 10:40 a.m. local time Thursday. The shooting occurred in Snyder Hall, where science classes are held, The New York Times reported, citing the Douglas County Sheriff's Department. Law enforcement told CNN that four guns believed to belong to the suspect were recovered at the scene. During a press conference Thursday evening, US President Barack Obama offered his condolences to victims of the tragedy before angrily criticizing the government for its continued inaction on gun control. ""There's been another mass shooting in America,"" Obama said. ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium is routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it — we've become numb to this. This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.""

A Roseburg resident who lives across the street from the campus told the Oregonian that roughly 20 ambulances and 75 cop cars arrived on scene. Via Google Maps
                                

After the shooting, the campus was placed on lockdown. Students and faculty were evacuated on buses to the Douglas County Fairgrounds, where they were to be picked up. UCC has no formal security staff, former UCC President Joe Olson, who retired earlier this year, told the Associated Press. There is only one officer on each shift. Roseburg is a rural town of about 22,000 people west of the Cascade Mountains and about 180 miles south of Portland, Oregon. The college has about 3,300 full-time students and 16,000 part-time students. People wait for information at the local fairgrounds after a deadly shooting at Umpqua Community College.

""In fact, during President Obama's second term, a Sunday-to-Saturday calendar week has not passed without a mass shooting incident,"" The Washington Post's Philip Bump reported. Definitions vary, but the Post defines a mass shooting as incidents in which four or more people are shot, so this statistic could include domestic incidents.

At least, the GOP won’t agree to repeal without some pretty big changes in return — like perhaps an agreement to scrap other parts of the health law, reports Pro's Brian Faler. Even though Democratic allies in organized labor want to junk the tax, that doesn't mean they're about to let the law get gutted. It's a surprising political obstacle to repealing the tax — especially since half of Congress now supports legislation repealing it. — ""Gridlock may be just fine for Republicans, who've made their opposition to the Cadillac tax clear to voters and are happy to head into next year's elections with Democrats taking slings over the issue,"" Faler writes. But lack of repeal will ""leave unions and companies, which have united in a formidable lobbying campaign to nix the tax, sweating out the issue even as the tax, set to begin in 2018, looms ever larger.""

 — The state asked the justices to overturn a lower court decision that struck down Arkansas' ban on abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy and when a heartbeat is detected, which a lower court ruled unconstitutional. The state said its case is the “ideal vehicle” for the court to revisit the viability standard it established in
Roe v. Wade and upheld in
Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It's far from certain that the justices will hear the case. In the last term, they refused to hear a challenge over a 20-week abortion ban that a lower court had overturned. More
here from Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn. — Speaking of SCOTUS: the Court is much more likely to take up a separate abortion case on the constitutionality of a
Texas law that imposed new restrictions on abortion providers and clinics in the state. And a whole host of provider groups opposing the Texas restrictions — including the AMA, ACOG, AAFP — and attorneys general from New York, California, Illinois and many more states have all signed on to new amicus briefs urging the court to take up the case and end the ""sham laws.""

Tim Murphy are stumping for their respective mental health bills today at a National Journal event on mental health reform, less than a week after the deadly mass-shooting at a community college in Oregon. The latest tragedy involving a killer with a mental illness has once again renewed calls from members of Congress and presidential candidates to fix the country’s mental health system, and bills from Chris Murphy and Tim Murphy are expected to get marked up in committee later this year.

 http://bit.ly/1JQyLuO SCOTUS: DOL CAN MOVE AHEAD WITH HOME HEALTH RULE — The Supreme Court won't block implementation of the Labor Department's rule on overtime pay for home health workers, it said Tuesday. That's in line with an August appeals court decision determining that the DOL could move forward with the long-delayed rule that extends minimum wage and overtime protections to workers in those facilities. Home care companies had sued to block the rule. Worth noting: under Tuesday's ruling the Supreme Court may still choose to take up the case sometime in the future; it is merely declining to enjoin the Labor Department from implementing the rule in the meantime. EXPRESS SCRIPTS WILL COVER COSTLY CHOLESTEROL DRUGS — The company is listing both Amgen's and Sanofi's drugs on its formulary, but will use ""rigorous utilization management"" to help control costs, the company announced Tuesday.

677,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obama-oregon-shootings-214352,"President Obama delivers remarks on the Oregon mass shooting from the White House Thursday evening. An exasperated Obama delivers what has become a frequent refrain, and asks the American people to demand more gun controls. By NICK GASS 10/01/2015 06:55 PM EDT Updated 10/01/2015 07:18 PM EDT President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room on Thursday evening, hours after a gunman killed 9 people and injured 7 more at a Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, looked briefly at the lectern and began a version of a speech that has become a frequent standby during his time in office. ""There’s been another mass shooting in America,"" Obama said. ""That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever. That means theres another community stunned with grief and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children."" Reiterating that ""thoughts and prayers"" are not enough, a visibly frustrated Obama called on state legislatures, governors and Congress to work with him to implement effective gun legislation that could prevent future shootings. Everything about these events ""has become routine,"" the president remarked. It was not even the first time Obama had delivered nationally televised remarks on a shooting this year. Photo Essay By DIANA D'ABRUZZO ""The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation and the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this,"" Obama said, delivering a meta-analysis of the cycle between shootings and media coverage of the past two decades. ""We’ve talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston… It cannot be this easy for someone who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun,"" he added. The Associated Press late Wednesday identified the alleged Oregon shooter as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, citing a government official. The gunman was killed in a firefight with police, authorities said. The number of mass shootings across America has piled up. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, a Michael Bloomberg-backed nonprofit that bills itself as a gun-violence prevention group, there have been 142 school shootings since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. In 2015 alone, the group estimates, there have been at least 45 school shootings in the United States. Meanwhile, the response from Congress has been emotional, but unproductive. The last push for gun legislation stalled in the months following the Newtown shooting that claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults, and subsequent attempts under a GOP-controlled House and Senate have not gained traction. In anticipating the reaction of people who opposed any form of ""common-sense gun legislation,"" Obama remarked that he ""can imagine the press release is being cranked out"" that the country needs more guns to be safer. “Does anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know that’s not true,"" he said. “How can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer?” Other countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to stop most future incidents, Obama claimed. “So we know there are ways to prevent it. And of course, what’s also routine is somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama will politicize this issue. Well this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to our body politic,"" he said, urging news organizations to publish statistics comparing the number of Americans killed by acts of terror to those killed by gun violence. By NICK GASS “This is a political choice that we make. To allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of their inaction,"" he added, urging Americans to elect officials who reflect their views. Obama also called upon responsible gun owners to make sure their views are being accurately represented by groups that claim to have their best interests at hand. ""I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances,"" Obama said, ending his address on another somber, yet hopeful note. ""But based on my experience as president, I can’t guarantee that. And that’s terrible to say. And it can change.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

679,http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/05/white-house-says-obama-is-considering-executive-action-on-guns/,"The White House is considering whether President Obama can take executive action to enforce stronger gun control measures, White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said on Monday. “The president has frequently pushed his team to consider a range of executive actions that could more effectively keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who shouldn’t have access to them,” Earnest said Monday. “That’s something that is ongoing here.” Earnest was responding to questions from reporters following Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s announcement that she would consider executive action to expand background checks on gun buyers by closing the so-called gun show loophole. Clinton’s move marks the second time she has said she will consider going farther than the Obama administration by taking unilateral action on hot-button issues. She has already said that she would expand on Obama’s unilteral actions granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens if Congress fails to pass immigration reform. Clinton’s announcement on the gun issue puts Obama in a bind. Last week, following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Obama said that he will continue to politicize the issue of gun violence in order to force Congress to enact gun control measures. But Obama’s critics have wondered why he does not exert executive authority if he believes so strongly in the cause. Earnest declined to expand on White House deliberations on possible executive action. “I don’t have anything to announce at this point, but we certanly welcome the kind of debate that Secretary Clinton is continuing,” he said. Another reporter followed up, asserting that if executive action on guns was a possibility, “it would be done by now.” “I don’t have a lot of details to provide you in terms of the work that’s being done by the President’s team to do this scrub of the available authorities that the president may have to address gun violence,” Earnest said. “But that is ongoing work and if there are any conclusions that are arrived at that the President agrees with then we will announce it publicly.” Asked if there were any technical impediments to implementing executive action, Earnest said that “it’s hard to answer this question while also protecting their ability to do their work.” Asked if the White House was having trouble figuring out how to tackle the issue, Earnest said “I can tell you, they’re not stumped.” “They are continuing to review the law that’s on the books and continuing to consult with legal authorities but also with others who may have ideas about what steps could be taken to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” Earnest said.

In a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), the California Democrat said Congress needs a select panel to study why mass shooting deaths occur and what legislation lawmakers could pass to stop the violence. The shooting at Umpqua Community College was the 45th school shooting this year. ""I urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to confront this crisis and report back common sense legislation to help end it,"" Pelosi wrote. ""The bipartisan committee would be charged to present its recommendations to the House within 60 days – in time for a vote before the third anniversary of the Newtown shooting this year.""

683,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/gun-lovers-arent-heartless-213224,"AP Photo Opinion I knowâIâm married to one. By SOPHIA RADAY October 06, 2015 Sophia Raday is the author of Love in Condition Yellow: A Memoir of an Unlikely Marriage. âHow can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?â President Barack Obama asked on Friday. I can answer that question. Iâm in the progressive camp, but Iâm married to my political opposite, a Republican police officer and soldier. Weâve had eighteen years to compare notes on many political issues, and out of all those arguments, I have gained an understanding and a measure of respect for the conservative worldview. When something as horrible as the shooting in Oregon happens, progressives want to pull some shred of meaning from it. So letâs do something already, we say, in increasingly exasperated and angry tones. Letâs learn. Letâs change things. But we might be more effective in getting something done about mass shootings if we actually understood the opposition. Researchers studying conflict and extremism believe you can get a lot further in negotiation with an adversary if you acknowledge what is sacred to them. And believe it or not, gun-rights advocatesâat least by virtue of their politicsâare not heartless. It must be understood that gun-rights advocates, like many conservatives, tell a very different story about the world than we progressives do. In their narrative, the earth is an inherently dangerous, often hostile, and definitely competitive place. Unlike us, they do not take as given that deep down, all people are basically good. They believe there is evil in the world, that there will always be evil in the world and that evil must be consistently and stalwartly confronted. In their story, itâs up to every one of the good people to stand up against malice. Otherwise, evil gets the upper hand. So, when a mass shooting occurs, their view of American society as overly permissive, and therefore an insufficient bulwark against ever-threatening evil, is only confirmed. Liberals scratch their heads at the NRA memberâs passion for firearms. People like Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlinâwhose post-Sandy Hook letter refusing to enforce any additional gun regulations is now going viralâseem like callous monsters to us. We find it odd and twisted to be so attached, so passionate about an amalgamation of metal and explosives whose raison dâtre is destruction. What we donât get is that for conservatives, and Second Amendment defenders especially, the supreme virtue is self-reliance. The unconscious story underlying much conservative thought is a tale of good versus evil. Think of movies such as the Dark Knight, or Braveheart, or Star Wars. The virtuous individual must draw on his own talent and courage to defeat evil within and without. He cannot rely on others to carry his weight for him, especially not the government, which is a greedy slug at best, a fierce tyrant at worst in the lore of the pro-gun camp. The importance of individual responsibility underlies conservative opposition to many government assistance programs: food stamps, health care, social programs in general. But to many conservatives, nothing is more basic than an individualâs right and responsibility to safeguard his own life. Ceding the ability to defend oneself to a stranger? Itâs not just feckless or weak; itâs self-betrayal. And thatâs where the right to bear arms comes in. A gun on your hip gives you individual power against the tyranny of violence. It gives you the opportunity to be the hero. Hence the American rightâs fetishization of the firearm. It is the symbol of an individualâs ability to defend his life. Itâs the linchpin to freedom. Law And Order By James Dudley Law And Order By Matt Valentine Law And Order By Thomas Geoghegan You may notice I am using the âheâ pronoun to characterize the strident pro-gun advocate. Thatâs because there are a lot more men than women in the gun rights camp. Indeed, attitudes toward gun rights constitute one of the biggest gender gaps in American public policy. In a 2012 Pew Research poll, women elevated gun control over gun rights by a 24-point margin, while men leaned the opposite way, prioritizing gun rights by a 10-point margin. Researchers explain this (tautologically to my mind) by saying that men are more likely to defend gun ownership because they are far more likely to own firearms. That simply raises another question: why do so many more men own guns? The obvious answer is that more men anticipate a need to defend themselves. The potential for a life-threatening conflict is more present in their minds. Perhaps this is somehow genetic. Or due to environmental factors. Or a consequence of men being more likely to have experienced a physical fight. Whatever the case, it is certainly true that men, even with todayâs advances in gender equality, often bear primary responsibility for a coupleâs or a familyâs security. It seems obvious that the more physical conflict looms in oneâs imagination, the more dangerous the world appears. Perhaps thatâs why police officers overwhelming oppose gun control. Cops see the results of gun violence, which makes their strong support of gun rights sort of odd to the progressive perspective. After all, they and their brethren are too often the targets of gun violence. Plus, they neednât personally fear gun restrictions since they would almost certainly be exempt. Nor should it bother them to yield control of their security to government agents since, well, they are the government agents. Yet despite all that, police officers want an armed citizenry. And not by a small margin. Over ninety percent believe there would be fewer casualties if armed citizens were present at the onset of an active-shooter incident. Over eighty percent think arming school administrators and teachers is a good idea. Why? The conventional answer is that conservatives and gun-rights supporters are more likely to become police officers. Thatâs clearly part of it, but maybe thereâs more to it. Perhaps police officers experience the world as dangerous and threatening, in the same way that passionate gun-rights advocates do. Perhaps because of all the dysfunction they see in their jobs, they believe evil is an inevitable part of life. Perhaps their job experiences confirm a worldview where the best answer to evil is widespread sleeper cells of ready-for-action, preferably packing, good guys. In sum, for a pro-gun American, limiting access to firearms is an assault on the very core of his identity. Because he does care. In fact, he wants to save the day. Take away his right to bear arms now? When evil is increasingly evident? Thatâs sending him out to face the playground bully with his hands tied behind his back. As far-fetched as all this may seem to a progressive, itâs not ignoble. Itâs not heartless. Itâs a radically different viewpoint that we progressives would be better served understanding rather than demonizing. California By Jeremy B.

On Thursday, it happened again: a mass shooting in America. This time, a gunman killed eight people at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Already, the shooting has led to demands for action. “10 Republican Senators — including Indiana’s @SenToddYoung & @SenatorBraun — decide whether we are going to do something about this deadly epidemic or continue to do nothing and live with this death every damn day.” the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted. But if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017, the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low. This has become an American routine: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues to experience levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress; nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror. So why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it’s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States but also America’s unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times the rate of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to 2012 United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) To understand why that is, there’s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the 2018 Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. That does not, however, mean that every American adult actually owns guns. In fact, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population, as surveys from the Pew Research Center and the General Social Survey suggest. These three basic facts demonstrate America’s unique gun culture. There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence — a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal. And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world. At the same time, these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority, who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures. The research on this is overwhelmingly clear: No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths. This is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) within the United States, as this 2013 chart from Mother Jones demonstrates. And it’s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) across developed nations. Data compiled in 2018 from GunPolicy.org shows the United States is an extreme outlier in both categories. Opponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America’s unusual levels of gun violence — particularly mental illness. But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had a mental illness. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” Stone concluded. Other research has backed this up. Another argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns, enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting. Yet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths, but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths. While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others, the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents. Multiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process. This video, from ABC News, shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they’re shot: The relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates, meanwhile, is well established. Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center back this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths — not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This 2018 chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. To deal with its problem, America will have to not only make guns less accessible but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well. The research also speaks to this point: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. But even with the outrage over gun massacres, the sense that enough is enough, and the clear evidence that the problem is America’s high gun ownership rates, there hasn’t been significant legislation to help solve the problem. If you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures, they will often say that they support them. According to Pew Research Center surveys, most people in the US support universal background checks, a federal database to track gun sales, and bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun, another proposal with solid research behind it. So why don’t these measures ever get turned into law? That’s in part because they run into another political issue: Americans, increasingly in recent years, tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns. This is part of how gun control opponents are able to thwart even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures, such as background checks that include private sales (which have upwards of 80 percent support, according to Pew): They’re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns, and galvanize a backlash against it. This kind of problem isn’t unique to guns. For example, although many Americans say they don’t like the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law. The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a “government takeover of health care” and “death panels.” Since most Americans don’t have time to verify these claims, especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts, enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward. Of course, it’s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws. And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they’re backed by a very powerful political lobby. The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America, and that development is more recent than you might think. The NRA was, for much of its early history, more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control, and even supported some gun restrictions. In 1934, NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.” A 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything. As crime rose in the 1960s and ’70s, calls for more gun control grew as well. NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law — eventually ending, they feared, with the government’s seizure of all firearms in America. So members mobilized, installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership, forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today. This foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms. It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations, such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases, are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America, which the NRA views — wrongly, in the minds of some legal experts — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. So anytime there’s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to quash these bills. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers. As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA’s support, especially the A-to-F ratings the organization gives out, very seriously. Politicians will go to sometimes absurd lengths to show their support for gun rights. In 2015, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun. Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has. This might be changing. Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland, Florida, shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords, gun control groups are generally more organized, better funded, and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control. But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: very passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, Norquist suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.” What’s behind that passion? Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, suggested that it’s a sense of tangible loss: Gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. (See: #NeverAgain.) There is also an exception at the state level, where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past several years, for instance, Vermont, Washington state, and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks. “There’s a lot more going on than Congress,” Goss said. “In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.” But state laws aren’t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name “the Iron Pipeline.” But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state. And until such a federal law is passed, there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law. Yet the NRA’s influence and its army of supporters push many of America’s legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them. In 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history. Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.) The result: Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers. It’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia’s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.” One 2010 study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking: Javier Zarracina/Vox One other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: “While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.” Depending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses, there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year. These events are, it goes without saying, devastating tragedies for the nation and, primarily, the victims and their families. Yet other, less covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings. Under a broad definition of mass shooting, these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016. That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year — most of which were suicides, not homicides. Preventing suicides isn’t something typically included in discussions of gun control, but other countries’ experiences show it can save lives. In Israel, where military service is mandatory for much of the population, policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend. So Israeli officials, as part of their solution, decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home. It worked: A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent. So while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control, the problem goes far beyond those incidents. Though it’s hard to fault them for trying; mass shootings, after all, force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture. But it seems that we as a nation just aren’t willing to look, or else don’t sufficiently mind what we see, when these events occur. Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut — in which a gunman killed 20 young children, six school personnel, and himself — catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states. Since then, there have been, by some estimates, thousands of mass shootings. And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

690,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/jeb-bush-oregon-campus-shooting-stuff-happens-214386,"GOP presidential hopeful addresses the Oregon shooting Friday afternoon, stating that 'stuff happens' and more government may not be the answer. By DANIEL STRAUSS 10/02/2015 04:22 PM EDT Updated 10/02/2015 05:51 PM EDT A day after a massacre on a U.S. college campus, Jeb Bush said ""stuff happens"" but that does not mean gun restrictions should be tightened. ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's very bad to see,"" the former Florida governor said. Then he added: ""Look, stuff happens and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" His comments came during an appearance in Greenville, South Carolina where the 2016 candidate was discussing gun control and urging caution before pushing new laws and regulations. He first said that in Florida ""we believe that concealed weapons permits is a proper thing."" ""All sorts of rules that are appropriate for Florida may not be appropriate for other places but the basic right is embedded and it's a personal right to bear arms but that shouldn't be infringed,"" he said. Bush also said the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, that left nine dead and seven injured was ""just heartbreaking."" Bush, in a question-and-answer session with reporters after he made the comments, said he was referring to tragedies in general, not specifically gun violence or the Oregon shooting. He also said states should look at gun laws to make it harder for the mentally ill to have access to weapons. The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza asked if Bush made a mistake with the phrasing. ""No, it wasn't a mistake, I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong?"" Bush said. Lizza responded, ""Well you said 'stuff happens.'"" ""'Things' happen all the time. 'Things,' is that better?"" Bush said. ""A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools,"" Bush said. ""Well it may not change it or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event and the cumulative effect of this is in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people, burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder for people to protect liberty, and that is, the whole conversation today was exactly about that."" Later on Friday, the Bush campaign blasted what they called liberals' unwarranted criticism of the former Florida governor's comments. “It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions,” said Allie Brandenburger, a Bush spokewoman, in a statement. Asked to react to Bush's comment, President Barack Obama was blunt. ""I don’t even think I have to react to that one, I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting,” Obama said at a press conference Friday afternoon. ""They can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happens.'"" Missing out on the latest scoops?

691,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/qqUGzQzmfbo/,"When President Obama spoke in reaction to the heinous October 1 attack on Umpqua Community College, he went beyond his usual calls for more gun control and suggested instead that America consider following the path blazed by Australia and Great Britain. In the mid-1990s Australia and Great Britain both instituted what were virtually complete bans on firearm possession. Obama referenced the bans thus: We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.  Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.  So we know there are ways to prevent it. And Obama is not the only one who suggested taking a gun-free approach to American life. The anti-Second Amendment message was also pushed by Slate, Vox, and Dan Savage. For example, on October 1 Slate ran a story reminding readers that Australia enacted their gun ban in response to an attack on April 28, 1996, wherein a gunman “opened fire on tourists in a seaside resort in Port Arthur, Tasmania.” Thirty-five were killed and 23 others wounded in the attack. Twelve days later Australia’s government banned guns, period. On October 2 Vox explained that Australia “confiscated 650,000 guns” via a “mandatory gun buyback” program which forced gun owners to hand their firearms over for destruction. Vox claims the result was that “murders and suicides plummeted’ and suggested such a path might be an option for America following “the murder of at least 10 people at Umpqua Community College.” Vox did not mention that “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” began plummeting in America in the mid-1990s as well. But in America, the decrease in violent crime did not correlate with a gun ban but with a rapid expansion in the number of guns privately owned. The Congressional Research Service reported that the number of privately owned firearms in America went from 192 million in 1994 to 310 million privately owned firearms in 2009. Subsequently, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate fell from 6.6 per 100,000 in 1993 to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2000 and finally to 3.2 per 100,000 in 2011. But none of this made any difference to Dan Savage, who responded to the attack on Umpqua Community College by calling for the Second Amendment’s repeal. Savage tweeted, “F**k the NRA, f**k the gun nuts, f**k the Second Amendment — better yet, repeal the Second Amendment. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

Fuck Ben Carson You know, the only thing more alarming than Donald Trump leading the Republican presidential field is the fact that Ben Carson is the guy right behind him. While establishment puds like Jeb! Bush and Marco Rubio can’t decide if they want to beat Trump or emulate him, the Good Doctor made it clear this week that he is not only willing to replicate Trump’s signature brand of hot-garbage-spewing, but he’ll say even DUMBER shit. Here is Carson from earlier in the week on the Oregon shooter: It gets worse. This is Clarence Thomas all over again. A black man seeks to rise to a position of power and because he dares to stray from The Liberal Thought Plantation, at every opportunity, including fabricated ones like this, the media piles on to destroy the black apostate as dumb, crazy, scary or a combination of all three. The real idiots here are the Gun Control Truthers on the left, and this includes the mainstream media. They know gun control will do nothing to stop these school shootings. They even admit it. They know that after 12 of these mass-shooting events (not all of them successful, thankfully) that we’re going to have another one soon, and yet the Left is suggesting NOTHING to prevent the next one. Democrats and their media allies keep using piles of dead children to push a gun control agenda that will do nothing to stop the next pile of dead bodies. GQ and CNN and MSNBC have been hammering Carson all week for daring to suggest an actual plan in the event this happens again. It’s not a perfect plan but it could at least the reduce the size of the pile and give these kids a direction that might save some lives. Barack Obama’s plan is for these kids to keep dying. The Democrats’ plan is for these kids to keep dying The media’s plan is for these kids to keep dying. Carson is suggesting the kind of self-reliance in a nothing-to-lose situation that might actually make a difference, and for that he’s being savaged by an elite media that will never do anything other than attempt to destroy a black man who thinks for himself.

Despite forecasting that others would criticize him for speaking about gun legislation after the tragedy, President Obama noted, “This is something we should politicize.” The comments came after at least 13 people were killed in a shooting at a community college in Oregon. In his remarks Thursday evening, the president said other countries had been able to create laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. He said that while Congress had passed “countless laws” aimed at preventing terrorist attacks, some US lawmakers have blocked efforts to collect data on shooting sprees. Advertisement “Somehow this has become routine,” a visibly angry Obama said at the White House. “We are the only civilized country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.” The remarks were the 15th time that Obama has delivered a statement in response to a US mass-casualty shooting, according to a tally kept by Mark Knoller, a reporter for CBS News. The president said he embraced criticism that he was politicizing the violence, and that Americans need to make clear to lawmakers whether they wanted new gun laws. “This is a political choice we make — to allow this to happen every few months in America,” Obama said on Thursday. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.” The president also challenged voters wanting to deal with the problem to vote for elected officials who will do something. ‘‘I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and to save lives and to let young people grow up, and that will require a change of politics on this issue,’’ Obama said. Advertisement At a global summit in New York, Vice President Joe Biden predicted a semi-automatic or automatic weapon was used, basing his guess on the large number of people killed and injured. He also said there’s almost nothing worse than getting a phone call saying, ‘‘Your child is gone,’’ alluding to his own son’s brain cancer death earlier this year.

Surprising new revelations from the Republican frontrunner. What would he do about guns in America? How does he respond to critics of his tax plan? And, what would make him quit the race. We're face-to-face with Donald Trump. Hillary's bad week. Donors, defecting. Her poll numbers, dropping. Can she turn her campaign around? And, gun debate firestorm. This morning, the clash over how to keep America safe heats up. From ABC News, THIS WEEK with George Stephanopoulos begins now. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ANCHOR: Good morning. A lot to get to this week. Our roundtable is standing by to reflect on the latest mass shooting in America. In that tragedy, the first topic I address with Donald Trump. Brand new polls out this morning show him still leading the GOP field and we met in his offices high above Central Park Friday afternoon, just hours after a clearly angry President Obama promised to politicize the issue of gun violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, he's a great divider and, you know, you have a big issue between the Second Amendment folks and the non-Second Amendment folks. And he is a non-Second Amendment person. STEPHANOPOULOS: You think he was being a divider? TRUMP: I think he was. I think he was actually being a divider because, you know, George, no matter how you cut it, you have people that are mentally ill and they have problems and they're going to slip through the cracks. And no matter how you do it, no matter how you try, and if you go back 2,000 years and if you go forward 2 million years, you're going to have problems. And it may not even be politically correct to say - STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, but every country has mentally ill people, not every country has mass shootings as frequently as we do. TRUMP: But what's interesting is the places, you look at Chicago, it's got the toughest gun laws in the United States, you look at other places where they have gun laws that are very tough, they do generally speaking worse than anybody else. I mean if you look at some of these places, Chicago's a good example, but go to Baltimore, go to various cities where they have very, very tough gun laws, they do terribly. STEPHANOPOULOS: So what would you do about it? You sound pretty passive. TRUMP: No, I don't. I'm not passive at all. I can tell you that people say, oh, were going to stop it. It doesn't work that way. This has taken place whether it's this type of crime or other crimes, taken a place forever, from the beginning, and it's going - you go out a million years from now, you're going to have problems. And even if you have a very tough system, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks. And it's a very sad situation and you have to - great vigilance. I mean you have to show great vigilance and watch and be careful and security and everything else. But no matter what you do, you will have problems and that's the way the world goes. You can have - STEPHANOPOULOS: That's your answer, were going to have problems -  TRUMP: Yes, you're going to - now, George, I could say, oh, were going to do this and that and it's never going to happen again. You have sick people in this country and throughout the world and you're always going to have difficulty. That's why you have newscasts. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're Mr. Fix-it. You're Mr. Can-Do. TRUMP: I know that. I know that. And I think I'll do a fabulous job. And I will make things a lot better. No matter what you do, you're going to have difficulties. People are going to slip through the cracks. STEPHANOPOULOS: So no new laws, no new gun laws? TRUMP: Well, the gun laws have nothing to do with this. This isn't guns. This is about really mental illness. And I feel very strongly about it. And, again, politically correct, oh, we're going to solve the problem, there will be no problem, et cetera, et cetera. You're always going to have difficulties, no matter how tight you run it. Even if you had great education having to do with mental illness, you educate the community, it's - still, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks. And these people are more than slipping through the cracks. These people want to slip through the cracks. So you're going to have problems. It's unfortunate. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about your tax plan. TRUMP: Yes. STEPHANOPOULOS: Everyone gets a tax cut. TRUMP: Right. STEPHANOPOULOS: More and more Americans will pay nothing at all. But the Conservative Tax Foundation says it will increase the deficit by about $10 trillion over 10 years. TRUMP: What do they know? George, what do they know? I mean they've been doing this stuff for years. STEPHANOPOULOS: They run the numbers. TRUMP: Can I tell you what? They've been doing this stuff for years. They're so off. You look at their past projections, they are so far off. People - this is a very dynamic plan. STEPHANOPOULOS: So it's not going to increase the deficit? TRUMP: People are going - well, if it works the way I want it to work it's not because we're going to bring back jobs. I am going to bring back so many jobs. One of the things that we're coming out with in the next three or four weeks is cutting. And the cutting is a big part of my plan. STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're going to come up with cuts that will close that hole? TRUMP: We're going to come up with very substantial cuts and - STEPHANOPOULOS: Give me one. TRUMP: The Department of Education. We're going to do cutting. And the economy is going to grow exponentially. STEPHANOPOULOS: You also said that this tax plan is going to cost you a fortune. TRUMP: It will cost me a lot of money. STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you get there? TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what. I have carried interest, like a lot of other people do, and carried interest is a wonderful thing, but it's unfair - STEPHANOPOULOS: But - but - but - but that's - TRUMP: And rich people are getting - STEPHANOPOULOS: That's $20 billion over 10 years for everyone who has it. That's a small - TRUMP: But it's psychologically so important. If the economy grows, we all make it up. I mean, frankly, the job producers make it up. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's - TRUMP: The economy has to grow. STEPHANOPOULOS: Dig into this (INAUDIBLE).  TRUMP: And, by the way, we have to bring back jobs. Also part of my plan. STEPHANOPOULOS: According to your financial disclosure you made, what, about $250 million in the last year? TRUMP: 605 million. STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, 605. The top rate goes from 40 percent to about 25 percent. TRUMP: Right. STEPHANOPOULOS: Capital gains comes down from 23 to 20. TRUMP: Right. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's a huge - that's tens of millions of savings for you. TRUMP: Everybody's going to save, according to my plan, and that money - you know where that money's going? STEPHANOPOULOS: That means you're not going to be spending - you're not going to be paying more taxes though. TRUMP: That money is going back into other things. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're going to get a tax cut? TRUMP: I don't know because I have very big deductions that are frankly some of them are ridiculous. You're entitled to deductions. So I don't know that I am. I think - STEPHANOPOULOS: But not 605 million dollars' worth. TRUMP: I think that probably I'll end up paying more under this. To be honest, I don't think I'm going to. If you look at all of the kinds of deductions that people are allowed to take, that you're not going to be taking anymore, including carried interest, that's just one of them, I think I probably don't do as well. STEPHANOPOULOS: But where your family would make potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, eliminating the estate tax. TRUMP: Well, the estate tax is a different thing. The estate tax is a very, very horrible weapon that has destroyed many families. In particular, farms and things where they make an income and they have a certain value and they have to go out and borrow money and they put mortgages on their farms, they - STEPHANOPOULOS: Twenty farms in the last year. TRUMP: It's a big business. George, if you have a business, and let's say it's a business that's not very liquid, and people have to go out and borrow against the business, you are having travesty. And the other thing is, it's a double taxation. The tax has already been paid. I mean you've been hearing this argument for many years. STEPHANOPOULOS: So your family would benefit but you're saying it's just wrong. TRUMP: No, no, I say it's a double taxation. It's a - it's - the death tax is an unfair tax because the tax has already been paid. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Bottom line, you do accept that you are going to make out well under your tax plan? TRUMP:  I don't know.  /I mean if the economy is good, if the economy is great, everybody makes out well so. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Getting any closer to releasing your tax returns? TRUMP:  Well, I'm thinking about it.  I'm thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary's emails -- you know, I've been saying that for a while, let's find out the true stories... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, that's been your line, but she's been putting some out. TRUMP:  But you know what?  I'm very honest with my tax returns.  (INAUDIBLE)... STEPHANOPOULOS:  What is your tax rate?  TRUMP:  I'm not going to say it, but at some point I'll release it.  But I pay as little as possible, I'm very proud to tell you.  And I will say this, if this country were properly run, where the money wasn't in shambles, where the deals that they make aren't the Iran deal, where we're giving Iran 150 billion dollars and the deal is a disaster in every single possible way, where everything we do is bad, including ObamaCare, which is, by the way, the premiums are up 55 percent for some people. If our country was properly run, I'd almost feel much better about it, and so would a lot of other people. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Let's talk about what... TRUMP:  But I just want to say, I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.  I used to watch Romney - who, by the way, really let us down because he failed to win an election that he should have won easily.  I used to watch him try and get his number as high as possible.  It's not the way it works.  I mean I fight because that's a very big expense.  And one of the problems and one of the reasons I fight so hard is because I hate the way our country is spending my money and everybody else's money. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Let's talk about foreign policy. We've seen Russia go heavy into Syria this week, at least two days... TRUMP:  Yes. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- of airstrikes.  Yesterday, Hillary Clinton; today, John Kasich; both say we should establish a no-fly zone in Syria. Would you do that? TRUMP:  I don't think so.  I think what I want to do is I want to sit back -- and this does not sound like me very much -- but I want to sit back and I want to see what happens.  You know, Russia got bogged down, when it was the Soviet Union, in Afghanistan.  They thought that would be quick and easy and they'll go in and they'll clean it up, they can... STEPHANOPOULOS:  You think he's falling into a trap? TRUMP:  Well, I think it's a -- I think it's not going to be great for them, if you want to know the truth.  But let's just -- look, they got bogged down.  It destroyed the Soviet Union.  I mean they essentially went bankrupt.  They -- it destroyed the Soviet Union, Afghanistan. Now they're going into Syria.  There are so many traps.  There are so many problems.  When I heard they were going in to fight ISIS, I said, ""Great. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But they're TRUMP:   Let them.' STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- not bombing ISIS. TRUMP:  Well, not yet.  But they don't want ISIS going into Russia, either.  So they're not bombing them yet. And the other thing I look at is Assad.  Assad's a bad guy, but they're all bad guys.  We're supporting rebels.  You know, they talk about the Syria Free Rebels.  We're supporting rebels.  We don't even know who they are.  I spoke... STEPHANOPOULOS:  So it's better the devil you know? TRUMP:  Well, I spoke to a general who's very, you know, much on -- he said, ""Mr. Trump, we have no idea who these people are."" They may be worse than Assad.  So we're going to spend all of this effort, all of this -- we'll probably have to go against Iran now.  I mean and Iran, we're making Iran rich and powerful.  You notice Iran now is coming in with the ground troops. They have 150 billion dollars.  All of the sudden they're rich.  The sanctions are gone.  Everything's gone.  What we've done with Iran is one of the most incompetent things I've ever seen.  So now, we have this and we don't -- we -- we're going to fight for people that we don't even know who they are.  Now if you look at Libya, you look at Gadhafi, you look at what's gone on there, you look at Iraq, with Saddam Hussein, I mean do you think we're better off now, because I personally don't? STEPHANOPOULOS:  We still do have this huge refugee situation.  And a few weeks back, you said we'd have to take some in on humanitarian grounds.  But just this week you seemed to reverse it.  You said you're putting people on notice -- I want to quote you here -- ""If I win, they're going back."" So what changed? TRUMP:  Well, ABC was at my speech the other night in New Hampshire.  A totally packed house, 4,000 people.  It was a beautiful thing to see. And I gave a explained -- a very, you know, detailed explanation. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what I want, the explanation. TRUMP:  And I'm going to give it to you right now. When I heard that -- I saw the migration.  The migration was strange to me, because it seems like so many men.  There aren't that many women.  There aren't that many children.  It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men.  These looked like physically strong people. And I'm saying, ""Where are all the women?  Where are all the children?"" OK, and a lot of people... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Half the refugees are children. TRUMP:  By the way, excuse me.  A lot of people have said the same thing. But when I heard we were going to take in 3,000... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right. TRUMP:  -- which was the first number, as you know, then I heard we were going to take in 10,000, I sort of said ""Well, OK."" Now I hear we want to take in 200,000.  We don't know where they're coming from.  We don't know who they are.  They could be ISIS.  It could be the great Trojan Horse.  I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever, since the original.  We don't know where these people -- they have no documentation.  They have no paperwork.  There's no way they can prove where they're coming from. And I'm saying we're going to take in 200,000 people that we have no idea where they come from? And I said I would absolutely not do it.  I have a bigger heart than you do, OK, believe me.  I have a very big heart and I understand the whole thing with migration.  It's a horrible thing.  It should have never happened in the first place.  We screwed up.  This country has screwed up the Middle East so badly, with breaking up Iraq.  We have so destabilized the Middle East.  It is a mess. So I said there's no way they come in.  If they do come in, if I win for president, they're going out.  And I tell them up front if I win -- now, I may not win.  I may not even get the nomination, even though even you will admit I'm leading big league in every poll.  But I may not.  I mean a lot of things happen. If I win, they're going back.  We are not going to take responsibility. Now are they ISIS? Probably not but nobody knows.  And many of them... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Even the kids? TRUMP:  Look, they shouldn't take them In.  Europe should take some probably, because you have the Gulf States.  You have Saudi Arabia.  You have Bahrain.  You have -- you have Qatar.  You have the -- some of the richest countries.  They're not taking any and they're right there, So we're supposed to take 200,000 people that we have no idea who they are? STEPHANOPOULOS:  Two final questions. Your wife Melania, a lot of the country saw her for the first time this week, ""People"" magazine. TRUMP:  Yes.  STEPHANOPOULOS:  Talk about what kind of a first lady she would be.  We've seen a lot of different models -- Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton all had their own styles. Where does she fit? TRUMP:  So Melania is a very beautiful woman both inside and out.  She has got a tremendous heart.  She feels so strongly about the women's health issues, in fact, she knows how strongly I feel about that and she's always pushing me on women's health issues. When Jeb Bush said he's not going to fund women's health issues, that was a terrible -- she couldn't believe it.  And she told me about it when I got home.  He then said he misspoke and he made a mistake and he's going to. But she couldn't believe it.  She would be so great on that.  And so would Ivanka, Ivanka Trump.  She feels the same way.  And they both want me -- they said, dad, you have such respect for women, and they say, you cherish women.  You have such respect for women, you've got to speak more about it, because there's nobody that cares more for women than you.  My mother was one of the great people ever in my life that I've ever met.  And I have just amazing admiration and respect for women. I think Melania would be unbelievable for women and for the country. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Finally, you talked about the polls.  A lot of good polls.  You're still in the lead.  Ratings breaking records every time you go on television.  And this let Dan Hettinger, a ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist yesterday, who says you're a master of timing.  He said it in Atlantic City and says, this is as good as it gets for you.  Quote, ""Mr. Trump should retire the sky box and enjoy what he has wrought."" TRUMP:  Well I've had a lot of fun doing this and I guess it's more fun when you see the kind of polls that I'm getting.  And I think they're now higher than ever.  And a lot of that is dissent.  I mean people are very, very unhappy with what's happened with politicians, how badly they're running the country.  They're all talk no action.  I've dealt with them all my life, believe me.  You know that because you've covered me in my previous life. STEPHANOPOULOS:  A long time. TRUMP:  You've covered me for a long time. But I'm really enjoying what I'm doing.  And I think we're having a very big impact.  And one thing I'll say, a lot of people are watching that would not be watching.  When you look at the debates, when you look at CNN, with 23 or 24 million people, they may have had a couple of million or four million, maybe.  You look at Fox, with 24 plus million people. So I think I'm doing a great -- I think I'm doing a great service. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But you've also said that you're not a masochist. So if the polls do start to turn around, do you get out before you get beat? TRUMP:  Well it's not a question of polls. If I felt that I was doing badly, if I felt that the polls were -- and I think polls are reflective, I mean right now I love polls because I'm winning everything -- I'm even winning-we just got one from Florida, I'm killing the governor and the senator from Florida I mean it's been amazing.  Texas winning.  Winning everything, winning every state, winning every national poll and big lead.  If that changed, and that went in a different direction and if I thought that I wasn't going to win, like there are numerous people running, they're not going to win, okay?  I would certainly want to get out.  I'm not a masochist.  I'm not somebody that needs to do this for other reasons.  If I thought I was doing poorly I would think I would want to do it. Now, I will say, right now I'm loving it, I'm having a lot of fun. And the most important thing is it's not a question of like, it's a question, I want to make America great again.  We can make it great again George.  And I think we can actually make it better than ever before.  I've never said that but I think we can make it better than ever before.  And that's what I'm most excited about.  Not polls, I'm excited about the endgame, the endgame is making this country great again. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANOPOULOS:  All right, thanks to Donald Trump. Much more ahead on This Week, will anything change after America's latest mass shooting.  Chris Christie is here live.  And after another tough week for Hillary, can comedy help her turn the corner. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Every month, another mass shooting.  Our roundtable reflects a soul numbing cycle of violence in just two minutes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There's been another mass shooting in America.  We may never understand what leaves anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this.  Such violence, such evil, is senseless. We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years.  And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would as a parent. I've had to make statements like this too many times.  Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times.  I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's President Obama speaking out for the 15th time, 15 mass shootings on his watch. Let's talk about it now on our roundtable.  Joined by Greta Van Susteren from Fox News, Matt Bai, national political columnist for Yahoo News, and two leading members of congress Republican Tom Cole, Democrat Keith Ellison. And Greta, let me begin with you.  You saw the president so angry, so frustrated on Thursday.  He said this is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS:  Well, it is -- I don't think it's a political choice, but it's now become a political issue. Look, everyone is on the same page on this... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Everyone is on the same page? VAN SUSTEREN:  No, no.  To the sense every single person wants this to stop, this violence.  Every single person.  And so some call for gun control.  And I think that's in some ways unrealistic.  When I practiced law in the District of Columbia, very strict gun laws.  And every single one of my clients could get a gun.  The guns are out there.  They are all over.  And you can create all the laws you want, but all the guns are out there.  They're going to be coming in through black markets.  And so we're not being very realistic that all of a sudden putting -- changing the laws is going to change anything.  The guns are there.  If you really want to regulate you've got to be a little bit smarter, maybe regulate ammunition so that people can't use their guns. That's the smart thing. But I think we're being a little bit unrealistic about this.  There -- and part of the problem is that the politicians on both sides of the aisle -- due respect, sir, both you gentlemen -- is that they take sides.  They're not looking for solutions.  Everyone wants to fund-raise off this.  The anti-gun people want to fund-raise and the pro-gun want to fund raise -- (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Any change coming out of this? COLE:  You know, I hope the changes in the mental health area, quite frankly.  My friend, Tim Murphy, who's a congressman, has a great piece of legislation -- (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mental health professional as well. COLE:  -- doctorate in psychology, but you know, he has a great saying.  He said the problem's not what's in their hand; it's what's in their head. And we have a -- not taken advantage of the amount -- the billions of dollars we spend -- STEPHANOPOULOS:  How do you answer the question? Every single country in the world has crazy people. ELLISON:  That's right.  That's right. Absolutely.  I mean, look, we are leading the world on these -- in these gun deaths.  And we're not doing anything about it.  And people argue that, because we can't stop every gun death, we can't stop any.  That's not true. We could do background checks.  Ninety percent of Americans believe that we can.  We can eliminate these high-capacity magazines that allow people to -- allow them to spray a whole theater or something like that. There's a lot of things that we can do that we need to do. We let -- should let the CDC give us statistics on how bad this gun carnage is. VAN SUSTEREN:  What are you going to do about the fact that there's so many guns out there, that there's such a huge black -- I'm not getting into laws.  We're so strict against my clients, but they always find (ph) guns. ELLISON:  Because we -- because they come across the boundary, that's what.  So we've got to have -- VAN SUSTEREN:  But they're still going to. ELLISON:  -- so we've got to -- no.  That's -- we've got to do more than just city by city.  This is something where we need a national policy, and we've got to treat it like it is a health issue, a disease, which it is -- STEPHANOPOULOS:  Matt Bai, the president did something there that, I mean, it does seem to be almost a ritual that we all participate in after this kind of violence, you know, we see the sides break down.  We give it the coverage.  We talk about who the shooter was.  We focus on the victim.  Nothing changes. BAI:  Nothing changes because in partly because we're having the wrong debate.  This is the wrong debate to me.  I mean, it -- there -- we're conflating a couple of different issues, because there's this debate about gun safety and what do you with guns, regulating ammunition, gun crime.  There's things you can do around that and the gun lobby's blocked it and maybe it would have some effect. This is a very specific thing.  This is what we saw in Arizona; it's what we saw in Connecticut.  It's what we saw this week.  It is a clearly mentally ill person who has signaled violence, has access to a lot of weapons, who, for some reason, gets to keep those weapons, either because the people around them and the people who see it feel powerless to stop it or just won't do anything about it or are in some kind of denial.  And in this case, right, when we talk about civil liberties, say post 9/11, we have -- we've had a very robust debate about civil liberties versus national security.  This comes down to an issue of civil liberties. How do you balance them?  The clear mental instability of someone who has access to guns against civil liberty laws, they keep you from going in and taking them away.  That's the debate we need to have -- STEPHANOPOULOS:  We saw the shooter's father lamenting yesterday about how he -- how could he possibly have 14 guns?  And you're talking about -- VAN SUSTEREN:  But he hasn't seen his son in 10 years.  He's not a very attentive father. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Two years I think it was.  But if you're going to focus on mental health, what could be done?  Should there be forces -- ? (CROSSTALK) COLE:  -- legislation, you know, in Congress right now.  And that's -- we should begin in places where we can agree.  You know, Republicans and Democrats don't have to fight about mental health.  They can agree on mental health. You know, I would argue, picking up Tim Murphy's -- you know, which would be the first significant federal legislation in this area in decades and moving that forward in a bipartisan way, that's a real -- (CROSSTALK) ELLISON:  I think we should move ahead on mental health.  But I think we should move ahead on it with the idea that we're going to solve some of the problem with that and there's other things that we can do.  And throwing up our hands and saying that this is not just fate and it's in the hearts of human depravity and will never be fixed is just a defeatist attitude and it's wrong. VAN SUSTEREN:  You know, I think we're underestimating the fact that there's a lot of evil out there.  You know, people are sort of, you know, (INAUDIBLE) excuse and say it's mental health, there's an awful lot of -- ELLISON:  -- everywhere -- VAN SUSTEREN:  -- well, no, no; I'm saying this.  But I'm saying this -- ELLISON:  -- an American problem.  We're worse than nobody on -- VAN SUSTEREN:  I'm not saying that. But I'm saying you know this, that, you know, this is also there's an awful lot of evil.  We -- and look at even, I mean, it's glorified in our culture, but you look -- you turn on the TV or video games and the big hero's coming in with a shot -- or with the assault weapon -- (CROSSTALK) BAI:  -- call it evil, call it mental health, when somebody signals they have violent intentions and deep depression and they have 15 guns and access to 15 guns and nobody takes them away and nobody says anything, you have a problem, there ought to be a policy, yes, there ought to be a federal policy effort to try and fix that problem because it just keeps happening. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's the last word for now.  We're going to come back in a little bit.  Chris Christie here live as well and the roundtable later is going to take on a tough week for Hillary Clinton and the top candidate for House Speaker. Plus Bill O'Reilly on his new best seller, ""Killing Reagan."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?  But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee.  What are her numbers today?  Her numbers are dropping. Why?  Because she's untrustable (sic).  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Today, here, I am announcing my intention to run for Speaker of the House of Representatives.  We were entrusted by the American people with the largest majority the Republicans have ever had since Babe Ruth was swinging a baseball bat.  But they didn't send us here to perpetuate the status quo. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Brand new polls this morning show Bernie Sanders continue to gain on Hillary Clinton. So did she turn the corner on ""Saturday Night Live""? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All anyone wants to talk about is Donald Trump. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  Donald Trump?  Isn't he the one that's like, ugh, you're all losers? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think he'll win the primaries? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He must.  I want to be the one to take him down.  I will destroy him and I will mount his hair in the (INAUDIBLE). (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  And when we come back, the roundtable weighs in on that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS: There is record rainfall on the East Coast this morning. You see the dangerous flooding there in South Carolina, one of six states declaring emergencies, including New Jersey. I'm joined now by that state's governor and presidential candidate Chris Christie. Thanks for joining us this morning, governor. And, of course, those images bring Sandy to mind. Are you ready for this one? And what's the biggest lesson you take away from that experience? GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, we - we were ready. We're lucky we dodged a bullet in New Jersey this time that we didn't dodge three years ago. The biggest lesson you learn is, George, you cannot prepare enough and you cannot prepare soon enough. You need to get provisions in place. You need to get evacuation plans set. You need to get yourself resilient and protected against loss of power and loss of major governmental function. We did all that. We learned that from Sandy and we were ready. But, believe me, I'm glad I was ready and nothing happened. I've been through when it happened. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about this gun debate and so tragic coming out of Oregon. You just heard Donald Trump say, you know, sometimes people fall through the cracks. And he also questioned whether tough gun laws make a difference. But look at your state. It has some of the toughest gun laws and one of the lowest murder rates. Isn't there a correlation? CHRISTIE: I don't - George, I don't think there is. But I'll tell you this, I'm very concerned about the mental health side of this and I put forward a proposal to the legislature last year and then again just about seven or eight weeks ago in response to a bill they sent saying, let's do some tough things on mental health. Let's make involuntary commitment of people who speak violently easier for doctors. STEPHANOPOULOS: So you would do that? CHRISTIE: I would. And I - and I've heard doctors in my state say, the laws are so difficult and murky. Let's work on those kinds of things. I think that makes sense.  But let's remember something else, in many of the places around this country where they have the toughest gun laws, they have the highest violent crime rates. And we focus on a tragedy like this. It's an awful tragedy. It's terrible. But it is the exception to violence in America. Violence in America that's happened on our streets in our cities, like Chicago, up 19 percent, the murder rate. New York, up 11 percent. And you have some of the most aggressive gun laws in cities like that. STEPHANOPOULOS: But - but - CHRISTIE: So let's enforce the law. There's lawlessness out there, George, that we are not enforcing the law in the (INAUDIBLE) ways we should. And as a former prosecutor, I believe we should. STEPHANOPOULOS: But there's no question the pace of mass shootings is accelerating, happening more frequently than anywhere else. If it's not the gun, then what is it? What is the answer? What is so unique about American culture and American psychology? CHRISTIE: It's a really complex problem, but I think it's about the mental health issues, George, and I don't think we're as aggressive as we should be. And that's why I put the proposals for New Jersey. And here's the bad thing about the politics of this. I heard our congressman on here before saying we should be able to agree on that. I've put this proposal forward twice and my legislature, a Democratic legislature in New Jersey, has ignored it. You know why? Because it doesn't create headlines. It's not taking away anybody's guns. It doesn't create a headline. So they don't want to deal with it. They tried to override a veto of - of a bill that I put forward when my substitute bill was to get tougher on mental health. Maybe this morning the legislature in New Jersey will see what happened in Oregon and get tougher on the mental health issues to help these folks. We don't want to involuntarily commit them, to put them away. We want to protect others and get them the help they need. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about Syria. Vladimir Putin going in aggressively this week, two or three days of air strikes. You heard Donald Trump right there. He sort of says, maybe it's OK, maybe to have Putin go in and do that, fight. You heard President Obama also this week. He believes that Putin's making a mistake and could fall into a quagmire. Are they right about that? If you were president, what would you do? CHRISTIE: Well, Donald should be concerned that he's agreeing with Barack Obama, because just when you think it can't get worse, it does. And just when you think this foreign policy can't cost more to the American people, it does. We don't need to be friends with Vladimir Putin and we don't need to be worried about whether he's in a quagmire. After 40 years, we allowed Russia back into the Middle East. And now who are they partnered with? Iran. STEPHANOPOULOS: So how do you push them out? CHRISTIE: Oh, listen, you should be - first, they should never be. But now that he's there, America's got to re-establish its presence in that area. We should be the ones leading the fight on ISIS. And by the way, we know Putin's not fighting ISIS. Putin's there to prop up Assad. After he told him - STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you put in a no-fly zone?  CHRISTIE: Absolutely. And I'll tell you this, there's now 300,000 nearly dead in Syria because of Assad and now Putin is going in and teaming with the Iranians to prop up Assad. Only Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could mess up this foreign policy that badly. And anybody who agrees with allowing the Russians into the Middle East is just painfully naive. STEPHANOPOULOS: Showing a little progress in the campaign. You had a good performance at the last debate. New polls out this morning show you picking up a couple of points in both Iowa and New Hampshire. We're going to show you this from the (INAUDIBLE) poll. It came out just this weekend. It shows an interesting trend line asking Republican voters what they want. Back in March, it was kind of - it was split evenly, those who wanted someone with experience and a proven record, some with new ideas and a different approach. Look what's happened since the campaign began skyrocketing for new ideas and a different approach. What does that tell you and can you meet that test given the fact that you've sort of been running on your experience and record? CHRISTIE: No, I haven't been running on my experience and records. George, in fact, I'm the most detailed person with future plans in this campaign of anyone. You know this. We've given five major policy speeches that laid out specifically what we do, because you know what, the people out there in the audience, they don't care about what I've done. They care about what I'm going to do for them going forward as president of the United States. It's like I said at the debate, they don't want an agreement between Carly and Donald about who declared bankruptcy more, who's lost money more, who's gained more money. They're all successful. That's great. Congratulations. But for the 45-year-old unemployed construction worker out there, you know what he wants to know, how are we going to improve this economy, how are we going to keep his family safe from terrorism? And those are all about those things. Campaigns are about tomorrow, not about yesterday. My campaign is about tomorrow and a greater America tomorrow. That's why we've laid out the plans we have. STEPHANOPOULOS: You heard Donald Trump there. You think he's in for the long haul? CHRISTIE: Who knows? You know, I mean, listen, the - who would have ever thought Scott Walker would have dropped out already. So these campaigns, as you know, are very personal in nature, as well as being a national event. That every candidate has to make that decision for themselves. When have they had enough? Are they willing to continue to push forward? Here's what people know about me. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say every day.  And I've done that for six years as governor and seven years before that as U.S. attorney. And of all the people on that stage, I guarantee you, George, you'd agree with this, no one has been more tested than me.  No one. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You've had a lot of tests. There seem to be two different campaigns going on.  You have the outsiders Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Ben Carson.  You, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich who have all served in government.  What sets you apart in that second group? CHRISTIE:  What sets me apart is that I've worked in one of the most hostile areas you never work as a Republican in the state of New Jersey where every day I wake up as an outsider.  And you know what I've done?  I've not only gotten things done like pension reform and tenure reform that people said could never get done, but also I've vetoed more than 400 bills.  And every one of those vetoes has been sustained.  That shows I can keep the Republican Party together.  Maybe they should send me the House caucus to try to help them with that. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You're not running for speaker now, are you? CHRISTIE:  I am not, sir, no.  I would rather jump off the Brooklyn bridge than be in congress.  And secondly, Americans for Tax Reform just said this, George, two weeks ago. I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.  And because of that, and every one of those vetoes being sustained, taxes are better.  What people want in Washington is someone who knows how to do two things at once: stand up and say this is where I am, who I am, to say what I mean and mean what I say.  And then also to be able to get people in a room and say, OK, now that we've set that out, let's get something done. And that's what I'll do.  That's what I've done in New Jersey.  Everyone else has had Republican legislatures on that list.  I'm the only guy with a Democratic legislature that's brought people together. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Chris Christie, thanks very much. Coming up, the battle over speaker of the house.  Did front-runner Kevin McCarthy throw Hillary a lifeline this week?  Can she stop the Bernie Sanders surge.  Our powerhouse roundtable weighs in. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) CALIFORNIA:  Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?  But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee.  What are her numbers today?  Her numbers are dropping.  Why?  Because she's untrustable. REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, (R) UTAH:  Today, here, I am announcing my intention to run for speaker of the House of Representatives.  We were entrusted by the American people with the largest majority the Republicans have ever had since Babe Ruth was swinging the baseball bat.  But they didn't send us here to perpetuate the status quo. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS:  Chris Christie not running for speaker, but there are two candidates right there: Kevin McCarthy and Jason Chaffetz. Let's talk about this on our roundtable right now. Congressman Tom Cole, you're a supporter of Kevin McCarthy.  We just saw that comment got so much notice this week where he seemed to be saying that the Benghazi committee was working because it's driving down Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. COLE:  Oh, it probably wasn't his most artful moment as the speaker, but frankly... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not speaker yet. COLE:  ...as a tempest in a teapot, I really do.  I don't think it's going to change what happens in terms of what people decide.  And I just think... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Aren't your colleagues concerned about it, though, your Republican colleagues? COLE:  No, I don't think so.  I think some people are using it as an opening to get in the race.  That's fine.  This is politics.  Hardball sport.  But I don't think it's going to change how anybody votes. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Matt Bai, you pointed out this week in your column that in some ways the Kevin McCarthy is running for a different job than speakers used to run for, that the parties in the House have  become oppositional.  BAI:  Yeah, I mean now the wave keeps sweeping in -- parties opposed the president.  And what you have is instead of a speaker who is traditionally literally speaking for the House and acting the will of the House in negotiations with the White House, you have speakers who are essentially who are at the pinnacle of resistance.  They seem to be resistance leaders. And there's a conflict.  If you're a guy like John Boehner or I think Kevin McCarthy who has some aspiration to governor, you find yourself in a position where your main job is to stop an agenda or roll one back.  I think it's almost impossible, as I said in that column, to do the job and to keep it. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And this congress, Greta, as another government shutdown could be looming in December. VAN SUSTEREN:  Oh, yes.  President Obama has said that he does not intend to sign any more short-term spending bills, either, which creates a problem for the House as well.  Although I think that he will if one is put on his desk. But let me just talk about that Kevin McCarthy statement for a second is if you step back for a second, look at Chairman Gowdy, he's a pretty straight arrow. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Benghazi committee. VAN SUSTEREN:  Of the Banghazi committee about which Kevin McCarthy speaks.  Chairman Gowdy is a straight arrow.  So far he has -- I think he'd take -- I think he would disagree with Kevin McCarthy about it being political.  He has requested documents.  And he's asking questions of people. So I think while there's criticism of Kevin McCarthy's statement, which was not a good one, is I think you've got to look at how Chairman Gowdy is conducting the committee so far. ELLISON:  This thing is political from the beginning to this moment, $4.5 million we've spent on this thing. Hey, look, let's shut it down.  Let's shut it down now.  It is improper.  And if the one member were to use their office to campaign, to try to drive somebody else's numbers down from the congressional office, that would be an ethics violation... STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think you'd concede it's not going to get shut down (inaudible) when Hillary is going to have to go before that. ELLISON:  The American people should demand it be shut down right now. VAN SUSTEREN:  But wait a second, you've got to understand is that in order to get to the bottom of it, you have to have all the documents.  And the State Department has not provided all the documents. ELLISON:  ...the documents from a ruse select committee from the very beginning?  Documents for what? COLE:  No, it's not.  I mean, (inaudible) produced and found important information.  We wouldn't know about the server if it wasn't for this.  They're continuing... (CROSSTALK) COLE: ...it's been systematically, appropriately and properly run by the chairman.  There have been no complaints about this. ELLISON:  If Democrats did this, there would be outrage.  This is a fishing expedition. VAN SUSTEREN:  Congressman, it's got to be transparency on all these issues.  I don't know how the chips are going to fall either way.  Congressman Gowdy, Chairman Gowdy, has the obligation to do it right. I don't know, it may come out exonerating -- it may exonerate. ELLISON:  It is not serious, by the admission of the majority leader.  STEPHANOPOULOS:  It does give Hillary a talking point when she goes and testifies on October 22.  And coming after this week, she is going to need something.  We saw these incredible crowds for Bernie Sanders again.  Last night 20,000 people in Boston, Massachusetts, raised almost as much money as she did the last quarter.  Does it cause you to revise your view at all on his staying power and what could do to this race? BAI:  Not that much.  Look, I've always been, you know, a little more skeptical about her chances than other people.  I think it's a tough race. But, look, I think if you're Hillary Clinton, and I do think it's a flawed campaign and she's a flawed candidate, every night you go to sleep and Bernie Sanders is the guy who is your main competition you've having a good day, because there is a tradition of Democratic frontrunners having very ideological, not necessarily electable, you know, opponents who rile up the base and give them a good run for their money but can't win nationally.  And I think Bernie Sanders probably fits into that category.  He's not Barack Obama. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Is it a good day if he exposes enough weakness to drive Joe Biden into the race. BAI:  Well, no, that's a very bad day.  And that -- I think if you are the Clinton team that is -- has got to be your greater concern.  You are always going to have a challenger, you are always going to have a base in rebellion at some point.  If Bernie Sanders is the instrument for that rebellion you've got to consider yourself... STEPHANOPOULOS:  What do you think of that argument? ELLISON:  Well, here's what I think of that argument, I think that -- I like the idea that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and O'Malley and Biden are all competing to help out the American worker, the American family.  I like that.  I mean they all are -- I mean Bernie is doing because he's talking about the economic -- the bread and butter issues that people are feeling every day.  Hillary is trying to do the same thing. I mean look at the other side.  They're competing on do you like Mexicans a lot, you know, should Muslims be the president, all this kind of crazy stuff. I think the field, the competition is a good thing.  I think it brings out the best in all of them.  I think it's going to actually help Hillary Clinton.  And I think it's going to happen Bernie... (CROSSTALK) ELLISON:  -- whoever we end up with. VAN SUSTEREN:  You know, the thing that -- Hillary Clinton, though, has a -- a huge weapon come this debate if she can drive it home to the American people that Senator Bernie Sanders has been talking about this stuff for the last 30 years but done -- but accomplished zero on it.  And that's important, that he hasn't accomplished anything, that he's a big talker. I think that's a problem for Senator Bernie Sanders... ELLISON:   You know, speaking... VAN SUSTEREN:  -- (INAUDIBLE). ELLISON:  -- speaking to people's reality is doing something, in my opinion.  I mean Bernie Sanders has done a tremendous service to this race by talking to what people feel. No matter who the nominee is... VAN SUSTEREN:  But has he actually... ELLISON:  -- I mean... VAN SUSTEREN:  -- delivered on anything? Secretary Clinton... ELLISON:   You know... VAN SUSTEREN:  -- is in a far better position than Bernie Sanders. ELLISON:  I think that's a reasonable thing to argue, but I also think that this is a primary nominee race and the issue is to put things on the table that are important to people. (CROSSTALK)  ELLISON:  People will make choices. (CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN:  You've got to be able to deliver. (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- you've got (INAUDIBLE) over on the... (CROSSTALK) COLE:   Well, I'm heading up Republicans for Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nominee.  So it would be, I think... (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  But how about, if you look at the polls right now on the Republican side, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, one, two and three. Are any one of those three going to be the nominee? COLE:  In my opinion, I don't -- I honestly don't know.  I've never seen it this volatile.  But I think this idea that they're -- those three merge into one is very unlikely.  I think there's a big difference between a Ben Carson supporter and a Donald Trump supporter and a Fiorina supporter.  They're very different styles... (CROSSTALK) COLE:  -- very different kinds of candidates. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And what does it tell you that -- that Donald Trump has held on, on top for so long? COLE:   Well, I think he's tapped into something that's real out there, which is anger at the political establishment, frustration that Washington seems gridlocked.  And, you know, the guy clearly is a gifted communicator, a flamboyant figure.  He attracts attention. So he's got a lot of skills. The real question is whose second choice is he? Who will move toward him in these other camps? And I think there's an assumption out there that the other outsiders will.  I just find that hard to believe.  I think they'll move in different directions. VAN SUSTEREN:  And it sure shows how pundits are wrong, because they said that Trump would be out. COLE:   Absolutely. VAN SUSTEREN:  Boy, I'll tell you, it sure... COLE:   Absolutely. (CROSSTALK) VAN SUSTEREN:  -- it's an indictment of pundits who have said that Trump was out. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And he is still on top. We've got to take a break right there. Up next, dangerous new developments in Afghanistan this week.  Two experts here to weigh in on that. Plus, Bill O'Reilly and his new best-seller, after this from our ABC stations. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) STEPHANOPOULOS:  New and tragic developments from the war in Afghanistan this morning.  There you see the destruction from U.S. bombs that hit a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Kunduz.  Nineteen people, including three children, killed in the strike.  The Afghan president says the U.S. has apologized.  President Obama promising a full investigation.  Another blow in a week where the Taliban claimed control of that city. We're joined now by two experts who served the U.S. in top foreign policy jobs.  Meghan O'Sullivan for President Bush, now with the Council on Foreign Relations; and Anne-Marie Slaughter at the State Department under President Obama and now president of The New America Foundation and author of the new book, ""Unfinished Business."" Congratulations on that. Let's begin with Afghanistan. Anne-Marie, let me begin with you. You've seen these Taliban advances this week, another tragic error with this air strike. Is the United States going to have to rethink the withdrawal timetable? Meghan, could you hear me? MEGHAN O'SULLIVAN, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS:  Oh, yes, I could hear you.  Sorry.  I -- I thought you were directing that to Anne-Marie.  The short answer is yes, this is a tragedy that we saw in Kunduz, but it's one that has broader implications.  It underscores what the Pentagon -- a Pentagon report concluded just a few months ago, and that is that the Afghanistan troops are going to struggle to maintain their positions without coalition support. And that is the sort of assessment upon which we should base our withdrawal or our staying in Afghanistan, not an arbitrary political time line. So what I'd like to see is the president keep the capabilities that the United States and the Afghans need to protect our interests there in order for the next president to be in a position to continue to do that, because that will be necessary out from 2017 and beyond. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The president has been so reluctant to do that. ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER, PRESIDENT, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION:  Well, I have to say, I think I agree with him.  This has been our longest war, in Afghanistan.  We've had thousands of Americans killed, 20,000 wounded and hundreds of thousands of Afghans. And we aren't going, in the end, to be able to save the Afghan government if they can't fight it for themselves. The worst thing about this kind of an attack is that it loses us the support of the Afghan people.  And without that, the Afghan government can't win and we can't win for them. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We also saw this week, of course, the president showing great reluctance to go in in a new and heavy way into Syria, as well, exposing a bit of a split between him and your old boss... SLAUGHTER:  Yes. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- Hillary Clinton, who's for a no-fly zone. Who's right on that? SLAUGHTER:  Hillary Clinton is unquestionably right on that.  I've been calling for this for three years.  Look, Russia is in there propping up a government that that has killed hundreds of thousands of its own people and we have to have actually act in a way -- the no-fly zones will reduce the bloodshed, because it will stop barrel bombs, it will reduce the flow of refugees, because you're -- you've got corridors for them to be in no-fly zones. And, critically, it will force Assad to the negotiating table, and then we can get a political solution.  And it will give Russia something to think about, because right now, Russia has got open season. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Do you agree with that? O'SULLIVAN:  I agree with that completely.  And I would say we need to look at this development on the part of Russia beyond simply the context of the Syrian conflict, which, for all the reasons Anne-Marie suggested, we need more forceful action. But we need to see this move in the context of what it means in the broader region. This is about the United States in some large part.  This is the most serious and direct challenge to America's global position in decades. And the United States needs to see it in that context and it needs to see this as Russia's beginning move to try to establish itself... STEPHANOPOULOS:  But now Russia, as the president said, acting out of weakness? O'SULLIVAN:  I do not see that -- I don't agree with the assessment that I've heard from the administration that this is going to necessarily or inevitably work out badly for Russia.  That's possible, but that's certainly not a conclusion that we can come to at this point.  And to assume that this initiative is going to collapse on its own weight is to really disregard an important strategic moment that demands an American response along the lines that Anne-Marie mentioned.  STEPHANOPOULOS:  The president used that word quagmire. SLAUGHTER:  Yes.  But Meghan is absolutely right.  I mean it may be a quagmire over the long-term, but over the long-term, this war is spilling into Turkey, into Jordan, into Iraq.  It is basically engulfing the Middle East. We can't just stand by.  We have to act in a way that gets a political solution. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And that's going to have to be the last word today. Thank you both very much. And in today's Sunday Spotlight, Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News star, has hit number one on the best-seller list again, this time with ""Killing Reagan,"" a new look at how that failed assassination attempt by John Hinckley dramatically transformed the Reagan White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Reagan was on a roll. REAGAN:  There you go again. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   He was elected president.  He defeated Jimmy Carter.  He's in.  They love him.  And then he's on his back on a gurney and he doesn't know whether he's going to live. What happens after that was kept from the American public. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was kept? BILL O'REILLY, HOST, ""THE O'REILLY FACTOR"":  Reagan was profoundly changed, psychologically and physiologically.  His health was affected and so was his mind.  And this -- the come back that he made is startling.  And the things that happened in that White House were kept shrouded from the public. And everybody felt he was OK.  You saw him in his bathrobe with Nancy cracking wise and everybody was ah, he's going to make it. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And people loved seeing that. O'REILLY:  Right.  But behind the scenes, everything changed.  On his good days, he was as brilliant and much smarter than the public thought he was. On his bad days, he couldn't even come down from the residence.  He was watching (INAUDIBLE). STEPHANOPOULOS:  How do you square your theory with -- I remember reading when it came out just a couple of years ago, ""The Reagan Letters."" And over the course of the presidency, they show a man who was still a clear, at times brilliant, writer.  He seemed to be there. O'REILLY:  There's no disparaging, because on his good days, he was all of that.  But it was the bad days that people didn't know about.  And there came a point in the second term where they might have removed him.  Baker was the chief of staff.  James Cannon investigated whether the president could still carry out his duties.  And then there was this -- and that's the linchpin of the book -- this meeting.  Reagan came down and they actually gave him a quiz.  And if he hadn't passed it, they were going to move against him. Unbelievable (INAUDIBLE)... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Play that out. So what if he didn't pass? What would have happened? They wouldn't have moved (INAUDIBLE)... O'REILLY:  I think they would have moved. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How? O'REILLY:  They spent a lot of time on this investigation and James Cannon complied a lot of data about Ronald Reagan and his failure to lock in on Iran-Contra and other things that were happening.  And they were very concerned. And they loved him.  And they were so relieved when he took over.  And I believe it was the communist thing that brought him back. REAGAN:  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. O'REILLY:  I mean he was so adamant about defeating the Soviet Union. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Tear down that wall. O'REILLY:  He had to defeat them.  And that gave him the motivation.  STEPHANOPOULOS:  You know, the family is not too happy with you.  Michael Reagan, on Facebook, ""It would have been nice if O'Reilly would have consulted the Reagans who were there when our father was shot.  Just saying."" O'REILLY:  Michael Reagan wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  And I like Michael Reagan contrary to... STEPHANOPOULOS:  You love don't this, don't you? O'REILLY:  Oh, it's great.  It's great.  I'm a historian.  I taught high school history.  I love history.  And now, I'm writing it so everybody reads it.  And I'm the luckiest guy in the world. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Bill O'Reilly, thanks very much. O'REILLY:  All right, George. (END VIDEO TAPE) STEPHANOPOULOS:  And now we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice. In September, two service members were killed overseas supporting the fight against ISIS and the Taliban. And that is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us.

And that's abnormal, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. The tracker was created by the moderators of the pro-gun control subreddit Guns Are Cool. It tracks every instance in the US in which a gun is used to kill or injure four or more people at one time. As of October 2, there have been 294 mass shootings in 275 days in 2015. Those shootings have claimed the lives of 380 people. No more than eight days this year have passed without a mass shooting. The tracker's definition of a mass shooting differs slightly from the official FBI definition, which says that an event qualifies as a mass shooting if four or more people are killed. ""The most obscene incidents of gun violence usually do not make the mainstream news at all,"" Guns Are Cool reasons on the Reddit page for the Mass Shooting Tracker. ""Why? Because their definition is incorrect. The mainstream news meaning of 'mass shooting' should more accurately be described as 'mass murder.'"" Based on these numbers, President Barack Obama's claim that these kind of events have become ""routine"" rings true. ""The reporting is routine, my response here at this podium is routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it — we've become numb to this,"" a visibly frustrated Obama said Thursday at the White House in the hours after the Oregon shooting. He added: ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experiences as president, I can't guarantee that, and that is a terrible thing.""",2015-10-02 11:21:20,The US is averaging more than one mass shooting per day in 2015,,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

704,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/mbgWD7t9WvQ/,"On September 18 an Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) SWAT team arrested 21-year-old Leslie Allen Merritt Jr. over alleged connections to the Phoenix freeway shootings that have haunted commutes since August 29. DPS officials could not provide details on Merritt on the day of his arrest, and law enforcement has been clear that the investigation is ongoing. Police say that Merritt’s gun has been linked forensically to only four of the eleven vehicles shot, apparently randomly, on Interstate 10. Local affiliate ABC15 reports, Merritt had “has had prior criminal charges and family trouble” based on court recordings showing a failure to stop at a traffic accident, dropped assault charges, and several family court cases. A now-deleted Facebook page appearing to belong to the suspect gives a glimpse of a blue-collar family man who often expresses passionate anti-government beliefs based on extreme conspiracy theories. Issue by issue, his politics appear more right-wing than left, but Merritt’s anti-government posts veer into anti-law enforcement territory more in keeping with Black Lives Matter than mainstream conservatism. Beginning September 4th, Merritt begins to post prolifically multiple times a day to his account after a nearly week-long pause after August 29th, the day of the first freeway shooting. He shares many images and memes to his wall, often without commentary and sometimes with conflicting messages, making his views on certain issues more murky. Several topics are crystal clear: Merritt is strongly anti-gun control, pro-military, and anti-Islam. He shares a meme saying “stomp on” people who stomp on American flags and criticizes the government for enforcing regulations on hunting more strictly than immigration laws. On political candidates and parties, Merritt has posts mocking Hillary Clinton, mocking Obama, mocking Donald Trump, and refusing to be identified with either Democrats or Republicans. However, Merritt did post Ben Carson’s announcement that he was running for president–without commentary for or against it. On some social issues, Merritt does not fit a simple mold. One image on his wall attacks Republicans for shaming people on food stamps, depicting an amputee veteran as a recipient. Another image he shares asks why “white pride” is deemed racist while various other ethnic prides are not; however, he also shares a photo mocking Fox News–a massive collage of blonde, white Fox contributors with the caption “Fox News will now describe the lack of racism in America.” Further undermining a possibility of white supremacist ideology, Merritt is in a relationship with a Hispanic woman, who he refers to as his wife; he says they have been together for five years and they have children together. Merritt’s politics also push to the fringe of anarchist and libertarian thought. He is a member of a group called “conspiracy lovers” and fixates on topics in line with fans of Ron Paul or Infowars. His last post shared before his arrest calls for the legalization of marijuana in Arizona. Several days earlier, he posted a meme that says, “It’s Common Knowledge That Wars Are Fought Over Oil Resources. What’s Not Common Knowledge Is That Hemp Can Do Anything That Oil Does. Which Means That Legalizing Cannabis Can Literally Stop Wars.” Another meme, shared from a group critical of agricultural giant Monsanto, decries the use of pesticides. His views toward government go beyond animosity to extreme paranoia. Some of the headlines he shares claim that a “secret government” controls the world, that the U.S. government might be spreading plague among its citizens, and that the military may have forced RFID chip implants on Texas residents during the Jade Helm operation. He posts a video of a military plane, referencing Jade Helm again. Even after a friend explains that it is a supply plane for military bases and that the operation is over, Merritt responds, “Government after everyone bro watch out.” Merritt doesn’t appear to be a big fan of the cops. One photo on his wall declares opposition to police becoming more militarized; another shows a police cruiser being towed out of sand with the caption: “pulled pork.” One photo, purportedly taken himself, shows a gathering of cop cars in a parking lot. “Nice to see my hard earned taxes spent right hahaha,” he writes. “7cops chillin wonder how much they make to sit there.” On several occasions, he touches on the idea of violent uprising against the government. One meme states, “The government is not afraid of guns. The government is afraid of us.” Another references the Battle of Athens, a 1946 incident when citizens took up arms and exchanged fire with a corrupt Sheriff’s Department. Through the first few weeks of September, Merritt shared over half a dozen stories on the I-10 shooting incidents, tagging a friend on several updates. Should prosecutors prove in court that Merritt actually perpetrated some of the shootings, one post in particular would carry a strange irony. Merritt shared a photo contrasting figures on mass shootings when ended by police or by armed citizens. Over a stock image of a woman in a business suit holding a shotgun, the caption reads: The average number of people shot in a mass shooting event when the shooter is stopped by law enforcement: 14. The average number of people shot in a mass shooting event when the shooter is stopped by civilians: 2.5. The reason is simple: the armed civilians are there when it started. Merritt’s father, Leslie Merritt Sr., told the Associated Press that anyone who thinks his son was involved in the shootings is a “moron.” He continued, “He has way too much value for human life to even take the slightest or remotest risk of actually injuring someone.” Featured photo via KPHO CrimeHealthPoliticsPhoenix Freeway Shootings .

705,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/73ig9eX1nDI/,"The White House confirmed that President Obama was preparing a series of executive actions on gun control to match his recent passion on the issue after the latest mass shooting in Oregon. “It’s a high priority and will continue to be until we start to see more progress on this issue in this town,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today at the press briefing. Earnest said he would “quibble” with anyone who criticized the president for not voicing any specific gun control proposals during his press conference, asserting that the White House was working behind the scenes for more executive actions on guns. “I can tell you that they’re not stumped, they’re continuing to review the law that’s on the books and continuing to consult with legal authorities but also others who may have ideas about what steps that can be taken to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,” Earnest said. He admitted, however that he had no details for what the White House was working on, but asserted that the process was a “scrub” that was “ongoing.” Earnest welcomed Hillary Clinton’s own gun control proposals announced this morning, but admitted that he hadn’t seen the full details of the proposal. He also pointedly criticized the “gun show loophole” for allowing criminals and people with mental problems to buy weapons, blaming organizations like the National Rifle Association for blocking action in Congress on the issue. 2nd AmendmentPoliticsBarack Obamagun controljosh earnestWhite House .

[email protected] & @laurennfrench) HE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT. Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan, “John Boehner’s speakership is not ending quietly. With less than four weeks left in his decades-long congressional career, Boehner is maneuvering to shape the House Republican Conference on his way out. His goal is to leave the conference he helped build —with countless hours of grunt work and hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising — in the strongest position possible. He has all but officially endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy to succeed him, giving the majority leader enough of a nod to express confidence but short of the full-throated endorsement that could sink him. Boehner tried to lure a candidate into the majority leader race against one of his own top lieutenants, a move aimed at bolstering McCarthy's right flank.
http://politi.co/1RrKBlq DEMOCRATS HIT BACK ON BENGHAZI. From Rachael Bade, “Two weeks before Hillary Clinton’s high-stakes Capitol Hill testimony on Benghazi, Democrats are trying to discredit the GOP-led Benghazi investigation following Kevin McCarthy’s boast that the panel was hurting the Democratic front-runner’s campaign. For months, the House Select Committee on Benghazi has dogged the Clinton campaign; its work led to the discovery that Clinton was using a private email server while running the State Department. But now, after McCarthy’s gaffe, Democrats think they have the advantage, arguing that the California Republican validated their view that the panel’s work amounts to a political witch hunt.”
http://politi.co/1FQp8l0 SO MUCH SASSE. First-term Sen. Ben Sasse had planned to keep his head down for a year before unleashing his inner pundit. Then came his Sunday-night
tweet-storm, in which the Nebraska Republican opined that the next House speaker ""needs to have the ideas of Jack Kemp, work ethic of Mike Rowe, resolve of Margaret Thatcher, & wit of Larry the Cable Guy."" And he was off to the races from there, in a riff that caused one person to ask if Sasse was ""a real senator.""…While most senators have offered standard demurrals on the race to replace John Boehner, the freshman Republican from Nebraska is leaning into the debate nine months after arriving in Congress.”

SANDERS’ GUN CONTROL COMMENTS GET NEW LOOK WITH PRESIDENTIAL BID. From Thomas Kaplan at the New York Times, “After the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Senator Bernie Sanders said that gun control was a matter best left resolved in state capitals. In the aftermath of the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, Mr. Sanders voiced support for new gun control measures, but also noted that the rights of law-abiding gun owners “must be protected.” In fact, Mr. Sanders sounded downright skeptical of the push for tighter new laws…Mr. Sanders’s statements on gun control, while less forceful than those of some other Democrats, did not seem out of place for a senator from a state where hunting is prevalent…But with last week’s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon stirring debate about America’s gun laws, Mr. Sanders’s attitudes toward gun control and the Second Amendment are facing fresh scrutiny as his presidential bid gains steam.”
http://nyti.ms/1Ma4wFk  HELP WANTED: IN THE MOST DYSFUNCTIONAL PLACE IN THE WORLD. Justin Talbot-Zorn for the Washington Post, “The Hill still offers stimulating, high-profile work. It’s possibly the only place where you can write major speeches, negotiate the contours of national policy initiatives and help design trillion-dollar budgets before you’re 30. But for many young American go-getters, Congress is losing its luster. Staff budgets and average salaries have been declining for two decades. Our most prestigious body of public deliberation is now defined by minimal productivity, constant brinkmanship and approval ratings that stand somewhere between those of traffic jams and toxic mold spores. This isn’t just a problem for politicians, who need good writers and strategists. It’s a problem for all of us.”
http://wapo.st/1Z6NHR4 CUMMINGS QUIET ON SENATE BID. Rachel Weiner and Paul Kane report for the Washington Post, “Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) will not announce whether he is running for Senate until after Hillary Rodham Clinton testifies before a House panel about the Benghazi attacks. In an interview Monday, the ranking Democrat on the House Select Committee on Benghazi said he wanted to “get this behind me” before making a public decision. Cummings said he wanted to avoid any accusations that he was using the controversial committee to further his own political ambitions.”
http://wapo.st/1L4aJhS CONGRESS LOOKING TO DEAL ON MEDICARE PAYMENTS. Robert Pear for the New York Times, “Congress and the Obama administration are frantically seeking ways to hold down Medicare premiums that could rise by roughly 50 percent for some beneficiaries next year, according to lawmakers and Medicare officials. The administration has criticized commercial insurance companies for seeking rate increases much smaller than that. Aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and Speaker John A. Boehner are quietly exploring a possible deal that would limit the expected increase in Medicare premiums.”
http://nyti.ms/1LeEFqF BOEHNER POSTPONES. Jake and Bres have the story; “Speaker John Boehner on Monday postponed the election for House majority leader and majority whip until next month, a blow to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who announced less than 24 hours earlier he had the votes to win the majority leader race. The House Republican Conference will still choose its nominee for speaker on Thursday, and the full chamber will vote on Boehner's successor on Oct. 29. Boehner's decision could take some of the pressure off House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the favorite to replace him. But the bigger impact may be on the majority leader's race: the delay will give conservatives more time to find a candidate to run against Scalise (R-La.) and Georgia Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) for the No. 2 leadership position.”

Following Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, James addressed the topic at the Cleveland Cavaliers' training camp on Friday, saying, ""There's no room for guns."" James originally reacted on Twitter on Thursday, following a report that a baby had been fatally shot in Cleveland on Thursday night. On Friday, James spoke more broadly on the issue, saying (via Joe Vardon of the Northeast Ohio Media Group): ""Obviously you're not going to be able to take every gun out, I don't know how you can do that. There's so many around now, today. But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.""

(AP) — The latest on the deadly shooting at a community college in Oregon (all times local): 4:10 p.m. President Barack Obama will travel to Oregon this week to visit privately with families of the victims of last week’s shooting at a community college. Obama will visit Roseburg on Friday as he opens a four-day trip to the West Coast. No additional details about his visit were immediately available. Obama has renewed his call for stricter gun laws following the shooting and has expressed exasperation at the frequency of mass shootings in the U.S. Nine people were killed when a 26-year-old opened fire in a classroom at Umpqua (UHMP’-kwah) Community College before killing himself in a shootout with police. Another nine people were wounded. Some faculty, staff and students have been bringing flowers to a makeshift memorial as they return to the campus for the first time since the shooting. — 3:50 p.m. A law enforcement official says the gunman who killed nine people in an Oregon classroom last week ranted about not having a girlfriend in writings he left behind for authorities. The official is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publically and commented on condition of anonymity. The official says that in the writings recovered last week, Christopher Harper-Mercer also complained that others around him thought he was crazy. The official says the gunman wrote he was sane and others were unbalanced. Harper-Mercer opened fire at Umpqua (UHMP’-kwah) Community College in Roseburg, killing nine. He killed himself as officers arrived at the scene. – By Associated Press writer Tami Abdollah — 3:05 p.m. The president of the Oregon community college where a gunman killed nine people last week says at least one injured student has visited the campus on the day it reopened. Faculty, staff and students began returning to Umpqua (UHMP’-kwah) Community College on Monday, although classes don’t resume until next week. College President Rita Cavin didn’t identify the injured student who came to campus. She says professional groups are available to counsel faculty, students and staff as well as “comfort dogs” that can help relieve stress. The gunman, Christopher Harper-Mercer, executed nine people inside a classroom last Thursday and wounded nine others. He killed himself after a shootout with police. — 12:12 p.m. Faculty, staff and some students have returned to an Oregon community college for the first time since a gunman killed nine people last week. Classes at Umpqua (UHMP’-kwah) Community College won’t resume until next week, but the campus reopened Monday to staff, faculty and students who wanted to pick up belongings they left behind when they fled the shooting last Thursday. The gunman also injured nine people before getting into a shootout with police and then killing himself. Chaplains and grief counselors were on hand to lend support. News media were not allowed onto the campus in the small town of Roseburg. — 11:15 a.m. An Oregon hospital reports no change in the conditions of three of the most seriously wounded survivors of a deadly mass shooting at a community college last week. PeaceHealth Medical Center in Springfield said Monday that one patient remains in critical condition and the other two are in fair condition. All are expected to survive, but one woman is expected to have permanent neurological damage. The three are women ranging in age from 18 to 34. They were among the most seriously wounded in the attack at Umpqua (UHMP’-kwah) Community College in Roseburg that left nine people and the gunman dead.

In a statement to CNN reporter Dan Merica, Clinton expressed exasperation with the frequency of mass shootings in the US and called for expanded gun laws. ""It is just beyond my comprehension that we are seeing these mass murders happen again and again and again. And as I have said, we have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe,"" Clinton told Merica. ""You know I know there is a way to have sensible gun control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands and save lives."" Clinton also tweeted from her account later Thursday:    Clinton has supported universal background checks for individuals hoping to buy guns, a measure that has broad public support but failed to pass Congress more than two years ago. This isn't the first time the former secretary of state has commented on mass shootings during her candidacy. In late August, Clinton took time after a press conference in Iowa to condemn the shooting of two reporters in Virginia by a disgruntled former co-worker.

712,https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/05/brady-campaign-joins-media-attack-oregon-sheriff/,"The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence joined left-of-center media outlets in their effort to attack a local sheriff from the Oregon county where the recent mass shooting occurred. As Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin is dealing with the aftermath of the violence and helping his community, the Brady Campaign demanded his immediate resignation due to his opposition to gun control laws which were passed and signed into law in Oregon earlier this year. According to the Brady Campaign: John Hanlin should tender his resignation from the Douglas Country Sheriff’s Office and be immediately replaced as lead investigator on this case,” said Dan Gross, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Citizens of Oregon voted for the expansion of Brady background checks in a law signed by Governor Brown this past May. In pledging not to enforce the new law, John Hanlin has clearly demonstrated that his political ideology trumps his responsibility to protect his community. The victims of last week’s shooting and the entire community deserve a thorough investigation that will get to the bottom of this heinous crime – an investigation that must be grounded in facts and evidence, not myth and bias. Brady’s calls for Hanlin’s resignation appear to be a veiled accusation that he his opposition to expanding background checks in Oregon was somehow causal in the Umpqua Community College (UCC) shooting. However, Brady is ignoring the fact that background checks were passed for all Chris Harper Mercer’s guns–some by him, some by other family members–so that all of his guns were purchased “legally.” In truth, the call for Sheriff Hanlin’s resignation is part of the larger media war being waged against him because of his opposition to more gun control. Breitbart News previously reported (linked above) that TIME magazine, Mother Jones, CNN, NBC, International Business Times, Yahoo, and the Washington Post are among the outlets reporting on the sheriff’s pro-Second Amendment views. ThinkProgress published some of the most pointed criticism of the sheriff, equating his opposition to gun control with support for anti-government militias. But Sheriff Hanlin is standing his ground, saying, “My focus right now is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and families of the victims.” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

But the White House says that’s not what he’ll be doing as he visits the victims of the college shooting in Oregon on Friday. According to the White House, Obama will be traveling to meet and console the victims and no public remarks are expected. “I think in this instance, on Friday morning, the trip would not be about politics, but that trip would be about merely consoling the families who were so profoundly affected by that tragedy.” Earnest added that the visit was convenient for the president, since he would already be on the West Coast for a series of fundraisers and events in California, but that it was unlikely that he would make public remarks. Obama’s tone has shifted dramatically on the issue since Thursday, when he took the podium vowing to politicize the issue. “[T]his is something we should politicize,” he said, asserting that “thoughts and prayers are not enough” when dealing with the aftermath of mass shootings. Earnest explained that Obama’s rhetoric was more about the president’s desire to combat the National Rifle Association and less about grandstanding in the location of a mass shooting. But that didn’t stop Obama from speaking about gun control during his funeral eulogy for one of the victims of the church shooting in South Carolina earlier this year. “For too long, we’ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation,” he said during the eulogy, asserting that the “the majority of gun owners want to do something about this.” 2nd AmendmentPoliticsBarack ObamaNational Rifle AssociationOregon .

Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, will announce the new proposals in separate town-hall-style events in New Hampshire, a state with a Democratic senator who has voted for some gun-control measures but where there is a thriving gun and hunting culture. The proposals will come just days after Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” to counter the National Rifle Association, after another mass shooting, this time at a college in Oregon, left nine people dead. Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a constant in her campaign speeches since the Charleston, S.C., shootings in which nine black congregants were killed. The proposal most likely to generate controversy is using executive action to close the so-called gun show loophole, if efforts to pass new measures in Congress do not succeed, according to a campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, who asked for anonymity to lay out the plans before the candidate does. Most of the ideas would face a steep battle with the Republican-led Congress, and efforts to pass new gun restrictions in the wake of the murders of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Since then, there have been a number of mass shootings, including the most recent, at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., last week. But her proposals are in sharp contrast to the Republican presidential hopefuls, and she is making them as her main rival in the primary polls, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has gained ground against her, but has also come under scrutiny among Democrats for some gun control policies he has opposed in the past. A central issue in Mrs. Clinton’s proposals are the background checks on prospective gun buyers, which are required for retailers at stores. But under federal law, they are not required at gun shows or over the Internet with private sellers. Under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, she would use administrative powers to make anyone selling a substantial number of guns declared “in the business” of firearms dealing, and subject to the same rules as retailers, if Congress does not act, according to the campaign aide. It was not immediately clear what the bar for being declared “in the business” would be. And use of executive action in connection with guns is certain to face criticism from staunch supporters of the Second Amendment. It is also likely to be applauded by Democrats who have grown weary of gridlock in Congress. Earlier in the evening, another Democratic candidate, Martin O’Malley, urged Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to embrace policies he supports, including a reinstatement of the lapsed federal assault weapons ban. That does not appear to be among those she will suggest. Mrs. Clinton will suggest urging Congress to end another loophole, by which people with felony records who should be barred from obtaining a gun can get one if their background check is not completed within three days. That loophole was how Dylann Roof, the accused killer in Charleston, obtained his weapon despite a felony conviction for a drug arrest. Since the Charleston shooting, Mrs. Clinton has frequently talked about gun control, but her comments have grown stronger. On Friday, a day after the shootings in Oregon, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to lead a “national movement” that would counter the National Rifle Association. “Here’s what the other side counts on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They count on really having an intense, dedicated group that scare politicians and say, ‘We will vote against you.’ ” Advertisement",2015-10-05 00:00:00,"To Curb Gun Violence, Hillary Clinton Has a Plan for Possible Executive Action - The New York Times","politics and government,united states politics and government,elections",1,http://nytimes.com

The sheriff, who has made no secret of his strident opposition to tougher gun laws, made his views clear in a letter to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. posted on his department’s Facebook page on Jan. 16, 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mr. Hanlin urged the vice president to treat his letter as “a formal request that you NOT tamper with or attempt to amend” the Second Amendment. “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” he wrote, adding that efforts to restrict gun ownership “would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people.” The sheriff also warned the vice president that “any federal regulation enacted by Congress or by executive order of the president offending the constitutional rights of my citizens shall not be enforced by me or by my deputies, nor will I permit the enforcement of any unconstitutional regulations or orders by federal officers within the borders of Douglas County Oregon.” Three days before that letter was released, Mr. Hanlin shared a link on his personal Facebook page to a YouTube video, which suggested that the shootings at Sandy Hook — and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — might have been staged by the federal government to provide a pretext for “disarming the public” through gun control legislation. In a comment imploring his Facebook friends to watch that video, whose producer claims that the parents of children “allegedly shot” at Sandy Hook were actors, the sheriff wrote, “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore.” After that update attracted criticism, it was removed from Mr. Hanlin’s personal Facebook page on Friday, but not before numerous screenshots were made and shared online.

716,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/us/death-of-gunman-in-oregon-college-shootings-is-ruled-suicide.html?_r=0,"Advertisement Supported by transcript NA By Jack Healy and Laura M. Holson ROSEBURG, Ore. — The father of the gunman who killed nine people at a community college here called on the nation to change its gun laws on Saturday, saying the massacre “would not have happened” if his son had not been able to buy so many handguns and rifles. “How was he able to compile that kind of arsenal?” the father, Ian Mercer, said in an interview with CNN at his home in Tarzana, Calif. He said he had no idea that his son owned more than a dozen firearms. His comments came as officials here confirmed that the gunman, Christopher Harper-Mercer, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging fire with police officers who responded to the shooting at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning. As grieving families across this hilly corner of southwest Oregon made plans to bury their dead and tended to wounded relatives at area hospitals on Saturday, investigators offered a few new details of the rampage. A new timeline of the response to the shooting showed that officers arrived five minutes after the first 911 calls. Two minutes later, they had engaged Mr. Harper-Mercer. Two minutes after that, they reported, the shooter was down. They also said they had found another gun at Mr. Harper-Mercer’s apartment, the 14th they had confiscated. Mr. Harper-Mercer, a student at the community college, was armed with six guns, spare ammunition magazines and body armor when he walked into a writing class and opened fire around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. All of the weapons had been purchased legally by Mr. Harper-Mercer or a relative, law-enforcement officials have said. A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check. Despite Mr. Harper-Mercer’s online interest in high-profile shootings and neighbors’ memories of him as an enthusiastic gun collector who frequently went target shooting with his mother, the gunman’s father told CNN he did not know his son owned guns. Mr. Harper-Mercer’s parents divorced a decade ago, and he had lived with his mother. The father said he had not seen his son since he and his mother, Laurel Harper, moved to Oregon about two years ago, but said there was no “disharmony or any bitterness” between him and his son. Adding a raw, personal voice to the debate over gun control in the wake of this latest mass shooting, he said the United States needed to tighten gun laws. “It has to change,” he said. “How can it not? Even people that believe in the right to bear arms, what right do you have to take someone’s life?” He would not discuss his son’s mental health issues, deferring to the police investigation. “Obviously, someone who goes and kills nine people has to have some kind of issue,” he said. Standing on his lawn, Mr. Mercer said the shooting had devastated his family. “But we’re not alone in this,” he said. “My heart goes out to all the families that were affected by this.” His interview came on the same afternoon that relatives of one of the students wounded in his son’s rampage also stepped in front of the microphones, here outside the front doors of Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. Bonnie Schaan, the mother of Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, said that her daughter had been shot in the back during the massacre in her classroom. Tears welled up in her eyes as she explained that a bullet had clipped her daughter’s lung and lodged in one of her kidneys, which had to be removed. Cheyeanne, 16, a nursing student, remains in intensive care. Mr. Harper-Mercer asked the young woman about her religion, according to her aunt, Colleen Fitzgerald, but “she didn’t answer.” Instead, Cheyeanne played dead next to her friend, Anastasia Boylan, a student who was also shot. Ms. Schaan said that her daughter did not know Mr. Harper-Mercer. After hearing the news about the shooting on campus, Ms. Schaan said she texted her daughter and said, “I’m on my way to school.” Instead she went to the hospital. Cheyeanne has begun to talk with her father about the ordeal, Ms. Schaan said. Now, even a chair being moved unsettles her. Her mother added, “She’s mentioned all the blood.” Dr. Jason Gray, the chief medical officer at Mercy Medical Center, said only two victims were still in the hospital. One was in critical condition and the other in fair condition. They were expected to be released in two to five days. The hospital treated seven victims in total, Dr. Gray said. Two were released Thursday, four went into surgery and one died in the emergency department. Three other people were being treated for wounds at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in the town of Springfield. On Friday, about 300 people showed up at Mercy Medical Center to donate blood, Dr. Gray said. The hospital set up a donation station nearby to handle the crowd.

Shear WASHINGTON — Just a day after a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon last week, President Obama told reporters that he had asked his staff to “scrub” the government’s existing gun laws to see what might be done to prevent massacres. On Monday, a group whose goal is to prevent gun violence will release a report urging the administration to issue a series of regulations that would clarify existing laws in an effort to reduce gun-related crimes. The group, Everytown for Gun Safety, writes that Mr. Obama could help protect potential gun victims from attackers, especially in cases of domestic abuse, by encouraging five relatively small changes to the way the federal and state governments interpret laws that are already on the books. “The White House can take steps today to keep dangerous people with guns out of our schools, to keep convicted domestic abusers from possessing guns, to crack down on trafficking and to help federal law enforcement and states enforce the laws on the books that keep criminals from getting guns,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety. Mr. Feinblatt reiterated Mr. Obama’s call for Congress to enact tougher laws. But he said the administration could carry out his group’s recommendations without action in the gridlocked Congress. The group says the Justice Department should make it clear to law enforcement agencies that federal laws prohibiting gun purchases by anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse also apply in cases where an abuser is not married to the victim. Current law bans gun purchases by those convicted of abuse if the victim is “similarly situated to a spouse,” but those running background checks often do not understand what that means, the group says in the report. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Obama said he had asked his staff: “Are there additional actions that we can take that might prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place?” White House aides noted Sunday that the president had taken 23 executive actions on gun violence after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. And they said he was willing to consider other steps as well. In focusing on firearms dealers, the authors of the report urge the administration to help states track background checks between unlicensed gun sellers and their buyers. The group says federal law enforcement agencies should notify local and state authorities when someone fails a background check because he or she is a felon or a convicted domestic abuser; the group says local authorities should be alerted when such a person tries — and fails — to buy a gun. The federal government should also clarify the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which prohibits the possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school, the group writes. It was signed into law by President George Bush in 1990. That law exempts people who have a “qualified” state permit to carry a gun. But the group says it is not clear what kind of permit qualifies for an exemption. In some states, a permit-holder does not need to pass a background check, a loophole that should be closed, it says. The group, which joined with a gun control organization founded by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City and another group formed in the wake of the school shootings in Newtown, claims more than three million supporters.

719,http://www.breitbart.com/tag/sarah-silverman/,"Far-left Hollywood celebrities took to social media in a collective last-ditch effort to garner public support for the far-left “For the People Act” —  which would nationalize U.S. elections, thereby stripping states of their ability to implement basic election safeguards — urging Americans to take action and call their senators. Comedian Sarah Silverman is the latest celebrity urging Congress to pass H.R. 1, the so-called “For the People Act,” that would gut voter identification requirements, protect illegal immigrants, and federalize election oversight by seizing power from states. Sarah Silverman blasted CA gubernatorial candidate and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner for agreeing with restrictions on transgender athletes. Comedian Sarah Silverman shredded the idea of America’s dueling political parties, calling the Democratic Party “f**king elitist,” not actually “progressive” at all. Their love for New York’s governor was so strong that a new sexual orientation had to be invented — “Cuomosexual.” Now as Andrew Cuomo fights for his political life amid nursing home and sexual harassment scandals, Hollywood’s burning desire for the Democratic politician has grown cold and desolate. In the latest episode of The Sarah Silverman Podcast, far-left actress and comedian Sarah Silverman attacked Jared Kushner, claiming that the former president’s son-in-law could play a Nazi in a film and adding, “he is not capable of empathy.” A horde of left-wing Hollywood elites piled on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) following reports that he was on a plane headed to Cancun alongside his family in the midst of the crisis in Texas, bashing him as a “worm” and a “motherf***er.” Now that His Fraudulency Joe Biden has already killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, a mob of super-wealthy Hollywood hypocrites are calling for His Fraudulency to kill the Dakota Access Pipeline. More than 50 Hollywood celebrities have mobilized to raise money and pump up enthusiasm for Democrat challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Using their star power to attract donor dollars, they have put their Hollywood imprint on the Georgia races in the hopes of flipping the Senate on January 5. As more celebrities use their star power to help Georgia Democrats, Sarah Silverman and Patton Oswalt are also getting in the game, teaming up with the Trump-impersonating social media sensation Sarah Cooper to rally their fellow comedians to push voter turnout during the runoffs. Actress-comedian Sarah Silverman is leading a group of stand-up comedians who are aiming to help turn Wisconsin blue and send Joe Biden “laughing all the way” to the White House. In a bizarre move, celebrities, including Chris Rock, Tiffany Haddish, Amy Schumer, Josh Gad, Sarah Silverman, Mark Ruffalo, Chelsea Handler, Ryan Bathe, and Naomi Campbell, stripped “naked” for an election ballot explainer video warning against “naked ballots” in the upcoming election. Hollywood celebrities reacted in outrage and alarm at the New York Times‘ exposé Sunday, in which the Times reported that it had obtained President Donald Trump’s tax returns going back over two decades. In recent years, the Times noted, President Trump had paid Left-wing Hollywood celebrities are giving high-fives and high praise in response to the NBA’s decision to turn some of its sports arenas into polling locations for the November election, allowing for more people to vote in-person. The voter initiative is Hollywood celebrities are commemorating 150 days since the death of Breonna Taylor in March by demanding the arrest of the police officers involved in her shooting death. Conservative black activist Candace Owens has been subject to a prolonged smear campaign on Wikipedia since expressing her support for President Donald Trump. Many of the edits made to her page have selectively quoted or misrepresented Owens to portray her negatively. This included recent comments she made criticizing attempts to minimize the criminal past of George Floyd in the wake of his death in police custody. Hollywood and social justice warriors have established a new Woke standard. Now the question remains: will Hollywood purge its own ranks of all actors, directors, producers, agents, managers, film crews, photographers, and hair and makeup artists who have ever worked on a film or TV show that employed racist blackface portrayals? Far-left actress and comedian Sarah Silverman bashed President Donald Trump on Monday for criticizing Barack Obama, saying that Trump doesn’t have “the labs” to criticize Barack Obama to his face. Actress-comedian Sarah Silverman called out Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) on Wednesday over her apparent #MeToo double standard when it comes to former vice president Joe Biden’s sexual assault accuser and former congressional staffer Tara Reade. Actress-comedian and left-wing activist Sarah Silverman is the latest celebrity to lend her social media influencer power to a vote-at-home initiative, which is being launched in the midst of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Actress Gal Gadot posted a video on Instagram on Wednesday featuring a compilation of celebrities singing John Lennon’s “Imagine” to transcend quarantines as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Democrat Party’s socialist frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) held a star-studded rally in Los Angeles, California, on Sunday, featuring comedian Sarah Silverman and Hollywood icon Dick Van Dyke, drawing 17,000 attendees. The likes of actor Dick Van Dyke, rap group Public Enemy, and actress-comedian Sarah Silverman are set to headline a rally in Los Angeles for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VM) presidential campaign on Sunday. Hollywood actors know a bad performance when they see one, and on Wednesday, they gave a big thumbs down to billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who made his first debate appearance following his late entry into Actress-comedian Sarah Silverman took to Twitter on Wednesday to call out social media users for trending the hashtag #NeverWarren after Tuesday’s Democrat presidential primary debate. Silverman cautioned her followers against tweeting the anti-Warren language, referring to the hashtag as “aggressively stupid” and “totally fringe.” Hollywood elites continued to engage in unhinged histrionics over President Donald Trump in 2019, ratcheting up their hysterical rhetoric to new comic heights. Actress-comedian Sarah Silverman has experienced an apparent meltdown over President Donald Trump’s border enforcement policy, expressing her desire for physical violence in a profane and inchoate social media rant. Left-wing Hollywood celebrities gloated after Democrats won key electoral battles in Kentucky and Virginia on Tuesday, with some stars jabbing at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), saying he will be the next Republican to fall. Actress-Comedian Sarah Silverman said she sees Jesus Christ in 16-year-old Swedish climate change alarmist Greta Thunberg. Left-wing comedian and actress Sarah Silverman revealed last week that producers fired her from a movie she was set to co-star in after discovering a photo of her in blackface, which stemmed from a comedy sketch in 2007.

725,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/pa6zF8peyC8/,"The Get Ben Carson Express has left the station and has now reached maximum velocity. The left, fearful of a successful black Republican utterly unconcerned with their priorities and immune to typical accusations of either incompetence (Herman Cain) or callousness (Clarence Thomas), has set its sights on Ben Carson. First, they sought to deem him a racist by dint of his comments about opposing a Muslim in the White House; now, they’re trying to label him nasty by dint of his recent comments about what he would do in case of a mass shooting. For those who missed it, here were the comments that set tongues a-wagging: “Not only would I probably not cooperate [with a shooter], I would not just stand there and let him shoot me, I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’” For these comments, MSNBC’s Steve Benen labeled the neurosurgeon “ridiculous” and his comments “shameful” and “callous.” When Hillary Clinton compares her opponents to Iran and terrorist groups, however, no biggie. German Lopez of Vox.com called the comments “ridiculous” and ripped Carson for not calling for gun control. No word on Lopez’s take on Vice President Joe Biden, who once suggested that victims of break-ins fire a shotgun through a door. Chris Matthews of MSNBC called the comments “pathetic.” He had nothing to say, however, about Biden’s comments this week suggesting that Republicans were “beating” Hispanics. But the coup-de-grace—the obligatory “X DESTROYS Ben Carson” headlines you knew were coming—came courtesy of Daily Show Obama hack Trevor Noah. The host has a charming accent, which is new, but aside from that, he’s just Jon Stewart without the talent. Noah led off with a few cuts of Carson out of context, Daily Show-style, then quipped, “For people who like Donald Trump, but hate his charm and charisma. Ben Carson’s like the drug-free cocaine for people who don’t want to get high but just like snorting white powder.” He then continued by playing Carson’s comments. He responded that Carson would be unable to rally people against a mass shooter. “I think he’s overestimating how inspiring his presence might be,” said Noah, before breaking out a rather incompetent Carson impression, then fake-falling asleep. Noah continued: Chastising victims of a shooting for what you assume was their cowardice is what most normal candidates would consider a gaffe. But I will admit Ben Carson does practice what he preaches, because even though the media kept taking shots at him, he kept charging into those interviews… What do you really expect the victims to do? I don’t understand this. This guy would make the worst hostage negotiator ever. “All right sir, I need you to stay calm and put your gun down. Everyone else rush him, rush him now, rush him! How many people are dead? Well, at least it wasn’t everyone.” Ben Carson wasn’t asked what he would do as a hostage negotiator; he was asked what he would do if he were in a mass shooting situation. But never mind: the non-humor must take precedence. Noah then commented on Ben Carson’s stated preference for arming trained teachers. “Who are you and how do you think this is an education policy?” Noah shouted in faux rage, second-rate Stewart style. “Kindergarten teachers can barely handle a room full of five-year-olds, and now you want them to be Navy SEALs?” That’s sort of the point: they aren’t Navy SEALs. But they are the only adults standing between a room full of five-year-olds and armed gunmen in certain situations. It would be preferable for them to be armed, given that armed people don’t need to be Navy SEALs to be effective defenders of the innocent. Finally, Noah concluded by critiquing Carson’s comments on Facebook that he “never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” Noah then said that perspective must have made him an unpopular surgeon, and joked via bad impersonation that Carson must have lectured other surgeons on the Second Amendment when confronted with shooting victims. More unfunny tripe—and inaccurate, given Carson’s highly successful career. Noah finished: Rushing a gunman? It seems crazy… It’s weird that Ben Carson would think a zombie strategy would be the way to go. Unless… wait a second. Slow, languid pace. Dead eyes. Loves brains. Oh my God, this explains everything, Ben Carson is a zombie! Noah’s insipid take on Ben Carson’s comments actually demonstrates that Carson was right when he said he wanted people to think seriously about what to do in a mass shooter scenario. Noah implies that the best solution was to do nothing and wait for the police to arrive. The victims tried that, and no one can blame them for it—no one truly knows how they would react in a horrible situation like an attempted mass shooting. But if Noah thinks Carson’s main sin here was urging people to take down mass shooters together, he should meet the heroes of Flight 93, or the military men who stopped a terror attack on a French train weeks ago, or, for that matter, Army veteran Chris Mintz, who did charge the shooter at Umpqua Community College. But it’s easier and more fun to play short clips, make funny faces, and get the trained seals of the Comedy Central audience to laugh at a black Republican candidate. After all, taking him seriously might make him a legitimate threat to a racist media that paints all black conservatives as stupid and uncaring.

726,http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/house-democrats-sit-in-guns/488444/,"The fight is only just beginning. Democrats were eager to impress that message upon a crowd that gathered outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday afternoon after emerging from a sit-in on the House floor demanding action on gun control that lasted more than 24-hours. “Don’t give up, don’t give in,” the Democratic congressman and civil-rights leader John Lewis said as onlookers waved rainbow-colored signs that read “Disarm Hate.” The crowd began to sing the civil-rights protest anthem “We Shall Overcome,” with lyrics slightly modified to suit moment: “We shall pass a bill someday.” A woman recording a video on her cellphone remarked aloud, “This is history, baby,” to no one in particular. The sit-in was an unusual moment of protest inside the United States Congress. The willingness to make such a bold, publicity-ready move suggests the Democratic Party feels emboldened to demand action on gun control in the wake of a tragic mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub earlier this month. In the end, however, Democrats did not succeed in securing a vote on the gun-control measures they had hoped for in staging the protest. Faced with that failure, Democrats insist this is only the beginning. “We’re going to continue to work,” Lewis said in a brief interview outside the Capitol. “Many people are supporting our efforts,” he said. “People all over America and around the world are supporting our efforts to do something about gun violence.” The sit-in may also indicate that House Democrats are increasingly willing to make use of confrontational tactics to make their voices heard. “It’s not just about guns,” the Democratic congressman James Clyburn said in an interview. “This particular issue is about guns, but this is just the start … I wouldn’t get hung-up on sit-ins, but I would call it activism.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi seemed reluctant to declare that this will be the way Democrats try to get their message on future issues. “No, I think you have to just take it on a day-to-day basis,” she said at Thursday’s press conference. She called the sit-in a reflection of the “the complete insistence that we cannot go through another moment of silence without taking action” on gun violence. The sit-in seemed to intensify the divide between Democrats and Republicans on guns. House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the action as a “publicity stunt,” during an interview with CNN. “This is not about a solution to a problem,” he said. “This is about trying to get attention.” House Republicans expressed frustration over the Democrats’ action, describing the event as a political distraction and a way to obstruct the business of legislating. In an interview, the Republican congressman Mark Meadows said that while it is “certainly within every member’s right to be able to articulate their concerns,” he disagreed with the tactics deployed by Democrats. As Yoni Appelbaum noted, “even having phones switched on, much less snapping photos, tweeting updates, or periscoping the proceedings, is a violation of the rules of the House”—all common sights during the sit-in.“I think it poses a very bad precedent and quite frankly other nations are watching what is happening,” Meadows said. The Democrats’ agenda faced criticism from progressives as well. Democrats were agitating for a vote on measures to expand background checks for gun purchases and prevent suspected terrorists from buying the weapons. As The Intercept’s Zaid Jilani wrote, the “unusually bold and moving tactic was undercut by the fact that its chief goal is a political gimmick that would do little to stop gun violence, while expanding the use of a deeply flawed anti-terror watchlist.” In spite of various criticisms, many House Democrats appeared defiant and energetic Thursday afternoon. “The American public has been crying out for help on this issue, for their families, for their kids, and we said ‘We hear you, we’re listening to you and, we’re going to do something about it,’” the Democratic congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said in an interview. “We may leave here today, but everybody is going home to a district where they’re going to take this fight on, and in addition to that we get back on July 5th and nothing changes. We’ve only just begun.” Other Democrats reveled in the fact that they had been able to broadcast to a wide audience using social media. Beto O’Rourke, a Democratic congressman from Texas who live-streamed the Sit-in on Facebook, said, “In a one-hour period, when I was streaming, we received 10,000 comments.” He pointed to his social-media metrics as evidence of the event’s resonance. “There was obviously a lot of pent-up urgency and excitement about this.” For now, it seems unlikely that House Democrats will win the votes they seek on gun control. But their agitation on the issue will probably continue, and maybe increase. —Clare Foran Roll Call photographer Tom Williams tweeted several images of the scene outside the Capitol this afternoon.

Led by Representative John Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement, it drew its spirit from the non-violent protests at lunch counters and bus terminals across the South that ignited national interest and eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Throughout the day Wednesday, black Democrats shared stories of people shot and killed in their communities, driving home the point that gun violence is not merely a problem of policy—it is also a matter of race and justice. But some have pointed out the incivility of the proposal the sit-in supports, the so-called “no-fly, no-buy” bill. Thanks for sitting in. Let's ditch racist no-fly-buy bill and make this a movement for the real fight against guns. https://t.co/W8geMD6sgJ As the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the Senate version of the “no-fly” bill, argued in a letter, government terrorist watch lists have long been criticized for targeting Muslims with little evidence: Granted, Democrats also want other things, including stronger background checks and a ban on assault weapons. But while the central chant of “no-fly, no-buy” may incrementally help solve one civil-rights crisis—the slaughter of people of color by guns—some say it unfortunately worsens another. House Democrats are now hugging, shaking hands, and taking photos on the floor. The sit-in is now over, and they plan to address supporters outside the Capitol in the next few minutes. Georgia Representative John Lewis, who helped lead the House sit-in, is addressing his fellow members on the floor right now. “We’re gonna win the struggle,” Lewis said, calling for members and constituents to organize. To his colleagues, he said: “You got it out there, you got in the way, you got in trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble. So we must never give up or give in. We must keep the faith and come back here on July 5, more determined than ever before."" It sounds like House Democrats might be wrapping up their sit-in. They held a meeting earlier today on steps forward. “We’re going back to our congressional districts...and we will not allow this body to ever feel as comfortable as they have felt in the past silencing our voices,” South Carolina’s James Clyburn just said on the floor. They'll return on July 5, he notes, and “we will be operating on a new sense of purpose."" House Speaker Paul Ryan's disdain for Democrats' sit-in is clear: “I don't think this should be a very proud moment for democracy or for the people who stage these stunts.” Ryan, speaking at his weekly press briefing Thursday morning, seemed agitated, criticizing Democrats for violating the norms of the House. He told reporters that he was worried about the precedent the sit-in could set, and hit Democrats for sending fundraising missives off the sit-in. “If this is not a political stunt, then why are they trying to raise money off this—off of a tragedy?” Ryan said. Social media has played a critical role in the House sit-in. Democrats used platforms, such as Periscope, to live stream from the chamber floor when C-SPAN was unable to air the protests. Similarly, the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor took off on Twitter. Politico’s Carla Marinucci reports: Reported by @Twitter: In the last 24 hours, #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor have been Tweeted 1.4M times. It appears some Democratic members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives are staging a sit-in of their own in the state capitol. Local reports say about dozen legislators are participating. In solidarity with our friends in DC, #NHHouseDems are sitting in today in Concord. #DemocraticSitIn #NHPolitics pic.twitter.com/WuAjJkhomE While Periscope was the Democrats' streaming app of choice on Wednesday amid a broadcast blackout, the New Hampshire legislators are recording their broadcast using Meerkat. The mood inside the House gallery feels subdued this morning as Democrats continue speeches and a sit-in demanding a vote on gun control measures. It was a long night, and members of Congress who stuck around are clearly exhausted. At least a few lawmakers dozed off, according to Ted Deutch, a Democratic congressman from Florida. “There were definitely some people sleeping,” he said, adding that he wasn’t going to name any names. “I have not pulled an all-nighter in quite a while,” Deutch said. “It’s certainly my first one on the House floor.” Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic congresswoman from Illinois, said she was stepped on while sitting on the floor. When asked if it was by a Republican, she said yes. “I don’t know if it was intentional, but there certainly was no apology,” she said, though she noted that she wasn’t hurt. “He was in a hurry to get over to his side ... and there was a certain amount of contempt.” Democrats have been “inspired, in part, by the kind of cynicism we saw last night from the Republicans,” she said. What happens next? “It could be another hour, it could be five hours, ten hours, that I don’t know,” Deutch said. “I really don't know what the plan is,” Schakowsky said, “[but] what I do know is this is really just the beginning.” She added: “We own this issue now. This is now the issue for the Democratic caucus. I don’t know what form it will take…but we are not giving up.” For America as a whole, the pandemic might be fading. For some communities, this year will be worse than last. The summer wasn’t meant to be like this. By April, Greene County, in southwestern Missouri, seemed to be past the worst of the pandemic. Intensive-care units that once overflowed had emptied. Vaccinations were rising. Health-care workers who had been fighting the coronavirus for months felt relieved—perhaps even hopeful. Then, in late May, cases started ticking up again. By July, the surge was so pronounced that “it took the wind out of everyone,” Erik Frederick, the chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield, told me. “How did we end up back here again?” The hospital is now busier than at any previous point during the pandemic. In just five weeks, it took in as many COVID-19 patients as it did over five months last year. Ten minutes away, another big hospital, Cox Medical Center South, has been inundated just as quickly. “We only get beds available when someone dies, which happens several times a day,” Terrence Coulter, the critical-care medical director at CoxHealth, told me. Why did so many Americans receive strange packages they didn’t think they’d ordered?  Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, sat atop his stallion Smokey and faced the camera. It was Saturday, August 1, 2020. Miller had a message to share. “Good morning, patriots,” Miller began, raising the coiled lasso in his right hand by way of greeting. “I don’t know about you, but I’m getting tired of all these surprises coming out of China. First it was the Chinese virus, then we had the murder hornets, then we had to close the embassy in Houston because of espionage … Now we’ve got all these mystery seeds coming in in the mail.” It was the seeds that Miller wanted to speak about. By then, news of the seeds had been circulating for several days. Packets were turning up at homes across the United States; residents of every state would eventually report receiving them. Their address labels and Customs declarations indicated that they had been sent from China. The contents were usually described as an item of jewelry—something like “rose stud earrings”—but inside would be a small packet of unidentified seeds. There was no evident reason why particular people were receiving particular seeds, or why people were receiving seeds at all. Mike White’s caustic six-part HBO series, The White Lotus, tackles the stickiest American addiction of all. In the first episode of HBO’s new miniseries The White Lotus, Shane (played by Jake Lacy) and his new wife, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), arrive on their honeymoon, on an unspecified Hawaiian island, with bagfuls of silk resort-wear and books by Malcolm Gladwell. Alone in their suite, Jake moves in to kiss Rachel, but he’s suddenly gripped by a suspicion that all might not be entirely copacetic. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait wait,” he says, detaching himself from his bride and lifting his face up to better sniff out the scent of deficiency. “This is the wrong room.” Thus begins a kind of one-man Waterloo, a furious and eventually bloody war between a luxury hotel and a wealthy guy who suspects he hasn’t gotten absolutely everything he’s paid for. Doctors have found a concerning link between the rare pediatric complication known as MIS-C and a syndrome related to tampon use. The U.S. fell short of its goal of giving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70 percent of adults by July 4, but not by much. About two-thirds of everyone above the age of 18 had gotten a shot when the holiday arrived, with coverage among seniors surpassing even that benchmark. That leaves kids—mostly unvaccinated—as the Americans most exposed to the pandemic this summer, while the Delta variant spreads. It’s said that COVID-19 may soon be a disease of the young. If that’s what’s coming, then its effects on children must be better understood. This month, The New England Journal of Medicine published new treatment guidelines for the occasionally fatal, COVID-related condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). When kids first started showing signs of MIS-C in early 2020—rash or conjunctivitis; low blood pressure; diarrhea or vomiting; etc.—doctors guessed it was an inflammatory disease that occurs most often in toddlers called Kawasaki disease. Now most experts believe it’s a separate condition, affecting kids at an average age of 8. No more than a few hundred children in the U.S. have died from COVID-19 during the pandemic—compared with more than half a million deaths overall—but more than 4,000 have developed MIS-C, and we still don’t have foolproof ways to cure it. But a handful of scientists think they’ve found important clues about what drives MIS-C. The disease, they say, may have something to do with a dangerous condition most commonly associated with tampon use. A short story During the interview, I realized almost immediately that the woman was pregnant—I guessed she was about halfway along—but she didn’t remark on it, and of course neither did I. Over the phone, we’d discussed only her 3-year-old daughter. The woman, whose name was Diane, was looking for a babysitter for the girl, whose name was Sophie, two mornings a week from 9 a.m. to noon, for $10 an hour. This was in late January 1997, my senior year at U-Dub—the University of Washington—and I’d seen the job advertised on an index card pinned to the bulletin board outside the career center, the information in tidy blue cursive. We met for the interview at a café near campus, after describing ourselves over the phone. She’d said, “I’m 5’4, and I have tortoiseshell glasses and light-brown hair cut in a bob.” Well-being is far from universal. Here are four models to help you understand the world—and your own mind. “How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Everyone knows where the happiest people in the world live—the United Nations tells us every single year. For the past several years, Finland has been ranked No. 1, sitting atop the pack of Nordic countries, which are all considered very happy. And since they’ve cracked the happiness code, as my colleague Joe Pinsker wrote recently, many of the rest of us are tempted to mimic Nordic habits. Live like a Finn—take a short walk in the forest, go ice swimming—and all will be well, right? Not so fast. In order for the World Happiness Report and other international happiness indexes to compare self-reports of happiness, they have to assume that people around the world define happiness and answer happiness surveys in roughly the same way. If this assumption does not hold, then happiness indexes are about as reliable as a ranking of music quality based on how much residents of each country say they like their local songs. This would indicate something about each country’s enthusiasm for their musical styles, but would provide little information about what music is objectively “best,” given differences in people’s traditions and tastes. Persistent hype around mRNA vaccine technology is now distracting us from other ways to end the pandemic. At the end of January, reports that yet another COVID-19 vaccine had succeeded in its clinical trials—this one offering about 70 percent protection—were front-page news in the United States, and occasioned push alerts on millions of phones. But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is “awash in other shots” already, as the The New York Times put it. Vaccines are still beating the variants, but the unvaccinated world is being pummeled. Fifteen months after the novel coronavirus shut down much of the world, the pandemic is still raging. Few experts guessed that by this point, the world would have not one vaccine but many, with 3 billion doses already delivered. At the same time, the coronavirus has evolved into super-transmissible variants that spread more easily. The clash between these variables will define the coming months and seasons. Here, then, are three simple principles to understand how they interact. Each has caveats and nuances, but together, they can serve as a guide to our near-term future. The vaccines have always had to contend with variants: The Alpha variant (also known as B.1.1.7) was already spreading around the world when the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns began. And in real-world tests, they have consistently lived up to their extraordinary promise. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna reduce the risk of symptomatic infections by more than 90 percent, as does the still-unauthorized one from Novavax. Better still, the available vaccines slash the odds that infected people will spread the virus onward by at least half and likely more. In the rare cases that the virus breaks through, infections are generally milder, shorter, and lower in viral load. As of June 21, the CDC reported just 3,907 hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people and just 750 deaths. No group like this one has ever gone to space before. Jeff Bezos has finalized the manifest for his company’s first passenger flight to space, and it’s a rather unusual bunch. There’s Bezos himself, the richest person in the world, who sold some of his Amazon stock to fund his space venture, Blue Origin. His brother, Mark, with whom he wanted to share the experience. Wally Funk, an 82-year-old American pilot who in the early 1960s passed the same training tests designed for male astronauts, but was rejected by NASA. And Oliver Daemen, a Dutch 18-year-old who graduated high school just last year. When they take off on Tuesday, they will each fulfill a personal dream, but as a crew, they’re making history: No group like this one has ever gone to space together before. Even the participants of the most diverse missions to the International Space Station have had far more in common with one another than this quartet. They were all professional astronauts, with comparable ages, educational backgrounds, and even temperaments, given that potential astronauts must undergo psychological screenings before getting the job. The motley crew of Blue Origin’s first passenger flight seems closer to a cast of offbeat characters gathered together for a zany adventure: If The Breakfast Club had the brain, the jock, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal, this Blue Origin flight has the boss, the tag-along, the real deal, and the kid. Last summer, unsolicited home deliveries sent Americans into a panic. The writer Chris Heath has discovered an explanation that many, including the USDA, don’t believe. Listen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts  Last summer, an unexplained phenomenon gripped nightly newscasts and Facebook groups across America: Unsolicited deliveries of obscurely labeled seed packages, seemingly from China, were being sent to Americans’ homes. Recipients reported the packages to local police, news stations, and agriculture departments; searched message boards for explanations; and theorized about conspiracies including election interference and biowarfare. Despite large-scale USDA testing of the packages, the mystery remained: Who sent the seeds and why? This week on The Experiment podcast, the host Julia Longoria speaks with the writer Chris Heath about his investigation of mystery seeds for The Atlantic, the byzantine world of international e-commerce, and the dangers of both panic and reason.

Shear WASHINGTON — President Obama’s rage about gun massacres, building for years, spilled out Thursday night as he acknowledged his own powerlessness to prevent another tragedy and pleaded with voters to force change themselves. “So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren’t so fortunate,” the president said in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named for a man severely wounded by a would-be assassin’s bullet, “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up.” Mr. Obama admitted that he was unable to do anything to prevent such tragedies by himself. And he did little to try to hide the anger and frustration that have deepened as he returns again and again to the White House lectern in the wake of a deadly mass shooting. transcript na Mr. Obama took a veiled swipe at the National Rifle Association, which has successfully fought most limits on gun use and manufacture and has pushed through legislation in many states making gun ownership far easier. “And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt for sport, for protecting their families, to think about whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that suggests it is speaking for you,” he said. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to respond to Mr. Obama, saying that it was the organization’s policy “not to comment until all the facts are known.” Wayne LaPierre, the organization’s executive vice president, declared after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” On Thursday night, Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass shootings, people had “become numb to this.” “And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” Mr. Obama said. “Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ‘We need more guns,’ they’ll argue. ‘Fewer gun-safety laws.’ ” A selection of President Obama’s comments after mass shootings. “Does anybody really believe that?” he asked, his voice rising. Mr. Obama sought to answer that question years ago. After the massacre in 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislative changes that polls suggest were widely supported. “Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?” Mr. Obama asked then. Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul the nation’s gun laws that would have included universal background checks and a spate of other measures he deemed “concrete steps” aimed at preventing more mass shootings. “This is how we will be judged,” he said in January 2013. The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from both parties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president’s gun control agenda. At the time, and also visibly upset, Mr. Obama stood in the Rose Garden to denounce the opponents of new gun measures even as he acknowledged the futility of his efforts. transcript NA He called it a “shameful day” in Washington and promised that eventually, “I believe we’re going to be able to get this done.” In a Twitter message on Thursday, Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama until this year, remembered that afternoon as “the most frustrated I ever saw President Obama in 8 years.” With each massacre since, Mr. Obama has been forced to help the country grieve, as presidents are called upon to do in national tragedies. Thirteen dead at the Washington Navy Yard; three dead at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex.; nine dead in a church in Charleston, S.C. And with each massacre, his sense of powerless anger and frustration has built. But what was different this time was that the president did not announce any new initiative or effort to fix the problem. Instead, he pointed out that there is “a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer?” States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths than those that do not, he said. “So we know there are ways to prevent it,” he said. This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters by insisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety, and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts. But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federal government even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notion that the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons. He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed by terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the number killed by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions of dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively few terrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far greater number of gun deaths. And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority. “If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views,” he said. A selection of articles from New York Times series about weapons and mental health. Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant. His speeches since being elected in 2008 have sometimes seemed like lectures from the constitutional law professor he once was. But he is also a father, one who insists on eating dinner with his daughters. Shootings, particularly at schools, have seemingly brought together his roles as president and father in ways nothing else has. And that combination brings forth the kind of raw emotion he almost never betrays. His eulogy in June for the victims of the massacre in Charleston, for instance, was widely considered one of his most impassioned, and included singing the opening refrain of “Amazing Grace.” Thursday night, he had little of the soaring language and certainly none of the hope he expressed in Charleston. But he promised to continue hammering away at this issue for the rest of his presidency. “Each time this happens, I’m going to bring this up,” he said. “Each time this happens, I’m going to say that we can actually do something about it.” Advertisement",2015-10-02 00:00:00,"Obama Condemns ‘Routine’ of Mass Shootings, Says U.S. Has Become Numb - The New York Times","politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,firearms,murders and attempted murders",1,http://nytimes.com

          / CBS News Investigators in Oregon are sifting through clues trying to determine why a 26-year-old shot and killed nine people at a community college and wounded seven others. The alleged gunman, Chris Harper Mercer, also died after he allegedly opened fire at law enforcement officials at Umpqua Community College. The stories of heroes and survivors -- in some cases the same individuals -- are emerging in the wake of the mass shooting at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon. One man's family says he used his body to try and prevent the gunman getting to others, and pleaded for his life before being shot repeatedly. Activists report an apparent tweak in Russia's target selection as Vladimir Putin's military pounds anti-government fighters in Syria and the Kremlin suggests the operation -- which has suddenly shifted the international dialogue on the more-than-four-year crisis -- could go on for months. Russian intervention in Syria deepens the quandary for the Obama administration over what it can realistically do to help resolve the conflict, and whether it should risk allowing Syrian President Bashar Assad to increase his tenuous hold on power.  Could Russia's actions force President Obama to clarify the U.S. policy in Syria. Three high school football players died from game-related injuries last month alone, and 16 have died since 2013.

742,https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/10/how-to-turn-panic-over-terrorism-against-the-nra/408778/,"James Fallows leads an ongoing discussion with readers on the inevitability (or otherwise) of mass shootings in the U.S. To join in, drop us a note: hello@theatlantic.com. I’ve received a flood of mail in response to the Oregon shooting and this item on whether the United States is doomed to be the only developed nation that tolerates mass-fatality shootings as routine. The message quoted below is related to the evocative photo above, showing the moment in 1967 when armed Black Panthers marched into the California state capitol building in Sacramento. (This moment is also part of a great new documentary on the Black Panthers,  which its director Stanley Nelson discussed with our editor James Bennet at the Washington Ideas Forum this week.) This reader imagines what it would be like if today’s Muslims applied a similar approach: One sentence in your article reminded me of an idea a friend and I have had for a couple of years to combat the NRA.  ""[The President] highlighting the disproportion between America’s sky-is-falling sensitivity to the slightest potential risk that could be defined as 'terrorism' versus its blasé acceptance of unending home-grown killings.""  What if gun control advocates combined the two and exploited that terrorism sensitivity?   

One evening, my friend, who happens to be of Indian and Sri Lankan descent, noted the potential hypocrisy of many Second Amendment supporters in that all hell would likely break loose if he walked the streets with an AR-15. Over drinks, we imagined a video project whereby Muslim Americans legally purchase and carry firearms within the bounds of existing laws.  However, maybe in the introduction they are wearing hijabs, maybe they are speaking Arabic, maybe they are praying to Mecca.  And then with the help of body cameras, you can watch them purchase firearms at a gun show without a background check and maybe watch them buy 5 guns in a month.  Pursuant to proper permit, you can watch them carry, either concealed or openly, such firearm(s) to their mosque, to the park or to the grocery store.  Lastly, you can watch a group of Muslims Americans fire off hundreds of rounds a minute legally at a gun range.  

Additional videos could feature other minority groups which many 2nd Amendment supporters might consider members of the scary ""other"".  A 6'8'' African American male taking an assault rifle to a Black Panther meeting!  A bandana and tattooed clad Mexican American with a gun in his low rider. The point being to highlight the deficiencies in the existing system with Americans that NRA members might fear, or at least not be sympathetic to.  You can also explain how real undesirables, existing mass murderers or individuals with undocumented mental illness, exploited the system and/or stockpiled firearms and ammo.   

If the videos got big enough, it would be interesting to see the NRA's response as supporting everyone's right to easy access to guns may alienate some of their members and supporters.    

Both my friend and I are attorneys with young families so while we would  actually like to undertake this labor intensive endeavor, there will likely never be the time.  

I am a registered New York Republican.  My father was in law enforcement for 40+ years and I grew up in a home with firearms, which were properly protected.  I believe in the 2nd Amendment but obviously agree with your writings that there are reasonable restrictions that could and should be put in place to reduce the risk of mass shootings.  A part of my humanity died on December 14, 2012 as a result of the shooting itself but also the failure to take any steps to prevent further bloodshed.  I know it is underhanded to play off the biases of people but if it serves the greater good and results in less death and tragedy, I could look myself in the mirror. Three years ago, after the then-latest horrific mass shooting (the one in Aurora, Colorado), I did a short, angry Atlantic item called “The Certainty of More Shootings.” It ended this way: There will be more of these; we absolutely know it; we also know that we will not change the circumstances that allow such episodes to recur. I am an optimist about most things, but not about this. Everyone around the world understands this reality too. It is the kind of thing that makes them consider America dangerous, and mad. After that came: the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, with six people killed; the shooting in a business office in Minneapolis, with six people killed; the shooting in a hair salon in Wisconsin, with three people killed; the Sandy Hook / Newtown elementary school massacre, with 27 children and teachers shot to death; the shooting at Santa Monica College in California, with five people killed; the shootings at the Washington Navy Yard, with 13 people killed; the shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas, with three people killed (which was different from the earlier Ft. Hood shooting, with 13 people killed); the shooting at UC Santa Barbara, with 7 people killed; the shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, with nine people killed; the on-air shooting of two TV reporters in Virginia; yesterday’s shooting outside Roseburg, Oregon, with ten people killed; and of course the countless other gun-death episodes. I bet you had forgotten some of these. I agreed with every word, and with every point of furious emphasis, in President Obama’s powerful statement last night after the latest massacre, in Oregon: His anger at the ritual of saying “our thoughts and prayers are with the families” but doing nothing to prevent further such killings. His stress on America’s status as the only “advanced” society in which mass shootings are routine. His highlighting the disproportion between America’s sky-is-falling sensitivity to the slightest potential risk that could be defined as “terrorism” versus its blasé acceptance of unending home-grown killings. His clear, cold reminder that it is an ongoing political decision by America collectively not to do anything to prevent these killings. For now, all I can add is views from readers. From one in Los Angeles: The astonishing chart in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog today, showing that the likelihood of dying in a car crash is severely negatively correlated with education, makes me wonder if the same is true for dying in gun violence. I bet it is. And I bet that's a major reason there is no serious public policy attempt to stop gun violence. If dying of gun violence were positively correlated with country club membership or levels of investment income, I bet there would be dramatic policy changes tomorrow. But when the victims are poorer, or younger, or less white - those with real power simply do not care. It's heartbreaking and wrong In real-time chronicling mode, I am putting up this note before completing a search for graphs or studies on this point. I am sure that the reader’s supposition is right it comes to “routine” urban shootings. The mass murders in schoolyards, colleges, theaters, and shopping-malls are different, in making it easier for better-off Americans to think, that could have  been me. Worse, that could have been my child. But evidently not enough people have made that imaginative leap to make a political difference. *** From a reader in Florida: I have a ""modest proposal"", ala Swift, as an attempt to get some cultural change in our our acceptance of gun violence. Fully publicized unretouched crime scene photos.  Think for just a second if we all could see what a hollow point did to the head of a child at Sandy Hook... or Aurora... or Umpqua or ....  it might get some action. If we want easy access weapons, we should see what they really do to a human body. On one hand it's like making folks convicted of DUI's to watch crash movies, excepting that we in the popular culture haven't been convicted of a crime.  But then, maybe, we all have been guilty of doing nothing for long enough. It's crazy, I know, but sane proposals haven't worked. *** From another reader in Florida. An important backdrop point about his message, of course, is that the very sheriff in Oregon running the Roseburg investigation is himself a ferociously outspoken foe of gun-control laws. Here’s the Florida reader, with emphasis added: There's a really important dynamic that I think gives arsenalists their political power. It's open law enforcement sympathy for the armed faction of American society against the unarmed. Culturally, I think American law enforcement thinks of itself as protecting the 35 percent of armed Americans against the 65 percent who aren't. It's crazy; but I think it's true. That's because actual police generally come from the 35 percent of American households that own guns. And more importantly, I think most of them probably sympathize with arsenal owners because many of them own their own arsenals. (10+ guns) As long as police rhetoric and sympathy rests with armed arsenalists and not the unarmed, nothing is going to change. Police overwhelmingly support the laws that allow our debased gun culture to thrive. It's worth noting that mass shootings are good for the gun business, especially during Democratic administrations. It's similar to how Katrina was a great achievement for the anti-government right. We have got to stigmatize the ""gun hustler"" industry. We've got to stigmatize the business of arsenalists in a way that splits them from police. A very long-term project. And we have to come up with the language of seediness and gangsterism, like ""gun hustler,"" to do it. Or at least that's my take. So mass shootings, like street level brutality and the Drug War are all part of the same issue. *** From another reader, on possible cultural / commercial pressures: Ernest Hemingway bought a shotgun from Abercrombie & Fitch and then went home and shot himself. After that, A&F stopped selling guns. It might be effective to start publishing the names of the gun manufacturer and retail store who sold that gun for each killing. Shame is not the best motivator but sometimes it can work. And a policy like that wouldn't require any legislation, just journalist initiative. WalMart did of course decide to stop selling AR-15 rifles, cousin of the military’s M-16, earlier this year. Unfortunately it is hard to imagine gun-show vendors or local weapons shops being as responsive as the old A&F to a mainstream-media shaming campaign. *** And, finally for today, perhaps the most sobering observation: The problem isn't simply that we have too many guns in the US and that the barriers to acquiring one are so low; other countries such as Canada and Switzerland have comparable gun to population rates, and they do it without having a school massacre every year or two. This school shooting phenomenon is distinctly American; it has become part of our culture, like it or not, one in which kids grow up being told they are the greatest thing on earth, one in which we have killed off all sense of humor for the sake of not offending anyone, one with very poor services for those with mental health problems, and one where now we've seen so many school massacres its well within our normal daily consciousness and cultural dialogue. For America as a whole, the pandemic might be fading. For some communities, this year will be worse than last. The summer wasn’t meant to be like this. By April, Greene County, in southwestern Missouri, seemed to be past the worst of the pandemic. Intensive-care units that once overflowed had emptied. Vaccinations were rising. Health-care workers who had been fighting the coronavirus for months felt relieved—perhaps even hopeful. Then, in late May, cases started ticking up again. By July, the surge was so pronounced that “it took the wind out of everyone,” Erik Frederick, the chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield, told me. “How did we end up back here again?” The hospital is now busier than at any previous point during the pandemic. In just five weeks, it took in as many COVID-19 patients as it did over five months last year. Ten minutes away, another big hospital, Cox Medical Center South, has been inundated just as quickly. “We only get beds available when someone dies, which happens several times a day,” Terrence Coulter, the critical-care medical director at CoxHealth, told me. Why did so many Americans receive strange packages they didn’t think they’d ordered?  Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, sat atop his stallion Smokey and faced the camera. It was Saturday, August 1, 2020. Miller had a message to share. “Good morning, patriots,” Miller began, raising the coiled lasso in his right hand by way of greeting. “I don’t know about you, but I’m getting tired of all these surprises coming out of China. First it was the Chinese virus, then we had the murder hornets, then we had to close the embassy in Houston because of espionage … Now we’ve got all these mystery seeds coming in in the mail.” It was the seeds that Miller wanted to speak about. By then, news of the seeds had been circulating for several days. Packets were turning up at homes across the United States; residents of every state would eventually report receiving them. Their address labels and Customs declarations indicated that they had been sent from China. The contents were usually described as an item of jewelry—something like “rose stud earrings”—but inside would be a small packet of unidentified seeds. There was no evident reason why particular people were receiving particular seeds, or why people were receiving seeds at all. Mike White’s caustic six-part HBO series, The White Lotus, tackles the stickiest American addiction of all. In the first episode of HBO’s new miniseries The White Lotus, Shane (played by Jake Lacy) and his new wife, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), arrive on their honeymoon, on an unspecified Hawaiian island, with bagfuls of silk resort-wear and books by Malcolm Gladwell. Alone in their suite, Jake moves in to kiss Rachel, but he’s suddenly gripped by a suspicion that all might not be entirely copacetic. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait wait,” he says, detaching himself from his bride and lifting his face up to better sniff out the scent of deficiency. “This is the wrong room.” Thus begins a kind of one-man Waterloo, a furious and eventually bloody war between a luxury hotel and a wealthy guy who suspects he hasn’t gotten absolutely everything he’s paid for. Doctors have found a concerning link between the rare pediatric complication known as MIS-C and a syndrome related to tampon use. The U.S. fell short of its goal of giving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70 percent of adults by July 4, but not by much. About two-thirds of everyone above the age of 18 had gotten a shot when the holiday arrived, with coverage among seniors surpassing even that benchmark. That leaves kids—mostly unvaccinated—as the Americans most exposed to the pandemic this summer, while the Delta variant spreads. It’s said that COVID-19 may soon be a disease of the young. If that’s what’s coming, then its effects on children must be better understood. This month, The New England Journal of Medicine published new treatment guidelines for the occasionally fatal, COVID-related condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). When kids first started showing signs of MIS-C in early 2020—rash or conjunctivitis; low blood pressure; diarrhea or vomiting; etc.—doctors guessed it was an inflammatory disease that occurs most often in toddlers called Kawasaki disease. Now most experts believe it’s a separate condition, affecting kids at an average age of 8. No more than a few hundred children in the U.S. have died from COVID-19 during the pandemic—compared with more than half a million deaths overall—but more than 4,000 have developed MIS-C, and we still don’t have foolproof ways to cure it. But a handful of scientists think they’ve found important clues about what drives MIS-C. The disease, they say, may have something to do with a dangerous condition most commonly associated with tampon use. A short story During the interview, I realized almost immediately that the woman was pregnant—I guessed she was about halfway along—but she didn’t remark on it, and of course neither did I. Over the phone, we’d discussed only her 3-year-old daughter. The woman, whose name was Diane, was looking for a babysitter for the girl, whose name was Sophie, two mornings a week from 9 a.m. to noon, for $10 an hour. This was in late January 1997, my senior year at U-Dub—the University of Washington—and I’d seen the job advertised on an index card pinned to the bulletin board outside the career center, the information in tidy blue cursive. We met for the interview at a café near campus, after describing ourselves over the phone. She’d said, “I’m 5’4, and I have tortoiseshell glasses and light-brown hair cut in a bob.” Well-being is far from universal. Here are four models to help you understand the world—and your own mind. “How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Everyone knows where the happiest people in the world live—the United Nations tells us every single year. For the past several years, Finland has been ranked No. 1, sitting atop the pack of Nordic countries, which are all considered very happy. And since they’ve cracked the happiness code, as my colleague Joe Pinsker wrote recently, many of the rest of us are tempted to mimic Nordic habits. Live like a Finn—take a short walk in the forest, go ice swimming—and all will be well, right? Not so fast. In order for the World Happiness Report and other international happiness indexes to compare self-reports of happiness, they have to assume that people around the world define happiness and answer happiness surveys in roughly the same way. If this assumption does not hold, then happiness indexes are about as reliable as a ranking of music quality based on how much residents of each country say they like their local songs. This would indicate something about each country’s enthusiasm for their musical styles, but would provide little information about what music is objectively “best,” given differences in people’s traditions and tastes. Persistent hype around mRNA vaccine technology is now distracting us from other ways to end the pandemic. At the end of January, reports that yet another COVID-19 vaccine had succeeded in its clinical trials—this one offering about 70 percent protection—were front-page news in the United States, and occasioned push alerts on millions of phones. But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is “awash in other shots” already, as the The New York Times put it. Vaccines are still beating the variants, but the unvaccinated world is being pummeled. Fifteen months after the novel coronavirus shut down much of the world, the pandemic is still raging. Few experts guessed that by this point, the world would have not one vaccine but many, with 3 billion doses already delivered. At the same time, the coronavirus has evolved into super-transmissible variants that spread more easily. The clash between these variables will define the coming months and seasons. Here, then, are three simple principles to understand how they interact. Each has caveats and nuances, but together, they can serve as a guide to our near-term future. The vaccines have always had to contend with variants: The Alpha variant (also known as B.1.1.7) was already spreading around the world when the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns began. And in real-world tests, they have consistently lived up to their extraordinary promise. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna reduce the risk of symptomatic infections by more than 90 percent, as does the still-unauthorized one from Novavax. Better still, the available vaccines slash the odds that infected people will spread the virus onward by at least half and likely more. In the rare cases that the virus breaks through, infections are generally milder, shorter, and lower in viral load. As of June 21, the CDC reported just 3,907 hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people and just 750 deaths. No group like this one has ever gone to space before. Jeff Bezos has finalized the manifest for his company’s first passenger flight to space, and it’s a rather unusual bunch. There’s Bezos himself, the richest person in the world, who sold some of his Amazon stock to fund his space venture, Blue Origin. His brother, Mark, with whom he wanted to share the experience. Wally Funk, an 82-year-old American pilot who in the early 1960s passed the same training tests designed for male astronauts, but was rejected by NASA. And Oliver Daemen, a Dutch 18-year-old who graduated high school just last year. When they take off on Tuesday, they will each fulfill a personal dream, but as a crew, they’re making history: No group like this one has ever gone to space together before. Even the participants of the most diverse missions to the International Space Station have had far more in common with one another than this quartet. They were all professional astronauts, with comparable ages, educational backgrounds, and even temperaments, given that potential astronauts must undergo psychological screenings before getting the job. The motley crew of Blue Origin’s first passenger flight seems closer to a cast of offbeat characters gathered together for a zany adventure: If The Breakfast Club had the brain, the jock, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal, this Blue Origin flight has the boss, the tag-along, the real deal, and the kid. Last summer, unsolicited home deliveries sent Americans into a panic. The writer Chris Heath has discovered an explanation that many, including the USDA, don’t believe. Listen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts  Last summer, an unexplained phenomenon gripped nightly newscasts and Facebook groups across America: Unsolicited deliveries of obscurely labeled seed packages, seemingly from China, were being sent to Americans’ homes. Recipients reported the packages to local police, news stations, and agriculture departments; searched message boards for explanations; and theorized about conspiracies including election interference and biowarfare. Despite large-scale USDA testing of the packages, the mystery remained: Who sent the seeds and why? This week on The Experiment podcast, the host Julia Longoria speaks with the writer Chris Heath about his investigation of mystery seeds for The Atlantic, the byzantine world of international e-commerce, and the dangers of both panic and reason. The growing demand for more ethical practices across the entertainment industry has paved the way for a new profession. For nearly three decades, Christopher Knight lived undetected in the dense woods of Maine. For America as a whole, the pandemic might be fading.

No more than a few hundred children in the U.S. have died from COVID-19 during the pandemic—compared with more than half a million deaths overall—but more than 4,000 have developed MIS-C, and we still don’t have foolproof ways to cure it. But a handful of scientists think they’ve found important clues about what drives MIS-C. The disease, they say, may have something to do with a dangerous condition most commonly associated with tampon use. A short story During the interview, I realized almost immediately that the woman was pregnant—I guessed she was about halfway along—but she didn’t remark on it, and of course neither did I. Over the phone, we’d discussed only her 3-year-old daughter. The woman, whose name was Diane, was looking for a babysitter for the girl, whose name was Sophie, two mornings a week from 9 a.m. to noon, for $10 an hour. This was in late January 1997, my senior year at U-Dub—the University of Washington—and I’d seen the job advertised on an index card pinned to the bulletin board outside the career center, the information in tidy blue cursive. We met for the interview at a café near campus, after describing ourselves over the phone. She’d said, “I’m 5’4, and I have tortoiseshell glasses and light-brown hair cut in a bob.” Well-being is far from universal. Here are four models to help you understand the world—and your own mind. “How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Everyone knows where the happiest people in the world live—the United Nations tells us every single year. For the past several years, Finland has been ranked No. 1, sitting atop the pack of Nordic countries, which are all considered very happy. And since they’ve cracked the happiness code, as my colleague Joe Pinsker wrote recently, many of the rest of us are tempted to mimic Nordic habits. Live like a Finn—take a short walk in the forest, go ice swimming—and all will be well, right? Not so fast. In order for the World Happiness Report and other international happiness indexes to compare self-reports of happiness, they have to assume that people around the world define happiness and answer happiness surveys in roughly the same way. If this assumption does not hold, then happiness indexes are about as reliable as a ranking of music quality based on how much residents of each country say they like their local songs. This would indicate something about each country’s enthusiasm for their musical styles, but would provide little information about what music is objectively “best,” given differences in people’s traditions and tastes. Persistent hype around mRNA vaccine technology is now distracting us from other ways to end the pandemic. At the end of January, reports that yet another COVID-19 vaccine had succeeded in its clinical trials—this one offering about 70 percent protection—were front-page news in the United States, and occasioned push alerts on millions of phones. But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is “awash in other shots” already, as the The New York Times put it. Vaccines are still beating the variants, but the unvaccinated world is being pummeled. Fifteen months after the novel coronavirus shut down much of the world, the pandemic is still raging. Few experts guessed that by this point, the world would have not one vaccine but many, with 3 billion doses already delivered. At the same time, the coronavirus has evolved into super-transmissible variants that spread more easily. The clash between these variables will define the coming months and seasons. Here, then, are three simple principles to understand how they interact. Each has caveats and nuances, but together, they can serve as a guide to our near-term future. The vaccines have always had to contend with variants: The Alpha variant (also known as B.1.1.7) was already spreading around the world when the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns began. And in real-world tests, they have consistently lived up to their extraordinary promise. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna reduce the risk of symptomatic infections by more than 90 percent, as does the still-unauthorized one from Novavax. Better still, the available vaccines slash the odds that infected people will spread the virus onward by at least half and likely more. In the rare cases that the virus breaks through, infections are generally milder, shorter, and lower in viral load. As of June 21, the CDC reported just 3,907 hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people and just 750 deaths. No group like this one has ever gone to space before. Jeff Bezos has finalized the manifest for his company’s first passenger flight to space, and it’s a rather unusual bunch. There’s Bezos himself, the richest person in the world, who sold some of his Amazon stock to fund his space venture, Blue Origin. His brother, Mark, with whom he wanted to share the experience. Wally Funk, an 82-year-old American pilot who in the early 1960s passed the same training tests designed for male astronauts, but was rejected by NASA. And Oliver Daemen, a Dutch 18-year-old who graduated high school just last year. When they take off on Tuesday, they will each fulfill a personal dream, but as a crew, they’re making history: No group like this one has ever gone to space together before. Even the participants of the most diverse missions to the International Space Station have had far more in common with one another than this quartet. They were all professional astronauts, with comparable ages, educational backgrounds, and even temperaments, given that potential astronauts must undergo psychological screenings before getting the job. The motley crew of Blue Origin’s first passenger flight seems closer to a cast of offbeat characters gathered together for a zany adventure: If The Breakfast Club had the brain, the jock, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal, this Blue Origin flight has the boss, the tag-along, the real deal, and the kid. Last summer, unsolicited home deliveries sent Americans into a panic. The writer Chris Heath has discovered an explanation that many, including the USDA, don’t believe. Listen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts  Last summer, an unexplained phenomenon gripped nightly newscasts and Facebook groups across America: Unsolicited deliveries of obscurely labeled seed packages, seemingly from China, were being sent to Americans’ homes. Recipients reported the packages to local police, news stations, and agriculture departments; searched message boards for explanations; and theorized about conspiracies including election interference and biowarfare. Despite large-scale USDA testing of the packages, the mystery remained: Who sent the seeds and why? This week on The Experiment podcast, the host Julia Longoria speaks with the writer Chris Heath about his investigation of mystery seeds for The Atlantic, the byzantine world of international e-commerce, and the dangers of both panic and reason.

744,https://www.thedailybeast.com/americas-mass-shooting-capital-is-chicago,"SEARCH People living in Chiraq’s worst neighborhoods are more likely to be killed than citizens of the world’s leading murder capitals. CHICAGO — Four men and two women were shot on April 5 last year, then five weeks later a 15-year-old boy and two men were shot. Another 15-year-old boy and two men were shot in July. Three men were shot on August 21. Three men and a 73-year-old woman were shot in September. Again in September, two boys ages 12 and 16 were shot along with an 18-year-old man. Two women and one man were shot on that same block on Nov. 19. These mass shootings didn’t happen in Roseburg, Lafayette, Charleston, or Chattanooga but in Chicago’s worst neighborhoods, where—by one measure—it is more dangerous to live than the world’s most-murderous countries. West Garfield Park, population 18,000, had 21 murders last year, which makes for a homicide rate of 116 per 100,000 people. The world’s leader in murders, Honduras, has a homicide rate of 90, according to the United Nations. Following West Garfield Park in lethality was West Englewood and its 73.3 murder rate, more than second-place Venezuela with its 53.7 rate. Chicago’s Chatham (58) beats Belize (44.7); Englewood (52.6) outdoes El Salvador (41.2); South Chicago (48) tops Guatemala (39.9). The United States as a whole has 4.5 murders per 100,000. Chicago’s 411 homicides don’t look like a lot compared the city’s 2.7 million residents, but that’s the misleading part of this grim numbers game: Determining a city’s level of violence by looking at its overall per capita rate doesn’t tell you shit if you don’t examine numbers in the hood. And West Garfield Park is certainly that. The neighborhood has an average annual income of just more than $10,000; 40 percent of households live below the poverty line. West Garfield Park ranks near the top of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods on the city’s “hardship index,” which is calculated by taking into account those living in crowded housing, and unemployment rates among teens and adults, among other factors. The higher the number, the more difficult life will be, according to the statisticians. West Garfield Park and its 96 percent black residents scores 92 on the hardship index. Many of those killed last year in West Garfield Park were men in their twenties. But there were others whose deaths are perhaps less dismissable. Shamiya Adams, an 11-year-old killed by a bullet to the head as she sat in a friends bedroom making s’mores, could be one. Or 21-year-old Shambreyh Barfield, killed by gunfire intended for someone else as she sat on her front porch with a friend, might be one to pick out as a particularly tragic death. And for every person killed by gunfire in Chicago, another four are shot and survive. Last year the city had more than 2,000 shootings and has surpassed that total in 2015. West Garfield Park’s per capita shooting rate was a staggering 411 per 100,000 people, followed closely behind by West Englewood’s 391.5. The media and politicians don’t really care about that though. The new “epidemic” is mass shootings, they say, just a few months removed from the previous epidemic of police killings. Those clamoring for change in the wake of another unexpected gun massacre are right: Mass shootings are a problem—in Chicago. The city saw 107 mass shootings last year, defined as having three or more victims. As of July 25 of this year, there have been 192 mass shootings, according to the Chicago Tribune. When a crazed gunman shoots up innocents on a tree-lined campus in a sleepy Oregon town, calls to action are loud and forceful. But when six people are shot in the 4300 block of West Wilcox in Chicago—as they were last year—there is silence. It can be hard for readers to keep up—let alone for people to contemplate—the daily massacres on Chicago’s streets. Just last week, a grandmother, her pregnant daughter, and the woman’s 11-month-old son were shot in a drive-by in Chicago’s Back of the Yards neighborhood. The child lived; his mother and grandmother did not. “You would think that the attention would be tremendous, but it really wasn’t,” Pastor Corey Brooks said. While he was surprised to hear that some Chicago neighborhoods near his own trumped per capita murder rates of violent South American countries, Brooks wasn’t that surprised. “We keep telling people about the magnitude and seriousness of the issue, but we’re obviously not getting people to hear the message,” the anti-violence pastor and rare black Republican said. “I think what’s going on is it’s expected, that people think it’s a way of life on the South Side of Chicago. And people have been desensitized.” With 6,000 shootings since 2012, perhaps that’s to be expected. *** It should be obvious why there are so many shootings in Chicago: guns. An illegal gun is recovered every 75 minutes by Chicago police, they say. Mississippi sent 4,000 illegal guns to Chicago in the last decade. Nineteen percent of guns seized by police between 2009 and 2013 came from Indiana, which does not require background checks for firearm purchases online or at gun shows. Straw purchasers buy up the guns, take a short drive over the state line, and sell them on the streets. The city may have strict gun laws—less strict than gun nuts would claim—but they’re doing next to nothing to stem the tide of illegal guns from states with weak gun laws. The Chicago Police Department does not break down homicides and shootings by neighborhood. Instead, The Daily Beast compiled the figures on West Garfield Park and West Englewood based on publicly available data and the help of a private, anonymous citizen who runs a Chicago crime website. Furthermore, there is no way to compare the neighborhood shooting rates to those at the national level, because there is no national shooting data. The best the feds can do to keep up with the hail of bullets is to estimate how many people get shot based on how many are admitted to the hospital each year with non-fatal gunshot wounds, which can be from suicides, accidents, or attempted homicides. An uptick in shootings and homicides this year is one of the reasons the Chicago City Council’s Black Caucus called for Superintendent Garry McCarthy’s head on Monday. Lorenzo Davis, a former Chicago police commander who went on to blow the whistle against his former department over whitewashed police shootings, is quick to criticize McCarthy and the force. Guns are a massive problem, Davis said, but so is the lack of black cops and officials in the department, which doesn’t help relations with the community. Complacency among police and prosecutors, reduced manpower, unwillingness on the part of victims and witnesses to identify suspects—all lead to a street culture that often results in killers going free. “When I was a police commander there were a handful of guys who killed five or six people,” Davis said. “They would kill someone, then they would kill the witnesses.” Jedidiah Brown, a pastor who works to mediate conflicts between gang members and others who often look to settle scores with shots fired, said guns are part of broader issues within street culture. “We have civilization and we have education, but we also have a Wild West mentality,” said Brown. Brown isn’t alone. Tio Hardiman, president of the Violence Interrupters, regularly works in West Garfield Park to prevent minor beefs from turning into mass shootings. Hardiman says he has personally saved eight lives in the past few years. “A lot of people talk a lot of good talk, but the only way to stop the killing is, you have to know the killer,” Hardiman explained. “You have to have a relationship with the killer to stop them at that moment in their life.” That means having deep roots in the streets. Hardiman doesn’t work with police, who distrusted by many in West Garfield Park and other majority black neighborhoods. “Our job is to prevent retaliation and stop it on the front end,” he said. Hardiman’s corps include some men in their twenties, others nearing 60. Too much contact with the police and “they’d lose their street credibility,” he said. “We cannot be satisfied with people’s lives being taken prematurely, especially when you’re dealing with a lot of children,” said Brooks, the South Side pastor, and drove home the point: “These are children that are killing one another.” Street connections are key to resolving disputes and preventing more deaths and shootings—a never-ending job in West Garfield Park and elsewhere. That’s because the nature of gun violence has changed drastically since the crack-fueled gang turf wars of the late ’80s and early ’90s. Even in those violent years, when annual homicides approached and passed 1,000, there was a sense of order, Askari Ali said. Hierarchical gang structures provided guidance—and rules. Now, chaos reigns. “Back in the day, what you did, it was accounted for,” said Ali, a community organizer who was born and raised in Chicago’s violent Austin neighborhood. “If we used to see on the news that you shot a pregnant woman or a kid back in those days, a gang would come and get you.” A self-described black nationalist, Ali works from the street level up—eschewing affiliation with groups like the Nation of Islam and others who attach a religious or political agenda to anti-violence efforts. The more-structured gang culture of the ’80s and ’90s “would make a young person more conscious of what they were doing,” Ali told The Daily Beast. “Now, if you go shoot up a McDonald’s and a child dies, nine times out of 10 people are gonna say, ‘You a savage, you go hard.’” The impact of so many people being killed along with their counterparts who live through shootings seems impossible to determine. “You can do the numbers and discover that murder is big business, and that murders are driving up a lot of costs,” said Brooks, the South Side pastor. “But what they’re not paying attention to is the trauma that families are experiencing, that children are experiencing. These children are growing up in war-like conditions.” The constant violence creates an atmosphere of fear and lack of self-respect; both Ali and Hardiman refer to the phenomenon as “self-hatred.” “A lot of the young guys will tell you, ‘Well, I don’t like him because he lives on different block,’” said Hardiman. “And when you ask why, the answer is, ‘I just don’t like him.’” This adds to the chaos, according to Hardiman. “They’re killing babies, shooting mothers, shooting kids… The mentality is, ‘If I don’t like myself there’s no way I’m gonna like you.’” Askari Ali puts it more bluntly. “They don’t appreciate life because they feel like their life not shit,” said the 26-year-old of kids coming up now. “So they got no problem taking your life.” Both Hardiman and Ali suggested a slew of fixes for the systemic violence plaguing their communities, which neighbor one another on the city’s West Side: jobs programs, community centers, intervention from people who can speak the same language as the 13- and 14-year-olds with no hope and easy access to guns, drugs, and street life. “A lot of these young people, all they have is their respect. They have nothing else,” said Davis. “And if someone disrespects them, they settle the score with guns.”",2015-10-08 05:00:00,America’s Mass-Shooting Capital Is Chicago,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

According to the Anti-Defamation League, it was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. The shooter targeted the synagogue for its work with HIAS — a Jewish organization that resettles refugees in the United States. The shooter, in a conspiracy theory that linked Trump-era xenophobia to longstanding anti-Semitic tropes, blamed Jews for the caravan of Central American migrants and asylum-seekers currently working its way slowly though Mexico to the United States — and blamed HIAS, in particular, for fomenting an invasion of Central Americans and other nonwhites to replace white Americans. The irony of this conspiracy theory is that it correctly identifies an important shift in HIAS' mission: the organization, founded a century ago specifically to help Jewish immigrants in the US, has recently found itself trying to encourage Americans (Jewish or otherwise) to care about the global refugee crisis and support its victims from Central America to Syria. But of course, to HIAS, this isn't about demographic replacement but a simple matter of justice. In 2015, I spoke to the president of HIAS, Mark Hetfield, about how the organization sees itself and its mission in the 21st century. It's as good an introduction as any to the vision that Saturday's shooter was, literally, trying to kill. Dara Lind: What is the work that HIAS does with refugees in the US, and what role do Jewish communities play in that work? Mark Hetfield: We are one of the nine refugee resettlement agencies [organizations that the government contracts with to help integrate refugees in the United States, and pair up with individual refugees]. We resettle refugees to the United States and receive them in communities, get them set up in new homes, get the kids to school, get them jobs, etc. That's always been the core work of the agency. Our resettlement system was established in the late 1970s, to deal with the Soviet Jewry movement, to be the way to think globally and act locally when it came to Soviet Jews. We were able to enlist more than 100 Jewish communities and federations, Jewish Family Services agencies around the country, to welcome Soviet Jews, and welcome them to American society and to the American Jewish community at the local level. That was done through us, and that's how our system was developed. We have the same system today, but today we're bringing in a very different refugee population than the Soviet Jews — and overwhelmingly, they're not Jewish. And our network is much smaller than it was during the peak of Soviet Jewish immigration. A lot of Jewish communities dropped out as the number of Soviet Jews arriving declined. Today, our network is only of about 20 local agencies. In Ohio, we have affiliates that were established by two Soviet Jewish women — they were refugees themselves — who worked for the Jewish Family Service. They were heartbroken when the Jewish Family Service Columbus dropped out of refugee resettlement, so they started their own very successful organization, which now resettles primarily Syrians in Toledo, Ohio, and Iraqis and diverse populations in Columbus and Cleveland. We're definitely trying to find ways to engage local Jewish communities in this, even if they've dropped out. But right now, we're kind of rethinking and redesigning the way we do refugee resettlement at the local level, because we know we have to update our model from the Soviet Jewry era. Now we welcome refugees not because they're Jewish, but because we're Jewish.    Dara Lind: That seems like a pretty significant shift, not just from the 1970s but for decades before that — after all, the international refugee system was set up after the world failed to help European Jews trying to escape Hitler in the lead-up to the Holocaust. Can you talk more about how HIAS evolved from helping Jewish refugees to helping refugees, period? Mark Hetfield: In the earlier part of our history, we advocated for people because they were Jews, because they were landsmen. And we tried to beg for charity, we tried to beg for the United States, and then when the United States shut its doors, for other countries to take Jews in. But we began to realize that if you want to be successful, you can't advocate for just Jewish resettlement, you have to advocate for the rights of refugees to be protected. You have to advocate for all human rights. Particularly when you're the member of a minority, you begin to realize just how important it is to human rights and the human rights angle. So we focus very much on the Refugee Convention. That's been our Torah, in a way. And the Jewish history is a history of displacement. There are 36 mentions in the Torah about the need to love the stranger as yourself. I counted them once; I got to 36. We know the heart of a stranger, because we were strangers once in Egypt. And that's just been true over and over again. So it's both part of our ancient teachings and our recent historical experience. And HIAS has been kind of the engine of that for the last 130 years, for the American Jewish community anyway. We feel it's important to do the same for others, to pay it forward. Dara Lind: How has HIAS been engaging the bigger Jewish community to help? Mark Hetfield: It's really important to us that the American Jewish community engage on refugee issues, because it's really a part of who we are. But we hadn't made an organized effort to do that. We had paid all of our attention to delivering resources to refugees, to resettling refugees, on advocacy inside the Beltway on behalf of refugees. And of course, we're doing this as part of the American Jewish community, we're considered to be part of the American Jewish establishment, but we were kind of doing it without — how do I say this? — we were doing it without much engagement by the community we were representing. So we decided to create a department that would focus on promoting refugee protection and the importance of refugee protection among American Jews, whether they're affiliated or not. Develop materials for services, just get out there more and speak as Jews on the importance of refugee protection in general. We didn't have any such department, or any people who were focused on that, a year and a half ago. But now we do. We have a small department where this is their focus.  Dara Lind: And how well has that been working? Have you found that American Jews still understand refugees as a ""Jewish issue,"" even when the refugees themselves aren't Jewish? Mark Hetfield I have to say, if you had asked me that question a month ago my answer would have been totally different. Totally, totally different. There was a real transformation over the month of [August 2015, as the Syrian refugee crisis dominated global headlines] in the way the American Jewish community was engaging in refugee issues in general, and refugee issues regarding Syrians in particular. Frankly, when I would speak to congregations — which I do pretty frequently — the Syrian refugee crisis, even though it's the largest crisis in the world, did not capture anyone's interest. I think because they view it as ""just another problem in the Middle East,"" ""just another problem of a community that doesn't like Israel and doesn't like Jews."" You'd get comments like, ""Why would I bring people here who want to burn down my synagogue?"" So I'd have to focus more on Ukraine or on Iranian religious minorities. Dara Lind: What changed? Mark Hetfield: Over the month of August, first you had the Sudanese guy who tried to cross the English Channel on foot, and that got some interest. And then people really started to wake up when they discovered the 71 decomposing bodies of refugee men, women, and children in Austria. And then, of course, just days later, when Aylan Kurdi's body was discovered on the shores of Turkey and photographed — that's what really humanized the crisis and made American Jews really relate to the refugee plight of the Syrians. It's just amazing what a difference that photograph made. I really think it was that single photograph that took the message home and made people realize that this is something we have to do something about. This is something we as a community can really, really relate to. Because HIAS has just recently become in a position to work with the community, to give them resources, we were able to respond to this need that arose out of this refugee crisis. In other words, we didn't drive it, but we were there to respond to it. Dara Lind: Of course, people can be interested in, say, donating to help people in need, but not necessarily interested in doing political advocacy. Are you seeing interest in, for instance, calling members of Congress? Mark Hetfield: A lot of people are making it clear they don't just want to write a check —they want to engage on the issue. And that's what we've been calling for. We have these petitions going. We put out an action alert this week for people to call their members of Congress, which is really very important because the president, while he can make refugee determinations and set the refugee ceiling just by consulting with [the State Department], he needs the funding to be able to do it, to bring refugees here. So that's a major part of our effort. Frankly, the refugee ceiling will not get increased without such pressure. It's not just from our community. I just think that our community, because these are Syrians, have a particularly important voice in the discussion. What's also been amazing is that all these congregations are calling, asking us how can they sponsor a refugee, how can they take a Syrian refugee family in. And this hasn't happened since Kosovo, literally since 1999. And that's been really moving. And because of the way the US refugee program works, we don't really have an answer for them right now, because there aren't that many Syrian refugees arriving in the first place, although we did resettle around a hundred in our network this year — mostly in Toledo, Pittsburgh, and Springfield, Massachusetts. But people really want to do some real work and even bring them into their homes. So we're telling them to sit tight, the most important thing you can do right now is to advocate, and ultimately there will be plenty of volunteer opportunities to help the new refugees once they actually start arriving. What we keep trying to emphasize is that this crisis right now really is a global crisis. This is not about one situation. Right now, the world has more refugees displaced than at any time since World War II. And most are not related to the Syria conflict, though that's the biggest. In fact, in most places where we work, we work in other places where there's mass displacement. People who have been refugees for a long time and still have serious integration difficulties and serious protection problems. We always try to put the Syria crisis in the context of the global crisis. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

        Leticia Miranda Posted on October 5, 2015, at 11:50 a.m. ET Last Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, which left 10 people dead, rekindled debates about gun violence in the United States. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight tackled the argument that mass shootings are more about mental illness, not guns. In Oliver's 12-minute monologue, he says that bringing up mental health after a mass shooting just steers the conversation away from gun control. He adds that ""the aftermath of a mass shooting might be the worst time to talk about mental health,"" because the majority of violence in the U.S. is committed by people without mental illnesses and, statistically, people with mental illnesses are often the targets of violence. The country's mentally ill are blamed for violence and simultaneously stripped of any public safety net for treatment. Oliver explains how a 1963 bill signed by President John F. Kennedy closed the dilapidated asylums for the mentally ill, once called ""snake pits."" But the country failed to fund the local community mental health programs that were intended to replace the old hospitals. The result is that, still decades later, people with mental illnesses are either treated by the country's jail system, sent to nursing homes for care, or in some cases, like patients at one Nevada hospital, are simply bussed out of town. Oliver challenged conservative politicians, like Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, and Ben Carson, who argue that mass shootings show the country needs to get better at treating people with mental illnesses. ""Ok fine, do it then,"" said Oliver. ""Because if we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control then the very least we owe them is a fucking plan.""

749,https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/oct/07/gun-demanding-control-firearms-psychology,"Much has been said about gun control in the wake of yet another mass shooting in the US, but the heated and divided nature of the debate means that a fundamental question is often overlooked; why is it people actively want guns in the first place? The answers are not as obvious as you may think Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST Once again, we’ve had yet another mass shooting in the US. That the previous sentence can even be written in a serious manner is a bleak summary of the situation. Even President Obama has clearly lost patience with the regularity of such horrific occurrences. As ever, the fallout includes endless scapegoating, political posturing and analysis. It all boils down to a large number of people not wanting to lose their guns under any circumstances.  Those opposed to gun control regularly cite the second amendment, granting US citizens the right to bear arms. But having the right to do something doesn’t make it mandatory. I have the right to smear myself in peanut butter and dance naked through my kitchen. But I don’t, because I have no interest in doing so. So why do millions of ordinary people see weapons that use controlled explosives to propel bits of metal at lethal speeds at people, and think “I need that in my house”. Basically, why do so many want guns? Given the diversity of gun owners, there isn’t going to be any comprehensive or obvious answer. However, there are a few scientific explanations that could help understand how this comes about. Despite the preconceptions of many, according to a Gallup poll from 2005, the most common reason given for gun ownership is protection. Just like large dogs or security lights, guns are something people have to ensure their safety from intruders. Some might argue this is a cop-out, something gun owners say to seem moral and credible, and maybe sometimes that’s fair. However, it’s also the most common answer given by juvenile offenders incarcerated for gun-related crimes. If you’re already in jail for gun crimes, it should be obvious why you wanted a gun, but still the most common answer among such people is “protection”. This may seem excessively paranoid to those of us in countries where guns aren’t so familiar, but in the US at least they’re much more commonplace. I remember being struck by this on my one visit there. Even the guy supervising a car park had a gun. Why? How often does a Chrysler go on a rampage and need to be brought down? Humans are all about self-preservation and prone to anticipating worst-case scenarios, so if you’re surrounded by people with guns, it would be logical to conclude you need one too. This doesn’t address why guns became so widespread to begin with, but it would explain why this situation persists. And if self-preservation rather than aggression is why you have a gun, you’d undoubtedly be loath to lose it. Another common answer for why people own guns is recreation. Target shooting and hunting are two popular recreational activities, and whatever you think of them, would explain ownership of guns by a substantial number of people. Sometimes the simple explanation is correct; people enjoy hobbies, and hobbies require equipment. Many gun owners confess to feeling vulnerable or “naked” without their guns. Perhaps this isn’t surprising; having a gun gives you considerable power over people. If you feel small, or weak, or underachieving, or anything like this, dealing with others can induce a great deal of social anxiety. A gun would provide at least one easy way where you can have the advantage over them for once, even if this reasoning only occurs at a subconscious level. Achieving high social status is important to your typical human, and guns can play a big role in this in cultures where they’re common. Trouble is, of course, if everyone else has a gun too, then it’s not so useful. So you need more guns, or bigger guns, and on it goes. The fact that it’s more often men who own guns suggests masculinity (toxic or otherwise) plays a part too. And while associating gun ownership with mental health issues is (rightly) considered shameless scapegoating, there is some evidence suggesting gun ownership correlates with tendencies towards anger and impulsivity. It’s reminiscent of how Douglas Adams described people who seek power, in that that those who want it the most are least suitable to have it. It’s now common to see people queuing up for days on end to buy the latest iPhone. Sacrificing home comforts and hours/days of their lives, even travelling great distances, purely to buy a device which is slightly different to one they already own. Why? Clearly there are social and cultural factors that mean owning an up-to-date iPhone is absolutely essential to many people. Why wouldn’t this be true of guns to others? If you grow up and are immersed in a culture where gun ownership is the norm, even praised, of course this is going to influence your attitudes. Earlier suggestions that gun owners are “making excuses” for having firearms don’t make sense when you consider that, for many, owning a gun is a good thing, something to be praised for. They wouldn’t make excuses if they saw nothing that needed excusing. Guns being a status symbol or highly-valued accessory, like iPhones and the like, would explain sheer variety of guns available, at least in the US. If guns were purely for home protection, then you’d only need one basic sort, maybe two. But no, gun enthusiasts often end up owning a wide variety of them. Unless they anticipate being besieged by armed mobs (which could be the case), this makes more sense when you assume that guns infer social status in the culture in which someone is immersed, meaning more or better guns provide higher status. Polarisation can push this even further, beyond any rational limits. Everything else There are many other possible factors that could result in someone wanting a gun, most of which probably aren’t even hinted at here. Gun ownership is more common amongst those with right—wing views, so a stronger self-interest, authoritarian personality and mistrust of other groups may make a gun feel like more of an essential item. Modern entertainment is saturated with guns, usually in the context of good guys using them to deal with less desirable sorts. What we see in the media can, within reason, affect our views and behaviour, so if guns are regularly seen being used to save the day, then no doubt this will rub off on some. Similarly, the making and selling of guns is also a very lucrative industry, so the companies behind it are going to promote the benefits of firearms as often as possible. And, sadly, you always seem to get the people who acquire guns purely to do harm to others, for whatever warped reasoning motivates them. This piece isn’t meant to justify gun ownership, it’s just an attempt to look at how it becomes so commonplace, and why so many people defend it in the face of an ever-increasing list of tragedies. Understanding why people want to own a gun should be essential to better regulate them, because if you just rely on condemnation and blanket criticism of gun owners, they aren’t going to simply agree and hand over their weapons. They’re more likely to double down and become even more adamant that they’re in the right, making gun control ever more difficult. With an issue so serious, this is the last thing anyone needs. Dean Burnett attempted to write an objective, neutral article on the issue of gun ownership and has no doubt failed spectacularly.

Caren and Tom Teves, whose son Alex died shielding his girlfriend in the 2012 massacre at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, say a greater emphasis on the victims instead of the shooter in Roseburg, Oregon, is a welcome shift.

        Claudia Koerner Reporting From Roseburg, Oregon Reporting From Roseburg, Oregon Posted on October 4, 2015, at 6:04 p.m. ET In the chaotic hours after the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, names and faces were floated on the internet by amateur sleuths and pranksters claiming to have identified the gunman. The next day, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters that the medical examiner, not him, would soon be releasing the shooter's official identity — 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer. “I will not name the shooter,” the sheriff said. “I will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice.” It was a moment that brought hope for Caren and Tom Teves, whose son Alex died shielding his girlfriend in the 2012 massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Since then, the Teveses have worked to keep their son’s legacy alive while advocating that his killer be forgotten. “We’re starting to make an impact,” Tom Teves said. “What’s the downside? There’s no downside except people may live.” The Teveses started No Notoriety, a challenge to media to be responsible when they report on mass shootings. It was inspired in the immediate aftermath of the Aurora shooting — as the Teveses looked for information about what had happened to Alex, all they could see was the face of the gunman. “When my son’s heroism was overlooked and replaced by the coward that killed him, that just added to the grief,” Caren Teves said. The next day, as they stood in the parking lot of the theater, Tom Teves offered a challenge to CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Go for 60 seconds without saying his name. Or 24 hours. Or forever. Tom and Caren Teves speak to members of the media while holding a t-shirt bearing the images of the twelve who were killed in the Aurora movie theater shooting in July. The challenge was born out of an attempt for emotional survival, Caren Teves said. The couple then began researching mass shootings and the motivations behind them. “The fact has come back unequivocally that it’s notoriety and fame,” Tom Teves said. In the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting, a single motive is seldom clear. Experts have pointed to factors such as narcissistic personalities, desires for revenge against society, and a lack of empathy. In a number of cases — including Umpqua Community College — the shooter studied other mass shootings. “It becomes a marketing campaign for the next shooter, and people deserve to live,” Teves said. BuzzFeed News has published Mercer’s name and photo as part of its coverage. Referring to the graphic videos of beheadings by ISIS, Executive Editor Shani Hilton has previously discussed the company's stance on reporting content that’s readily available on the internet. ""We don’t want to sanitize the Internet,” she said. “It’s there on the internet, our audience is on the internet, so to pretend like there’s some artificial wall between our audience and the raw content, it seems a little silly to me.” Though Tom Teves refers to the man who shot his son as “the coward” or “it,” he said he understands that the media has a job to do. He does, however, ask the media to be responsible: Report the story as you normally would, but name the shooter only once if necessary and refrain from continually showing the same photos. “That will take the celebrity off that person,” he said. As Umpqua Community College began to appear on the news last week, he said he saw more stories about the victims, the events themselves, and the college’s place in the community. “The tide is starting to turn, he said. ""It doesn’t take an act of Congress, it takes an act of conscience.” In Roseburg, a small community where almost everyone was somehow connected to the tragedy, residents said they were most concerned for the victims, the survivors, and their families. The hashtag #dontsayhisname began to spread quickly, and many called for a focus on the stories of heroism that began to emerge with #coverthecourage. Everyone's talking about the shooting, and I'm at the hospit trying to see my friend who is in critical condition. #dontsayhisname #IAmUCC At a prayer vigil near Roseburg on Saturday, a speaker echoed the call to refrain from using the shooter’s name. But not everyone in Roseburg is onboard. PJ Jackson, who attended the vigil with a friend, suggested that telling Harper-Mercer's story could bring improvements to the nation's mental health system, perhaps preventing a future tragedy. “That has to be addressed,” she said. Treven was shot, bleeding, and used his body to cover Lacey's body.. So #DontSayHisName thought she was dead covered in blood. What a hero💚 As the tug of war over reporting and glorification continues, the victims’ families face a long, and potentially lonely, road ahead, the Teveses said. The grief is consuming and not everyone in the community will be as deeply affected. “As time goes on, people will get tired of the fact that you’re in pain and want you to get over it,” Tom Teves said. “You will lose friends.” So their fight for No Notoriety — to prevent future shootings — continues, as does their work to keep the memory of Alex alive, to make sure the 24-year-old who had recently received his masters in psychology, who mentored troubled youth, who died saving someone he loved, outshines and outlasts the mark in time left by his killer. “All we want is people just to remember our child,” Caren Teves said. buzzfeed.com buzzfeed.com  Claudia Koerner is an editor and reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

After killingÂ 10 peopleÂ and wounding seven more, Mercer died in a shootout with police, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin confirmed at a Thursday press conference. According to the first 911 calls, the shooting occurred at 10:38 a.m. PT, according to theÂ New York Times. Shortly before the shooting was reported, Mercer walked into Snyder Hall, a building on campus that houses the science department, and opened fire.Â Responding to the fatal shooting, emergency officials transported staff and students by bus to the Douglas County Fairground, according to an Oregon State Police news release. In the hours that followed, members of the Oregon community waited for information about the gunman to surface. ""All I know is that two students came into our kitchen ... and told us they heard gunshots,"" Liliana Navarro, a cashier at Umpqua Community College's Logger's Cafe, toldÂ Mic shortly after the shooting. ""All of a sudden my manager is telling us we need to lock down."" Oregon Sen.Â Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, joined the conversation on Facebook. ""I am absolutely heartbroken by today's news from Umpqua Community College,"" Merkley wrote in a Facebook post. ""I know that the hearts and thoughts of all Oregonians are with the victims, their families and the entire community. I and my team are standing by to assist in any way we can."" Thursday's shooting at Umpqua Community College marked the 142nd school shooting in the United States since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012.Â Oct. 2, 2015, 8:50 a.m.: This story has been updated to reflect the revised official victim count at Umpqua Community College.Â Correction: Oct. 1, 2015",2015-10-02 00:00:00,Chris Harper Mercer Identified as Oregon Shooter; What We Know About Umpqua Gunman,,109076,http://mic.com/

10.2.2015 6:30 AM President Obama is tired of calling for more gun control after every mass shooting, and I am tired of explaining why that knee-jerk reaction is illogical. But he feels duty-bound to continue (""each time this happens, I'm going to bring this up,"" he says), and I guess I do too. Last night Obama gave an impassioned 13-minute speech, ostensibly in response to yesterday's murder of nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, by a gunman who died after a shootout with police. The president insisted that ""modest regulation,"" consistent with the Second Amendment rights of ""law-abiding gun owners,"" could ""prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America."" But as Brian Doherty pointed out, Obama did not mention a single specific policy fitting that description. That telling omission makes it pretty hard to buy Obama's argument that anyone who opposes ""common-sense gun-safety laws"" has blood on his hands. ""This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,"" he said. ""We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction."" If only we had done something, in other words, those people in Oregon would still be alive. But we are left to guess what that thing might be. Obama did offer some clues. ""It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun,"" he said. So presumably the ""common-sense gun legislation"" he supports has something to do with making it harder for would-be mass murderers to obtain firearms. The problem is that would-be mass murderers look a lot like ""law-abiding gun owners"" until they commit their crimes (because that is what they are), and any effort to distinguish between the two groups is bound to be underinclusive, missing seemingly harmless people with murder in their hearts, or overinclusive, depriving actually harmless people of their constitutional rights. Probably it will be both. That is certainly true of existing restrictions on firearm ownership, which exclude millions of people—including pot smokers, illegal immigrants, nonviolent felons, and the targets of involuntary psychiatric treatment—who would never have used a gun to harm anyone. Meanwhile, these rules allow the vast majority of mass shooters to legally buy their weapons because at the time of the purchase none of the disqualifying criteria applies to them. Strengthening enforcement of these restrictions, whether by making databases more complete or by requiring background checks for private gun transfers as well as sales by federally licensed firearm dealers (as Oregon started doing in August), therefore will do little to prevent mass shootings, but it will deprive many people who pose no threat to others of a basic human right: the right to armed self-defense. We do not know yet where the Oregon shooter obtained his weapons (a rifle and three handguns), whether he had a disqualifying criminal or psychiatric record, or whether he underwent a background check. Maybe he will turn out to be an exception: a mass shooter who was legally disqualified from buying guns for a reason that would have been flagged by a properly performed background check. But even if that's true, it does not change the basic picture: Restrictions on gun ownership affect far more innocent people than criminals, who generally find a way around them, and mass shooters typically do not even need to avoid the background checks that Obama seems to think would stymie them. There are similar problems with proposals to loosen the criteria for coercive psychiatric treatment. ""It's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds,"" Obama said, ""regardless of what they think their motivations may be."" But how does he propose to identify this sort of mind sickness before the fact? Only a small percentage of people who receive psychiatric diagnoses commit violent crimes, and psychiatrists are notoriously bad at predicting which ones will. Anticipating the charge that he is using a tragedy for political purposes, Obama embraced that description. ""This is something we should politicize,"" he said. ""It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic."" Obama is right that important political issues are at stake—in particular, the extent to which Americans should sacrifice their freedom for an empty promise of safety.

That’s the aim. Registration, confiscation. State agents will become the only law-abiding gun owners, and then utopia. And when the bodies of the innocent STILL pile up what then? More police, of course. The bodies of the innocent will pile up DUE TO the police (not just violent criminals), as in current-day Mexico. But gun-banners don’t seem to be able to draw the connection between Mexico’s tight gun control and rampant police corruption and police killings of innocents. Since this shooter appears to be an IRA nostalgiast, he would have been deemed legal under Obama and supplied by Putin in Obama’s unicorn leftoid world. And some senators or others anti-gun lobbyists, like senator Leland Yee, benifit of the illegal gun sales in the black market. Looks like the anime Gunsmith Cats predicted this https://youtu.be/TO_JrkEOQ5E?t=1h20m58s (check before Youtube remove it). Jimmy Carter has to be the happiest man in the USA. He will be able to die knowing he is no longer considered the worst president in our history. But surely we have the DUMBEST president in our history in the White House currently. It’s no surprise he refuses to show us his grades while he attend university. IT’S ALL OVER FOLKS! And the socialists have won. I don’t think the grades would be the issue, but the course titles. Actually I think it is the student status that is the problem. If you had the opportunity to attend Harvard but you knew that minority status may not be enough to get you in, perhaps you fudged the the application and claimed foriegn citizenship and your fathers legacy status. No I am not saying he is not a US citizen but if he commited fraud to attain a degree and receive grants then he does not have a degree and I am pretty sure this would also affect the Bar as well as any legal issues his hands were on. If he used minority status to avoid academic probation as well because of poor grades well I am sure you can see how this would create problems. It would be interesting if his grades made GW look like a MENSA candidate. I do find it odd that a constitutional professor was able to pretzel the constitution to the point that it was ok to execute a US citizen who had never taken up arms against the US Government and had only spoken words against the US Government if that is the standard than any American with an IQ over 100 has commited the exact same offense the fact that he executed his child for the crimes his father commited is even more troubling. They had won but let’s give them a taste of phyrric victory as well. Of all of the “politicians are awful” moments in that speech, the worst had to be when he called out other politicians for using the incident to advocate for gun rights – prospectively. He said words to the effect of: “I can just see them writing their press releases now…. how more guns would have helped…” The naked cynicism and just raw ballsiness of using a the tragic deaths of innocent victims as a prop for you pet cause before you have any information about the incident is impressive. But using the same opportunity to call out your opposition who haven’t yet spoken on the incident for having press releases ready to go advocating for their pet cause without having the facts while you are doing much worse is really high-end political work. Very few have the cajones to pull that off. That is Clinton territory right there. Innocent victims don’t die tragically. ?Que? How else could they die? Senselessly? Ironically? Most people don’t understand the meaning of tragic. When people misuse this word it irks me too. A tragedy is self-inflicted. When some one dies tragically it is because of some character defect or error of their own making. The people killed in Oregon where innocent victims, no other clarification needed. Meh, I’m a pretty harsh word Nazi but I’ve come to accept that when people use the word “tragic” or “tragedy” they’re not thinking of Aristotle’s Poetics but instead use it to mean “really bad,” or “heartbreaking.” Oh, I understand the ignorance of people well, but will correct it when I have an opportunity. Remember, Popular Usage is why knuckle dragging progressives believe, for instance, that where the 2nd amendment says “…,shall not be infringed.”, means only the Top Men should decide who has guns. Fuck that. So then only Mercer died tragically. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle. G.I JOOOOOOOO!!!! Oxford English Dictionary- Tragedy-An event causing great suffering, destruction, and distress, such as a serious accident, crime, or natural catastrophe Truthishly, who cares? Not in the dictionaries I happen to own. That is one of its meanings, especially when applied to drama. But, not its only one. Kamerad Matt on The Today Show was already grilling the Sheriff about his 2A stance. A letter from the Sheriff to Biden made it to the news overnight, somehow. Also on the Today show: Chuck Todd talking about the politics of Washington. He chided the Republicans for being afraid to face the politics of gun control. He said many politicians are afraid of the NRA and chided the President for having been afraid of the NRA before Sandy Hook. He had the base assumption that more gun control is what is right and good and just. More gun control is a moral requirement. Any politician who doesn’t march lockstep for more gun control is afraid of the NRA and afraid to courageously face up to the politics of the issue. There was no room for the possibility of a real argument in favor of the second amendment. This is the new talking point. You could see it in the President’s speech – only calls for more gun control can possibly be honest. Only the position that there are more and more school shootings and we are all in danger can possibly be “reality based”. Chuck Todd and host Matt Lauer were definitely on board with the new strategy. There was no discussion of what happened or why or if any particular gun control measure was on the table or if it had any bearing on the current situation. The only legitimate topic of discussion is “why are politicians afraid of the NRA?” Also in the Chuck Todd segment: the proactive dismissal of counter arguments. “Republicans will come out and say it is not a gun issue, it is a mental health issue. In fact, we’ve already heard from Ted Cruz….” I don’t think we’ll hear Chuck Todd say that the Republicans are right about this one. Our elected officials are SUPPOSED to represent us, so if the majority of the voters in these Republican’s districts say they want less gun control, it would be absolutely wrong for those Republicans to go against the wishes of their constituents and push gun control. Chuck Todd doesn’t seem to get this, and thus he considers himself part of the ruling class, better than the little people. He fancies himself a little enlightened despot and wonders why Congress isn’t filled with other enlightened despots. Chuck Todd doesn’t seem to get this, Oh, he gets it. He just thinks Republican voters and voters who disagree with him have been brainwashed, or are simply evil, and hence don’t count. Cyto — It doesn’t take “cojones” to do what Obama has done. It takes an evil desire to want to control the world. It is truly amazing no one has done him in yet. Surely Putin has considered it. I worry about this happening constantly. Why would Putin want to? Obama’s the best thing for Russia. Putin only has to sit back as Obama weakens and destroys the USA from within, leaving a power vacuum out in the world that Putin is all too glad to fill… (This does not mean I advocate interventionist policy, just pointing out that Putin sees Obama’s weakness as a plus.) As do many. Instead of trying to be a problem-solver who worked with qualified individuals to get the economy really chugging along in the right direction, Obama is more worried about climate change and mending fences with people that are going to hate him (and us) regardless. Putin’s licking his chops. The real problem is the number of citizens who don’t turn their guns in and be subject to all sorts of capricious law ‘enforcement’. How does a committed Progressive disarm a nation without that happening? Answer: committed Progressive could give a flying fuck. No, the real problem already exists. They can declare anyone a criminal and take away his gun rights. This effectively nullifies the 2nd amendment on a case by case basis. We know exactly how progressives treat people once they are disarmed. What follows is a typical page from a first-hand account of the Soviet revolution. Here is how you mold a worker’s paradise: “For example, in a metal factory some Red Guards bound the arms and legs of a batch of fifty cadets so as to bend the victims’ bodies double, and threw them, bound, into the flames of the blast furnaces. And later the victims’ remains were found on the refuse heaps outside?fused with the slag. In addition, mass shootings and executions by other means took place in the factory compounds.On some of the corpses were not only wounds of the kind which rifle fire ordinarily causes, but also wholesale cuts and stab wounds, obviously inflicted before death. And sometimes the number of such wounds was so large as to show that the victim had literally been hacked to death, whilst in other cases the head lay shattered, and in others the head had been transformed into an almost shapeless mass in which the last trace of the facial contours lay lost. Lastly, there were corpses whence the limbs and ears had been cut off, and yet others which still had surgical dressings upon them?clear proof that it was from hospitals and infirmaries that the victims had been dragged to their deaths.” We know exactly how progressives treat people once they are disarmed. What follows is a typical page from a first-hand account of the Soviet revolution. The Soviet revolution was a communist revolution. Progressivism is a precursor of fascism, not of communism. Although they are both equally deadly in the end, the causes, mechanisms, and target groups of the two ideologies differ. The answer is always.. More laws.. The hang up on method over motive astounds me. The gun is an inanimate object that delivered the message from a determined messenger. Never mind the fact that murder, being one of humanity’s oldest crimes, is illegal. Never mind the fact that punishments as a deterrent, were often quite severe, and ruthless enough to make modern capital punishment advocates a bit squeamish. Never mind the fact that murderers through out history tended to use whatever technology was available, from a rock, all the way up to the firearm, effectively. None of these things ever deterred a determined murderer, and more bluster from the windbag in chief probably won’t tip the scales in favor of deterrence , any more than sensationalizing it will make it less attractive for those looking for inspiration from it. Shut up, and quietly ride out your term in office.. The world will be a better place for it. I think fairly that everyone that disdains gun ownership in the USA compares gun-related violence in the USA with other developed countries and the USA is ahead for the obvious reason that there are more guns per capita. I explain things to my worried friends in Europe and elsewhere that we need guns in the USA to protect ourselves from our police. I think fairly that everyone that disdains gun ownership in the USA compares gun-related violence in the USA with other developed countries and the USA is ahead for the obvious reason that there are more guns per capita. And suicides, police shootings, and accidents all seem to find their way into those statistics as well. I explain things to my worried friends in Europe and elsewhere that we need guns in the USA to protect ourselves from our police. Explain those Europeans that they’ll probably wish they had them, sometime around their next state sponsored genocide, which seems to plague them every ~20-30 years.. I think fairly that everyone that disdains gun ownership in the USA compares gun-related violence in the USA with other developed countries and the USA is ahead for the obvious reason that there are more guns per capita. Correlation is not causation. Demographics have more to do with it than anything else; the bulk of the gun violence is committed by poor inner-city minorities. The gun violence rate among middle class people is comparable to most European countries. Thats a fact that would make any true Progressive squeamish. They love minorities (Even though they seem to go out of their way to make sure they don’t live anywhere near them). The real question is why is there so much violence in our inner-cities? I imagine that drug prohibition is a contributing factor, it has put a lot of poor black men behind bars which then makes difficult for them to ever get a job again once they get out. It also results in a lot of young black kids being raised in single-parent households. We could end a lot of innercity violence if we just stopped the goddamned drug war. We could end a lot of innercity violence if we just stopped the goddamned drug war. Too much money and government power at stake for that to happen. Yup. And special interest groups. DEA/ATF agents, police, prisons, the courts, lawyers… They’ll fight to keep it. And don’t forget about scared suburban moms. They are a lynchpin in many of these fights. Nobody wants their kid addicted to drugs – particularly not waspy suburbanites. And old people, afraid of junkies breaking in to their homes to supply their drug habits. There are many more constituencies for the drug war than there are against it. Heck, it took 30+ years for the civil rights groups to begin to recant their position that not doing enough on the war on drugs was racist. Actually, I’m not sure that most of them have recanted their position on the war on drugs… just that they’ve added the position that it has been used by racists to attack black people. Kind of a cake and eat it too proposition. Explain, then why drug prohibition hasn’ t put a proportionate number of poor white men behind bars and spurred a proportionate amount of white gun violence. Because a “proportionate number” of white men don’t live in the cities. Whatever other factors are at play, urban crime rates have always been higher than rural ones. Furthermore, when alcohol prohibition was in effect, crime rates were elevated, especially in urban areas. Why would anyone expect drug prohibition to be different? The question of demographic shift between the 1950s and today is perhaps a worthwhile topic of investigation, but is orthogonal to the question of drug prohibition. Why is it that the repeal of alcohol prohibition is widely accepted as having been the proper course of action, but the repeal of drug prohibition is highly controversial? That is a good question. I think at the base of it, the average person understands that getting addicted to alcohol is somewhat more difficult (but not impossible) than getting addicted to CERTAIN kinds of drugs. The people do seem to be perfectly fine decriminalizing marijuana in no small part due to the perception that it is non-addictive and non-harmful. But present something like meth or heroine, and the average person suddenly gets all prohibitionist. Yeah during college I smoked weed all the time. After that, I got married and started working full-time so I decided to stop. There were no physical withdrawal symptoms for me personally. Smoking, on the other hand, has been really difficult for me to quit. But ending this idiotic prohibition and war on drugs not only would save truckloads of money, but it would lessen police violence against citizens. It’s no different than alcohol abuse. If you allow yourself to get addicted to things, then there will be consequences, but (more importantly) it should be an individual decision. I think fairly that everyone that disdains gun ownership in the USA compares gun-related violence in the USA with other developed countries and the USA is ahead for the obvious reason that there are more guns per capita. Except that there really is no consistent relationship between gun ownership, gun control, and homicides. In fact, even in the US, the groups with the highest legal gun ownership rates are not the groups committing homicides. The only consistent relationship that there is is that if guns are easy to get, people tend to use them more for suicides. Given that they are effective for that purpose, I don’t see that as a problem. Obama has pointed to Australia’s gun laws. And of course no bad guy ever has access to guns here: Shooting outside police headquarters in Parramatta Oh. Never mind. Obviously a boomerang effect from the USA’s gun violence. Nice. Oooh – good one! *applauds* Yeah, and then there was this asshole… And then there was this asshole… They clearly got their guns from gun stores in the USA where there are no gun laws!!! Sorry, WTF, but you clearly didn’t click on the link. Disgusting, but not for the reason you may think. I did. It was engrossing Well, I just did, and What. The. Hell. I had one crawl up my leg while eating lunch at the park. Did a youtube search and this came up. Whoa–is that the IRS crawling out of its anus? Why yes, yes it is! Obama has pointed to Australia’s gun laws. Every time someone brings up the Aussie stats, ask, “So how do you explain a similar drop in homicides in the US?” Mass shootings still happen in Australia but they are far less frequent than they used to be; and the stats prove it. In contrast, if you define a mass shooting as a single incident with 4 firearms deaths or woundings than the United States has a mass shooting AT LEAST once a week. In this year alone there have been close to 300 as I type this. http://shootingtracker.com/wik…..gs_in_2015 No other country in the civilised world has that many. If these were terrorists killing Americans with IEDs there would be outrage from all sides of the political spectrum and Congress and US state legislatures would have a zillion laws on the statute books to deal with the plague, including ones to stop the terrorists owning the materials to blow up people. But guns, it seems, are different. So instead for the most part nothing is done; and the deaths have now become so common that most go unreported in the media. …and the deaths have now become so common… …that the rate of their occurrence, along with rates of overall violent crime in general, is only about *half* of what they were just a couple of decades ago….even as restrictions on the ownership and carrying of firearms have significantly loosened across most of the U.S. Sorry, but the “gun violence epidemic” talking point is bullshit. the “gun violence epidemic” talking point is bullshit.” from Wikipedia’s article on Gun Violence in the United States: “There were 19,392 firearm-related suicides in the U.S. in 2010. The U.S. Department of Justice reports that approximately 60% of all adult firearm deaths are by suicide, 61% more than deaths by homicide…. According to the FBI, in 2012, there were 8,855 total firearm-related homicides in the US, with 6,371 of those attributed to handguns.” If you check out the graph that article shows then, yeah, there was a spike in gun deaths “just a couple of decades ago” and the numbers have dropped since. But if you think more than 25,000 deaths per year is NOT an epidemic then you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about. If 25,000 US citizens died through bombings do you think people like you wouldn’t be talking about an “epidemic of terrorism”? What other country in the world not going through a war on their own soil has that many gun-related deaths per year every year? Barry, by his own admission, puffed the reefer in his youth when there was law in place that said you should not. So how does he expect other people to follow his gun control law when he didn’t follow the reefer control law? Laws are magic, okay? For other people, anyway. Like the law that says you cannot bring guns anywhere near a school… Obviously the gun-free school zone sign was defective. “If you won’t respond to a senseless act of violence against innocent people with an act of state-sponsored violence against innocent people, then you’re a heartless child-hater.” /Obama “This is something we should politicize,” That’s your money quote right there. In the context of the country, how are gun laws in Oregon? Strict, not strict, just right? In the context of the plain meaning of the 2A, no state has it just right. A couple come close. Vermont, for example. Oregon has common sense gun laws already. Apparently the Constitutional scholar in Chief isn’t aware of that. What we really need in this country is nonsensical laws based on national pants-shitting. Obama: “I’m not sure exactly what happened, but I think it’s obvious I’m going to appeal to emotion”. Hey, if Obama can’t use their deaths to promote his political agenda, then those people have died in vain. I will steal that line. The right of individuals to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment. It has been upheld by the SCOTUS. If there really is a groundswell of support for gun control, then the logical path would be to repeal or significantly alter the Second Amendment. This is not an easy process, but if the gun control lobby honestly thinks that their position is in the best interest of the country, then they should begin a drive toward such legislation. In my 60+ years, I don’t ever remember seeing any significant attempts. I have never seen a petition. If it’s that important, why not? Perhaps the form of political discourse outweighs the substance of a change in the law. The right of individuals to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment. Guaranteed =/= established. The second amendment didn’t establish our right to keep and bear arms, and cannot be “repealed”.. only ignored/disrespected. Because they have learned that you don’t need to bother amending the constitution when you can just keep ‘interpreting’ it in the desired direction. For example “shall not be infringed” now means “reasonable” restrictions are allowed. Much easier than amendments. This argument is so difficult for most everyone to grasp. Even experienced right-wing attorneys have a hard time with the literal reading of the text. I’ve had discussions about the “obscenity” exception with hard-core free speech types who could not grasp the simple language of “shall make no law”. The argument that there is no line for “unless it is really important” doesn’t reach them at all. They strangely become pragmatic when confronted with the reality of the law. The second amendment makes it perfectly clear that the actual letter of the law would be unacceptable to almost everyone in the US (except nutters on libertarian and anarchist websites). The unambiguous letter of the law is that the Federal government can issue no restrictions whatsoever on weapons possession, manufacture or transfer. That includes all weapons. Even nuclear weapons. The language is very plain and easy to read. “Shall not be infringed” is in no way ambiguous. The entire constitution is unworkable in our current society without a myriad of amendments. So we just ignore it and let the Supreme Court make it up as it goes along. This despite the fact that avoiding “rule of man” was one of the specific reasons for writing and ratifying the constitution in the first place. You’re definitely right. The single biggest obstacle in discussing politics with the people I speak to in person (co-workers, friends, acquaintances) is that all of them, without exception, feel that there should be exceptions to the Bill of Rights. Freedom of speech? Oh, but you shouldn’t be able to say this, or that, or that… Freedom of religion? Oh, but not in this case and that case and that case… It basically means that nearly all people are utter hypocrites who would carve out exceptions for themselves and people like them while using the law to batter and harm those not like them. Simple tribalism. So those people you speak to in person are demonrats, right? Must republicans ignore the plain meaning of words as well. It’s a pretty universal problem. Even experienced right-wing attorneys have a hard time with the literal reading of the text. You apparently also have problems with the literal meaning of the text. “Congress shall make no law” explicitly refers to Congress. The 10th Amendment makes this even clearer: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. So, states ought to have wide latitude in terms of regulating speech, guns, and other things. However, gradually, constitutional limits on the power of the federal government got extended to all levels of government. In some areas, that was a good idea, in other areas, it leads to contradictions. But those contradictions are not a problem with the original Constitution. Last I knew, “government” had a much more impressive body count total for mass murder than all the rest…combined. History suggests that we should be much more fearful of government than the occasional whacko. This is completely incontrovertible. Thus it is rarely mentioned by our political class. I think it is pretty clear that the progressive machine had this one locked and loaded, ready to go. In less than 5 hours they had the top politicians and the main voices of the news media all singing from the same song book, calling for more gun control and preemptively dismissing all other narratives. All of them taking the lead from the President in saying that politicising this issue is perfectly fine (if you happen to agree with them). In this case the glaring central narrative is the targeting of christians for death. There really is no room for another narrative when something that shocking happens. Imagine this same incident, only with the group changed. You don’t even have to hit the main tropes. Imagine a shooter on campus targeting asian women. What would the discussion be about? How about some guy walking around asking if people are Muslim and shooting them? Would that be the main topic 18 hours? How frustrated were they when they heard that the targeted group didn’t fit neatly into a ready-made “racism” narrative. And the anti-Christian angle kinda kills off their “right-wing nutcase” canned argument too, but if history is any guide, they’ll figure out a way. As a younger man I really would never have believed that reporters would ignore something as glaring as killing people for their religion in order to score political points. Yet here we are in an era where it isn’t even surprising. More that it is expected. How sad. and if anyone asks why no one is talking about the shooters targeting of Christians, they’d be labeled ‘whiners’. I don’t get it. Couldn’t they find a picture of this guy wearing a graduation gown and cap, or at least one where he’s 6 years younger? Isn’t that the new standard? Obama doesn’t care about the victims and their families as much as he pretends. If he did, he would not bring this up so soon. Instead, he is signaling his base to encourage them to get out the vote for Democrats this coming election season. He’s also using this tragedy This is shrewd, unapologetic politics, pure and simple. In fairness to the President, he pretty much said as much in his speech. He was not only unapologetic, he bragged that politicizing the issue was perfectly fine. It is hard to imagine a world where making a stump speech on an issue like this before the families have even been able to identify the bodies would be OK. But it looks like that’s where we are with the modern news cycle. Gotta control the narrative…. That was my thought when I heard him making his statement yesterday. The bodies are barely even cold, families haven’t even identified the bodies, and this scumbag is already trying to make political advantage from it. Disgusting. Compare the anti-gunners’ reactions to that of the NRA, who waited a week before making any statements after Sandy Hook, and it becomes pretty clear which side sees these events as political godsends to power their agenda. He pretends? Wow, he’s really bad at pretending. “The president insisted that “modest regulation,” consistent with the Second Amendment rights of “law-abiding gun owners,” Please explain how “modest regulation” can be consistent with “shall not be infringed”. Or this: Fuck you, NO. You can’t have my guns. If you try to take them I WILL shoot you. Can I use that? My standard response is Because FUCK YOU! MURICA! I’m not mocking you, I don’t think there should be any restrictions on firearm ownership or carry anywhere, and convicted felons and those adjudicated mentally defective should have their cases examined individually before their rights are taken from them. Not every crazy person is dangerous, and neither is every felon. People kill people with guns in this country because they can. Please give me your address. You can’t really argue with the logic. It is a tautology after all. People kill people with guns in this country because they can. By that logic, we’d have 300 million shootings occurring daily. Well, one day. And people kill people with machetes in this country, and around the world, because it is a side effect from lobbing the heads off of said people; because they can, too. Obama is a perfect illustration of the need for common sense woodchipper legislation. “It’s fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds,” Obama said, “regardless of what they think their motivations may be.” Is he unaware many people feel this way about anyone who wants to be president? No. Kidding. Whenever I hear someone saying he or she wants to be president, all I can think is “you want to tell others what to do. Fuck off!” Is he unaware many people feel this way about anyone who wants to be president? Willfully unaware, as are all seekers of power over others. I am appalled by the contortions some people I have encountered go through to stamp out any self awareness, simply so they can mentally justify abusing those around them. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction Contemptible argument… Are we responsible for deaths in the Middle East because of our collective inaction against ISIL? People dying in Africa of AIDS because we haven’t airdropped billions of condoms? Fuck that noise He wants to shame people for having the audacity to effectively defend themselves. He’s lower than a urine-soaked paper towel. When he says we he really means you. Or more specifically, the congressional rethuglicans and their supporters who refuse to give him the unconstitutional gun control legislation that he covets. -because of our inaction It seems appropriate that he, and those who support him, should then be collectively answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our actions as well. Well sir? Have you met with the family members of each and every person you’ve had killed globally? How about at least in this country, say maybe those killed due to police malfeasance in support of your policy? No? If you don’t think we are already being infringed on, just TRY and buy 22lr’s! If you can even find them anywhere, the price has skyrocketed. 38 and 380 shells you can find but not afford. What worries me is that no one can afford to practice much due to the cost. By the way, guns don’t kill people, bullets DO. (Mine only kill pop cans and paper targets.) Thank you, Liberals, for saving pop cans and paper targets. here is the only law they could pass, that could actually cut down on these events” no place can be deemed as a “gun free zone” unless there is screening and enforcement. i.e. if you don’t have metal detectors, then you can’t tell people they can’t have guns. almost all of these things happen in gun free zones. gunmen seek a defenseless crowd when they want to do some mass killing. if there is a place where you think it is important enough to have no guns, it should be important enough to make sure. That just moves the attack to the security line. Though having armed security near the line might have some deterrent effect, or it will make the armed security the first ones to be shot. possibly, but it does not seem to be a problem at the places that currently use metal detectors. they only seek places where they know everyone is unarmed, and they won’t be checked. See my response to you in the other thread. Put simply, what you are proposing is just expensive whack-a-mole. ditto. put simply, I’m suggesting that only places that warrant the cost of a metal detector should be gun free, not that we magically have metal detectors everywhere. It’s not just about the cost; there’s a reason I said “whack-a-mole”. Metal detector with an unarmed guard? Just shoot him. Arm the guard? Shoot him from a distance. Concrete or bulletproof glass? Ram it and/or blow it up. Barricades? Launch the bomb over the barricades, or just walk up to the checkpoint and plant it on a timer. Better yet, just sneak the guns in the back, or get someone to do it for you. Then after you turn every school into Fort Knox, people will just attack parks, malls, public transit stations, sidewalk cafes, whatever. Not banning guns on the other hand is free. while i agree, in principle, that there should be no banning of guns, such an absolutist approach will never gain popular support…. imagine people able to carry loaded guns on an airplane, and people will start to call you a nutter…. ignoring any other point you make. even if you did get that through on the federal level, there will always be more local governments clinging to the falsehood that a sign will stop bad guys from carrying a weapon. like it or not, “gun free” zones will always exist. (and, they are really not new. the “wild west” had some of the biggest gun restrictions in certain towns.) i simply think it is better to enforce some standard enforcement requirement before calling a place “gun free”. that is the problem we have now… it takes no effort at all to hit these “soft” targets. of course no security system is perfect, but what we require now is nothing but a sign. by making the requirement more substantive (and making the local government pay for it), the “gun free” craze would be limited to those areas people really see as important. even if they are wrong, they will do it on a case by case basis, instead of broad declarations. We’re all “collectively responsible” for their deaths? Silly me. When I point to laws I don’t like, statists tells me that I can love it or leave it. As if I’m granted some freedom to choose. The next minute, they’re telling me we’re all collectively responsible. Well, if they don’t like it, why aren’t they leaving? Does this imply that thy secretly love living in a country with a Second Amendment, but just have to be immature whiners and discontents about it? And then they say they want to empty the prisons. So, exactly how do you collect taxes after you simply abolish violent legal punishments? Whatevs. It’s feelstown. Perspective is all I ask http://www.davidcolarusso.com/deaths/#.Vg6cw_lVhBd These mass shootings always happen in gun free zones. The war on guns will never be won, the same as the war on drugs, or the war on terrorism. The wars are just excuses to give the enforcers, and lawyers, more funding for their careers and promotions. Who will protect us from our protectors? “These mass shootings always happen in gun free zones.” Maybe they need bigger signs! When I point to laws I don’t like, statists tells me that I can love it or leave it Or they tell you “It’s the Law of the Land!” over and over and over because it is a law they like. ‘Law of the Land’ never seems to be a valid argument with laws leftists/statists don’t like. Strange, that. It’s the same thing with the Constitution. When it happens to be in line with what they want, they’ll shout that the Constitution is set in stone and that no politician has the right to disobey it. But when it’s something they don’t like, suddenly it’s a “super old piece of paper that was written by white slave owners, like, 100 years ago or something”. Ironically, we just passed a new law in Oregon increasing restrictions on gun ownership. It was supposed to solve problems like this. and of course we have the Gun Control Law of 1968. Don’t forget the National Firearms Act of 1934. And the Brady Bill of 1993. “It was supposed to solve problems like this.” No it wasn’t. But but but, we banned firearms on campus in 2013! How did this happen? We had a sign and everything! And one unarmed security guard! If background checks are racist, why would we put more of them in effect for people – possibly minorities who live in inner city war zones – who just want to protect themselves with a legally owned firearm? I thought the Democrats were the anti-racist party. Why would they do such a racist thing to minorities? So what IS your proposal/policy/prescription for dealing with this rather tiresome situation, Sullum? Something has to be done. I don’t know what it is. I like to hunt and shoot, I own guns. And every time this happens I feel like throwing the damn things out. I feel like puking all over this sick society we live in. This column is so empty and contentless it makes me feel like giving up on Reason and libertarians altogether. Something has to be done. Where do you live? I can bring my truck… Here’s “something”s that might work and should be tried somewhere. 1. Abolish gun-free zones, which tempt shooters. 2. Hire armed school guards. (That was the NRA’s suggestion.) 3. Encourage teachers to carry. 4. Encourage the most responsible 25% of students (as rated by their teachers) to carry. 5. Maybe install metal detectors, provided they also can detect an over-riding RFID carried by carry-registered students and teachers. 6. Encourage theater owners, etc. to carry, too. Something has to be done. Why? Mass shootings in the US are no more common than elsewhere (relative to population size), and they are a negligible cause of death. Why do you obsess about this particular cause of death? And if this really is your primary concern (really phobia), why don’t you make your own choices accordingly? Attend a college with open carry or a gun-free college according to your own preferences. And every time this happens I feel like throwing the damn things out. I feel like puking all over this sick society we live in. Maybe the problem isn’t the fucking guns–maybe the problem is society. Maybe the problem is our increasingly complex, increasingly atomized culture that glorifies narcissism and denigrates community and face-to-face human relations. And all that aside the rate of violent crime is FAR lower today than it was 20 years ago. That’s not hyperbole, it’s an empirical fact. You’re just as, if not more likely to be killed by a drunk driver than to be murdered by someone with a firearm, but I don’t see you “puking your guts out” over the poor 6-year-old who got her life taken from her *in her friend’s own driveway* by a drunken idiot that should never have gotten behind the wheel. “Something has to be done,” right? You ready to have the state crawl up your ass every time you buy a tall boy or a glass of wine? You willing to risk, say, 10 years in prison for a first-time DUI offense “if it saves just one life”? Or do the people who are killed by drunk drivers (and excessive alcohol abuse in general, which kills more people than firearms by a 2.75-1 margin every year) not mean as much to you as those killed by guns because the fucking media’s tugging at your heartstrings? What great fucking ideas do YOU have, chump? Because I’m not seeing much from you other than typical shitlib whining. because he thinks it has such a simple answer, if only we’d pass a law getting rid of guns then there’d be no more murder, but it’s those stupid politicians beholden to the NRA that keep it from happening An empty promise from a empty head ” If only we had done something, in other words, those people in Oregon would still be alive.” Like, I dunno, forbidding schools to ban guns on campus? If Chris Mintz had had a gun, he’d be walking right now. He should sue the hell out of the school for not keeping him safe. This is minor heresy because I’m a Marine, but I believe if that “good guy with a gun” had been an Army Veteran, he could have made a difference. If I’m there, it is no longer “gun free”. Unless I see a metal detector, I’m carrying. Fuck the stupid signs. How about the fact that it most likely would not achieve it’s advertised goals, aside from becoming a bureaucratic boondoggle, to end bureaucratic boondoggles.. Google pay 97$ per hour my last pay check was $8500 working 1o hours a week online. My younger brother friend has been averaging 12k for months now and he works about 22 hours a week. I cant believe how easy it was once I tried it out. This is wha- I do…… http://www.buzznews99.com Guessing 15 years and the 2nd amendment is toast. The public schools are doing a bang up job imprinting in impressionable young minds that guns are bad, from pop tarts to this… http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_new…..d-him?lite When an opponent declares, “I will not come over to your side,” I calmly say, “Your child belongs to us already… What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time they will know nothing else but this new community.” – A. Hitler Re Obama’s “empty gun control promise”, “empty” isn’t quite correct as a description of/for his rhetoric. Actually, his anti gun, anti gun rights routines are full, as in “full of s**t”.

10.1.2015 2:42 PM There is very little being reported right now and we'll avoid speculation. Police have responded to mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg Oregon. We have seen reports that between 7 and 15 people have been killed. KATU in Oregon is reporting the situation live here. Their Twitter account is here.  They are reporting that the shooter is ""down."" Updated (4:45 p.m. eastern): At a press conference, the Douglass County sheriff would not provide casualty numbers but said there was a single shooter, the shooter and deputies ""exchanged gunfire,"" and the shooter is now dead. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has described him as a 20-year-old male. Updated (6:40 p.m. eastern): President Barack Obama spoke on the shootings, calling, as he does in these situations, for more gun laws.

See what happens when you let in a bunch of military-age Syrians? SEE? Good one! I’d like to check out his medicine cabinet. IT’S A MUZZIE/TEABAGGER! Got all the premature conclusions covered. And you are just praying to Cthulhu its a PEANUTGOLDBUGTEAHADIST. Just somebody who voted for BOOOOOSSH Either that or it was the gun’s fault. Has anyone heard from Tony today ? Just wondering. Maybe it was Wilbur Whately. He didn’t bring the Necronomicon back on time, and they took away his library card. So he flipped out. I’ll take “this confirms (insert bonehead theory here) that I’ve been saying all along. Congress must act now!!!” for $1000 please, Alex. Oh, and Turd Ferguson. MOAR WHITE ON BLACK HATE CRIME!!!!! #blackOregoncommunitycollegestudentslivesmatter Ban guns. And what’s that old story about repeating actions over and over and not getting any results? Maybe someone should ask BO why he’s been speechifying the same drivel so many times with No Measurable Positive Effect..? Such a Motivator For Change! Not. There’s only one way to stop this madness. Prosecute the family members of these wack-jobs for not reporting these sickos to the proper authorities. The vast majority of these family members know their offspring and relatives are dangerous nut-jobs, yet nothing can be done until the sickies do their damage. In the 40s, 50s and 60s we used to institutionalize the mentally ill but then the Liberals said “You can’t lock these people up, they didn’t do anything.” So we let the whack-jobs out to roam the streets and live under our bridges and get a hold of guns and kill us. Sounds like another socialist plot to me. This is insane. We deserve the fucked-up society we have. Great, now we get to hear journalists asking every candidate about this for the next couple weeks. Sorry if I’m sounding callous. It’s a bit like if a large demographic want to ban private cars, so every single six pile car up in the nation got reported on the national news. Bad shit happens to innocent people, but I’m more likely to slip and break something in the bathroom or kitchen than be on either side of a violent encounter with a gun. +1 No one need more than 4 cylinders. Only professionals should be allowed to handle one ton death machines. What if someone slams on the breaks in front of you? You might panic and swerve into an innocent bystander on the sidewalk. Professionals unlike your average person are trained how to handle these stressful situations. I’m not sure you can buy a car as light as one ton anymore… More reason to ban modern cars. When cars were first allowed to drive freely on our roads they were mere lightweight slow model-T’s. The current death machines couldn’t have been anticipated by the legislatures of the time. We can not hold our citizen’s safety hostage to an anachronism of history. Nicely done, IIIocust. 2016 Mazda Miata is about 2300 lbs. I’m not sure about the Smart Fourtwo, but that barely qualifies as a car. You can but they come with pedals to crank instead of an engine. I like my 8 cylinder SS Monte Carlo! It is a gas! It is a little difficult, driving it. It wants to spin the tires, too easily, especially when it is wet! And, it shuts down 4 cylinders, at speed, to get 28 miles/gallon, estimated. Can’t wait to get my 4 cylinder turbocharged car to replace it, in the future! You’re even less likely if you avoid ‘gun free zones’. The irony of that fact, well, it’s palpable. I see your point, but the analogy isn’t apt. If there was a driver who drove through a crowd of people and killed many of them, and this happened over and over, then the analogy is apt. Shooting is an intentional act to kill. What you’re describing is an accident. yes all analogies must use criteria that are identical in all ways. context is irrelevant to analogies. and dont even get me started about similes! (six pile car up) < six car pile up Brace yourselves. Gun grabbers are coming. We’ve been surrounded by them for years. They always do. I’m avoiding Derpbook, Twitter, and… well, everywhere except here for the next several days. That is probably wise of you. I avoid those pretty much every day. Racist !!!!1! It wasn’t a gunfree zone already? Sort of. Colleges in Oregon can’t prohibit licensed concealed carry, but can (and usually do, IIRC) ban unlicensed mere possession or open carry. Of course, I’d bet a dollar that the shooter was not a permit-holder… The lone security guard was unarmed. OR SO I’VE BEEN TOLD. They are at all the community colleges around here. It makes no sense. And by “coming,” of course you mean ejaculating all over their televisions at the thought of climbing on top of a pile of dead bodies and grieving family members to call out their moral inferiors. Brace ourselves for what? Somehow, the NRA has managed to equate guns with apple pie, Jesus Christ, and the Statue of Liberty’s glorious bunghole. No one is grabbing shit. and I think that most Americans have conceded the fight. The anti-2nd Amendment crowd is a lot like the anti-abortion crowd. Neither issue will move the way the respective sides want them to move in America, but they just can’t shut the fuck up about them. To their detriment. Brace ourselves for another endless round of near hysterical bleating about “common sense” gun regulations that wouldn’t have done a damn thing to prevent the tragedy that’s being exploited and thinly veiled insinuations that by opposing them we approve of and endorse mass murder. Look, it’s ok to believe that if we just had more laws violence like this would be prevented. I can understand that belief, even if I think it’s completely wrong. One can utterly disagree with someone and still respect the person. It’s the self-righteous smugness it takes to stand on the graves of the innocent dead and the blatant appeals to emotionalism I can’t stand. And yes, the same applies to the NRA people who laughably insist their rifle is protecting them from radical Islamists. The odds that any of them will ever see a terrorist other than the likes of Salim Abu Aziz are worse than the lottery, lightning, and Tony voting Republican. Awful to hear. Heartfelt prayers and condolences to the families of the victims and of the shooter, all of whom have a difficult time ahead of them. …. Can we politicize this now? Too late. The other side already has. Read down before you climb off your high horse Nikki. But but but mommy they do it too! How many more times does this have to happen before we finally get serious and do something? Given the number of times this has happened, and nothing has been done, never. Repeal Dodd-Frank? That’s something. “” do something”” THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE BEST PLAN YET Finally my dream of online only college will be realized! Do something… Like what? “Something” is not a policy or even a serious suggestion. (“Something must be done. This is something. Thus this must be done.” is the worst form of that. But “do something!!!!” is not serious either.) Your sarcasm detector is broken. I just did something. I took a sip of my iced coffee. I feel better already. And yes, I’m serious. Finally. I blame the feminization and slutification of society. Our society needs to embrace positive masculine role models to prevent these tragedies. Therefore, effective immediately, GI Joe and He-man will be put on every major network for 90 minutes a day. Of course, waffles, we must have reasonable fun laws, such as the ones recently passed in Springfield. He-Man should wear a shirt, obviously, and the GI Joe characters should fight crime/enemies using the types of firearms available in the founders’ times when they use guns at all. Perhaps Skeletor could be re-envisioned to address bulimia and/or anorexia…. GI Joe should have A-Team type assault weapons. Full-auto, never need reloading, and never actually hit anyone. What would you have us do ? I agree, we should do something about this. We should stop restricting firearm rights and allow people the right to protect themselves no matter where they are on America’s soil. The supervisor on the radio feed that Warty posted is a fucking idiot. The worst I’ve ever heard. Ever. The reporter I was just listening to thinks rounds= magazines. Mentioning “clips” will probably really confuse the hell out of them. No one needs a clip that holds more than seven magazines. Seven magazines, or ten Readers’ Digests. Bartender, I’d like to get the next round! *** reconsiders *** Never mind. Wouldn’t that be four Readers’ Digests, because they’re condensed? No sensible subscription needs to have 12 magazines for home reading. Practically no mass shootings are committed with double-barreled shotguns. I propose a two-barrel minimum gun law. For the children. I propose a two-barrel minimum gun law. Excellent! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDCCTCYTNI On a related note, I just extended my subscription to Car & Driver magazine for only $4 per year for three years! The other people seem calm and capable though, Playa. Oh – thanks Warty. Yes, it’s almost like watching The Office. Everyone is doing a great job in spite of the buffoon in charge. He just asked for a body count from the hospital over the air. That’s a big no-no. The fire department pays for his fancy cell phone for a reason. As firearms are banned on its campus, I’m certain that this could never happen at my institution. Is that Mulatto U? Partially. Partially Mulatto, is that a tautology? I believe “octoroon” covers it. I always find it amazing that 1) people ever thought skin color really mattered and 2) it is so powerful that a 1/16 genetic heritage was enough to not only talk about but come up with a specific name for. One Drop rule. Tracing lines told you who could still be owned or not. In some places octoroons were freepersons. It also served as fodder for a whole genre of 18th century art (Casta paintings), which remind one of Pokemon breeding charts. It’s like a recipe book for racists. My father’s side of the family is melungeon. I always figured it was a slang term for mulatto, although a lot of them would claim to be descended from the Portuguese. Melungeons are tri-racial. My cousin had his DNA tested to see where our Y chromosome came from. Turns out it was the Indus Valley. Best guess is that there were some Spanish Moors who came up from Florida/Caribbean along the Appalachians and mixed with the Indian, European, and slave populations. I;d guess Indus Valley (Pakistan) would come from Gypsies who migrated to Europe in the Middle Ages. DNA testing and language analysis has shown them to be connected to India Those Moors probably did a lot of rapin’ of the indigenous savages back in the day. African/European/Native American describes most of Puerto Rico Awesome. I’ll make that claim next time I see him. That should get his panties in a twist. From my understanding it was a way to justify keeping the increasingly white slave population after importing fresh slaves became illegal. Musta forgot to ban murder on their campus! Why can’t these fuckers ever just commit suicide? I hate them. And of course they’re doing a room to room search now even though they already have the shooter. Never miss a chance to play GI Joe!!!! Oh come on now. It’s a possibility-albeit small-that there is/was an accomplice. If there was ever a time for the cops to ‘get active’ it’s when there’s a campus shooting in progress or just happened. Beats those fucks who stood around with their thumbs up their bums like at Columbine. An accomplice who is unarmed and just sitting quietly in class? Seems like a good reason to point guns at hundreds of students who have already been terrorized! No, an accomplice who helped shoot these people. Neither you nor I can rule that out, and ruling it out is worth some GI Joe police action. I think getting shot by a hypothetical accomplice is just a tad worse than the sight of GI Joe cops. Without knowing the if or who of accomplicism what/whom are the cops searching for in their room to room adventures? A maniac who is pointing his gun at people for no good reason. The shooter is a pasty. Check the photographs of all the people running toward the grassy knoll. A “pasty”? Interesting.. A pasty with or without tassles? It’s. A Cornish dish of beef and taters wrapped in a fried pie crust. Don’t forget to put some onion in there! That’s what she said!! mmmm… meatpie I’ve got a friend from high-school who’s on campus, in lockdown according to her FB. Ugh. Hope your friend stays safe. What religion is she ? Never waste an opportunity to blow a dog away. they are also taking the sheep i mean the students to a different location so that they can do what i don’t know instead of saying okay go home now. Don’t they test everyone for GSR? Mandatory counseling. OT: Fiorina: ‘We must be prepared’ to use force on Russia http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-…..-on-russia If she were to be elected I’m confident that the Valkyries would be quite busy for some time. Any potential adversary must believe we are willing to use force against them, idiot. How do you think deterrence actually works? Like gun free zones? “I believe we must tell the Russians that we will conduct [and] we will secure a no-fly zone around anti-Assad rebel forces that we’re supporting,” she said on Fox News’s “Hannity.” She’s being more specific here and advocating for the US to take an active role in the Syrian conflict in opposition to Russia. That’s not the same as the deterrence I think you’re referring to. This is bad, and she is bad for thinking that. Although Russian intervention is probably NOT aimed at getting rid of ISIS, so that is bad as well. MMMMMM’KAY? Well, yes, she’s basically saying, “we won’t let Russians bomb our proxy to preserve their proxy.” That’s exactly how deterrence works. Because right now, Russians are sparing ISIS and bombing non-ISIS rebels. Which makes sense, US and friends have been hitting ISIS as hard as they could, not much Russians can do there. Now, you want to argue US should have no proxy and should support Assad, that’s different. Won’t get you far with Republicans, but maybe different parties should offer different policy options. I would argue that it’s a rats nest and the only policy worth pursuing is ISIS containment. Opposing Russia isn’t going to help that. I agree. It’s important to maintain US credibility. We come in and back a rebel group against Assad, but then as soon as the Russians back Assad should we say to our proxies, “Sorry, it’s been nice knowing you!” because we don’t want to poke the Bear? Maybe we decide this fight isn’t worth the risk – but which groups are going to want to ally with us in the future when we show this level of commitment, and will the Bear begin to push us even harder because they’ve seen our fecklessness in previous confrontations? The credibility was ruined when we decided to back a disorganized, terrorist connected, group of rebels in the first place. It was a bad idea from the beginning. Are you saying that because it’s now an even worse idea because of Russia’s involvement that we need to double down? True. I was speaking more in generalities than this specific situation. I did say this may not be the fight we want to pick. “Now, you want to argue US should have no proxy and should support Assad, that’s different. Won’t get you far with Republicans, but maybe different parties should offer different policy options.” Republicans ? I thought it was the Lightbringer who drew the line in the sand. I though Clinton/Kerry said Assad must go ? Silly boy. The Republicans are in Congress and Obama has a pen and a phone. And a State dept. and a military to boss around. Congress ? What the phuc do they have to do with anything ? “Now, you want to argue US should have no proxy and should support Assad, that’s different. Won’t get you far with Republicans, but maybe different parties should offer different policy options.” Republicans ? I thought it was the Lightbringer who drew the line in the sand. I though Clinton/Kerry said Assad must go ? Silly boy. The Republicans are in Congress and Obama has a pen and a phone. And a State dept. and a military to boss around. Congress ? What the phuc do they have to do with anything ? “How do you think” He doesn’t. Why sabre-rattle against some idiot who is willing to do your dirty work? Russia is not going to go after ISIS that hard. ISIS helps legitimize the Assad government. Not to say that one should sable-ratter here but don’t get your hopes up for a Putin-cleansing of Syria. “Fiorina: ‘We must be prepared’ to use force on Russia” Meh. If she really wanted to act tough she would have drawn a red line in the sand and threatened Putin that if he crosses it there will be a price to pay. It worked for Obam…….oh.. wait a minute. These shooters should do everyone a favor and shoot themselves first. Then again, if they did that they wouldn’t get all the attention (posthumously) that they felt denied during their life. And don’t forget the manifesto! I have a manifesto but no one wants to read it. But if I go out and kill a bunch of people then the masses will scramble to get a copy in an attempt to understand me. In this environment I’m surprised there aren’t more of these shootings… I’m starting to wonder if we should provide a public place to commit suicide. An eight story monument that you can jump from for example. If you commit suicide using it a loud speaker will play a one minute speech by you after you hit the ground, and an up to one hundred page manifesto can be made available to print in a nearby gift shop. A set amount of the proceeds from sales of your manifesto will go to the cause or person of your choice. It’s a spectacle that gets your message out. You can get revenge on people by claiming they are the cause of your death in your one minute speech, and most importantly it doesn’t involve killing other people. I’m in, you pick the place then tell me where to send money. Interesting idea. But I suspect that over time people would become numb to it, so crazy people who have to up the ante to get the attention they desire. Plus it’s hard to imagine that being allowed since there’s so much opposition in this country to Assisted Suicide. But if your proposition were ever on a ballot, I’d vote for it! Oh people will definitely become numb to it over time, but it will act as a tourist attraction because humans are both curious and morbid. The people doing these sorts of killings are crazy enough they don’t realize they are hurting their causes, so they are probably crazy enough not to understand the difference between tourist and convert crowds. The anti-assisted suicide thing is the main problem I see. I can’t figure out a way to get around the current legal framework. Not unless I piggy backed off a crisis like the current one. Catch people while they are thinking about how they wish the bastard just offed himself, and they won’t think about people pressuring them on their death beds. NOW you’re thinking like a progressive! 😉 Nah, a reality show. The Ultimate Reality Show. Useless fuck could drone on and on about how disaffected he is until they hit a hard break. Perhaps a panel that mocks him by rating his sincerity 1 – 10. Then he can dynamite himself in front of millions. Slow Mo would be a plus. American Psychiatry Assoc. could be a sponsor. Or Ruger maybe. Then again, if they did that they wouldn’t get all the attention (posthumously) that they felt denied during their life. I don’t think they would be in a condition to care. I’m just glad that there’s now something to distract from the Dunham thread. I’m on the live news feed from the local tv station. They’ve now got a student from the college on the phone. He just told them how he had been on his way to the “Lie-berry” when he first saw activity on campus. What? He’s an Ebonics major. OT: You can now Yelp your friends (or anybody else) Imagine a database that allows you and everyone you know to be ranked, classified and reviewed by someone you’ve dated, worked with or befriended, without their consent. Welcome to Peeple, described by the founders as a “positivity app.” When it launches in November, Peeple will allow users to rate and search human beings in the same way we rank and file restaurants, hotels, and car services on scores of other apps. That idea is idiotic and I only give whoever came up with it 1 meowmeowbeenz. The people who came up with it are really upset that people are saying mean things about them on the internet now. The lulz are pretty epic. JUDGE NOT, LEST YE BE DOWNVOTED ON YOUTUBE *slow clap* It would be better if it were limited to the context of the other sites. mad.casual – A Langham Hotel-style intellect with an Ed Debevic’s personality at a Budget Rent-a-car price. -1 Lee “Is known to repeat his opinions over and over again, as if we didn’t appreciate his wit the first time.” I have a new mouse now and have left those days behind me.

I saw that this morning and thought it would be awesome to have that for H&R commenters. I mean, the wiki really hasn’t been updated in a while. That could be entertaining. Especially if you can only update with reviews of commenters that consist of memes they have spawned. So essentially, John, Warty, and Nicole. “Nicole: the worst” Well we already know who would be rated the worst. Yeah, this will totally not end up a place for exes to bitch and falling outs from high school to be rehashed. I see this either fading in two months or becoming a tool to inform your in group who is in the out group. Actually, I think this concept is brilliant. Perhaps people will be more considerate if they know that their mistreatment of others could come back to haunt them. Fuck off. Irony? Ah…the first person I’m gonna rate! Or, people will just shun all human contact since there’s no way of keeping crazy exes from posting crazy, made up bullshit. ^This. I’ve been delving further and further along that path since the Facebook was introduced in 2005. My wife has absolutely refused to have anything to do with Facebook since it was created, for exactly this reason. She thinks anyone who goes in Facebook is nuts. She gets pissed if anyone posts a picture with her in it on Facebook, and asks that they not identify her if they have posted something. But she also has a strange belief that she has online privacy since she doesn’t go on Facebook. Yeah, she asked me to ask you to stop talking about her on here. I said I like the concept. But as with many things the execution will likely fall short. Sometimes I forget there are crazy and/or lying people among us. What? Are you nuts? The best way to get the real truth about any man is to ask his ex-wife. Everyone knows this. You misspelled “bartender”. I eagerly await enough assets to accrue in my down-rankers plus one stupid hiring manager eilling to blame my not getting a job based on my down-ranks to make me live on my own island rich. I don’t think of yelp as a source for restaurant reviewers so much as a source for pompous reviewers “I’ve eaten all over the world and I just love this type of currently trendy ethnic cuisine, so I was surprised to find a restaurant serving this style of food in this otherwise podunk town. I hope I never have to come here again, but if I do at least I know of one place I can be seen without dying of embarrassment” I imagine a database for ranking people would be similar, with reviews telling more about the reviewer than the one being reviewed. bleh *source for restaurant reviews I don’t think of yelp as a source for restaurant reviewers so much as a source for pompous reviewers Yes, thank you! You can tell that some of these assholes have had a life-long dream of being a restaurant critic for the NYT or something similar….and now they get to indulge in some wish-fulfillment. Exactly Google reviews is much better. You don’t have to wade through a long paragraph of BS to get to “my sandwich was tasty” or “my sandwich came with extra cockroaches”. The reviews are straight and to the point. Take the following the usual grain of salt: Apparently the shooter posted on 4chan last night Police radio traffic of the incident Wtf are they even talking about with this “Beta” stuff? I sort of understand it in the context of pajama boy, but not the way they’re using it. It’s PUA-speak. Alphas are jerks and go around impregnating ladies who then get betas to raise their children. Betas are losers who white-knight for women because they think “being nice” is the way to get laid, as opposed to the real way, which is “being a dick.” This is true. When I have sex, I single-mindedly concentrate all of my focus into my genitals. I am my dick. Be the dick, and nothing more than the dick. pppt. they’re both wrong. The way you get laid is to be good looking, funny, and fantastic in bed. poor kids. someone needs to kick their ass and teach them some self respect. You get laid by teasing a woman with low self-esteem about her hair, weight, clothes, and intelligence. Also, I am not saying you hit her if she gives you any trouble, but a smack or two is okay. Just remember to use a stick that is no wider than your thumb. Need to stay on the right side of being legal and all. Being a quick witted dick can make people you interact with superficially like you. A friend of mine got really misanthropic after finding that being a funny asshole to people he didn’t like made him very popular with them in high school. So they aren’t wrong, being a dick can get you laid. It’s just the people it will get you laid with generally live off of drama, and are too stupid to build anything long term with (second part is my opinion, first part is why they like being with someone who is a jerk to them). I’ve done pretty well with just funny… “good looking, funny, and fantastic in bed.” Does this person even exist? It reminds me of the fast/cheap/good Euler diagram – “pick two” I’ll take good looking and fantastic in bed. I’m terrible with word play, and it feels like I’m not holding up my end of the conversation when I talk with someone who is good at it. I am surprised none of you have claimed that you would take a person who is just good looking and use your charms and smooth moves to create a fantastic lover who perfectly suits your desires. “use your charms and smooth moves” a bullwhip is faster Ah lap83, your one of those deviant BSDM freaks I keep hearing about on my granny’s cop shows. Trying seduce impressionable young women into your evil libertarian ways. I’m actually (straight) female, so hopefully the comment comes across less psychopathic because people usually just assume that women aren’t psychopaths, not that I’d use that to my advantage or anything… *shifty eyes* I am surprised none of you have claimed that you would take a person who is just good looking and use your charms and smooth moves to create a fantastic lover who perfectly suits your desires. “But they said we couldn’t have sex with those robots!” In the context of the Santa Barbara virgin shooter. The police radio traffic is embarrassing. They had maybe 3 officers that responded right away. The rest of the cowards were trying to close out other calls or weren’t answering their radios. Shameful. Hey, Dunkin’ Donuts requires your undivided attention “The Northwest”. Yeah, I’m totally convinced that must have been THE GUY. Because The Northwest is so specific. (Interesting question: How many posts like that come up on 4Chan that can never be tied to anything?) but it was posted yesterday, with the OP saying he was going to shoot up a community college. CNN seems to confirm Investigators are examining social media postings made by a man, thought to be in his late 20s, who they believe is the suspect in Thursday’s shootings at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The night before the attack, the alleged shooter appears to have had a conversation with others online about his intentions, the source said. In an attempt to distract myself from the news, I offer that today is #askanarchivist day. I’m available if you have any archives/preservation related question. How do you resolve complex disputes without someone ultimately deciding, and how do you enforce that person’s decision? Why can’t I find a copy of “Monsieur Beaucaire” starring Bob Hope? It is available on DVD from amazon in a double feature with Where There’s Life. Whoops. I read that as “ask an anarchist” day. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? What do you mean, African, or European swallow? More importantly, what is SF’s favorite color? Plaid? Royal purple. Which is an ironic choice for a libertarian, I realize. Is that because of the line of synthetic lubricants they produce? No, the association with monarchical systems of government. The first Star Wars novel had a quote from something (possibly a book) called “The Journal of the Whills”. Where can one find this journal? Here What’s the best way to organize my digital photos? Whatever really works for you. We generally go by date if it is available, considering how complex any sort of subject ordering can become. Make sure to use the .tif format when possible. To date is it most stable and lossless format known, and migrate to new storage media when it becomes widely-used. How does one write description for famous lionized white dudes that doesn’t ignore inequities of race, gender, and class? [withering stare] Why do those inequities matter in a description of that dude? Answer that question, answer yours. *whoooosh* Nicole’s deadpan sarcasm is just one of the reasons she’s the worst. I have an old 5.25″ floppy disk that contained my grandfather’s life story that he dictated to me when I was a kid. I took it to one place years ago to get the data off but they were unable. So I’ve always wondered about digital archiving. How do the pros deal with digital archiving? Do they move everything to the latest greatest tech whenever it comes out, or how do they decide when and to which media to move data to? How do the determine how many copies to keep? Migrate, migrate, migrate. Widespread usage is usually the standard, like the march from floppy to ZIP disks to CD ROM to DVD ROM. Three copies on any physical format, two onsite, one offsite. I keep my personal digital back-ups on USB drives, one of which stays in a safety deposit box. I have a Mac at home, so I partition the drives and keep Apple OS and Windows format copies. (Large archives now keep digital material in server vaults that back themselves up in different locations around the world.) As for the 5.25, I’d contact the archives at the nearest state university. They often keep legacy equipment for just that purpose. If they won’t help you, they are probably just assholes. Try another. But also keep in mind that media was quite unstable. Even a weak magnetic field might have corrupted it. The Computer History Museum keeps a variety of old machines for that purpose if your local university doesn’t have the equipment. I have several MP3s on my iPod that started off as vinyl records in the 70’s and 80’s, then migrated to cassette and finally MP3 “one of which stays in a safety deposit box. ” Hillary ? What is done to preserve old documents made with caustic inks, such as iron gall ink? Iron gall ink is an inherent vice and there is a very little that can be done. Some institutions have tried interleaving buffered paper in hopes of neutralizing some of the acid in the ink, to little effect iirc. If possible, given the paper/parchment etc, some will wash the documents in deionized water and sodium bicarbonate to neutralize and stabilize the damage (this is also done with ground wood pulp documents with high lignin content.) This is an incredibly complex process and not something you should do at home. (And it usually is followed up by light encapsulating the document in Mylar, something that requires some very pricey equipment.) The “good” news is, all the ink usually does is eat away only the paper/parchment it is directly applied to, so the document is still readable, as such, since the shapes of the letters remain. Iron gall inks do not work well on paper, so most documents written in oak gall ink are on parchment. The key to preserving parchment is absolute humidity control and keeping exposure to oxygen to a minimum That said, degradation of the ground from the ink is incredibly slow and a new document written in iron gall ink on parchment can reasonably last 1000 years or more. See Book of Kells At what point is something considered old enough to fall under your purview? Also, how do you decide what is important and what is not? Institutions will generally collect anything that falls within their collection development policy, and of any age. Archives are generally run to focus on primary resources (letters, photographs, business records, etc.) Secondary resources (books, periodicals, government publications) are usually the purview of libraries. When those materials are of an age, a fragility or become rare, they become the responsibility of a special collections department. While special collections and archives are often housed together or even share staff or access points, they serve different functions. Deciding what is important is one of the hardest things to quantify and regularize. Archives generally err on the side of taking/retaining too much rather that too little. And every institution is different. In that way, I often describe archivists as “anti-librarians.” Sugar you are reminding me of the charater on Friends who dinosaur bone collector or something. I’ve had a rough day and can’t remember the exact term. How is anarchivism functionally different from anarchism? We are much better organized. Zing! “I’m available if you have any archives/preservation related question.” Very well, SugarFree. How much damage is done annually to the American forest by the spruce bud worm? I’m in a different movie, man. What is the ideal medium for preserving fart stench? Sometimes I let the really horrific ones go when there’s nobody else around to enjoy it. I’d like to be able to capture the experience for release in a more populated area. Silica aerogel Ambergris. MythBusters did a segment on flatulence where they collected farts using an submerged inverted jar filled with water to collect farts. You could use that method. Gawd, but I love this forum. You guys are the best worst. Special delivery to the Clinton Campaign headquarters… Actually, I do have a question, though not very interesting. I’ve done some work with libraries over the past year, archiving old Umatic and beta tapes. I think we did it for NYU and another library, but both asked for a compressed version (DVCPro) and a 10bit, uncompressed version, all transferred using that bagit procedure. So… what up with that? Is the uncompressed version there to ensure future compatibility, in case DVCPro is dropped from future media players? Or is it for stability purposes, like what you said about tif files? If you have the space, and your whole purpose is maintaining integrity for decades down the line, I understand going with uncompressed video. But 225 mbit/s for something compressed to videotape in the 80s looks like such overkill. We have a tendency to go for overkill in digitization. Archives and libraries both have a bad tradition of early adoption of technologies before they have been optimized. For example, when the mass digitization projects of photographs began, the prevailing standard was set to scanning everything, regardless of physical size, at 300 dpi. This was settled on mainly due to digital storage costs and millions of work hours were put into scanning photographs with not very good scanners into a substandard format to produce files that were barely usable just a decade later. So here we are, scanning them again, which is a lot of wear and tear on the original objects. Hence, the overkill. I see. That’s what I figured, really. Tanks. But job security ! How are you still alive? Black magic and super science. Why are you still alive? I’m not done yet. In an attempt to distract myself from the news, I offer that today is #askanarchivist day. I’m available if you have any archives/preservation related question. Have you ever used a particle accelerator to read/scan a manuscript that was erased and overwritten? I have a friend, let’s call him Not Crusty Juggler, who wants to know if it is possible to infiltrate Warty’s dungeon for a randy doomcocking and still make it out alive? “In an attempt to distract myself from the news, I offer that today is #askanarchivist day. I’m available if you have any archives/preservation related question.” Do women find archivists super sexy and throw their panties at them like they did Elvis ? I’m thinking of something to do in my retirement other than “Get Off My Lawn”. Thanks Archivist . What are your thoughts on microfilm? Specifically, what sort of role should/will it play in preserving future documents? The Brady Campaign will get richer, but that’s about it, thankfully. Doesn’t he make enough money as the greatest quarterback ever already? I deflated your joke. Does anybody need to read a non-straight news story about this? I mean, we know exactly what every news/politics website will write about this and what their commenters will say. A person with mental illness who somehow fell through the cracks obtained a weapon, or weapons, legally (or illegally, the details don’t matter), and carried out a grudge because they are a person who is mentally ill. It is just so sad, sad enough that politicians and activists are going to fuck it dry. *Slow clap* Gun free zone? If so, it looks like their magical gun free zone signs are defective. When is someone going to hold those sign manufacturers accountable? /sarc More and bigger signs are definitely in order. Clearly the shooter didn’t see them. Hilariously, one showed up at my local grocery store. I wondered to myself, ‘How could a business that *should* be otherwise so publicly accommodating, get away with this?’ Upon closer inspection, the fine print (fine black print on clear glass so… nearly invisible) on the sign reads that it’s applicable to employees and business associates only. Nice Trick! I’m sorry to hear this news. My thoughts to the survivors and family members of the victims. The media is the worst. Nicole has been bested. Oh I think not. I mean, I don’t even know why anyone complains about the media doing that. It’s their job. Peeps want the reporting, after all. You are right, you are still worser. All of the requests on the same page shines a light on the seediness that is that industry. I mean, at least lie and say you hope they are safe before you ask for the interview. Worsted, rather? This is Jack’s complete lack of surprise. I remember when Andrew Cunanan murdered Versace. At the time I was renting a room from a friend who had gone to school with Cunanan. We had multiple phone calls a day from “journalists” who wanted interviews or to buy his old yearbook. IIRC, it was mostly Hard Copy and Inside Edition types. It is funny / disgusting to see it all lined up like that, but what do you expect? They got a job to do, and only 140 characters for their pitch. Can’t they just file a ghoul report, I mean a pool report? So how do these produces from ABC and CNN found these accounts so quickly? Do they have bots set up to scan the web for keywords such as “students are running everywhere”? 2nd Active Shooter in One Day “The Associated Press 7:29 a.m. EDT September 14, 2015” *narrows gaze* well…. I SAW THE STORY ON THE SAME DAY which is almost the same thing. Mandatory grief counseling. http://www.davidcolarusso.com/deaths/#.Vg2Iy_lVhBd The campus is a gun free zone. How did someone get a gun into a gun free zone? I blame the lax Virginia gun laws. Note that, while it’s probably irrelevant to the shooter, Oregon campuses cannot, because of preemption, ban licensed concealed carry. So they’re not strictly gun-free zones. I’m sure Tony can answer that for us. I grew up there and I can’t think of a more depressing place. A mass shooting there doesn’t surprise me one bit. Why is it depressing? Is it the economy? The parts of Oregon I’ve seen were beautiful. You’ve never been to Portland I take it. I didn’t think Portland was bad. I must have been in the good part of town. Anyway, it’s not like it’s back east or something. I’ve hiked a nice chunk of the PCH through Oregon. I still think…about the most beautiful beach I ever saw was in Oregon. Forests and waterfalls. Snow covered mountains and wildlife. World’s best pinot noir. Awesome Shakespeare Festival. I was thinking maybe it was a logging town that went bust or something. That’s still my first bet. Roseburg’s only depressing if you have to live there and look for work or enjoyment… I thought Oregon was fucking sweet. Even Portland, although I preferred Eugene and Corvallis. (Those were the only places I went.) I liked Corvallis because it was so small and quiet but not like a small town in the South or even on the East Coast. It was totally laid back with $3 microbrew pints and $2 ones on Monday. Roseburg’s notable for being along I-5 and… that’s really about it. The economy has been in the toilet for the last 30 years. I think right now it’s holding on through welfare, unemployment and weed…so things might turn around soon. The mix of “poor” california retiree and small town hick/redneck that manages to pull out the worst in each. The insular and proud of it view of the world. Most people I grew up with couldn’t fathom moving more than 5 miles away, high school guidance counselors recommending the local community college to kids with enough credits to graduate from said college. Just hearing a town of 17K people called “The City”. It’s pretty but unless you’re an outdoor all the time type of person there just isn’t anything there. Never been up there myself, but I get the notion that a lot of crazies move there. For a few decades they seemed to have more than their fair share of serial killers. No doubt the Ban Boner crowd is at full mast right now. My wife, whom I love dearly, had a great take here: I patiently wait to find out what thing we can find to blame this one. Was the shooter wearing blue sneakers? Blue sneakers should be banned so this doesn’t happen again! OT: Homophobic Pizzeria Inadvertently Caters a Gay Wedding So, if there ever was a question about it, at least with some, being about nothing but trophies; let it be laid to rest. Sometimes the difference between ‘Do you hate gay/SJW people?’ and ‘Are there gay/SJW people you hate?’ is subtle and sometimes, it’s not. They specifically said they didn’t care if the gayest people in gaytown ordered their pizzas to go. Just that they’d be “uncomfortable” with participating in a gay wedding. a la Vegans and Muslims not being comfortable at a pig-roast. I really don’t get why so many people think lack of affirmation is a hate-crime. If you don’t fully agree with me on everything that my group has determined to be right and good, then you’re against me and everything that is holy. Prediction: The shooter recently passed some mental health screening that would have blocked him from legally having a firearm if only we had common sense legislation banning the mentally ill from legally having firearms and he had failed the screening. See 11f on the NICS form. It’s already covered by law See 11f on the NICS form. Just use the standard S-1798 and write in “pizza” where it says “machine gun”. I believe in Doing Something, so long as it’s a smart something. For example, how many mass shootings are at honky-tonks? They’re full of inebriated good old boys – shouldn’t there be more mass shootings there? shouldn’t there be more mass shootings there? They aren’t gun-free zones, in all likelihood, so no. More importantly, drunk dick wants to shoot one guy he has a sudden problem with, not “everyone at the bar because his life sucks”. Someone looking to kill a bunch of people isn’t going to pick a bar, so much, especially one where there’s a good chance at least someone behind the bar has a weapon. People who want to kill lots of other people choose places where they can achieve that. So what you’re saying is that with people able to carry guns in so many places, the really good targets for mass shooters are the remaining places, like schools and theaters. Obviously the country will never be rid of mass shootings until every kindergartner is packing. Hmm. The last time I went to an elementary school – which admittedly was a long time ago – there were adults there. But were they government approved adults, Jordan? Because in Tonyland, only government knows best, and only adults that work for the government can be trusted with (insert anything here). The teachers work for the govt, let a few of them carried concealed, and they don’t have to advertise which ones. Don’t rely on the 300 lb resource officer posted outside the office. He will be the first target. You exaggerate, of course. Nonetheless, if you want to get attacked, then disarm yourself and advertise that fact to the world. Or, you could do the opposite and reduce your chances of suffering such an attack. It’s not exactly rocket surgery. Curious about how many VIPoliticians who will be surrounded by armed bodyguards will be saying that we shouldn’t be allowed to own guns ? Christ, this makes me sick. I know they are bat-shit insane, but the perpetrators of these kinds of things are no less than pure evil. Fucking worthless cowards. I can’t imagine what the parents of the murdered are going through right now. I have to ask. Is the school a gun-free zone? The gun grabbers will start their shrieks and emotional appeals any moment now. Those people are equally as evil and make me sick also. You’re the one who just fucking politicized it, so shut up. No, Tony, he’s simply pointing out the inevitable. Like predicting rain during monsoon season in Indonesia. Brady Centers Twitter feed yields: Our thoughts are with the entire Roseburg community as they are the latest to be impacted by a uniquely American tragedy. Coalition to stop gun violence twitter If you feel absolutely sick about the #UCCShooting, pick up the phone & call an elected official who backs the NRA. And give them an earful. They just want a “conversation,” not to force their anti-gun hysteria onto peaceful gun owners. Our thoughts are with the entire Roseburg community as they are the latest to be impacted by a uniquely American tragedy. Yep, mass shootings never happen in countries where they have mandatory registration, “assault weapon” bans, safe storage laws, and no concealed carry whatsoever.

Expect 10% increase in gun sales tomorrow. Eternal Memory What a shitshow. Here. This should cheer everyone up. That is a statistically unlikely number of blondes. Sorority, dude. That story had a link to another story… ..whereupon i thought to myself = “I really want to party with THIS GUY” “Homer’s night on the town If you drank a shot with the Knights mascot on Sept. 20, you were basically harboring a fugitive Joe Gillespie woke up at the bottom of a BB&T Ballpark stairwell with no idea how he got there. It was hours after an event he attended in the venue, and it didn’t seem like the beginning of what would be one of his “top three nights of all time.” That is, until he began searching for a way out and came across the dressing room for Homer the Dragon, the Charlotte Knights’ mascot. He spent the next five hours of that Sunday morning carousing around Uptown Charlotte as Homer, posing for pictures and getting free drinks wherever he tore up the dance floor. By Monday, Gillespie was in jail and the story, complete with a mullet in a mugshot, went viral shortly after.” I’m glad the hot brunette didn’t disappoint me. She’s just eating her ice cream and checkin’ her phone every now and then. I’ll imagine she’s reading War and Peace or something. God Bless America. That is all. This should cheer everyone up. Is the hot dog/pretzel rod to the face thing deliberate? I assume at college age it’s deliberate, but the deadpan ‘look at me having a good time!’ expressions are too hard to read. Apparently, I’m too old to tell when a girl/woman is doing something suggestive because it’s humorous or because she doesn’t know any better. All the bitches crave the pretzel rod, bro. Were their some licking the ketchup from between their fingers and I missed it? Do they even *know* they’re at a baseball game, or did they just wander in by mistake? Selfies are stupid, but still beat watching baseball. Just looked over the 4Chan link. The majority of those fucks seem to be supportive of the shooter. It is hard to tell if they take him seriously or not, but God, why would anyone even blow hot air about something like that? I am guessing misfit kids who blame the world for their own shortcomings and probably have a touch of crazy in them as well. It’s the internet. In other words, “4chan users”. (That and “4chan is trolls”.) It’s nothing new. “I stood up in a social studies class -the teacher wanted a discussion — and said I could never kill anyone or condone anyone who did kill anyone. But that I could, on some level, understand these kids in Colorado, the killers. Because day after day, slight after slight, exclusion after exclusion, you can learn how to hate, and that hatred grows and takes you over sometimes, especially when you come to see that you’re hated only because you’re smart and different, or sometimes even because you are online a lot, which is still so uncool to many kids? After the class, I was called to the principal’s office and told that I had to agree to undergo five sessions of counseling or be expelled from school, as I had expressed ?sympathy? with the killers in Colorado, and the school had to be able to explain itself if I ?acted out?. In other words, for speaking freely, and to cover their ass, I was not only branded a weird geek, but a potential killer. That will sure help deal with violence in America.” Oh fucking hell. Murder fantasies of between 1 and 4 people you personally know I can understand. They could have possibly done enough to you to justify your hatred. Anymore than that and you are a narcissist blaming innocent people for shit they didn’t do (unless you are literally in a concentration camp or warzone). Murder fantasies of between 1 and 4 people you personally know I can understand. At a frustrating time in my life a female co-worker with a background in forensics said knowing this fact about me put her at ease. She explained how the profile (at the time) was always white guy, 20-40, above average education, little or no family/personal life, etc., etc. and that I fit to a ‘T’. The thing that set me apart is that the neighbors and co-workers were always surprised when they went off and, if the police showed up and said I went on a rampage and murdered someone she wouldn’t be at all surprised and would probably suspect that the victims most likely did something to deserve it. I might nudge the number a little higher than 4 if we’re talking total, but sincerely fantasizing to murder more than a person or two at a time is not at all unheard of. Because day after day, slight after slight, exclusion after exclusion, you can learn how to hate, and that hatred grows and takes you over sometimes See?!?!? Microaggressions are real! I told my daughter about the few times I was bullied from 6th grade on up. I identified the properly responsible person and used my fists. That doesn’t strike me as that outrageous. I can definitely see how severely bullied kids could snap. I think there are two issues to take into consideration here: 1) When two kids fight, most teachers will punish both kids equally, even if one kid had been bullied by the other for weeks and weeks. 2) 99% of teachers and 90% of parents will tell kids that the solution to bullying and teasing is “just ignore them and they’ll stop”. That NEVER works. Zero percent success rate. They do it even worse because they know you’ll just put up with it. I’m all for the non-aggression principle, but… Sometimes, the only solution is to give that bully a good crack in the jaw. “Because day after day, slight after slight, exclusion after exclusion, you can learn how to hate, and that hatred grows and takes you over sometimes, especially when you come to see that you’re hated only because you’re smart and different” Sounds like a supervillain origin story. You know, when the bad guy has the hero in a dungeon and is just shooting the breeze about how come he *the villain) became so bad. “And then, the Fuhrer personally trained me, and I became an embodiment of ultimate evil, ha ha ha! But enough about me, what’s your favorite deep-dish pizza?” Oregon expanded background checks on online and private gun sales in August. I suppose the background check will cover personal vendettas and grudges. Bring on the Facederp! Just fucking horrified about UCC and also just already tired about the non-conversation that will follow. By “conversation” you mean “disarm or else.” Just fucking horrified about UCC Yes, the use of “fucking” as an intensifier has convinced me that your feelings of horror are genuine and not a convenient pretext to socially signal and self-justify your ideological biases. Also, she should that the Uniform Commercial Code isn’t all that bad. +1 fucking love science! Speaking of which, as much as I’m interested in The Martian, I don’t think I can sit thru a movie with Matt Damon blurting out lines like “I’m going to science the shit out this” YEP. That is seriously the only reason I’m avoiding it. I generally like Ridley Scott, it’s getting good reviews, it’s supposed to be a fun adventure; but I can’t stand a grown, accomplished man using ‘science’ as a verb. Ridley Scott hasn’t made a decent movie in decades. If this one doesn’t suck then it is completely because it was more or less written for him. How can you be tired about a non-conversation? She’s tired of the fact that she can’t force her personal preferences on people like us. Not yet, anyway. At this point, it is only lobbying by certain special interest groups (here, the NRA) that prevents the U.S. from going full Eurotyranny. I read that as Eurotranny the first time. From my friend who gave me the “Imagine” quote yesterday… Yeah. And these mass shootings are so unlikely when compared to all the other ways somebody can be killed that we really don’t have to worry about [His kid’s name] or [My kid’s name] getting shot to death at school. I mean who even cares about 10 or 20 students? There’s nothing anybody can do thats preventative that won’t greviously harm everybody else’s freedoms. I mean really. Why care? People have all these statistics to prove their side already and they’re all obviously wrong. Nobody really knows anything. Best leave it all alone. I can’t even. “There’s nothing anybody can do thats preventative that won’t greviously harm everybody else’s freedoms.” Well he hit the nail on the head there. I know he’s saying that facetiously, but I wonder if he would have such an attitude toward his preferred freedoms. Hey! His preferred freedoms are the important ones, OK? After all, the modern man doesn’t need a gun. Anyone know who the shooter is? It’s Reddit, so take with salt: here you go. Holy cow, the kid looks creepy. It’s obvious this dude is a freak. That hair is sooo Beiber 2012. Doesn’t he know the Beb has evolved ? Hotair.com is reporting that the shooter allegedly asked the students to state their religion. “Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has described him as a 20-year-old male.” No mention of race? No pic of the perp plastered all over the media? Hmmm. Must be one of those protected groups. The local dead tree rag The Houston Chronicle does this on a daily basis. A typical crime story will read something like this. “Police are advising people to be on the lookput for two males in their mid twenties . When last seen fleeing the scene one was wearing a black t-shirt and red sneakers while the other wore blue jeans and white sneakers. Police advise the suspects should be considered armed and dangerous and if spotted you should call 911 immediately and do not try and apprehend the suspects yourself. I shit you not. It has become a running joke around town. They are owned by the same group that owns the liberal Boston Herald or whatever so that should explain their liberal attitude towards race. “Maybe if we don’t say the boys (ooops racist I know ) are black no one will think that “. Just another mass shooting in a gun-free zone. When will leaders learn? And yet again, a protracted shooting of many people by a madman in what is surely a “gun free” zone. Is anyone EVER going to figure out the correlation? BTW, in Utah, you can pack heat on campus. Indeed, Utah PUBLIC SCHOOL teachers can carry — it’s been so for over a dozen years. No firearm incidents of ANY kind — in college or at a public school. Finally! A barbaric yet humane strategy to combat these senseless shootings by madmen by Richard Rider All right. Enough is ENOUGH! And I’m not kidding. It’s time we take REAL steps to end these senseless tragic random shootings. No, not more gun control. And not even more guards everywhere. Instead, I propose we put an end this madness a different way. It’s time for a radical new approach. A barbaric but painless solution. We have to understand that such premeditated killers don’t seem to fear death. Indeed, they seem to welcome it — often ending their own lives. So we need to go at this a different way — a way to deter them from a fear of what happens AFTER they die. Here’s my plan: Publicly announce that from this time forward, any such killer (bomber, shooter, or whatever) will have his body BADLY mutilated. Remember, I’m talking BARBARIC. Start with cutting off penises and testicles (almost all such shooters are guys). Announce that these body parts will be jammed in the deceased shooter’s mouth. Furthermore, gouge out the eyes. Pull out all teeth. Slash the face to ribbons. Cut off all fingers and toes. Smash the elbows and knees. There, that ought to do it. And oddly enough, I’m convinced this post-death retaliation will work on at least some of the shooters. (continued) (continued) These shooters crave the attention they get by their despicable act. Complain all you want about the avalanche of press coverage — these killers are going to get the attention they crave. It’s the price we pay for a (relatively) free press, and I can live with that. But it’s likely these wackos don’t crave the thought of being mutilated — even if they are crazy. And even after death. I know, I know — it’s too ghoulish an idea to even seriously consider. It’s better to keep doing what we’ve been doing — cleaning up after the killings in the (usually) gun free zones, wringing our hands as usual. But is the status quo really better? I think not. For me, the only question is whether or not grisly pictures of the mutilated killer should be posted on the Internet. For now, I’d say “no” — but only because it would be hard to keep kids from seeing them. Besides, posting such photos is probably not necessary anyway. Merely threatening to carry out such an horrible act (and following though on the next shooter’s body) should put a real damper on this aberrant behavior. I think a frank discussion with psychiatrists would find that I’m correct in this. At the very least, it’s time to consider this mutilation alternative. Remember, no one is killed, tortured or otherwise physically harmed. It’s a terrible idea — except when one considers our current useless policies. Publicly announce that from this time forward, any such killer (bomber, shooter, or whatever) will have his body BADLY mutilated. Remember, I’m talking BARBARIC. Start with cutting off penises and testicles (almost all such shooters are guys). Announce that these body parts will be jammed in the deceased shooter’s mouth. Furthermore, gouge out the eyes. Pull out all teeth. Slash the face to ribbons. Cut off all fingers and toes. Smash the elbows and knees. “These job postings almost write themselves!” /job services employee I would prefer to give first choice for the mutilation job to the relatives of the victims. I favor contracting out government work whenever possible — especially to someone who will do it for FREE. Too bad we can’t consult Ruyard Kipling on this matter. He wrote a poem about this very thing concerning the women in Afghanistan. Something about advising the young British soldiers to save their last bullet for themselves. Could a libertarian case be made for gun control? Yes. Poor control means you are a poor shot and therefore unable to competently defend your inherent rights. No but dickheads callng themselves libertarians have proposed it. See Cato’s Robert A Levy. Let me guess, just like every other murder spree but one, it’s a gun free zone. There is another great progressive idea that has worked SO well. According to The Federalist Umpqua Community College, the site of the mass shooting, is a gun-free zone. http://thefederalist.com/2015/…..n-control/ Maybe the shooter can’t read ? barry is calling for ‘common sense’ gun control. I translate it to be communist sense gun control – AKA confiscation. How could this happen in a Gun Free Zone? Maybe they should change it to a bullet free zone? President Obama is absolutely right on. I’m so tired of you Teathuglicans saying otherwise. We need laws right now making it illegal for people to kill and shoot others. Exactly. Jack, you been pwnd. And busted. True dat. What we need a 5 more.. no 10 more, maybe 20 more laws making it illegal to murder people amd bigger signs saying “This is a Gun Free Zone”. Maybe it’s the signs fault. Maybe if they said This is ABSOLUTELY a Gun Free Zone….and in BIG letters…big RED letters because big red letters mean business. That’s the ticket. I still want to look through this guys medicine cabinet. “What we need a 5 more.. no 10 more, maybe 20 more laws making it illegal to murder people amd bigger signs saying “This is a Gun Free Zone”.” Dunno if it’s still there or those with some intelligence have ripped it down, but there was a sign on I-80 between SF and Sacto: “Davis is a nuclear-free zone!” I wondered how the kept the atoms organized Oh, and: “I still want to look through this guys medicine cabinet.” Jack’s? Naah; standard depressants. That’s all it takes to swallow Obo’s comments whole. I’m AMAZED that no one thought of this before! They should have revealed the identity of the killer by now. Was it the “egg man” or not? The Presidents comments were right on point. It’s insane that we accept these occurrences without any attempt at reducing gun violence. He called for stricter gun laws, Scott? Good for him. It’s typical? Not as typical as the constant mass shootings that occur here. Shame on you all for accepting it all so willingly. EXACTLY what steps or actions would you propose or push were you positioned to do any such thing. No generalities please. Jackand Ace|10.1.15 @ 8:14PM|# “…Shame on you all for accepting it all so willingly.” Yeah, shame on us for not being ‘concerned’ like oh-so wonderful Jack! Why, most of us here were practically cheering him on, weren’t we? Re: Jackass Ass, The Presidents comments were right on point. If the “point ” is to ghoulishly score political points before the victims are even identified, then you would be right. It’s insane that we accept these occurrences without any attempt at reducing gun violence. It is clear we need more mellow guns, because these are quite rowdy. Asshole. It’s typical? Not as typical as the constant mass shootings that occur here. Shame on you all for accepting it all so willingly. So many that you actually need two (count them: 2) hands to count. them! Do you even believe your own BS, Jackass? It’s insane that we accept these occurrences without any attempt at reducing gun violence. There have been many attempts to reduce and mitigate murder by gun. They haven’t worked. Some of the recent mass murderers got their guns illegally. Laws don’t work against the lawless. More laws will not make up for that fact. Common Sense Gun Control? is already enacted, but has had little effect. If doing the same thing while expecting different results is a definition of insanity, the doubling down is double insanity. Yet progressives continue to propose the same doubling down every time a senseless mass murder is committed. And they continue to blame those who disagree with them for the murders even though their solutions have failed. Shame on you all for accepting it all so willingly. Nobody is “accepting it all so willingly.” That’s just your response to disagreement. You accuse those who disagree with you of callousness to shut down conversation while many progressives who use your same silly tactics are calling for a conversation about common sense gun control. If you progressives want a conversation you can have it, but you must be willing to listen and to accept that your past attempts have failed and that doubling down will not produce a solution. Otherwise you don’t deserve the time of day. Has martial law been tried? Considering that most of the mass shooters are liberal leaning nutjobs, and not conservatives, perhaps your side could quit the name calling and personal attacks on anyone who disagrees with the liberal position on issues ? No one can deny that the personal attack method of denigrating comes directly from the modern day Democrat Bible “Rules for Radicals”. Stop your tribe from inspiring these boderline mentals Jackland and maybe fewer of them will go off the deep end in the future. That would be doing something , no ? Even the guy you elected to what is supposed to be the most dignified office in the world spouted a “TeaBagger” crude insult on TV. Oregon expanded background checks on private and online gun sales, and the campus was a gun free zone. So……… Mexico has stricter gun laws. My first attempted disappeared, I’m stubborn so I’ll try once more. From what I’ve seen/heard, little information re the shooter other than the following: 1. He was a 20 year old. 2. Supposedly, at one point, he inquired into the religion of some who became victims. As to comment from Obama, the usual comparisons between this country, and other nations. Also, some generalities regarding the need to “do something”, heaven knows what, however given his past comments and the record of his expressed desires and executive antics, draw your own conclusions. Things might become clearer, more interesting when, if more information becomes available. I make up to $90 an hour working from my home. My story is that I quit working at Walmart to work online and with a little effort I easily bring in around $40h to $86h? Someone was good to me by sharing this link with me, so now i am hoping i could help someone else out there by sharing this link… Try it, you won’t regret it!…… http://www.HomeJobs90.Com Obama didn’t even wait until the bodies are cold before he started in politicizing their deaths. Meanwhile: Rank City 30 Baton Rouge, LA 29 Youngstown, OH 28 San Bernardino, CA 27 Oakland, CA 26 Barberton, OH 25 Poughkeepsie, NY 24 Cincinnati, OH 23 Petersburg, VA 22 Wilmington, DE 21 York, PA 20 East Palo Alto, CA 19 Jackson, MS 18 Wilkes-Barre, PA 17 Birmingham, AL 16 East Point, GA 15 East Chicago, IN 14 Compton, CA 13 Baltimore, MD 12 St. Louis, MO 11 Harvey, IL 10 Newark, NJ 9 New Orleans, LA 8 Trenton, NJ 7 Detroit, MI 6 Flint, MI 5 Saginaw, MI 4 Chester, PA 3 Gary, IN 2 Camden, NJ 1 East St. Louis, IL m, how about some info on the ‘rank’? I have been to towns 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. I wouldn’t live in any of them. Is that the information you seek? I assume this city ranking is “gun deaths per 100,000” or some such, with “1” being the worst. Nothing correlates perfectly with such a list, but the characteristic that gives the best statistical correlation is likely the percentage of blacks in a city. There are DEFINITE exceptions, but overall the correlation is pretty high. But nobody wants to talk about that. Racist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Richard Rider|10.1.15 @ 10:38PM|# “I assume this city ranking is “gun deaths per 100,000” or some such, with “1” being the worst.” That might be true, or it might be towns with roses bought on Valentine’s Day. I’m going to avoid the conclusion-jumping event until mpercy gives us some idea. Sevo, given that it’s statistically likely you don’t follow this issue or peruse the relevant data, your decision is a wise one. I have some passing familiarity with these matters, so I can intelligently speculate as to the criteria used in these city rankings. Here’s a bit more on the black thingy: Blacks constitute about 13.1% of America’s population. quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html Yet when it comes to crime, the FBI reports that in 2012 blacks committed: 49.4% of all murders 32.5% of all forcible rapes 54.9% of all robberies 34.1% of all aggravated assaults 28.1% of ALL crime http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in- the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the- u.s.-2012/tables/43tabledatadecoverviewpdf Are whites a major murder threat to blacks? Of course not. 90.8% of all murdered blacks are killed by other blacks. The remaining 9.2% black murder victims were killed by ALL other races, or “unknown” — which doubtless includes some additional blacks. fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/ 2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/ tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6 NOTE: I had to fiddle with the links to get past the spam filter. An intelligent person can “connect the dots.” My hometown has fallen to 6th? The two best things we ever did was make Buicks and shoot people and ferkin Saginaw is ahead of us? I love Obama and Us http://www.mytricks.in/ There’s only one way to stop this madness. Prosecute the family members of these wack-jobs for not reporting these sickos to the proper authorities. The vast majority of these family members know their offspring and relatives are dangerous nut-jobs, yet nothing can be done until the sickies do their damage. In the 40s, 50s and 60s we used to institutionalize the mentally ill but then the Liberals said “You can’t lock these people up, they didn’t do anything.” So we let the whack-jobs out to roam the streets and live under our bridges and get a hold of guns and kill us. Sounds like another socialist plot to me. This is insane. We deserve the fucked-up society we have. Reason, you know I love you, but “But not us! We’d never politicize a tragedy!” is so obviously implied in that 6:40 PM update…..keep it real. Please log in to post comments Billy Binion

1. Planned Parenthood: The reproductive health clinic chain managed to hold onto its federal funding in the short-term spending bill passed on Wednesday, and while PP President Cecile Richards bobbled several questions in hearings this week on the non-profit’s activities, her Republican critics’ performance was so poor even conservatives groaned. A court order deprived GOP congressmen of their most potent ammunition: the undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood employees casually talking about deliberate preservation of aborted fetal tissue for research purposes. Meanwhile, polls continue to find the clinics enjoy far higher approval ratings than Congress.
2. Sen. Bernie Sanders: The insurgent socialist trailed his main rival for the Democratic nomination, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, $26 million to almost $29 million when the most recent fundraising numbers came out Wednesday night. But for Ms. Clinton to have a candidate once seen as such an underdog biting at her heels could hardly have left her camp feeling assured. Especially considering Mr. Sanders’ haul came from some 650,000 individual donors compared to her 250,000, which ups the likelihood that the former senator from New York will begin to directly engage her Brooklyn-born opponent in the next few weeks—especially at the first Democratic debate on October 13.
3. NYPD Inspector General Philip Eure and Department of Investigations Commissioner Mark Peters: The city ombudsmen dropped a damning report yesterday claiming the NYPD had at best a “patchwork” system for tracking uses of force by cops, and that it rarely disciplined officers who deployed violence without justification. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton displayed his public relations savvy by rolling out a plan to keep tabs on physical encounters that afternoon, with the apparent aim of eclipsing Mr. Eure and Mr. Peters’ findings in the media. But that’s just a sign that the two investigators got some results, even if the results didn’t cover the whole problem they exposed. And when Mr. Bratton demanded an apology from Mr. Eure for saying his department had been in “the dark ages,” Mr. Eure refused.
WHO HAD A BAD WEEK?
1. Anybody who lives near the Atlantic Ocean: The image of Hurricane Joaquin, a menacing Category Four storm, spiraling on the weather maps near the Eastern seaboard inevitably triggered flashbacks to 2012’s Superstorm Sandy. The threat of catastrophe and the emergency response preparations were even enough to get Mr. de Blasio to say, at first, that he’d actually stay in New York City for a couple of days. The powerful weather system is currently pummeling the Bahamas, but the silver lining of the storm is that it appears to be headed east and will likely not directly strike any American coastal cities—just hurl drenching rainstorms and fierce winds their way. Which means Mr. de Blasio is already on his way to the airport. But Joaquin may yet hit Bermuda, meaning former Mayor Michael Bloomberg may want to spent Saturday putting the windows down and unplugging appliances at his vacation house there.
2. America: The country saw its 294th mass shooting of the year yesterday at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, which is pretty remarkable considering we’re in the 274th day of 2015. The late killer, Chris Harper Mercer, was reportedly a self-identified mixed-race conservative Republican who admired the Nazis and the Irish Republican Army and hated organized religion so much he deliberately singled out Christians in his rampage—so political fingers are sure to be pointing in just about every direction imaginable over the next couple weeks. Except one, that is: towards some kind of policy change that might prevent these things from happening.
3. The open-air merchants of Times Square: The motley assortment of Muppets, superheroes, CD hawkers and body-painted babes making a living at the crossroads of the world may soon find their favorite marketplace not so free, if the recommendations the mayor’s task force unveiled on Wednesday go through. While they won’t rip up the plazas or outlaw the characters, the panel claimed it found a way to regulate the entrepreneurs’ activities without violating their First Amendment rights by having the Department of Transportation take over the pedestrian plazas where they ply their trades, and having the Council rezone the area to enstate special rules about commercial activity. Exactly the kind of anti-capitalistic big government impositions you would expect in #deBlasiosNewYork.
WHAT WAS THE WEEK’S BIGGEST STORYLINE?
Local electeds looking burnish their liberal credentials piled onto the Planned Parenthood issue early in the week—but then here came the story of the hurricane.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Honestly, haven’t we seen this movie before? The speeches over the Oregon shooting have already started, but we all know where they’ll all end: right back where we began. The stopgap spending bill Congress passed to keep the government running expires in December, which means the feds will face the cliff again in just two months—only without the leadership of the pragmatic House Speaker John Boehner. And Mr. Bratton will continue to try to juggle the roles of reformer and adamant defender of the police.
On the bright side, you might be able to get that Elmo costume you wanted for Halloween real cheap.
WHO WAS LAST TO THE TABLE?
After Mr. Boehner’s announcement that he would resign at the end of this month achieved the impossible last Friday by overshadowing the Pope, New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox decided it was best to wait til after the weekend to put out a press release remembering him as “a friend to the New York Republican Party.”
WHAT ARE WE HOPING HAPPENS NEXT WEEK?
Another DOI report finds a direct correlation between the mayor’s absence and extreme weather events.
WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN NEXT WEEK?
Fall is in the air, so Mr. de Blasio will likely be visiting someplace warm. 1.

Especially considering Mr. Sanders’ haul came from some 650,000 individual donors compared to her 250,000, which ups the likelihood that the former senator from New York will begin to directly engage her Brooklyn-born opponent in the next few weeks—especially at the first Democratic debate on October 13.
3. NYPD Inspector General Philip Eure and Department of Investigations Commissioner Mark Peters: The city ombudsmen dropped a damning report yesterday claiming the NYPD had at best a “patchwork” system for tracking uses of force by cops, and that it rarely disciplined officers who deployed violence without justification. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton displayed his public relations savvy by rolling out a plan to keep tabs on physical encounters that afternoon, with the apparent aim of eclipsing Mr. Eure and Mr. Peters’ findings in the media. But that’s just a sign that the two investigators got some results, even if the results didn’t cover the whole problem they exposed. And when Mr. Bratton demanded an apology from Mr. Eure for saying his department had been in “the dark ages,” Mr. Eure refused.
WHO HAD A BAD WEEK?
1. Anybody who lives near the Atlantic Ocean: The image of Hurricane Joaquin, a menacing Category Four storm, spiraling on the weather maps near the Eastern seaboard inevitably triggered flashbacks to 2012’s Superstorm Sandy. The threat of catastrophe and the emergency response preparations were even enough to get Mr. de Blasio to say, at first, that he’d actually stay in New York City for a couple of days. The powerful weather system is currently pummeling the Bahamas, but the silver lining of the storm is that it appears to be headed east and will likely not directly strike any American coastal cities—just hurl drenching rainstorms and fierce winds their way. Which means Mr. de Blasio is already on his way to the airport. But Joaquin may yet hit Bermuda, meaning former Mayor Michael Bloomberg may want to spent Saturday putting the windows down and unplugging appliances at his vacation house there.
2. America: The country saw its 294th mass shooting of the year yesterday at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, which is pretty remarkable considering we’re in the 274th day of 2015. The late killer, Chris Harper Mercer, was reportedly a self-identified mixed-race conservative Republican who admired the Nazis and the Irish Republican Army and hated organized religion so much he deliberately singled out Christians in his rampage—so political fingers are sure to be pointing in just about every direction imaginable over the next couple weeks. Except one, that is: towards some kind of policy change that might prevent these things from happening.
3. The open-air merchants of Times Square: The motley assortment of Muppets, superheroes, CD hawkers and body-painted babes making a living at the crossroads of the world may soon find their favorite marketplace not so free, if the recommendations the mayor’s task force unveiled on Wednesday go through. While they won’t rip up the plazas or outlaw the characters, the panel claimed it found a way to regulate the entrepreneurs’ activities without violating their First Amendment rights by having the Department of Transportation take over the pedestrian plazas where they ply their trades, and having the Council rezone the area to enstate special rules about commercial activity. Exactly the kind of anti-capitalistic big government impositions you would expect in #deBlasiosNewYork.
WHAT WAS THE WEEK’S BIGGEST STORYLINE?
Local electeds looking burnish their liberal credentials piled onto the Planned Parenthood issue early in the week—but then here came the story of the hurricane.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Honestly, haven’t we seen this movie before? The speeches over the Oregon shooting have already started, but we all know where they’ll all end: right back where we began. The stopgap spending bill Congress passed to keep the government running expires in December, which means the feds will face the cliff again in just two months—only without the leadership of the pragmatic House Speaker John Boehner. And Mr. Bratton will continue to try to juggle the roles of reformer and adamant defender of the police.
On the bright side, you might be able to get that Elmo costume you wanted for Halloween real cheap.
WHO WAS LAST TO THE TABLE?
After Mr. Boehner’s announcement that he would resign at the end of this month achieved the impossible last Friday by overshadowing the Pope, New York GOP Chairman Ed Cox decided it was best to wait til after the weekend to put out a press release remembering him as “a friend to the New York Republican Party.”

Another DOI report finds a direct correlation between the mayor’s absence and extreme weather events.

757,http://wonkwire.com/2015/10/02/mass-shootings-since-sandy-hook/,"Vox: “In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 986 mass shootings, with shooters killing at least 1,234 people and wounding 3,565 more.” “The counts come from the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowdsourced database that tracks shootings since 2013 in which four or more people were shot.”  “But why does the US have so many more gun homicides than other advanced countries? One possible explanation: Americans are much more likely to own guns than most of the world — the US makes up about 4.4 percent of the global population, but owns 42 percent of the world’s civilian-owned guns. And the empirical research shows places with more guns have more homicides.”  Enter your email address to receive the latest posts: The Hill: ""Dozens of economists and health experts from both sides of the aisle are coming to the defense of...",2015-10-02 07:10:46,Mass Shootings Since Sandy Hook,,19854,http://www.rollcall.com

760,http://observer.com/2015/10/cuomo-worry-about-guns-crossing-borders-not-mexicans/,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo (Photo: Spencer Platt for Getty) Gov. Andrew Cuomo attacked the Republican Party for its concerns over border security while blasting their resistance to new federal gun control laws—while backing off his call last week for his fellow Democrats to threaten a government shutdown if such measures fail to pass in the wake of the mass shooting in Oregon.
Speaking on the Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC this morning, the governor touted his success in getting the SAFE Act, short for the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement, passed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. The 2013 law limited the size of bullet magazines, required new background checks and permit renewals and called for the creation of an assault weapons registry—but Mr. Cuomo argued shootings had risen recently in New York City as a consequence of looser restrictions in other states, and mocked the GOP primary preoccupation with illegal immigration over the nation’s southern border.
“Because a state can’t do this on its own. That’s why the federal government has to act. I passed the toughest law. I closed the front door on the state. You—that’s what our law does. The back door is open because of the federal government,” he said.
“And people are getting in the car and driving to Virginia and driving to South Carolina and they’re bringing guns in. That’s why we need federal action,” he continued. “Because by definition, this is an issue a state can’t do on its own. You know, they’re so worried about the border with Mexico. Worry about my state’s borders. I’m not worried about Mexicans coming over my border. I’m worried about assault weapons coming over my border. If you want to protect borders, start by protecting the borders of states, and respect their gun laws.”
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo dialed back the idea of threatening to refuse to pass spending bills needed to keep parts of the government running unless a gun control bill were passed—a tactic Republicans have used on issues like deficit spending and federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
“Just to clarify: I didn’t call for a government shutdown. I said, you know, the Republicans are very good at making their priorities known, and they’re basically saying ‘if we don’t get a tax cut for the rich, then we’ll shut down the government.’ Democrats should say, well, ‘our top priority is gun control.’ And they should put it up at the top of the agenda and threaten the Republicans right back, that if they don’t act on gun control,” Mr. Cuomo said, not completing the thought before moving on to commentary on the severity of the situation.
“It’s amazing, as the conversation is going on, Brian, this is a societal crisis. It’s been so bad for so long, the American people are almost numb. I think they’re so disgusted with the gridlock in Washington that they don’t even bother to ask the government to do anything any more, because it’s been so incompetent for so long. And, 80,000 deaths since Sandy Hook. I mean, it’s really unbelievable.”
Pressed to answer how congressional Democrats—currently a minority in both the House and Senate—might force their GOP colleagues to agree to new laws on firearms, Mr. Cuomo instead proposed making it a 2016 campaign issue.
“Put a real gun control bill on the table. I would make this presidential [campaign] about gun control, I’d make the congressional races about gun control. I would lean into it, Brian. I don’t think the Democrats should run from it, I know they’re nervous, this is a controversial issue,” he said, asserting that he himself is a gun owner and is not anti-gun. “I want to say to people, as tough as our law is in New York, and it’s one of my proudest accomplishments, I’m not anti-gun. I get it. It’s keeping guns from criminals, mentally ill, etcetera. That’s what the ‘sensible’ means. You can’t give the Republicans the position that gun control means no guns. That’s what the NRA sells. And that scares people in this country. That’s not our position.”
Mr. Cuomo confessed, however, that he could not quantify how many people the SAFE Act had protected—though he maintained the number was considerable.
“I believe in my heart and soul that we have saved lives with that law. I don’t think it’s even close. I mean, these assault weapons have progressed to a point where they have such a capacity to kill. And what the big magazines do is, it’s uninterrupted,” he said. “So a police officer doesn’t even have that moment in time where the person is reloading. Because they don’t have to reload. So I have no doubt—in my heart, I believe we have saved lives. Can I prove that this person would have been a victim without? No.” Speaking on the Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC this morning, the governor touted his success in getting the SAFE Act, short for the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement, passed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. The 2013 law limited the size of bullet magazines, required new background checks and permit renewals and called for the creation of an assault weapons registry—but Mr. Cuomo argued shootings had risen recently in New York City as a consequence of looser restrictions in other states, and mocked the GOP primary preoccupation with illegal immigration over the nation’s southern border.
“Because a state can’t do this on its own. That’s why the federal government has to act. I passed the toughest law. I closed the front door on the state. You—that’s what our law does. The back door is open because of the federal government,” he said.
“And people are getting in the car and driving to Virginia and driving to South Carolina and they’re bringing guns in. That’s why we need federal action,” he continued. “Because by definition, this is an issue a state can’t do on its own. You know, they’re so worried about the border with Mexico. Worry about my state’s borders. I’m not worried about Mexicans coming over my border. I’m worried about assault weapons coming over my border. If you want to protect borders, start by protecting the borders of states, and respect their gun laws.”
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo dialed back the idea of threatening to refuse to pass spending bills needed to keep parts of the government running unless a gun control bill were passed—a tactic Republicans have used on issues like deficit spending and federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
“Just to clarify: I didn’t call for a government shutdown. I said, you know, the Republicans are very good at making their priorities known, and they’re basically saying ‘if we don’t get a tax cut for the rich, then we’ll shut down the government.’ Democrats should say, well, ‘our top priority is gun control.’ And they should put it up at the top of the agenda and threaten the Republicans right back, that if they don’t act on gun control,” Mr. Cuomo said, not completing the thought before moving on to commentary on the severity of the situation.

762,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-chicago-gun-laws-not-as-strict-as-gop-candidates-claim-20151008-story.html,"The mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week thrust the debate over the nation's gun laws to the center of the presidential race. At least some of the Republicans who are running have pointed to Chicago as proof that gun control does not work.The city has a reputation for having some of the country's strictest gun laws but has experienced an increase in homicides and shootings this year, which Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina say proves their point.""You look at Chicago, it's got the toughest gun laws in the United States. You look at other places where they have gun laws that are very tough, they do — generally speaking — worse than anybody else,"" the billionaire businessman Trump said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday.Christie, who is New Jersey's governor, echoed the sentiment Sunday, telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that homicides are up in cities like Chicago and New York, which he said have ""some of the most aggressive gun laws.""But Chicago's gun laws aren't as tough as their reputation suggests. They once were, but courts have overturned or gutted many of them in recent years, forcing a city that once banned handguns and gun shops to allow both.CHICAGO'S VANISHING GUN RESTRICTIONSFormer Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was determined to keep handguns out of residents' hands and he fought every legal challenge to Chicago's gun restrictions during his 22 years in office. But the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a big blow to Chicago's gun laws in 2010 when it struck down the city's handgun ban.Chicago quickly enacted a gun ordinance that proponents said included some of the nation's toughest regulations, but the city was forced to scrap some of the provisions that most angered gun rights advocates.Then, after a federal appeals court struck down Illinois' last-in-the-nation concealed carry ban in 2012, gun rights advocates took aim at Chicago's decades-old ban on gun stores. The city lost that fight, too, and last year passed an ordinance allowing gun stores.WHERE ARE TODAY'S GUNS COMING FROM?No gun store has opened in the city yet. That means that every gun owned legally or illegally came from somewhere else. Just how many is unclear, but Chicago's police department seizes more illegal weapons than any other in the nation — nearly 20 a day for a total of 5,500 so far this year.Mayor Rahm Emanuel released a report that blames gun sales elsewhere for much of Chicago's street violence.It said nearly 60 percent of recovered guns used to commit crimes in Chicago from 2009 through 2013 were first sold in states with more lax gun laws. Neighboring Indiana was the biggest source, with 19 percent of all recovered guns having been sold there first. But they came from far and wide, with Mississippi second at 6.7 percent.Just days ago, a Chicago man was sentenced to nearly three years in prison after pleading guilty to helping purchase 43 firearms from gun shows and individuals in Indiana to sell on Chicago's South Side.Several Chicago residents filed a lawsuit this summer against three suburbs, accusing them of lax oversight of local gun shops that they say have been an easy source of weapons for criminals who bring guns into the city.CRIME, BUT ENOUGH PUNISHMENT?Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy often complains that people arrested for possession of illegal guns don't stay locked up for long.McCarthy, who spent most of his career on New York City's police force, notes that former Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was sentenced to 20 months in prison after he accidentally shot himself in the leg with an illegal gun. By contrast, he says the sentences meted out in Chicago courtrooms are typically no more than six months.An analysis by the Chicago Sun-Times bolsters McCarthy's argument that courts in Cook County, where Chicago is located, aren't nearly as tough on illegal gun possession as they might be. For example, the mandatory minimum prison sentence for illegal gun possession in New York is 3½ years, but such a conviction in Cook County carries a minimum sentence of a year in prison and judges stick to that minimum term most of the time, the paper found.Two years ago, several black Illinois lawmakers blocked a bill backed by McCarthy and Emanuel that would have imposed stiffer prison sentences on those convicted of illegal gun possession. The lawmakers viewed it as a recipe to lock up more blacks and Latinos.

This is the second ranking executive officer of the state. Remember that as you read what he says. Tennessee Republican Lieutenant Governor Ron RamseyCredit: YouTube Conservatives have scrambled to connect nearly every recent event to a larger trend of Christian persecution. Now obviously, terror groups like ISIS have singled out Christians for persecution in places like Iraq and Libya but somehow America’s religious right has inserted themselves into the mix to paint themselves as victims of a broader attack against the faith. Call it the Kim Davis complex. The Tennessean first flagged Ramsey’s Facebook post, which links to a New York Post article titled “Oregon gunman singled out Christians during rampage.” There are reports that the 28-year-old man who opened fire at Umpqua Community College on Wednesday, killing nine people and wounding seven more, asked the victims if they were Christians before shooting those who affirmatively answered in the head and shooting those who said no or denied to respond in the leg.

It came after the movie theater massacre in Lafayette, Louisiana, in July that left two dead and nine injured, which came after the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, in June that killed nine. There have been plenty of others. They just didn’t make national news. Through it all, Congress has done nothing about gun violence. The last time lawmakers acted was in April 2013, when the Senate failed to pass a bill tightening background checks on gun sales. The Huffington Post got to thinking: Is there a level of violence that would cause a lawmaker to reconsider his or her opposition to gun control bills? A mass shooting every week? Another attack on an elementary school, this time in his or her home state? On Tuesday, HuffPost posed the question to nine senators who voted against the 2013 background checks bill. Most didn’t really want to talk about it. “That’s a hypothetical question,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “I take every case based on the evidence before me, not speculation. I’m not going to … Some years ago I read the fine print on one of the common anti-depressant drugs.  It said that 1 person in 10,000 users would become psychotic.  Given the wide-spread consumption of these drugs, that is enough to produce a steady stream of mass shootings.  Yes, we need to do something about guns, particularly the ones (mostly AR-15 clones) that feed violent fantasies. What about these terribly violent television shows and more importantly (maybe) the violent internet or just computer games which have graphically violent content? these are what I see as a cause of the mindset of violence in America. It starts with football and other violent sports and escalates to violent games and shows which all reminds me of ancient Rome and the violent games of that empire. I think the American Empire creates this atmosphere of violence upon itself to encourage the violent thinking of our youth. They should all be banned: TV violence, game violence, and gun violence would… Read more » I firmly believe that nothing will be done unless a family member of a so-called representative is the victim of gun violence. The 2nd amendment to the Constitution is a failed social experiment. The only answer to gun violence is repeal of the 2nd amendment.",2015-10-07 05:36:31,"Despite Mass Shootings, Republicans Won’t Touch Gun Laws",,300516,http://www.schwartzreport.net/

I am particularly offended by the arguments put forward by the no gun control community. They are all based in denial and break down to basically two themes: Stuff happens, you can’t stop it, and the good guy with a gun fantasy. So I went looking for some research on what actually does happen when a country tries to get control of guns and mass murders. Here is a good accounting of what happened in Australia and Britain, written by someone competent to make such an assessment. People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon October 1, 2015. A gunman opened fire at a community college in southwest Oregon on Thursday, killing nine people and wounding seven others before police shot him to death, authorities said, in the latest mass killing to rock an American campus. Credit:Reuters/Steve Dipaola In his speech after the shooting at a community college in Oregon in which nine people died and seven were injured, US president Barack Obama acknowledged that the failure to pass meaningful gun laws has been the most frustrating and disappointing aspect of his entire presidency. He contrasted the US to Great Britain and Australia, noting that America was the only developed nation that had failed to pass “common sense gun safety laws – even in the face of repeated mass killings”. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours – Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. In the stark light of this judgement, it is worth revisiting what laws We need to do a lot more than just ban guns, obviously. We need to tackle the mindset which makes a person want to use the weapon, no matter what the type. Early meditation classes like Stephan and I, myself, have encouraged would do a great deal to start changing people’s minds starting at an early age to become more tolerant of each other and be less fearful in general. Teaching a person to “KNOW THYSELF” would encourage everyone to stop and think before doing any wrongdoing.",2015-10-07 05:35:21,Obama on US shootings: What Gun Laws Worked in Australia and Britain?,,300516,http://www.schwartzreport.net/

(Fox) Thursday’s gun massacre in Oregon occurred three days before the Sunday shows, so it was old news to many of them this week. Move along, move along, they seemed to say. There’s nothing to see here.
Most obvious at this approach was “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace, which gave eight minutes to the story in the last quarter of a one-hour show.
Dismissing President Obama’s plea for sane gun-safety measure, Fox panelist Brit Hume said of the President that confiscation of firearms “is the kind of control he likes.”
“What common-sense measures does he mean?” Mr. Hume said. “It’s a quixotic mission.”
It got only slightly better on ABC’s “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos during his interview with Presidential candidate Donald Trump, the leader in the Republican Presidential polls.
“He’s a great divider,” Mr. Trump said of the President. “. . . This kind of crime has taken place forever . . . that’s the way the world goes . .. . the gun laws have nothing to do with it.”
Later, panelist Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post offered a more realistic reaction.
“I have two daughters on college campuses,” she said. “I watch these things and I am terrified.”
In Thursday’s shooting spree on a community college campus, at least 10 persons died, including the gunman, who owned 13 legal firearms.
Mark Leibovich, a New York Times writer on NBC’s “Meet the Press” with Chuck Todd, said guns laws don’t change due to the opposition of the National Rifle Association.
“The NRA pretty much owns more than half of Congress,” he said.
On this notion, the best comment came from Jonathan Alter, who appeared on MSNBC on Al Sharpton’s “Politics Nation,” which has been moved from weekdays at 6 p.m. to Sunday only at 8 a.m.
Alter said he had written on the web site The Daily Beast that the President should debate on national television against Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice-president of the NRA.
“This is a nation that only responds to drama on live television,” Mr. Alter said, predicting that Mr. Obama would “clean the clock” of the man who represents gun dealers under the guise of Second Amendment “rights.”
On CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper, a guest was Mark Kelly, the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a mass shooting.
“We sell 40 per cent of our guns without a background check,” he said.
Also treating the issue seriously was Mr. Todd, who noted there have been 294 mass shootings (four or more victims) this year. Then he played clips from Republican Presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ben Carson.
“Criminals don’t follow gun laws,” said Mr. Rubio, a Republican U.S. Senator from Florida.
“It doesn’t work for crazies,” Dr. Carson said.
Perhaps the most unintentionally honest line came from Howard Kurtz on “Media Buzz” on Fox. He concluded a gun-safety conversation with “There is no magic bullet.”
Otherwise, most of the shows included a mishmash of recent events, including the statement of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-California), who may have jeopardized his chance to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House by implying that the Benghazi investigation of four murders in Libya is merely a political ploy to hurt Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State.
Mr. Hume on Fox suggested Mr. McCarthy has given the Democrats and Ms. Clinton “a shillelagh they can beat the Republicans over the head with ad infinitum.”
Perhaps that’s why Fox gave so much time to an interview with Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) who challenged Mr. McCarthy after Mr. McCarthy’s accidental truth-telling.
He said his colleagues have told him “Please, Jason, do this.” Curiously, Fox avoided discussing Mr. Chaffetz’s kangaroo court last week in which he led a committee chorus of Congressional hecklers against Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood.
On another of the week’s major issues – Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war – Mr. Trump on ABC said something insightful that may have been overlooked among his continual bluster.
He referred to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by President George Bush, a mistake causing much of the current Mideast disruption.
“This country screwed up the Middle East so badly by breaking up Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “We have so destabilized the Mideast. It’s a mess.”
Like the chimpanzee with the typewriter who occasionally spells a real word, Mr. Trump from time to time actually says things that make sense. He makes enemies of people like Rand Paul, the Republican Presidential candidate and U.S. senator from Kentucky.
“I just don’t believe he’s a true conservative,” Mr. Paul said of Mr.Trump on “Media Buzz.” “Being for higher taxes. Being for a single payer health system. Those aren’t conservative notions.” He suggested that Mr. Trump is a “fake conservative” and that “there are some clownish things he has said.”
One of them may have been in answer to the American plan to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees. Mr. Trump compared it to a “Trojan Horse” that could allow terrorists into the U.S. On another issue, Mr. Trump, who proposed a new tax system last week, refused to disclose his own tax rate. “I’m not going to say,” Mr. Trump said.
On Rev. Sharpton’s show, Ms. Clinton said of Mr. Trump: “He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia. He’s been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it’s dangerous. His demagoguery is no longer amusing.”
Bur Mr. Leibovich said on NBC: “Anyone who is dismissive of Donald Trump at this point – particularly the media – is an idiot.” Most obvious at this approach was “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace, which gave eight minutes to the story in the last quarter of a one-hour show.

“This is a nation that only responds to drama on live television,” Mr. Alter said, predicting that Mr. Obama would “clean the clock” of the man who represents gun dealers under the guise of Second Amendment “rights.”
On CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper, a guest was Mark Kelly, the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a mass shooting.
“We sell 40 per cent of our guns without a background check,” he said.
Also treating the issue seriously was Mr. Todd, who noted there have been 294 mass shootings (four or more victims) this year. Then he played clips from Republican Presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ben Carson.
“Criminals don’t follow gun laws,” said Mr. Rubio, a Republican U.S. Senator from Florida.
“It doesn’t work for crazies,” Dr. Carson said.
Perhaps the most unintentionally honest line came from Howard Kurtz on “Media Buzz” on Fox. He concluded a gun-safety conversation with “There is no magic bullet.”
Otherwise, most of the shows included a mishmash of recent events, including the statement of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-California), who may have jeopardized his chance to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House by implying that the Benghazi investigation of four murders in Libya is merely a political ploy to hurt Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State.
Mr. Hume on Fox suggested Mr. McCarthy has given the Democrats and Ms. Clinton “a shillelagh they can beat the Republicans over the head with ad infinitum.”
Perhaps that’s why Fox gave so much time to an interview with Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) who challenged Mr. McCarthy after Mr. McCarthy’s accidental truth-telling.
He said his colleagues have told him “Please, Jason, do this.” Curiously, Fox avoided discussing Mr. Chaffetz’s kangaroo court last week in which he led a committee chorus of Congressional hecklers against Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood.
On another of the week’s major issues – Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war – Mr. Trump on ABC said something insightful that may have been overlooked among his continual bluster.
He referred to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by President George Bush, a mistake causing much of the current Mideast disruption.
“This country screwed up the Middle East so badly by breaking up Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “We have so destabilized the Mideast. It’s a mess.”
Like the chimpanzee with the typewriter who occasionally spells a real word, Mr. Trump from time to time actually says things that make sense. He makes enemies of people like Rand Paul, the Republican Presidential candidate and U.S. senator from Kentucky.
“I just don’t believe he’s a true conservative,” Mr. Paul said of Mr.Trump on “Media Buzz.” “Being for higher taxes. Being for a single payer health system. Those aren’t conservative notions.” He suggested that Mr. Trump is a “fake conservative” and that “there are some clownish things he has said.”
One of them may have been in answer to the American plan to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees. Mr. Trump compared it to a “Trojan Horse” that could allow terrorists into the U.S. On another issue, Mr. Trump, who proposed a new tax system last week, refused to disclose his own tax rate. “I’m not going to say,” Mr. Trump said.
On Rev. Sharpton’s show, Ms. Clinton said of Mr. Trump: “He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia. He’s been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it’s dangerous. His demagoguery is no longer amusing.”
Bur Mr. Leibovich said on NBC: “Anyone who is dismissive of Donald Trump at this point – particularly the media – is an idiot.” Later, panelist Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post offered a more realistic reaction.
“I have two daughters on college campuses,” she said. “I watch these things and I am terrified.”
In Thursday’s shooting spree on a community college campus, at least 10 persons died, including the gunman, who owned 13 legal firearms.
Mark Leibovich, a New York Times writer on NBC’s “Meet the Press” with Chuck Todd, said guns laws don’t change due to the opposition of the National Rifle Association.
“The NRA pretty much owns more than half of Congress,” he said.

“I just don’t believe he’s a true conservative,” Mr. Paul said of Mr.Trump on “Media Buzz.” “Being for higher taxes. Being for a single payer health system. Those aren’t conservative notions.” He suggested that Mr. Trump is a “fake conservative” and that “there are some clownish things he has said.”
One of them may have been in answer to the American plan to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees. Mr. Trump compared it to a “Trojan Horse” that could allow terrorists into the U.S. On another issue, Mr. Trump, who proposed a new tax system last week, refused to disclose his own tax rate. “I’m not going to say,” Mr. Trump said.
On Rev. Sharpton’s show, Ms. Clinton said of Mr. Trump: “He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia. He’s been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it’s dangerous. His demagoguery is no longer amusing.”
Bur Mr. Leibovich said on NBC: “Anyone who is dismissive of Donald Trump at this point – particularly the media – is an idiot.” “This is a nation that only responds to drama on live television,” Mr. Alter said, predicting that Mr. Obama would “clean the clock” of the man who represents gun dealers under the guise of Second Amendment “rights.”
On CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper, a guest was Mark Kelly, the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a mass shooting.
“We sell 40 per cent of our guns without a background check,” he said.
Also treating the issue seriously was Mr. Todd, who noted there have been 294 mass shootings (four or more victims) this year. Then he played clips from Republican Presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ben Carson.
“Criminals don’t follow gun laws,” said Mr. Rubio, a Republican U.S. Senator from Florida.
“It doesn’t work for crazies,” Dr. Carson said.
Perhaps the most unintentionally honest line came from Howard Kurtz on “Media Buzz” on Fox. He concluded a gun-safety conversation with “There is no magic bullet.”
Otherwise, most of the shows included a mishmash of recent events, including the statement of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-California), who may have jeopardized his chance to succeed John Boehner as Speaker of the House by implying that the Benghazi investigation of four murders in Libya is merely a political ploy to hurt Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State.
Mr. Hume on Fox suggested Mr. McCarthy has given the Democrats and Ms. Clinton “a shillelagh they can beat the Republicans over the head with ad infinitum.”
Perhaps that’s why Fox gave so much time to an interview with Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) who challenged Mr. McCarthy after Mr. McCarthy’s accidental truth-telling.
He said his colleagues have told him “Please, Jason, do this.” Curiously, Fox avoided discussing Mr. Chaffetz’s kangaroo court last week in which he led a committee chorus of Congressional hecklers against Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood.
On another of the week’s major issues – Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war – Mr. Trump on ABC said something insightful that may have been overlooked among his continual bluster.
He referred to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by President George Bush, a mistake causing much of the current Mideast disruption.

On Rev. Sharpton’s show, Ms. Clinton said of Mr. Trump: “He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia. He’s been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it’s dangerous. His demagoguery is no longer amusing.”
Bur Mr. Leibovich said on NBC: “Anyone who is dismissive of Donald Trump at this point – particularly the media – is an idiot.” On another of the week’s major issues – Russian involvement in the Syrian civil war – Mr. Trump on ABC said something insightful that may have been overlooked among his continual bluster.
He referred to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by President George Bush, a mistake causing much of the current Mideast disruption.
“This country screwed up the Middle East so badly by breaking up Iraq,” Mr. Trump said. “We have so destabilized the Mideast. It’s a mess.”
Like the chimpanzee with the typewriter who occasionally spells a real word, Mr. Trump from time to time actually says things that make sense. He makes enemies of people like Rand Paul, the Republican Presidential candidate and U.S. senator from Kentucky.
“I just don’t believe he’s a true conservative,” Mr. Paul said of Mr.Trump on “Media Buzz.” “Being for higher taxes. Being for a single payer health system. Those aren’t conservative notions.” He suggested that Mr. Trump is a “fake conservative” and that “there are some clownish things he has said.”

UPDATE (10/02): As the New York Times reports, the man behind Thursday's mass shooting in Oregon was a 26-year-old named Chris Harper Mercer. An alleged campus gunman is dead after going on a horrific shooting spree at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon on Thursday. The New York Times reports ten people were killed and seven wounded. Earlier Thursday, a state police spokesperson told VICE the suspect was in custody, leaving the exact timing and nature of his death unclear. According to the Douglas County Sheriff's Office, the shooting was called in to 9-1-1 around 10:38 AM Oregon time. Local news outlets reported that the shooting occurred in the campus's science building, Snyder Hall. Reuters reported at 12:45 PM local time that Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco had briefed President Obama on the shooting. Obama went on to give a press conference on Thursday evening calling for tougher gun laws. ""Each time this happens I'm going to bring this up,"" he said. ""Each time this happens I am going to say we can actually do something about it."" An 18-year-old witness named Kortney Moore spoke to the News Review on Thursday afternoon, saying the shooter asked people in her writing class to state their religion before opening fire. She also said that the teacher of that class was one of the victims, suffering a gunshot to the head. Former Attorney General Eric Holder was among the first major figures in politics to broach the topic of gun control in the aftermath of this shooting when he tweeted, ""Now Oregon. We weep again as a nation. Is the answer to our gun violence epidemic to do nothing? Again? Come on America! We solve problems."" This post has been updated throughout. Follow Mike Pearl on Twitter.

768,http://www.vice.com/read/why-the-media-shouldnt-name-mass-shooters-over-and-over-again-1002,"The 294th mass shooting in America this year happened Thursday in Oregon at Umpqua Community College. A 26-year-old man with six guns killed nine people and wounded several more. I'm not including his name because he doesn't deserve to be named or remembered—he deserves only to be forgotten. Local Sheriff John Hanlin said as much on television: ""I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought."" This man deserves to be erased from history while we mourn and remember and celebrate the victims and the survivors. But so many of us already know his name because journalists are talking about him and his past with family, friends, and mental health professionals. They do this with the best of intentions, of course: Something horrific has happened and people are hungry to learn who did it, and why. It's instinctual—it's human nature—to ask these questions, and it's part of the news media's most basic relationship with the public to try to provide answers. But in naming mass killers over and over and showing their pictures day after day and diving deep into their personal history, are we journalists somehow aiding and abetting these horrible people? For over three years I co-anchored the 3 PM hour at MSNBC, and in that time we covered more mass shootings than I can remember. Over time, I began to wonder what impact I was having. Was I somehow making things worse? Journalists cannot pretend to be a simple window on the world—we are a camera and we impact the world by the things we choose to focus on and how we crop the images. I think it was while covering my fifth or sixth mass shooting that we had on a psychologist who told us that the media figures are often unwitting partners for these killers—they feel left out of society and plan a spectacularly horrific killing that lets them go out in a blaze that they know will be memorialized on TV; they know their name and their image will be wallpapered across the internet for days, if not years. They'll join the roll call of infamous mass killers, a list many troubled young men have memorized. As the expert shrink explained all of that, I realized that I could no longer participate in saying the names of these deranged mass killers over and again because that meant I was participating in the last part of their plan. There is a tricky set of issues for journalists here—news cannot function if fully draped in advocacy or activism, and there is a basic human need for information that we must fulfill. It is necessary to report the name of the killer within 24 hours of the incident—that's part of news media's basic contract with the public. But, for me, after that initial period, repeatedly naming the killer and showing his picture and diving into his background means providing a sort of celebrity for America's worst sort of losers—a perverse sort of fame that they covet. It means participating in a kind of killer porn that draws viewers in but does not truly inform them. The narrative is almost always the same: His classmates say he was a loner. His family says he had mental issues. He acquired the gun legally so no laws could've stopped this. He had a lot of anger toward the world. Meanwhile, somewhere the next boy is watching and dreaming of his face and his name acid raining down on America. When we covered the 2014 shooting at Ft. Hood, which was my seventh or eighth shooting—or maybe it was my ninth—I vowed to be different. I refused to say the killer's name after the first day. I refused to name past killers; I'd just refer to the cities they happened in. And I asked that we do more about the victims and less about the background of the killer. I couldn't be part of some maniac's plan. When the press trains its lens on the life story of the killer, that casts the situation as a personal failing, as something that one individual unleashed. But the situation is also one that sits in the midst of a slew of societal issues. Fixating too deeply on the biography of a killer nudges us away from discussing the American problems that fuel these killings—the prevalence of guns, and the ease with which almost anyone can get one, and the way the NRA and Congress protect gun manufacturers from responsibility for how their products are being used. When we cover mass shootings without discussing America's troubled relationship with guns, we are covering a tree and ignoring the forest all around it. The media can serve America better by talking less about these killers, by naming them less often, by not making them into perverse sorts of celebrities—by erasing them. That alone would not stop mass killings, but it would serve the public better. Follow Toure on Twitter.

Republican Kevin McCarthy announced he wants to remain majority leader and not be speaker of the House… The GOP just can’t get Benghazi right. At this point, what difference does it make? Hello. They proved they can nominate someone worse than Boehner. Hopefully they can get serious now. Uber has apparently responded by recruiting more drivers and offering discounts to new riders. UNFAIR PRACTICES. Customer discounts? Ruinous competition! More drivers – more criminals who will murder even more passengers than up to now! Because that’s what Uber is, criminal enabling app! Raping and killing all your customers seems like a bad business model but, hey, Uber appears to be making it work. STEVE SMITH run Uber? STEVE SMITH DRIVE UBER, AND SOMETIMES LYFT!!! STEVE SMITH DRIVE NEAR REI AND CABELAS BECAUSE STEVE SMITH LIKE TASTE OF CAMOFLAUGE Pfft, without reams of government regulation and oversight, all companies would rape and kill their customers all the time! Get with the prog-ram. I just drove by what looked like an Uber recruitment fair, in a church parking lot near my house. They even had one of those guys standing on the corner spinning and waving a big sign. There was a small crowd at the table they’d set up. The taxi companies should know when they are beat. Everyone who isn’t a taxi driver hates taxi drivers. Even the mayors of major cities aren’t willing to go to bat for taxi drivers. They’ve literally lost all of their support over the decades by using local laws to carve out comfortable, long-term employment for themselves at the consumers’ expense. I drove by a taxi driver protest a few months back. There were only about a dozen drivers there, marching in a circle with signs. Everyone who passed by either ignored them or flipped them off. They’re done for. The Black Knight should have known when he was beat too. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. The hacks and their owner’s won’t “know” until every relative and loan shark they know has gone broke helping them out. “Police do not believe terrorism is involved.” That’s not what I heard on Twitter. When Oklahoma executed Charles Frederick Warner in January, they used the wrong drugs, according to an autopsy report. It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man… wrongly. Hopefully an appeal will bring him back so Oklahoma can kill him the right way. There’s a Roberta Flack joke in there somewhere. Killing me wrongly with your drugs? Or Huey Lewis I want a new drug…one that will WORK! Damn you Donny Hathaway killed himself by jumping out a hotel window, not by drug overdose. We should ban hotel windows. it hasn’t stopped the enterprising Chinese sweatshop worker from what i read “When Oklahoma executed Charles Frederick Warner in January, they used the wrong drugs, ” *raises hand* What ARE the right drugs? They should just buy whatever they are prescribing in California. Weed seems like a tough way to kill a man. We won’t know until it happens for the first time. Marihuana kills, yo. I’m guessing he also liked the buttsex. If you ask Nicole “Quaaludes” I wish it wasn’t behind a paywall, but just last night I was reading a scholarly article that was a cognitive-based critique of the sociocultural understanding of second language acquisition (e.g., Lantoff and company) in which the author employed, just out of nowhere, an extended analogy concerning the “not even wrong” concept that involved a discussion comparing the arguments of two fictional people, in which one believed AIDS was caused by the HIV virus and the other by the inhalation of poppers. I really can’t do it justice…you just had to read it. A whole heck of a lot of morphine. State of Oklahoma, where’s my finder’s fee??? You misunderstand. Thse monkeys are too incompetent to mix up solid KCl in the right dilution. They have to have it pre-mixed. They ordered Potassium Acetate FFS. Worse than that, the mistake went unnoticed and they utilized it. what the hell is wrong with not killing him? Heroin overdose. Go out happy. I don’t think pharmacies stock that, but yeah, morphine. And then something to stop the heart. But the whole point is the actually try to avoid using opiates because those sadistic bastards want the condemned to feel pain. Now, the courts take a dim view of that so they have to use some sedation. I should not have to write this, but I have no sympathy for murders, etc. OTOH, given the prevalence of false convictions I think we ought to err on the side of caution here. But in the end I do not trust the state with this type of power and feel we ought to stop executing. Except maybe corrupt politicians. So out with the needle and in with the woodchippers? Gets my vote. Crack is whack! …in fact, a monkey on your back, so get your mother off the crack! What ARE the right drugs? Rule 303 They used the wrong sodium-whatchacallit U.S. officials say Russian missiles aimed at targets in Syria have landed in Iran, instead. Doesn’t Russia have easier ways delivering arms to Iran? Apparently a couple of cruise missiles crashed as they traversed iran on their way to Syria. Doesn’t sound like a big deal. Probably either a malfunction or perhaps shot down by small arms fire. More interesting is the Turkish assertion that Russia has not been hitting ISIS/ISIL targets, but rather is almost exclusively targeting Syrian opposition groups that are supported by the western coalition (primarily the US CIA). So the question is, why? Is it because they don’t view ISIS as an effective threat to Assad? Or is it because US support is the real sin that Putin wants to punish? Or is it because ISIS is a thorn in the side of the US? Or is it just that Turkey isn’t right about that? Demolish the the groups with US support, then you can cast the situation as Assad vs ISIS. The US is not going to come in on the side of ISIS, so Assad will remain in power. So the question is, why? Is it because they don’t view ISIS as an effective threat to Assad? Probably. Russia doesn’t really give a shit about ISIS, they just want to keep Assad in power in order to protect their interests (namely, their Syrian naval base, which is the only one they have on the Med). Mostly, US is hitting ISIS already, so why bother? That ISIS is horrifying is quite helpful, leave them as the sole alternative, and the regime looks really good to everyone. Well, its not like Turkey has been doing a whole lot of hitting of ISIS sites – they’re more concerned with shooting at the PKK. “Doesn’t Russia have easier ways delivering arms to Iran?” Oh, I definitely think this is not only the best way to do it, but easier also. Hell, all they have to do is push a few buttons. What good is a super expensive weapons delivery system if you aren’t going to use it? From the article: “Execution team members considered trying to save his life and even taking Lockett to an emergency room before he finally died, 43 minutes after his initial injection.” Ummm… You’re doing it wrong? What, there wasn’t a pillow in the room? +1 cuckoo’s nest Ah, Juicy Fruit What are you doin’ here? You oughta be out in a convertible bird-doggin’ chicks and bangin’ beaver. “Shane, bring Mommy a pillow.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCv7xjcaIt4 shameless Shaaaaaane, come baaaaaack! I hope someone uploaded the Yakety Sax version of this. Man, that just feels right. Doing CPR on a death row inmate should ALWAYS have a soundtrack. One of the men credited with stopping a mass shooting on a train in France was stabbed in an incident in Sacramento. Known as the Zimmerman Phenomenon. the Zimmerman Phenomenon Wasn’t that an episode of The Big Bang Theory? I think it was the Zimmermann Telegram. Is that when Bob told Donovan what he really thought of his schtick? It’s aaallll overr now, baby blue …….. Remember, his compatriot in France is an alumn of Umpqua Community College, so… I think it’s safe to say these men are a swirling vortex of tragedy and drama. It’s real-life Final Destination. Some Chicago taxis went on strike today to protest Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s budget proposal that would allow ride-sharing services to get fares at the airports. Uber has apparently responded by recruiting more drivers and offering discounts to new riders. Good for them, protecting consumers like that. …such as guests who apparently smeared charcoal on their foreheads to darken their faces. I blame Mad Max: Fury Road. I blame the Russians You mean Mad Max: Libertopia? I can only imagine what they would think of Silver Streak. Recently watched that movie for the first time in many years. That scene would never fly today. Pity, since it’s genuinely funny and is far more insulting to whites than Blacks. Good movie. I can only imagine what Richard Pryor would think of all the “That’s not funny!” types who have taken over the culture. I can imagine him telling them all to go fuck themselves “Bill, have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.” Eddie Murphy skit about Pryor & Cosby. I don’t think they’d dare start any of this shit while he was alive. I find that botched execution incredibly depressing. On the bright side, at least that guy isn’t practicing medicine in a hospital somewhere. AMA doesn’t allow its members to participate in executions, so this is all done by Department of Corrections staff. Including choosing the drugs. See? On the bright side! When Oklahoma executed Charles Frederick Warner in January, they used the wrong drugs, according to an autopsy report. The same thing apparently almost happened in Richard Glossip’s case, which is why his execution has been stayed Talk about a bad trip. “U.S. officials say Russian missiles aimed at targets in Syria have landed in Iran, instead. Keep in mind these two countries are not even neighbors, separated by Iraq.’ The missiles were fired from ships in the Caspian Sea It makes more sense when you look at a map. Bearing was right, range was wrong. Happens all the time. I’m sure Iran will happily accept compensation for any damages in the form of military hardware. But 4 out of 26 missed the country they were aiming at. So much for Russian pin-point precision weaponry. Pretty sure they hit nothing but dirt. Russian weapons suck…when they misfire no one dies but some rabbit in some middle eastern desert. When American weapons miss they kill NGO aid doctors and burn patients in their beds. Of the initial 26-missile volley, the officials said, four went awry and hit northern Iran, according to technical sources of information like satellite imagery. Mr. Konashenkov said sarcastically that if the reports were true, “we would have to admit that the sites of the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria, located far apart from one another, just blew up on their own.” Man, the Russians are bad at this. The claim wasn’t that they all went awry, just four. Russia’s responding to the claims they WISH had been made… Did anyone else think that Russian missiles had landed in a place called Iran, Oklahoma? I thought shit just got real. It’s just Oklahoma They probably didn’t even hit anything. WOLVERINES! I was about to round up my brother and C.Thomas Howell and head into the mountains. Don’t forget Lea Thompson Okay, so executions are done in prisons or near prisons right? Denying prisoners pain medication would violate Doctor’s oaths to do no harm correct? Morphine overdoses is how medics gave soldiers mercy kills on the battlefield. Go downstairs to the infirmary. Grab morphine shot. Overdose inmate in execution chamber. Painless for the inmate with little chance of untrained folks fucking it up. Can’t be denied by drug companies without denying pain medication to all inmates. Problem solved all around. “But that’s not in the procedure!” They’re not supposed to enjoy it, dude. No doctors, see above. “Yeah boss, I went and checked. All we can come up with is a half gallon of bleach, a pint or so of acetone, some toilet bowl cleaner and a half pot of Warty’s coffee. We’re good to go!” Bullets are cheaper. Same effect. Or a captive bolt gun. The pretense of humane executions is ridiculous. For the record, I don’t think the government should have the authority to kill outside of declared war. This is the salient point. “Humane” mostly means “not messy and disgusting and likely to get the death penalty outlawed”. If “quick and painless and absolutely sure” were the sole criteria then putting them out with a sedative and then hitting them with a bolt gun would do quite nicely. I’ve advocated (tongue in cheek) for the use of the same method used in the egg industry for male chicks. They toss them into a meat grinder. They are completely macerated in less than a second. I’m quite sure you could adapt an industrial shredder of some sort to chop up a human body in less than a tenth of a second. Put ’em out and drop ’em in that thing. SPLAT! Guaranteed 100% painless, 100% successful and instantaneous. If you reject that one out of hand, then you are really only worried about optics. So you might as well jump on over to my side and oppose killing, full stop. IMO only one method beats the guillotine: popping a nuclear device over the condemned person’s head. Being blown to molecules in microseconds must be the ultimate way to exit. The pretense of humane executions is ridiculous. Not a fan of the Death Penalty, but I’ve never understood the need for it to be humane. It’s all about revenge so shouldn’t it be as horrible and painful as possible, like what their victims endured? And wouldn’t it be a better deterrent for would-be killers to know they faced a 12-hour torture session for their crime rather than get to fall asleep with a painless injection? It’s all about revenge so shouldn’t it be as horrible and painful as possible Nope, some people just need to be put down, we don’t torture the dog that has a tendency to bite. Nor should we torture the Lennie Smalls of the world, neither understands deterrence but sometimes all’s well that ends well- and quickly. Yeah, I was complaining about this below. It’s absurd that they make executions so difficult. Denying prisoners pain medication would violate Doctor’s oaths to do no harm correct? It is cute that you think that modern doctors take the Hippocratic Oath.

You’ll make Bob Stoops appear! +1 genital cuff I go to nude beaches to read the articles. Apropos of the articles, I got a postcard from Playboy offering me an annual subscription at a discounted rate. The funny thing is that I was chosen because I belonged to their “preferred demographics.” Internet illiterate? Hmmm. Do you have a Playboy branded MasterCard? Ha. There’s a bit of a long story behind it but because of my father a considerable number of print advertisers think I’m old enough to be a retiree. Getting an AARP letter on my 30th birthday hurt. Asian? Well, in my case the “preferred demographics” apparently means gay. I skipped over that one. I have been shamed. I’m surprised you’re capable of shame. “His incredible story, which should have ended with Stone being shot in the head, ” I thought this was written by Sheldon Richman for a second Ah Wants Mah Monays = One of the richest guys who gives the worst investment advice sues his own company for…. ah, forget it.

That’s an odd venue for that amount of money… Isn’t that what California’s trial level courts are called? Where else would it be heard? Federal Court, presumably, if for no reason other than diversity. Harry Reid suing exercise company for his injuries It calls the elastic resistive exercise band, the TheraBand, defective and unreasonably dangerous, particularly for the elderly, who might have trouble gripping it without handles. The lawsuit alleges negligence, liability and failure to warn consumers about “dangers that may result from the use or foreseeable misuse” of the Theraband. Or perhaps a bathroom is not the best place to do your exercise. It’s where I do my best squats. Harry Reid should sue his mother for all that drinking she did while she was pregnant with him. I would loooooove to be the defense attorney in charge of discovery. Heh. It’s a lot safer suing a rubber band company than the actual mob boss that beat the fuck out of you. mob boss that beat the fuck out of you. Surprised Reid’s not letting this die. Isn’t he concerned the truth will come out if he insists on pushing this? Then again, he asked for a relatively small amount so maybe he hopes they’ll settle rather than go to trial. Or perhaps it was a bad choice on the part of an elderly man who has trouble gripping it without handles. Naw – that would mean it was*your* fault, wouldn’t it Harry? Forget it Jake, Its Frenchy-Town “France’s far-right party targets Muslim vote in Paris region’ Confused? I am. “That may seem counter-intuitive for an anti-immigration party whose leader, Marine Le Pen, will go on trial later this month for comparing Muslim street prayers to wartime Nazi occupation. But it represents just the latest step in the party’s self-declared strategy to “de-demonize” its image.” WTF? It is hoping people in under-privileged suburbs will be attracted by its campaigning on law and order Some of the French banlileues are essentially run under Sharia and the cops don’t even go in. Some of that population may thrive on this, but I suspect many don’t, but there is nothing they can do. So I can sort of see it. France should announce that the welfare budget for immigrants is now capped, and so every new immigrant or child means that everyone’s slice of pie gets a little smaller. Hell, we should do that. Since the new children would be citizens rather than immigrants it wouldn’t exactly do anything. Marine Le Pen, will go on trial later this month for comparing Muslim street prayers to wartime Nazi occupation. I might be Canadian, but it’s things like this that make me want to move to the US. Man refused service at his own pub, returns with bulldozer and flattens it, cops don’t charge him because it’s his A local in the village said: “It was a classic case of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Wealthy shellfish factory owner Swistun invested ?60,000 into the pub along with his business partner Colin McDonald, 59, just a year earlier Well, if anyone would know shellfishness, it’s him. Why didn’t he just fire the barman? Or just walk back and pour himself one….? Well, the barman may be legally obligated to not serve visibly intoxicated people. That’s the prevaling standard in the US. If someone is slurring or having trouble walking straight, they won’t get served. The server can be fined. “Now they’ll have to serve me!” But locals said Swistun left the pub after being refused a drink after the 11pm closing time. So, go behind the bar, get your own damn drink and explain to the staff that if they like their fucking jobs they won’t refuse to serve him again. Years of watching British television tell me that’s not quite how the pub owner/license holder relationship works. I couldn’t actually tell you how it DOES work, but I don’t think they have that kind of direct relationship. Here comes the Biden train.

The interesting thing is that of all three, Clinton had the lowest number of “Don’t Know/Refused”. Everybody has an opinion on her. I still do not understand why execution has to be so difficult. 1) Use standard medical techniques to render unconsciousness. 2) Stop the heart. Neither of those things involves exotic drugs or techniques. Or just bring back firing squads, which could be done remotely, with rifles clamped to stands and pre-aimed. I blame anti-death-penalty people for doing everything they can to make it difficult. It’s deliberate. See above. Why not just give them a morphine overdose….. It is what they use for Euthanasia isn’t it? The non-medical folks ordered the wrong potassium. Figured it didn’t make a difference. Randy Quaid Detained in Canada Like the right-wing french and mulims, I don’t understand this one either. Randy wants to live in Canada.

I LOVE volatility. QUESTION TIME: I’ve had just about enough of DISH TV. Where I live, even if I wanted it, cable is not available. I believe this has been covered before, but- what should I get if I decide to go full tilt streaming? Roku? Also, any suggestions for motorsports? What would be even better than live stream F1 would be on demand races from Days of Yore. Netflix + sling + youtube It’s not perfect, especially for motorsports (no NBCSports), but it’s a start. The new Tivo Bolt looks interesting if you can get OTA broadcasts. I’ve got a Roku 3 and like it a lot. The Roku 4 with 4K just came out as well. I also really like my Roku 3, but I know nothing about streaming motorsports. I am sure you can stream that online, even if illegally. How fast is your internet? U.S. officials say Russian missiles aimed at targets in Syria have landed in Iran, instead. Keep in mind these two countries are not even neighbors, separated by Iraq. But if I recall correctly, they’re firing them from ships based in the Caspian Sea, which means they’re launching them over Iranian airspace to get to Syria. Russian missiles aimed at Targets in Syria Evidently Russians prefer shopping at Wal-Mart… There are theories that Russia is involving themselves in the Syria mess in order to advertise their new weapons. “Our cruise missiles hit the correct country almost 85% of the time!” HBO Now is available on Roku!

I’ve been bamboozled. How fast is your internet? I would definitely have to upgrade from where I am now. Helpful commenters, do you have any tips for dealing with plantar fasciitis? Is a night splint my best bet? The person who recommended the night splint also finds me attractive, so I am not sure if I should believe them. Buy Birkenstocks. The Strassburg sock is what you want to get. When mine flares up, I use the sock for a couple of nights and it goes away. You just have to remember that you have it on when you get up to take a leak. I figured something like that is the direction I should be heading. Thanks. ” plantar fasciitis” I don’t know what that is, and when in doubt, KILL IT WITH FIRE Be a real man and stop jogging. I have flat feet. I hate wearing arch support anything even though I’m supposed to. Stretching and flexing my feet helps. I have collapsed arches so when I flex the arch magically reappears. I don’t run, ever. The elliptical machine and bicycles are my choice of cardio. Walking/hiking is okay. But seriously, fuck running. I’m seriously considering getting one of those marathoner stickers for my car but instead of “26.2” it will say “0.0”. ^This works best, last resort surgery. I am sure not running would help, but I am not going to do that. How do you feel about scraping your flesh with medieval looking medical tools? If that sounds like a hoot (and I’m sure it does) find someone who does Graston. Night splints and stretching/rolling your feet out on a coke bottle, frozen water bottle or a golf ball can help, but people tend to give up as soon as they feel better and then the problem comes back. Do you know if you’ve developed a heel spur (it’ll feel like a small rock is in the heel of your shoe no matter what you do)? I do not think I have a heel spur. The pain is only bad in the morning the day after an intense run, or after I run three or four days in a row. I am avoiding a medical visit partially because my doctor moved away, so I would have to find a new one. I figure I will try the golf ball/night splint for awhile, to see if that works. If the pain continues, or stops being manageable, I will see actual medical professionals. Jogging is the only thing that seems to keep me sane (that’s right, this is sane me), so I would like to keep it up. If you are running three, four days in a row then you probably already know this but – in case you don’t- get good , properly fitted shoes, when I took up running again after a long hiatus I had similar problems tried everything, finally paid a stupid amount of money for shoes and insoles at a store that did all that computer stuff*, and it worked, of course six months later I fell off of a ladder at broke my ankle but, hey, for six months I was running pain free. *only do this once, then buy the same shoes online for a fraction of the cost. 1) get your gait checked at your local running store, and buy the recommended shoes/inserts. At the very least, this should eliminate equipment as the cause. 2) stretch your calves out before running. Spend extra time on them to make sure they’re not tight before you hit the road. 3) I agree with above advice about rolling both your feet and your calves. You want to eliminate muscular issues that cause pf. Get a bike. Also deal with it sooner rather than later. If you end up with a heel spur your options start narrowing to very painful external manipulation or surgery. I also use a longboard skateboard for exercise. It’s pretty fun and in my flat neighborhood I can do a steady 12 mph. I calculate that it’s about a 4:1 mileage ratio for exercise benefit relative to running. Thanks to everyone for their suggestions. The heel spur is what I am worried about, because I know I can deal with the pain (which isn’t that bad, which probably isn’t good either) and I have learned that not dealing with pain, or any medical issue, leads to not good times. Crusty- Do sprint intervals up a big hill that fourth day- run up as fast as possible, walk back down, repeat… Gets you up on your toes, uses different muscles, etc. So, did you hear that they’ve cut the length of the Democratic debates from three hours to two? They decided that it was dangerous to ask elderly people to stand for so long. Thank you, I’ll be here all week! do you have any tips for dealing with plantar fasciitis? Maybe I’m thinking of something else, but isn’t that helped by stretching? (as in manipulating the bones of the foot in relation to one another? Stretching helps, but the main culprit is the overnight healing of the torn muscles in a shortened position. When you get up and stand on the foot the next morning, it tears them again. First time I had it, I thought my foot was broken it hurt so bad. rolling the bottom of my foot with a golf ball or lacrosse ball several times a day. That’s what I was thinking of. Mmm…yeah. Feels good. U.S. officials say Russian missiles aimed at targets in Syria have landed in Iran, instead. Keep in mind these two countries are not even neighbors, separated by Iraq. Lord almighty. Now we’ll have to invade Iran to protect it from the Russians. Hey I found one of those mythical Trump supporters in the wild… Guess what he said? ” [?] Aroteas_Forgehammer 2 points (+5|-3) 20 hours ago Rand Paul is the man. But Trump is even better!” https://voat.co/v/politics/comments/571820 LOLOLOLOLOLOL Let me try and think up some NON-offensive party themes for frats and sororities. …wow, this is taking some time… …still thinking… Oh, yes, a dunking booth with a white guy in it. Or instead of “pin the tail on the donkey,” “pin the blame on the honky.” Ooh, a sorority can do a drunken, half-naked slut-walk at 2 AM in the bad part of town. Nobody would *think* of criticizing that, it would be blaming the victim. Oh, a black *conservative* theme party. They can be as offensive as they want, dressing up as Thomas Sowell and Clarence Thomas, and nobody will mind. Wouldn’t the “wrong drugs’ keep him alive? They can’t be too wrong if they worked.

10.4.2015 11:00 AM The father of the man who murdered nine people at a community college in Oregon last week, who had not seen his son in two years, was dismayed to learn that he owned 14 guns. Police say the killer brought six guns—a rifle and five handguns—with him to Umpqua Community College in Roseburg and left another eight at home. All 14 were legally purchased by the shooter or his relatives. ""How was he able to compile that kind of arsenal?"" the killer's father, Ian Mercer, asked in an interview with CNN yesterday. Calling for stricter gun control, Mercer argued that the mass shooting ""would not have happened"" if his son did not own so many firearms. That claim is debatable, to say the least. The perpetrator of the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, at Virginia Tech in 2007, managed to kill 32 people with just two handguns, and other mass shooters have killed more than nine people with one or two weapons. Furthermore, the policy implications of Mercer's argument are unclear. Enforcing a limit on the total number of guns that any one person could own would require more than limiting the number that could be purchased in a given transaction or a given month (as California, where Mercer lives, does for handguns). It would require registering all 300 million or so guns in the country and keeping track of all transfers—not to mention confiscating guns from people who exceed the limit. That's a pretty tall order, and it is hard to see how it could be reconciled with the Second Amendment. The gun restrictions that the Supreme Court so far has indicated are constitutional have to do with categories of people (such as ""felons and the mentally ill""), categories of firearms (""dangerous and unusual weapons""), and carrying guns in ""sensitive places such as schools and government buildings."" The Court has said nothing, as far as I know, about limits on the number of firearms a person may legally possess, which would require a highly invasive regulatory system that would raise issues under the Fourth and Fifth amendments as well as the Second.

The arguments have already returned that the Second is being misinterpreted and only the state sponsored such as LEO, military and militia should be allowed to possess weapons. I’ve also really grown to despise the articles about how much the Australians hate our “unreasonable” position on guns. Is that supposed to influence my opinion? What is the point of articles like that? Bottom line for me I guess is that as long as I breathe, I will retain and maintain the ability to keep myself safe thank you very much. The point of those articles is to make Australians (and leftist Americans who might be reading) feel “superior” – that is all. During German reunification, and just after, the smug arrogance of the dirt poor and garbage dwelling east Germans was vexing outright baffling to their western counterparts. Apparently, being dirt poor, unambitious and largely ignorant Russian pawns, as well as play-toys of the stazi, made them superior to their bourgeois western counterparts in every conceivable way.. Given how many of them fled to the west at the first opportunity, I don’t think that view was all too common. Well, for the thousands that fled, maybe.. as for the millions that stayed, you might be surprised.. Ossis lived with the brainwashing by a totalitarian dictatorship for 40+ years – cut them some slack. The uber superior smug-douche is the same in those who have convinced that less is more, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is bliss.. it’s quantum in nature, and that was my point.. If Germany was this way, can you imagine what post-unification Korea will be like? It’s a question I’ve often comtemplated. Eventually China will get tired of propping up lil Kim, and the likely result will be reunification with the South. The questions arise: How will South Korea’s economy survive the influx, and and how do you deal with deprogramming such a huge group? The North Koreans will be able to vote when they migrate into the South. Don’t be surprised when they vote in a way that attempts to restore what they just escaped from. Calling East Germany a “totalitarian dictatorship” makes it sound like East Germans were brutally oppressed and overwhelmingly tried to resist the regime. By and large, East Germans generally accepted their government to roughly the same degree as West Germans accepted theirs. To the degree that East Germany eventually became less and less popular, that was less about individual liberties (which Germans generally don’t care much about) but simply because it wasn’t delivering economically. And with that horrible fucking accent as well. I like the accent. Commie.. Germans who say nice things I like it too. Every racing documentary should be done in that accent. I find it especially galling to read the “If you don’t agree with me, you’re not a reasonable person” BS. They’re not American, and Americans are uniquely delusional on this point, so they’re better than Americans, therefore their opinions count for more than Americans’. It’s really very simple. It’s leftist Mad Libs. “We are the only industrialized country in the world that ________________________.” And no, you’re not allowed to fill in “has a corporate tax rate above 30%” or “claims the authority to tax income earned by expatriates”. or has jus solis citizenship or tax corporate profits earned in other countries If you listen to some leftist acquaintances of mine, you would have to come to the conclusion that all of Europe and pretty much every other first world country that is NOT the USA is a paradise in which everyone is happy, healthy, and totally care free, a literal utopia. But for some strange reason, none of those people ever leave this Mad Max style wasteland of the USA for one of these heavens on earth. I don’t get it. You forgot to mention all the children, standing on the hilltops, laughing and flying their kites. A bizarre college student formulation (yes, clich? I know) I recall was that we treat all of these other countries horribly. I asked what are all of these students from those other countries doing here, if we are so horrible? The response: “They pay a lot of money to come here!” QED, I guess. I’m sure some Australians hate it. But let me share an anecdote from another gun-control country. We just had a new postdoc start coming from the UK. She is really interested in buying a gun and can’t wait to go shooting. She was a little weirded out that she could enter a gun raffle at the local fair, but she enthusiastically did so. My guess? Most Brits/Australians/whoever don’t shit their pants about guns, they just don’t care as much as many Americans. It’s a minority that really want to get rid of all guns in any country. note a lot of people from gun controlled countries will go to a gun range as soon as they get to America. This place is across the street from a hotel I stayed at in Brisbane in 2012. I suspect more Aussies than this guy like guns. Didn’t someone a while ago post a like to an article in an Aussie paper about an increase in gun ownership in New South Wales? One the other hand, on my last trip to Australia an Aussie lectured me about guns in America and how “even though we don’t own guns we can make the government do what we want. We get all pissed off and they listen!” I somehow managed to not laugh at him. Well, I hate Australians’ unreasonable willingness to be disarmed. That’s really the amazing thing as far as I can see. That so many countries have been so willing and even enthusiastic about being disarmed. They must see themselves as subjects rather than free citizens, or something. I just can’t understand that mentality. +1 pair of invisible shackles Australia did start out as a prison colony. OTOH “Those who do not learn history…” what makes LEO’s so special? Their habitual killing of unarmed black men? If so, why not let the Crips possess weapons as well? Must be the dog shooting. No one needs more than 7 or 8 safes of guns. Maybe a couple of buried vaults, too. And let’s say no more than 100,000 rounds, too. no more than 100,000 rounds For each weapon. Well, it depends. 10,000 might be enough for a single shot or double-barrel gun. I’m not sure 100,000 is enough for a semiauto. And mags for all of it? No one needs more than 3 dooms day devices. Redundancy Two Three is one, one is none. Be prepared. Science is still perfecting the Dooms Week? device, as the entirely theoretical Dooms Month? device remains so elusive, current technology levels just aren’t there.. Pie in the sky.. +1 beryllium sphere Maybe a couple of buried vaults The whole buried vault thing doesn’t work out too well, if FO is any indication. It showcases the intrinsic greed, corruption, and irresponsibility of free-enterprise, (such as Vault-tec) for everyone to see… You’re just sitting there, minding your own business, things are going pretty good and then the Deathclaws show up.

In a SHTF moment, even gold will be less desirable than a large supply of firearms and ammunition. As many have said, it’s the SHTF stuff for which the Second Amendment exists. How would the government enforce a limit on the number of firearms people may possess? Irrelevant. Such a proposition is, objectively, unconstitutional at all levels. The Constitution is an unconstitutional infringement on our rights. A living document, that they’re plotting to murder.. And feelings too! By taking stop and frisk to a national level. How would the government enforce a limit on the number of firearms people may possess? Irrelevant. Such a proposition is, objectively, unconstitutional at all levels. Oregon Killer’s Father Says No One Should Own So Many Guns has no idea how a constitutionally protected right works, yet thanks god he hasn’t been hauled off to be tortured by the secret police over his son’s crime. He is from England and lives in California. Your expectations of his knowledge of liberty are set much too high. The father of the man who murdered nine people at a community college in Oregon last week, who had not seen his son in two years… Guilt trippin? Agreed. Dad is looking for a reason not to off himself at this point. Blaming the number of firearms his son owned may have been fed to him by “concerned” parties. Probably fairly pliable at this point. Maybe we should all chip in and buy him a handgun and a bullet for no particular reason. since the shooter lived with his mother this is probably one way for the father to attack the mother as in how would you let him have all those guns. note the media has already attacked her for this. I’ve seen a number of references in news articles to some of the guns being bought for him by family members. I’d like to see that expanded upon, given that gifting weapons not as part of an estate settlement starts to look like a straw purchase. Oh so now the father of this killer wants to take MY guns away? That won’t solve anything. Maybe if he had been paying attention and taken HIS KIDS guns away then this killing wouldn’t have happened. I really wonder what plan they have for us when they take all our guns away. Because everything they propose is useless in stopping mass killing violence, but will be super useful in preventing political dissent in the future. Maybe if he had been paying attention and taken HIS KIDS guns away then this killing wouldn’t have happened. Too bad somebody doesn’t say that to his face. From the sound of things, he was largely absent from his son’s life anyway. Don’t really see why we should be taking an absentee father’s opinion on this seriously. Because he has the right opinion. Seems a bit more to the ‘left’ if you ask me… I really wonder what plan they have for us when they take all our guns away. Because everything they propose is useless in stopping mass killing violence, but will be super useful in preventing political dissent in the future. GLOBAL SOCIALIST GUBERMINT!1!111!1 *hurries off to store for more tin foil. before they run out* I’m still looking for the sub-clauses and/or fine print in the constitution that entitles law enforcement access to military grade hardware (machineguns/armed MRAPs/etc.) that the general population is disallowed… It’s gotta be there, somewhere.. Legislative grace. They will never run out of socialism. One world government is just as feasible as one world mafia: sorry, there are just too many wanna be godfathers for that to work. That would be nice to believe. Yes, he wants to take away your right to defend yourself from people like his son. ZING! Mercer argued that the mass shooting “would not have happened” if his son did not own so many firearms. Au contraire, Ian. Had your son owned *more* firearms he wouldn’t have been able to decide which to use and so the shooting “would not have happened”. Idiot. +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant +23 brands of deodorant Also 23 comments? What did you do to so anger the squirrels? That’s like, 161 types of deodorant! Probably including one for the people who want to smell like mackerel. Maybe his point is that his son was hoarding and if his guns were collectivized, others could have thwarted him. Maybe his point is that his son was hoarding and if his guns were collectivized, others could have thwarted him. What does he think? That the guns reach a critical mass beyond whoch he can’t resist killing a bunch of people? What an idiotic statement. If he’d had fewer than 14 guns he couldn’t have used 8 guns to kill 9 people? Exactly. Most of us could own hundreds of guns and still have zero desire to go around shooting people. Yes, because it would have made a huge difference if he only had one or two. People who are not around guns, or are around them only for an annual deer hunt weekend or something like that, find the idea of someone owning a dozen or more guns to be shocking and an indication of danger. For someone to whom shooting is a hobby, though, a dozen is pretty much the minimum. You’ve got to have a rimfire rifle for plinking or squirrels, an AR-15 for three gun, a milsurp rifle for historical wanking, and of course a good bolt-action rifle for long distance shooting. Then you’ve got to have a double-barrel skeet shotgun, a pump shotgun for defense, and another one for hunting. For handguns, you need a small pistol for summer carry, a medium one with larger capacity for winter carry, a big fat heavy one for home defense, a rimfire target pistol for plinking and range time, and a nice cowboy action pistol for more historical wanking. That’s a dozen right there — and that’s if you only want one of each and don’t want to experiment with a semiauto shotgun or lever-action rifle, etc. Yeah, a dozen is not that many. Neither is a thousand rounds of ammo for that matter. Back when I used to shoot a lot and ammo was cheaper I could go through that in a summer. Right? Two bulk packs of 22LR is over a thousand. Back when I was a lad (three years ago) I remember seeing them stacked into gigantic cubes at sporting goods stores for $20 a pack. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands of rounds were in those stacks as the liberal douche hipsters looking for kayaking gear obliviously passed by. Growing up my dad had a literal gun room, 2 vertical shelves with long guns on the left, pistols on the wall on the right. I forgot the total at the peak, but it was over 100 Reminds me I need to buy some more guns. Pretty much my list exactly. plus the odd impulse buy, like .357 revolver for wife’s birthday present, which is now her bedside table gun. What this country needs is common sense dad control. It was the village’s job to raise that kid. I’m not the responsible one here, you know. Society really fell down on the job and has some deep thinking to do. /Ian Mercer Nice They’re doing amazing things with sperm protein these days. Sculpting it into three dimensional replicas of their visions of Devils tower after a close encounter with extra terrestrials? That would be somewhat amazing.. Man, I remember that movie all wrong Sculpting it into three dimensional replicas of their visions of Devils tower after a close encounter with extra terrestrials? That would be somewhat amazing.. I didn’t mean Sasha Grey. I meant those Japanese scientists. That’s *worse*. Mmmmm, Sasha Grey. Wait – what were you talking about? Another Sasha Grey vote here! Youngsters. *fires up the bootleg Betamax copy of Deep Throat* This is as usual an emotional response. The most guns any person can fire simultaneously is two, and that’s if they’re not aiming. It is odd that some of these mass shooters bring ridiculous numbers of guns and ammunition with them, far more than they could possibly shoot before being neutralized one way or the other. Is it some sort of security blanket? *side-eyes* *taps sarcometer* Mine no work-ee. Can someone else give me a reading? Makes sense to me. The first sentence could use some commas. I love cooking my children and my pets. This sentence might need commas. Sociologist Randall Collins seems to say “yes” when discussing Adam Lanza: “Like other rampage shooters, he brought far more weapons than he actually used…After he committed suicide, police found he still had over 250 live rounds on his body, with more in his car. He had used up about 150 rounds in breaking in and killing 26 people. He could have kept on firing, but he stopped. He could have fought it out with the police, but he did not– rampage shooters virtually never do, either killing themselves or giving up when real opposition arrives. Two implications: Much of the weaponry he carried was not for practical purposes. It was his symbolic accoutrement, like his black costume and his earplugs, his fantasy surrounding him in the real material world, his comfort zone hugging his own body– even the weight of the ammo he didn’t need. It was a continuation of the clandestine playacting that had filled his life for the months leading up to the attack. Ordinary street fighters don’t wear this kind of gear, and they don’t wear earplugs– they have other kinds of social support for their violence. Loners need more symbolic support.” http://sociological-eye.blogsp…..s-for.html I don’t remember which mass shooting it was but the police and media claimed the shooter had a 1000 rounds on him. unless they were 22 rounds i don’t think a person can physically walk very well with a 1000 rounds. I even asked my friend who was a Marine and he said he never did in the first gulf war but maybe they can now? does anybody know if you can. I have a 45 and I can barely lift the 500 round box Stuffed in your pockets? nope. 1000rds of loose/boxed 9mm or 223 weighs about 30lb (.308 would be about 50lb), but loose ammo isn’t much use; if you’re gonna commit an atrocity and you expect to be opposed, you’ll want at least a couple hundred rounds already loaded in mags. Some interesting staristics about gun violence. http://hotair.com/archives/201…..solutions/ Statistics are only valid when they confirm my personal bias. /just about everyone ever They also never tell you anything about people at an individual level. It’s interesting how that works. The fundamental purpose of the discipline of statistics is to eliminate the effect of cognitive bias when studying a phenomenon. But in practice, in the hands of a dishonest practitioner, it introduces new ones. — The point of the article is not to propose regulations that could theoretically be either enforceable or effective — The point of the article (and the dozens of associated pieces echoing the call for someone to do “something”) is to provoke obvious objections & criticisms to these regulations from the expected sources (Republicans), and then point fingers at them, saying, “SEE!! SEE!! They want your children to die.”” (re: the ‘how they got their guns’ piece – you can tell the ‘concern for journalistic integrity’ by their focus on the AR15 that the Oregon shooter brought to the scene…. and never used) The linked piece also seems to undermine the argument that “number of guns” (or even *type of gun*) is particularly significant, given that most of the significant ‘mass shooters’ they cite used only one weapon… or in some cases used ‘hunting’-style shotguns*, or .22 caliber ‘recreational’ rifles. (though its equally possible that the NYT has no idea what is what and just consistently misrepresents things) (though its equally possible that the NYT has no idea what is what and just consistently misrepresents things is largely staffed by the imbecilic and functionally retarded) Ironically these articles as well as Obama’s speeches ensure a ramp up of gun and ammunition sales as people attemp to get ahead of any proposed legislation. The assault weapon ban debate triggered sales of more ar15’s then has existed before. The more they run their stupid gobs, the more guns and ammunition there are in American homes. Keep talking please. Maybe all the people who bought overpriced Bushmaster crap in 2013 will be able to break even? That bubble will burst again in about 2 months.. Seems like the ammo has gone up at a way higher percentage then the gun prices. I paid probably $750 give or take for my Colt AR A2 pre-ban 20 years ago. I doubt I could get a whole lot more for it today. Ammo has gotten better lately but still expensive. Er, wasn’t that immediately after the 1994 AWB? That would have caused a spike in gun prices too. I bought it before the ban so I guess more than 20 years ago.. Legislation was being discussed they had already began climbing in price when I bought it. Colt? I would pay $750 for it now… Yeah it’s held it’s value but no ones going to pay that much more for it used even in excellent condition. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms. Jayne Cobb: I just get excitable as to choice- like to have my options open. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I don’t plan on any shooting taking place during this job. Jayne Cobb: Well, what you plan and what takes place ain’t ever exactly been similar. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No grenades. Then the callback: River Tam: They want us alive when they eat us. Jayne Cobb: It sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don’t ya think? “The Court has said nothing, as far as I know, about limits on the number of firearms a person may legally possess, which would require a highly invasive regulatory system that would raise issues under the Fourth and Fifth amendments as well as the Second.” Thank you, Mr. Sullum. In addition to whatever utilitarian arguments all the well-meaning NRA types out there are making, we should also remember that there is no Constitutional justification for violating the rights of millions of gun owning Americans for the “crime” of never having done anything wrong. Look, I know all the libertcockmostarians here laugh at the thought that either more, or a lack of, regulations could result in a mass killing like this. But if a flag can kill in the South then it stands to reason that regulations can kill in the northwest. /The Tony Troll What we have here is a father (of the shooter) trying to pass the buck on his responsibility to raise a sane child. A handgun, in the hands of a responsible person, will be used responsibly. But put it into the hands of a nut-job and you end up with a tragedy. Go back over the history of mass shootings like this and take a close look. You’ll find that the overwhelming majority of shooters were mentally unstable (usually suicidal). This is not “yet another example” of the lack of gun control legislation. This is “yet another example” of society’s disinterest in funding the inpatient facilities to keep these nut-jobs off our streets. Of course, for each mass shooter there are 100 similarly unbalanced people who despite having the means never massacre anyone. I guess we should lock them up anyway for the good of society, amirite, comrade? Not necessarily. People who are mentally ill can usually be recognized by mental health professionals. And these professionals can also usually recognize who is a danger to him/herself or others. THOSE are the people who need to be locked up. The problem is that, over the years, inpatient mental facilities have been defunded. And there’s a sad and growing trend in the mental health to consider people who are a danger to themselves and others as “treatable” on an outpatient basis. A large percentage of the homeless are mentally ill. With a few exceptions they tend to be non-violent though. Wow, just wow – no they can’t. You are flat-out, just wrong. People who say this sort of stuff know absolutely nothing about the mentally ill, or the people who treat/care for them. they also don’t understand anything about the De-institutionalization process and what motivated it. This was the great American gulag debate, yes? Background Key part of that process was the Supreme Court decision in 1975 that said (basically) you can’t involuntarily confine someone who isn’t guilt of any crime…. and – importantly – *has other people/places to live where they can be reasonably cared for. … be “reasonably” cared for? That’s a pretty broad umbrella. Under law, it usually means an address they can be found at, and someone who can keep a spare set of eyeballs on them. You claimed that there’s …”a sad and growing trend in the mental health to consider people who are a danger to themselves and others as “treatable” on an outpatient basis”” Technically, if someone is legally determined to be a danger to themselves or others, then they CAN be confined temporarily and treated until psychiatrists recommend otherwise, and remitted to the care of some guardian. Also – anyone ever determined a threat to themselves or others by a court would also be prevented from ever legally buying a gun. On the “professionals can identify” front, I’ll note the plethora of articles (both scholarly and popular) showing that once you are confined in a mental health facility, no behavior can tip off the staff or doctors that you are merely a reporter or grad student and not mentally ill. Not even walking around with a notepad while telling everyone that you are an undercover reporter for the Washington Post doing a story on the state of mental health care. There are also studies that show that doctors will stick with the diagnosis in the file even when grad students are portraying symptoms of a different disorder. Confirmation bias is a bitch… particularly in a field as subjective as mental health. “his responsibility to raise a sane child.” To be clear = better-parenting wont make a mentally-ill child sane. Shitty parenting isn’t the (only) reason people become mentally-ill. Good Parenting, however, can help teach mentally-ill kids to deal with the world without senselessly hurting other people. What I’m trying to say is that “this” parent is trying to deflect any responsibility he might have had toward the “weapons” his son chose to use. I wonder how many of the relatives will be held liable for giving the punk any of his guns? I agree with your assessment of the dad… it is a perfectly understandable response to a horrific situation. But on the good parenting front we have some examples of how a parent can teach mentally ill kids to deal with the world without senselessly hurting other people. I saw this documentary series about this forensic tech in Miami who was a sociopathic killer because he saw his mom get murdered when he was a little kid. His father was a cop and helped him develop a code of ethics to guide and suppress his violent tendencies. It was kind of a feel good story about making lemonade out of lemons. Yup. And I still want to go through this kids medicine cabinet and compare it with the others. that have done this. Sounds like pops’ stupidity started with the woman he bred a kid on and went downhill from there. I believe the one-gun-a-month laws are not intended to prevent people from having a lot of guns, it’s to prevent people from being able to make a living as unlicensed dealers to criminals and other prohibited persons. Well, there are intentions, there are the justifications politicians use to sell policy, and there are the real world consequences. The intentions of one-gun-a-month laws are to sell progressive and Democrat constituents on the idea that the Democratic leadership is doing something on the issue. The justification could be that such laws will prevent mass shootings. The real world impact could be to prevent unlicensed dealers to make a living selling to criminals. Well, as we know there are a lot of Dems who will vote for any law that is anti-gun, without any thought as to what the purpose is, or how effective they would be at fulfilling that purpose. Just give them talking points and watch them spin. 1GAM laws are particularly politically safe since even a lot of cultural gun owners would look askance at someone buying guns more frequently than that, and they also have survived court challenges post-Heller. ” a lot of Dems who will vote for any law that is anti-gun, without any thought as to what the purpose is, or how effective they would be at fulfilling that purpose’ as already noted = the purpose/point of the laws is largely to demonize the opposition to the laws they will perpetually propose new ideas on top of the old ideas, not because the old ideas were bad, but because they NEED to keep forcing people to Oppose “Common Sense” Laws. They can’t be “good guys” unless they’ve got “bad guys” to be fighting against. And proposing new gun laws gives them INSTANT BAD GUYS to prevent people from being able to make a living as unlicensed dealers to criminals and other prohibited persons. Uhm, did you *read* this? Is it a typo? How are *unlicensed* dealers going to be stopped from selling large numbers of guns to criminals. 1. An ‘unlicensed dealer’ is just a private transaction – so there’s no record of the sale anyway. 2. If the state allows transfers outside the control of FFL holders, there’s absolutely nothing stopping a guy from buying from other private sellers (even from sellers in other states) and then reselling them to criminals. I think he is talking about the source of supply for the unlicensed gun dealer who buys guns legally, then sells them illegally in the sorts of unregistered transactions you mention. in volume enough to make money But you can’t really buy guns in *bulk* without being an FFL in the first place. The guy selling guns to criminals is either an FFL doctoring the paperwork to cover up a buyers ineligibility or he’s a guy who’s buying one gun from an FFL and twenty more from sellers on Facebook. In jurisdictions where there is no restriction on gun buying frequency, you can buy multiple guns from multiple FFLs every day. You wouldn’t get volume pricing, but presumably such a person is going to charge a premium above the normal retail price when selling to prohibited persons. Yes? And there’s no way a law mandating a maximum number of purchases a month could possibly do anything about ‘unlicensed dealers’ selling to criminals as a business. Because there’s no way to keep track of *private party exchanges*. I can buy two dozen guns in individual purchases and sell them for, say, a $100 dollar markup to someone who can’t *legally* purchase a firearm (and for some reason doesn’t want to evade the background check by doing their own PP – say because they don’t want to spend time combing ads) and come out with a decent $2400 buck. So the ‘one-gun-a-month’ law would not be able to stop that as there’s no way to verify *when* anyone bought those guns. And FFL’s keep records … so mass buyers leave footprints, too. In jurisdictions where there is no restriction on gun buying frequency, you can buy multiple guns from multiple FFLs every day. If those guns are handguns the multiple sales get reported to BATFE and local law enforcement. And any reputable dealer who wants to stay in business will report suspicious sales to BATFE. Your business isn’t going to last very long. So, as I said in the beginning – you buy from a private party. Where these restrictions do not exist. Negating that whole effect of the law. And in his case, the people closest to him bought some of his guns for him. Thus, they would be the unlicensed dealers in this story. There’s no such thing as an “unlicensed dealer.” Read the Form 4473, Question 16. It’s illegal to engage in the business of selling firearms without a FFL. The private sale exception is for occasional sales, as defined by BATFE. (Who won’t tell anyone how many per year is “occasional.”) If you buy a firearm from a FFL you state it’s for your own use. If you buy one firearm to sell to another person, it can cost you ten years. (Who won’t tell anyone how many per year is “occasional.”) And who won’t *know* how many guns you’ve sold since you’re selling them to *criminals*. Who are not going to go rush out to register the weapon with the ‘authorities’. Maybe they should pass similar restrictions on crack, so that people will not be able to make a living as a friendly neighborhood crack dealer??. I’m so fed up with Obama, I’ve been willing to support most any Republican candidate who isn’t openly hostile to free market capitalism, but I’m starting to think that our next President’s stance on the Second Amendment is going to be more important than I realized. Especially if we get a Republican President in the upcoming, chances are we may get Democratic majorities in Congress at some point over the next eight years. And the chances of there being another mass shooting during that time period are pretty high. They have to be the right kind of mass shooting. Funny how in the litanies of mass killings that the media indulges in, Fort Hood and Chattanooga never come up, nor the Boston Bombings. “And the chances of there being another mass shooting during that time period are pretty high.” And the media is going out of their way to sensationalize, in the desperate hope that you are right, and they can keep it on the front burner.. “See??!! See what you get! Elect a Rethuglican, NRA doormat and you get mass shootings!!” /Salon Enforcing a limit on the total number of guns that any one person could own would require more than limiting the number that could be purchased in a given transaction or a given month (as California, where Mercer lives, does for handguns). It would require registering all 300 million or so guns in the country and keeping track of all transfers?not to mention confiscating guns from people who exceed the limit. Which is precisely where the obsession with “universal background checks” come in. It’s how we get millions of previously untracked and untrackable guns onto the books. The truth of the matter is that more people in the U.S. defend themselves with a gun each year than are victimized by people with guns. Don’t take my word for it, ask the CDC. The truth of the matter is that gun control is counterproductive. Don’t take my word for it, ask Harvard. The truth of the matter is that armed civilians stop mass murders. Don’t take my word for it, ask the FBI. The truth of the matter is that the crime rate, including “gun crimes” and gun homicides is at a 30 year low despite the sunset of the “assault weapon ban”, liberalized concealed carry, steady gun ownership, stand your ground laws, and ignoring the DEMANDS of the “gun control lobby”. Everyday our leadership has an opportunity to look at the root causes of crime and violence such as poverty and lack of opportunity and education, the War on Drugs, our revolving door justice system including plea deals, as well as mental health and the role of SSRI drugs and enact policies to address these issues. It’s time to move on from “gun control”. The CDC, Harvard, the FBI. Are you saying the science is settled? the root causes of crime and violence such as poverty and lack of opportunity and education Bullshit. There are millions of poor, uneducated people who are not criminals. We just don’t want to accept that some people are going to be criminals. It’s in their nature. Your Bayes is backwards. Poverty and lack of education may not inevitably cause criminality, but they certainly lead to a higher probability of becoming a criminal, because (1) poor people have less to lose from the punishments for criminality, and (2) they have fewer options in the legal economy. Are you serious? Poverty does not correlate to criminality, and no one in poverty is consigned to staying in poverty. Where there is a higher probability is in what happens after-the-fact: poor people are more likely to go to prison because they can’t afford lawyers to whittle charges down to probation. Regardless, your argument sounds like the one from the gun-grabbers in that it ignores the individual and seeks to blame some outside entity. +1 product of my environment.. poor people are more likely to go to prison because they can’t afford lawyers to whittle charges down to probation ^This. And getting sucked into the “criminal justice” system seems guaranteed to lead to an entire life of crime. School to prison pipeline! State raised.. Poverty does not correlate to criminality That’s a pretty extraordinary claim. You have a link to prove it? Where there is a higher probability is in what happens after-the-fact: poor people are more likely to go to prison because they can’t afford lawyers to whittle charges down to probation. This may be the case for nonviolent drug possession and the like. It’s not the case for violent crime, which I assumed to be the only type of crime libertarians care about (excluding fraud). I won’t argue anything but I’ll throw something into the mess. I’ve walked around Third World poor neighborhoods in Indonesia I don’t know how many times. Never had a problem. Someone who considers himself dirt poor in the US might be doing relatively all right over there. Yet people in Jakarta, for example, aren’t running around in every ghetto taking turns assaulting, robbing, murdering each other. Biggest problems in the US regarding tendencies toward criminality are cultural. Regardless, your argument sounds like the one from the gun-grabbers in that it ignores the individual and seeks to blame some outside entity. The blame for a violent crime always lies with the person who chose to commit it. That does not change the fact that external factors will make that choice more or less appealing. Do you seriously believe that a kid raised in a wealthy suburban family, sent to the best private schools and private university has the same chance of becoming a violent criminal as a kid raised in abject poverty surrounded by street gangs, and forced to attend terrible dysfunctional inner city public schools? Some people make poor decisions. Poor decisions lead to poverty and criminal behavior. So the two do go hand in hand in a way. Too bad you can’t fix stupid. “the role of SSRI drugs” Yes. I want to look in this kids medicine cabinet and compare it to other mass killers. This medical layman suspects there might be a connection but the FDA has approved these drugs so that link won’t get much Fed. Gov. attention. I haven’t seen anyone point to evidence he was being treated for anything. Have you? I’ll cut a parent trying to comprehend the incomprehensible a little bit of slack – just a little – but here we have a network letting someone spew retardation nationwide. Editing, how does it work?* *Reason comments section may not be the right spot to ask about editing. I 2nd this post. Fuck Ian Mercer. That is all. This man doesn’t need to speak at all unless the first words out of his mouth are heartfelt remorse and an apology to the world. Only when he has convinced us of the first two should he decide his opinion on anything else ought to mean dick. What fucking gall and arrogance. This is giving off strong aromas of a self-important negligent dicktwiddle with all the self-awareness of algae. I’m fighting the urge to rush to judgment, and losing. Also, Christ, what an asshole. Too bad there aren’t laws against murder or against carrying guns on college grounds. That would have prevented this from happening. You forgot hate speech. Maybe we should ban anti-Christian hate speech? That isn’t hate speech anymore. Same with anti-male, anti-hetero, etc., etc., etc. No, no, no. Christians are intolerant. So hate speech against them is an act of tolerance, since tolerant people do not tolerate intolerance. Someone should pipe up, too, that there are legitimate reasons to have a lot of different guns. Guns are highly specialized. A 20 gauge camouflaged turkey gun. An over/under 12 gauge for pheasant and other upland birds A 400 yard+ rifle for elk in the Western U.S. A pre-1964 Winchester 94 lever action carbine for deer in the woods A small 9mm like a S&W M&P for conceal carry. A Taurus Public Defender or S&W Governor for home defense/backpacking in bear country. All those guns are for mutually exclusive, perfectly legitimate purposes. And there are a hell of a lot more like that. Add in rabbit hunting, target shooting, nostalgia collectors, etc., etc. It’s down to this. We have to defend our legal rights because a man who fathered and raised a mass murderer pointed a finger. Christ. Taurus Judge/PD are the stupidest, most useless handguns ever invented. That’s the beauty of it.. I don’t know that I would go that far but yeah I personally have no desire for one. I disagree. If you can find more firepower in a smaller package for backpacking, I’d like to see it (and .357s out of a pistol with a 6″ barrel are known not to be reliably insufficient for black bear, much less grizzly). Those guns got a bad reputation from people (magazine journalists) who shot standard ammo (whether shotgun shells or .45s) out of them, but there are specialty loads out there now that make for some of the most devastating rounds available anywhere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bLonprIWm4 http://www.hornady.com/store/4…..ense-Ammo/ I’d rather get shot with just about anything else, and I bet a bear would rather get shot with anything else but that, too. Is that $20/box, or $20 a round? Yeah, you’re not going to do a lot of practicing with those specialty rounds. I’m sure it’s up there at a dollar a round. “not to be reliably insufficient” Double negative anybody? Should be [not to be reliably sufficient] But you probably already knew that. .410 slugs, (and buckshot) are the key to that pistol.. Yes they are. I have one for home defence and within 10 feet, it’s my favorite. .410 buckshot (000) = (3) 9mm balls in a 2.5″ chambering. (5) 9mm balls in a 3″ chambering. 5-round cylinder dumped in a panic fire within ~3-5 seconds at ~10′ is devastating with ~3-6 pellets in the air at any given second. Better accuracy than an smg, ~0% likelihood of a jam, similar volume of fire.. A difficult to control ammunition as well. What’s the spread look like at 10′? According to what I’ve seen on You Tube, for the Defender (disks and BBs), 3″ on the disks and 8 1/2 on the BBs )) buck stays within 4″ for all 5 balls. I’ve usually gotten pretty close to that in practice. 00 Nice Good enough. I’d say Is this hypothetical shooter aiming each shot or just firing wherever the gun happens to be pointing? 5 aimed shots in 5 seconds from a small revolver is going to be something most people aren’t capable of. Aimed fire? in a panic situation, at 10′? With any snubnose, for that matter? The entire point of buckshot at that range is area denial.. denying your would be adversary that area by filling it with lead. three to five times as much as an ordinary revolver. Across a bedroom, or down a short hall, it will work.. point and click.. It’s a snubnose .410, not a competition silhouette pistol.. Those “9mm balls” are 1/6 oz, roughly 0.01 pound, or 70 gr. The lightest bullet you’d commonly find for a 9mm Luger is 115 gr. It’s misleading to call them “9mm balls” when they are much smaller than 9mm bullets. I still wouldn’t want it fired at me. Ballistics. http://www.fourten.org.uk/mwdefence.html Ballistics on a .38 special http://www.ballistics101.com/38_special.php Ballistics on a .38 special http://www.ballistics101.com/38_special.php Winchester makes a .410 buckshot load in a 2 ? inch shell containing three “triple-ought” or 000 buck shot. The 000 buck is .360 in diameter, weighs 71 grains, and the first pellet out of the two shells which I chronographed out of a Remington Model 870 with 25 inch barrel crossed the chronograph screens at slightly above 1250 fps with a muzzle energy of nearly 250 ft. lbs. The other pellets were no doubt going nearly as fast. That gives three pellets each with as much energy as a standard .38 special police load, and a total energy of 750 ft. lbs. That would have to be quite effective. A full-sized .410 shotgun gets the same energy* as a caliber (38 Spc) that’s considered the bare minimum for self defense purposes. A 3″ revolver is going to do far worse in the energy department. * adding up pellet energies is deceiving as the energy is spread out over a larger area in the case of pellets. I wouldn’t want a pellet gun fired at me either, that doesn’t make it a good self defense weapon. Which pistol ? .357 mag or the judge ? I keep two .357 mags loaded with hollow points at two spots in my home and my 5′ tall wife and I go to the range with them a couple of times a year. If those don’t stop what I need them to stop then I am a lost cause. We don’t backpack with bears on Galveston Bay. .357 will not reliably take out a black bear–at least not out of a pistol. Out of one of those pre-2007 Winchester 94 lever rifles with a 16″ barrel, you get a lot more velocity and they probably do just fine. I read one report of a guy who was hunting black bear with his dogs. Just as he got to the tree they had the bear in, the bear decided to come out of the tree and go after his dogs. The hunter drew his .357 revolver and emptied it into the bear, and the bear just kept coming. YMMV. I’m sure you can take down a black bear with a .357 revolver, and I know it’s been done. And I’d rather have a .357 revolver against a bear than just my street fighting skills. I was charged by a black bear coming out of a tree, from 150 feet away or so, while I was hiking a couple of years ago. He stopped about 25 feet short. Scared the shit out of me. They do that sometimes if you smell like food–they do that to people at campsites, etc., too, because people will leave the area and they can then get their food. I’ve had a number of bear encounters since then–none of them so dramatic. Anyway, if I’m hiking out in the back country somewhere with a lot of bears, especially if there are grizzlies, I think a Defender with the right ammo would make an excellent choice. That’s all I was trying to say. I also think they make an excellent home defense gun. If a shotgun with an 18″ barrel can make a good home defense weapon, then why wouldn’t a shotgun with a 3″ barrel make a good home defense weapon, too? But, you know, that’s my opinion, and it’s not going to work for everyone in every home defense situation. A 12 gauge shotgun with an 18″ barrel is good for home defense*. A .410 bore shotgun with an 18″ barrel, probably not. You’re going to have to fire more shots for the same effect as a 12 gauge. With a 3″ barrel you’re going to get even less power, blow your eardrums out for sure, and have much tougher follow up shots. * 26″ or longer is better if you’re defending a fixed choke point or saferoom entrance — about a 20 dB sound reduction and it looks more like a hunting or recreational gun if you get prosecuted or sued. Needless to say, tramping around the house like Elmer Fudd looking for the wabbit is NOT a good home defense strategy. Again, look at the ballistics tests above from that gun. Look at what it does with .45s that are made for that gun. Did you see the size of those holes? You may not get as much power per round as you would from a 12 gauge shotgun with a standard 18″ shotgun, but you’re getting a hell of a lot of firepower, you don’t have to worry about an intruder grabbing the barrel of your gun, and you’re getting off more shots with a revolver than you would from a standard pump shotgun, as well. If an 18″ shotgun isn’t a bad choice, then the Taurus isn’t a bad choice for home defense either. If you want a handgun that makes .45″ holes, there are far better options out there than the Judge. you’re getting off more shots with a revolver than you would from a standard pump shotgun Are you referring to capacity or the speed of follow-up shots? A standard home defense shotgun (and even many hunting shotguns) have 5+1 capacity or more, which is more than the Judge has. I really don’t think you’re going to get off aimed follow-up shots as quickly from a small revolver as from a pump shotgun. If you’re defending a saferoom, you don’t have to worry about somebody grabbing the barrel because you’re not letting them get near you. If you’re tramping around the house like Elmer Fudd, your home defense plan is probably pretty lousy to begin with. The only legitimate home defense scenario where you’d have to worry about somebody grabbing the barrel is if you’re answering the front door and the attacker shoves their way in when you reach it. In which case you want a handgun, preferably not one that has had compromises in its design enabling it to shoot shotshells. So you’re shooting a solid chunk of lead that’s less aerodynamic than a regular pistol bullet. Not sure how that’s an advantage. Whereas shot is going to pattern weird thanks to the rifling, and .410 00 buckshot has what, 3 pellets? Again, not seeing any advantage over a regular pistol. Desert Eagle is more useless. But more fun, too. I’ve shot one. It’s ridiculously huge and heavy. People also inherit them. Hell I have four of those last year that I haven’t even shot yet. Also, I don’t need a reason anyways. I agree you don’t need a reason, but I thought someone should point out that there are reasons to own a lot of guns–other than just because a nut wants to storm a community college. This guy was suggesting that there is no reason to own a lot of guns. He’s wrong. Yeah, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are just as clueless as he is. “This guy was suggesting that there is no reason to own a lot of guns signaling, as loud and clear as he possibly could, to distance himself, and deflect conversation from his sense of failure, guilt, and moral responsibility as the parent of a mass-murder.” Given the circumstances, I’ d bet he would rather be talking about anything else.. Given the circumstances, I’ d bet he would rather be talking about anything else.. We’ll see if he cashes in in any way. Given the circumstances he ought to have simply kept his mouth shut, but who passes up a chance to get on the teevee being slopped over by an interviewer feigning sympathy? that there are legitimate reasons to have a lot of different guns Yes. I want to own a lot of different guns. Amusing side-note: When I typed my response, I fat-fingered “guns” as “funs”. “How was he able to compile that kind of arsenal?” the killer’s father, Ian Mercer, asked. Well, pops from the sentence just ahead of that quote All 14 were legally purchased by the shooter or his relatives. I suppose he would be under your theoretical limit if his own damn relatives were not giving your nutjob son any guns at all. Did this punk have a job? Sans job, my money is on your ex wife giving him the money for the rest of the guns an ammunition. Go back to Oldham from whence you came you bloody wanky leprechaun. The burden of proof is on those who want to restrict. So asking “How many guns does someone really need?” is switching the burden of proof. Fallacies all the way down. Tony would be proud. I wish I had the coin to buy fourteen guns. I’ve only got three. Ever heard of Hi-Point? Ever heard a little bird? They say “Cheep, cheep, cheep.” So you do have the money for 14 guns. Just not good ones. Apparently. Cheap isn’t always bad. Cobra and Diamondback are cheap because they have shitty materials and workmanship. HiPoint is cheap because the blowback action they use has fewer moving parts and stress components. (at the cost of increasing size and weight) Yeah, if you have, avoid them like the plague… Yeah, they are shit. Ruger, Tauras, Rossi much better value brands. I’ve heard pretty decent things about Kahr and Bersa as well. Don’t know a lot about Keltec but they seem pretty popular. I’d go with any of those over Hi-Point. I’d probably have to research the Keltec more though. Had a buddy who’s brand new Hi-Point was literally falling apart when we were at the range. Taurus = Rossi, they merged. most of their tooling was purchased from S&W, and Beretta back in the day. I’m sure they’ve upgraded since though. Bersa, I believe is an extension of Imbel, which produces excellent firearms. Kahr firearms are decent, if a little over priced. An interesting history on the owner/ceo and his “tertiary activities”.. Interesting, I wasn’t aware that a Moonie owned Kahr The Tauras/Rossi thing rings a bell now that you mention it. Had a buddy who’s brand new Hi-Point was literally falling apart when we were at the range. Really? There are some videos on YouTube of people trying to destroy a HiPoint, and those who succeed generally have to take dire measures to make it happen. for example this one by Iraqveteran8888 Yeah, really. I was there, he basically just started shooting when the front sight became loose and slid around the barrel. Then after we fixed that he had some other other problem with it. I don’t recall what that one was but it was ridicules. Ruger is a great brand, but Taurus/Rossi (same company now) have very poor quality control. You roll the dice on whether you’ll get a great gun for the money or a paperweight (which you have the option of shipping off for a few weeks or months while they send you another gamble gun). So, you’ve never actually owned one and probably never shot one, I’m guessing? They have their negatives (weight, ugliness, and annoying field strip method) but they are excellent, accurate, reliable guns. Not as reliable as a Glock, but you can buy three of them for what it costs to get a Glock. And the Hi Point carbine rifles are even better. Hi Point 9mm is absolute crap. Had one which could not be made to function with any of the magic techniques which work for everyone else. Plus there was no way to hold to keep it from eating my thumb joint. Bought a Smith and Wesson SD VE 9. Under $300, 350 rounds, no malfunctions. Don’t believe the reviews about the trigger. After the second magazine you don’t notice. Superb weapon. For those who in Knoxville, TN are scared of the guns in thy home, please check out this generous offer. For a limited time there is a gun buyback program to get those scare things out of your home and into the hands of the right people: http://austriananarchy.blogspo…..yback.html Thank you for your vigilance. Sarcasmic should set up a table across the street and offer more money for the good ones he wants ! Ah, that is why I will operate in a cul-de-sac I blame society. In honor of this limey fuck, I think I’m going to go gun shopping today. Glock 42 or AR? AR, but just because I am personally anti-Glock. YMMV I’m an XD guy, but I borrowed a Glock 21 at the range. I consistently had quarter sized groupings at 25 yards. It just fits my hand. I have 3 Glocks including a 21 I recently bought from a friend. Grips a tadon the big side but I shoot it well anyways. so that’s what matters. Also have a 22 and 26. prolly going to sell the 26. I’m a Colt 1911 guy all the way. Always shot well with those. I have a stainless officers special. Very finicky about about ammo. Forget about Federal. Seems to do pretty well with Winchester. It’s the short throat. Still love it. Beautiful, nice grip, nice trigger. I like it better than any of the Glock’s. I’m not really a Glock guy. I had the Glock 22. Inherited the 26 and got a great deal on the 21 from a buddy so that’s why I have 3. That brings me back to my XD 9mm. Over 8000 rounds fired, haven’t cleaned it once. Not a single FTF or FTE. Carbon soot is a great lube. Nice The grip angle on the 1911 is a perfect, holy number. I agree So did/does Gaston Glock! Can’t it be both? Or more? The safe is full. It would mean buying another one, and it turns into a big thing. I’m going to have to dig out the hammer drill, bore into the concrete slab, and epoxy in a new safe. I just want to molest some new guns, not do a remodel. If you need to make room, allow me to assist! http://austriananarchy.blogspo…..yback.html For you, I will make an out of State exception and we would have to enlist the assistance of some licensed dealers. Spent a few days in Farragut last year. Nice little area. I used to live out that way. Son, half-assed effort gets you half-assed results.. Grab the brass ring.. /Dad You can buy this for me http://www.sigsauer.com/Catalo…..atrol.aspx Or this http://www.smith-wesson.com/we…..rrorView_Y That’s in the maybe pile. I do want an AR in .308. I had an order in for a multi caliber lower, but then the unpleasantness in Connecticut happened and they didn’t honor the order. That’s crap. Get a man’s gun. You know, a revolver. Revolvers are for pussies who can only piss off six people at a time. “Revolvers are for pussies who can only piss off six people at a time fuck-up resistant.” In honor of this limey fuck, I think I’m going to go gun shopping today. I will go gun shopping too, though probably not today, definitely sometime this week. Glock 42 or AR? Why not both? Why not both? Oh. This is what I get for being late to the thread. I see you answered it up above. From the CNN interview: “It has to change. How can it not? Even people that believe in the right to bear arms, what right do you have to take people’s lives? That’s what guns are, the killers. Simple as that. Simple as that. It’s black and white. What do you want a gun for?” Animism. Evil spirits. “Them guns was to blame, not my boy.” Fuck you, dad. What do you want a gun for? Seriously, what the fuck? Ask the 150 million or whatever peaceful gun owners who have never shot anyone. What is wrong with people? Buy a manly gun, Playa. Get a 1911. I have a Raptor. I’m looking for a cargo pocket piece. Which reminds me, I need more cargo shorts. Or something ridiculous. I already have 2 ARs and an HK USC. If I could find an AK for a decent price around here, I’d get one. I’ve been thinking about one of these since I don;t have a 9mm. Not sure if that’s small enough for your cargo shorts or how your securing it. http://www.beretta.com/en-us/px4-storm-compact/ I wonder how heavy it is. That’s one of the reasons I like Glock for CC. Local range has one to rent. Planning on trying it before buying. There are a lot of youtube reviews out there on it. Which Raptor do you have? Do you love it? Which Raptor do you have? Do you love it? II, not the stainless one. It’s pretty awesome. I bought it used, though. There’s no way I would have paid retail. Yeah, I’ve had my eye on Kimber since they first started out. Don’t own on yet. If you’re considering Kimber, you might want to look at Dan Wesson too. I’m looking for a cargo pocket piece. I have a Ruger LC9 and it has a very easy carry. With the laser on it, it somewhat obscures the outline, which helps with printing. I also have a Bersa CC .380 which is thin enough to wear IWB under a t-shirt. I like both of these for different reasons, but the Bersa fits in a pocket holster and draws without hangups. I have the LC9 sans laser. It just doesn’t fit my hand very well. I supposed with some practice I could get better control on it, but I don’t really have the time. It’s not a bad gun, but it’s also not awesome. I had the same issue with it fitting, so I got a magazine extender that adds only about 3/8″, but that made all the difference for me. You’re right, not awesome, but it works for what I need it to do. It’s not just the uncomfortable feeling of having nowhere to put my pinky. I think it’s the diameter of the whole grip. It just doesn’t fit my hand well, so it wobbles a little bit when I sight up. so it wobbles a little bit when I sight up. With the laser set, I don’t think I’ve noticed that problem. Do you have the little foot extending out of the front of the mag? That’s where I put my pinky. To be fair, I can understand where this guy is coming from, given that if someone I loved did something like this I would probably be up there looking to blame anything but them, it’s only human nature. That doesn’t mean any rational person should listen to him though, he’s pretty much the definition of a subjective witness. It would be like someone who lost family members in 9/11 saying we should ban planes, you can smile and nod along and maybe give them a hug or something, but anyone who would base a policy decision on that is mentally crippled. To be fair, I can understand where this guy is coming from, given that if someone I loved did something like this I would probably be up there looking to blame anything but them, it’s only human nature. Even if you knew exactly which of your relatives gave him the means to kill all those people? Seriously, you would shield those people behind a lame excuse like this? I mean yeah, I would probably still react the same way. My point is that he clearly isn’t in a place where he is thinking rationally, so while it’s not like we should toss him in jail or something for what his kid did, we also care about his opinion on this as much as we care about the Dalai Lama’s opinion of who I should start at quarterback in my fantasy football league. He didn’t need anyone to give him the means to kill. Once someone has the firm intent, they are spoiled for choice in regards to means. In other words, they don’t even need a lame excuse. Unless they knew he had formed intent to kill and then gave him guns, they didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t have to know if/when he was going to kill people before giving him a gun. They should know not to give nutty people guns. You know, I was going to put some effort into distinguishing whether you meant to imply these people were giving guns to someone with a known, diagnosed medical condition, or just wildly trying to assign blame anywhere possible, and then I realized it was completely unnecessary. Fuck off, slaver. I never said the government should limit it directly. I said people who give guns to nuts should be held to some level of culpability, shitbrain. That’s dangerous territory.. There thar be dragons.. Remember that when you loan a car, give a tool (claw hammer/tire iron/crowbar/screwdriver) or sporting equipment… I don’t have to be reminded not to give a bat or hammer to a punk who cries about the bugs in bugland. Not legal culpability. Public shaming maybe. Look at this cunt. You should have opted for the Cracker Jacks degree in criminality and constitutional law rather than their half-off armchair psych degree. Do we know how nutty he was? I’ve been out of the country and not paying attention, so I have no idea. Yes, he was nutty, nutty, weird acting nutjob nutty. “Do we know how nutty he was?’ The fact that he attended a 4 year high-school program specifically for kids with emotional/behavioral problems is a sign that he had some recognized issues as a youngun. One place noted his graduating class was only 4 people. Which suggests he got plenty of direct attention. However, interviews with people at the school didn’t paint the picture of anyone particularly off their nut Nutty nutjob always wearing military gear, mom going to the neighbors telling them to quiet their kids because her son has problems, etc, etc, etc. Nutty nutjob always wearing military gear and acting detached, mom going to the neighbors telling them to quiet their kids because her son has problems, etc, etc, etc. And what medication is typically prescribed for cases of “Nutty nutjob”? http://www.oregonlive.com/paci…..qua_c.html “He was born with problems. He was hard to discipline. If you told him ‘no,’ he would scream like you had just hit him.” The U.S. Army confirmed Friday it discharged Harper-Mercer just halfway through his 10 weeks of basic training in 2008. His screen name on some social media sites was “lithium love.” Lithium is used as a psychiatric medication. And it is a pretty safe bet that he was on the same category of antidepressants as so many other of these mass shooters. “it is a pretty safe bet that he was on the same category of antidepressants as so many other of these mass shooters.’ Again = i’ve not heard any evidence of this yet. The childhood behavior described isn’t particularly uncommon even for “normal” kids. And the teachers in the “Special Needs” school didn’t characterize him as being anything but sweet and funny. Obviously the guy was a few cans short of a 6-pack. The degree to which this was the case, and whether he’d ever actually received treatment is completely unknown. Okay, let’s assume he never got any treatment. Buying guns for a guy who has fits about neighbor kids playing, and bugs in his mom’s apartment is as stupid as giving a drunk guy a car to drive. “”a guy who has fits about neighbor kids playing”” i thought you said that was the mom who did that? Look, all i’m doing is pointing out how people are jumping from these randomly collected details of ‘oddity’ about the guy, to making grand assumptions about his emotional-stability & mental competence at age 26 I submit he was actually batshit crazy, which is easy to judge in retrospect of a mass-killing. I submit that in the time leading up to his mass-killing, almost no one would be qualified to judge him ‘incompetent’ or a danger to self/others based on the same information you’re using now to make that determination. “Which suggests he got plenty of direct attention.” Which apparently stopped the day he left, leaving him attention starved, and eager to seek it in other venues and formats.. ” leaving him attention starved'” This is speculation. The impression most people seem to be consistently communicating is that he was more of a loner than someone starving for attention… generally reticent, but not particularly misanthropic. Most people described him as “funny” and not-unpleasant. “This is speculation.” Absolutely. He is not available for comment.. When he gets done blaming everybody who had nothing to do with his son’s actions, I wonder if he will be supplying the families of the victims with the names and whereabouts of the relatives who gave his “mentally ill” son guns and the money to buy more. So if I have 20 guns, go shoot someone but only use one or two – how does limiting me to one or two limit the amount of damage I could do. To put that sort of limit will *only* stop some dude who is planning on outfitting his own private army. And those guys seem to spend more time holed up in a compound in the woods than they do shooting people. It depends on your cause, naturally. If you are a close friend of Angela Davis, then you get a pass. Actually, I messed that up. If you are a close friend of Angela Davis she gets a pass. Not if your limit is zero, citizen, now.. move along.. Mercer argued that the mass shooting “would not have happened” if his son did not own so many firearms. Obviously not. Look, the kid could have countered the evil spirits emanating from one or two guns but nobody, nobody can overcome an assault by fourteen evil spirits at once. It’s absolutely diabolical the way they network in community, like a hive-mind.. Hasn’t seen his kid in two years? Maybe have a catch with the lad once in awhile and he won’t want to take out his father issues on society. That’s government’s job. I’d like to see the stats on how many of these mass shooters are the children of divorce or estranged from their fathers. The Sandy Hook sicko didn’t have a relationship with his father either. This may make me a socon, but children really do need both strong male and female role models who are active in their lives. The 2 most recent shooters had moms who introduced them to guns, despite the fact that they very obvious emotional and psychological problems. Dealing with kids like that is a lot of work, and yes it takes 2 parents. My neighbors are going through that right now, and their son just turned 14. The dad knocks on my door for help every once in a while (which I told him to do). He used to call the cops for help. Bad idea. But, again, almost no mentally ill children of single parent families go out and murder a bunch of people. But anyone who denies that two parents (as long as they don’t themselves have a completely disfunctional relationship) is preferable to one is suffering some serious delusion. This may make me a socon, but children really do need both strong male and female role models who are active in their lives. Yeah this dad is the dictionary definition of a weak male role model. I’m reminded of something my uncle once said about when he used to teach high school P.E. He would occasionally get calls from fathers who said to let them know, personally, if their sons were ever out of line. Those kids without fail were never the problem. The kids who were the most trouble were the ones whose parents he was least likely to hear from. I think the fact his parents were separated probably indicates that the dad was not a good role model. Kind of like mine – though I did have other male role models & I don’t disagree overall. I just wouldn’t go basing any sort of policy on it. I might be misunderstanding here, but I would absolutely base my policies on it if I were dictator. The government is not a replacement for a father. Period. The government is not a replacement for a father. As much as they’d like us to believe that “It” being the notion that “two parents are better than one”. That is none of the government’s business. The government is not a replacement for anyone. Government is like the large intestine; doing a job necessary for life as we know it, but if you start noticing what it’s doing it’s an unpleasant situation. the dad was not a good role model. Kind of like mine My father was an alcoholic who broke my jaw when I was 12… But, he was my single parent from 11-17 (he died of pancreatic cancer), and taught me how to work, and how the world works. I haven’t killed anyone who didn’t deserve it. I just wouldn’t go basing any sort of policy on it. The reason stable two parent households used to be the norm is that it was economically and socially essential. Single women with children suffered extreme economic hardship and were ostracized. Those weren’t government policies, they were the way society works. These days, welfare and other government support has largely removed both the economic hardship and the stigma of single parenthood. What that means is that you really can’t avoid “basing any sort of policy on it”: either you adopt policies that encourage two parent households, or you adopt policies that encourage single parent households; there is no neutral position. “I’d like to see the stats on how many of these mass shooters are the children of divorce or estranged from their fathers” Speaking of, has anyone seen The Tony Troll here since the shooting ? Just sayin….. This may make me a socon, but children really do need both strong male and female role models who are active in their lives. Bullshit. The vast majority of kids from single-parent homes grow up to be perfectly normal. A single parent home is far better for the kid’s development than a home with two parents who can’t stand each other and fight all the time, which is what you’d have if you try to end divorce. The root problem is our society’s idiotic attachment to an ideal (happy loving nuclear family) that has always been somewhat rare in practice. The root problem is our society’s idiotic attachment to an ideal (happy loving nuclear family) that has always been somewhat rare in practice. You’re a moron. There’s plenty of studies that show children raised in two-parent households tend to be ahead of their single-parent peers in just about every social and economic metric. It doesn’t mean being raised by a single parent dooms you to failure, but the facts are that single-parent kids have a much tougher row to hoe to achieve stability. By your logic, America’s ghettos should be paragons of social stability. Have a heaping helping of correlation not being causation. The same factors that make it easier for couples to stay together also make their kids more likely to grow up in a positive environment. That doesn’t mean that forcing couples in bad situations to stay together will cause their kids to be better off. America’s ghettos are not paragons of social stability for many reasons, few of which have anything to do with parenting. The WoD, the culture of govt dependency, ridiculous incarceration rates, racist policing, suffocating regulation from city hall, terrible schools… all of those have a bigger impact and little to do with single vs double parents. It’s very likely that the disproportionate number of single parent homes in the inner city is an effect of these causes, rather than the reverse. If daddy’s in jail or can’t make enough money to make ends meet, he’s not going to be part of the family. Have a heaping helping of correlation not being causation. The same factors that make it easier for couples to stay together also make their kids more likely to grow up in a positive environment. That doesn’t mean that forcing couples in bad situations to stay together will cause their kids to be better off. What it means is that you shouldn’t have kids unless you are quite certain that you are in a stable relationship that can be expected to last for the next 21 years. America’s ghettos are not paragons of social stability for many reasons, few of which have anything to do with parenting. The WoD, the culture of govt dependency, ridiculous incarceration rates, racist policing, suffocating regulation from city hall, terrible schools… all of those have a bigger impact and little to do with single vs double parents. Actually, they have a lot to do with single parenting. Single parenting limits economic resources, parental involvement in school and school work, and time for supervising kids. It greatly increases government dependency. And single parenting is often the result of crimes committed by the father, which kids take as a role model. That’s in addition to the psychological problems resulting from breakups, family conflicts, and single parents bringing in a string of dates and short term partners. Have a heaping helping of correlation not being causation. Have a heaping helping of question-begging. The same factors that make it easier for couples to stay together also make their kids more likely to grow up in a positive environment. You’re not exactly making the case for the awesomeness of single-parent homes. That doesn’t mean that forcing couples in bad situations to stay together will cause their kids to be better off. Nice strawman, idiot. America’s ghettos are not paragons of social stability for many reasons, few of which have anything to do with parenting. Yeah, I’m sure they’re all awesome parents, they’re just going through a tough stretch. Please. The WoD, the culture of govt dependency, ridiculous incarceration rates, racist policing, suffocating regulation from city hall, terrible schools… all of those have a bigger impact and little to do with single vs double parents. None of which refutes the multiple studies that show children who grow up in single parent homes tend to be worse off than those in double parent homes. Sorry, the stats don’t take a backseat to your feelz. How would the government enforce a limit on the number of firearms people may possess? Subjectively, of course. Not entirely unlike their enforcement regimes for Medicare/tax/social security/ebt fraud, or Obamacare implementation. “Incompetently” and “ham-fisted” are the first two terms that come to mind… They would fuck it up in stellar, breathtaking fashion.. Yea, those are good terms too. Beware of the man with only one gun. He probably knows how to use it. + 1 Quigley Or if he has none, he might just take one of yours huh. The guy who gets chumped there is “Trevor” from GTA V. I’ve never actually seen him in anything. What an asshole. “I failed as badly as it’s possible to fail at being a father, so it’s obviously everyone’s fault but mine.” “But someone’s gonna get publicity out of this, so it may as well be me!” So, wait, the kid had an English daddy and was obsessed with the IRA? Is that right? That’s quite a way to manifest a daddy issue. Yes, and his relatives armed him. Congressman Peter King? Sorry to break it to you pal. The guns weren’t the lonely homicidal maniac. Your son was. Man loses touch with his son (suffers from learning disability) for two years, can’t believe his son bought guns and apparently accepted guns from relatives. My mom isn’t a Tiger mom, but she wouldn’t lose me for 2 years. No amount of “I’m my own man now and I want to live my life” Americana is going to persuade her. I’m convinced that a touch of shame based culture would do America some good. If you weigh 300 pounds, that’s not something to be “empowered” about. You won’t walk somewhere in Japan and see too many human hippos, because they’ll be pressured about it in the most passive aggressive way. Lots of 25 year olds are still kids. If they have no job and no future prospect, some decisions can be made on their behalf. You don’t send your emotionally unstable son to a far away college and lose track of him for 2 years. Yeah, you’re legally responsible for him. But your family and peers have every right to shame you and ridicule you. You’re not legally responsible So you want a suffocating society instead of a suffocating government? If the kid moves and doesn’t tell his parents what his new address or phone number is, how are they supposed to “keep track” of him? Hire a PI? Your mom wouldn’t lose track of you because you wouldn’t try to be lost track of, presumably. And if I weigh 300 pounds that’s my problem, and all the consequences that flow from weighing that much are my problem too. I never demanded accommodation. If you don’t like seeing me walking around, buy some blinders or better yet stay at fucking home, weight slaver. Tulpa is a fatty? You never know who you’re talking to on the internet. The person you’re talking to has a whole history and set of personal traits and experiences that you’re not privy to. You have no idea, for example, whether they’ve had bouts with depression and overindulged in food to try to feel better. This realization would lead a normal person to avoid telling people to I said a touch of shame based culture. Can you read? Wasn’t kid was enrolled in this college? How did pay for tuition? And no, most parents wouldn’t lose track of their kids, and most kids don’t flee their house without a trace of information. If you let these mentally unstable kids isolate themselves in cocoon, stuff like this will happen. Almost all of these mass shooters break off from their families and society and marinate in their madness. You don’t want gun control because it wouldn’t work, that’s fine. It’s not unreasonable for society to take these clueless parents to task and do something about the breakdown of families. If you’re overweight, it’s not something to be proud of. But that’s how it is in America. I don’t want the government to dictate my diet, but its shouldn’t be “discriminatory” for me to express concerns about someone’s weight. This guy lost track of his son for two years, but he received guns from relatives. How did that happen? None of his relatives told the dad about that? The dad didn’t search the internet for his son? Forget it. You’re in Tulpa town. its shouldn’t be “discriminatory” for me to express concerns about someone’s weight. Unless it’s somebody you know well, it’s very nosy to do that. Losing weight is a very hard thing to do and ragging on someone about it is just going to make them resent you. I know someone’s going to pipe in and say “just eat right and exercise” — easy to say, hard to do for a person who’s not in the habit. Fuck off, Tulpa. No one should own guns PERIOD! they should be banned and for everyone. This includes the hypocritical politicians. How are you going to tell people to get rid of their handguns when you hypocrites have bodyguards with handguns protecting YOU? Be real LEADERS and live the way you want others to live. Then others will follow. Until then … we will do what YOU do… No one should own guns PERIOD! they should be banned and for everyone. Hell yes! And once we ban them, no one will have them! Just like no one has drugs! Works in prison! And prisons are really safe places too! Right? who bans the banners? Municipal advertising regulations? No one should own guns PERIOD! they should be banned and for everyone. This includes the hypocritical politicians. How are you going to tell people to get rid of their handguns when you hypocrites have bodyguards with handguns protecting YOU? Be real LEADERS and live the way you want others to live. Then others will follow. Until then … we will do what YOU do… We wouldn’t need guns if it weren’t for the kind of assholes who want us all disarmed. -jcr “That claim is debatable, to say the least.” No. No, it is not. “Calling for stricter gun control, Mercer argued that the mass shooting “would not have happened” if his son did not own so many firearms.” Yes. Yes, it would have. His son was like this, only with guns. His argument would make sense if his son had gone on his little spree using several muskets. Applying that kind of nonsensical thinking to semiautos or revolvers is the height of stupidity. I’ll cut the guy a bit of slack because he’s obviously in the middle of a very hard time but the people who are taking this idea and running with it really deserve nothing but ridicule. “I’ll cut the guy a bit of slack because he’s obviously in the middle of a very hard time” Not me. Either he’s being honest and he actually thinks guns are to blame, which only highlights the shittiness of his parenting and moral character (not that he should take the blame, but that he should at least admit his son made an evil decision) Or he actually knows that the problem is the fact that his son is to blame, but he’s lying to deflect that fact or for some other ulterior motive, which makes him a liar and a douche. I would take anything he says with a grain of salt for at least a month or more. It’s been what, less than a week? Fucking media vultures. The mom is the one the kid was around in the time leading to this. Where is she? RE: “How would the government enforce limits on how many guns you are allowed to own?” Ummmmm…. the same way they enforce other laws. If you are suspected of owning more guns than you should, send the police with a warrant to search your home. If more guns are found there than allowed, have a prosecutor charge you. If convicted, sentence you to 50 years in solitary confinement. You need to do something about the adjective in your handle. You never read THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS??? Who brought you up? How is owning 20 guns more dangerous than owning 2? In fiction, you can use all of them at the same time. Who needs courage, when you can have… a government? I make up to $90 an hour working from my home. My story is that I quit working at Walmart to work online and with a little effort I easily bring in around $40h to $86h? Someone was good to me by sharing this link with me, so now i am hoping i could help someone else out there by sharing this link… Try it, you won’t regret it!…… http://www.HomeJobs90.Com I make up to $90 an hour working from my home.

He should also blame some friends and other peoples then his son visited. That comic seem to be right on target. http://anarchyinyourhead.com/2…..-peasants/ Maybe he should have been a better father? Calling for stricter gun control, Mercer argued that the mass shooting “would not have happened” if his son did not own so many firearms. It would also not have happened if he had raised his son better. I think we should pass laws that hold parents liable and criminally responsible for the actions of their children. “How would the government enforce a limit on the number of firearms people may possess?” Easy peasy lemon squeezy, you pass a law. Boom, then it shall be so. Already this morning on Derpbook I saw someone post that what we need is a constitutional amendment to ban guns. He backed his reasoning by saying that prohibition was a success because everyone was drunk and now they are not. I SWEAR TO GOD. Already this morning on Derpbook I saw someone post that what we need is a constitutional amendment to ban guns. He backed his reasoning by saying that prohibition was a success because everyone was drunk and now they are not. I SWEAR TO GOD. The father of the Oregon mass shooter is trying to blame guns for his failure as a father. The mass shooters came from divorced homes where the mother had custody. These mass shootings did not happen at this rate 100 years ago when everyone had a gun, and most boys had a father in their lives. The State is an enabler to this father absence by being involved in the family/marriage/divorce racket, when the State acts as the enforcer collecting child support payments, it makes the father a slave with responsibilities, but no authority. His master is the mother of his children, and the State, enforced by the State gun toters. Please log in to post comments Billy Binion

Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, discusses the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, during a news conference Friday in Roseburg, Oregon. Armed with multiple guns, Chris Harper Mercer, walked into a class at the community college, Thursday, and opened fire, killing nine people. (AP) ROSEBURG, Ore. -- When the gunshots started at Umpqua Community College, some people mistook them for falling books. But Army veteran Chris Mintz quickly recognized the threat. ""He was in the military and knew what it was,"" said Mintz's aunt, Wanda Mintz. Her 30-year-old nephew, a student at the college, told classmates to remain calm and went to the door as the shooter came across the hallway. He tried to stop the gunman from entering the classroom and was shot three times, his aunt said. After Chris Mintz fell, he told the suspect: ""It's my son's birthday today. Don't do this,'"" she said. The gunman then shot him at least twice more and went into the classroom, where he kept firing. Nine people were killed before the shooter died in a shootout with police. Wanda Mintz said her nephew tried to crawl away but could not move because of his wounds. He was recuperating Friday at a hospital in Roseburg and was expected to survive. ""He's lucky to be alive, and we're grateful he's alive,"" his aunt told The Associated Press on Friday. In an interview with ABC News, the younger Mintz said: ""I just hope that everyone else is OK. I'm just worried about everyone else."" A cousin who spoke with Mintz on Thursday night said he ""wishes he could have saved more people."" ""I've never seen him give up on anything,"" said Derek Bourgeois of Hope Mills, North Carolina. Word of Mintz's actions spread quickly. A page seeking donations on the fundraising site GoFundMe raised more than $250,000 Friday in a matter of hours. Speaking by phone from her home in Randelman, North Carolina, Wanda Mintz got a description of what happened from her nephew's girlfriend. She said he went through seven hours of surgery. ""Chris is a tough guy,"" she said. He was hit in both legs, his stomach, his back and in the hand, but the bullets did not hit any of his vital organs. He has two rods in his legs and is going to be in a wheelchair for the foreseeable future, she said. ""It's going to be a long, long recovery,"" she said. She said she spoke Friday with her nephew, who said he was in a lot of pain. Chris Mintz was born and raised in Randelman, North Carolina, west of Raleigh. His son, Tyrik, turned 6 on Thursday, she said. When he was in the military, Mintz was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, then moved about nine years ago to a base in the West. He never saw combat, his aunt said. She said he's an athlete and was studying body building and nutrition. He left the Army a few years ago and was a part-time student at Umpqua, she said. Mike Gwaltney, a swim coach at the YMCA where Mintz worked, said he was not surprised to hear how Mintz reacted. ""It's something that Chris and many others are trained to do,"" he said. ""He's a pretty tough cookie."" Gwaltney said he saw Mintz at the hospital as he was coming out of surgery. ""For the most part,"" Gwaltney said, ""he was in very good spirits.""

(Chris Clark | Mlive.com) (Chris Clark | Mlive.com) LANSING, MI -- Michigan state Sen. Steve Bieda was at a conference in Washington D.C. last week when he learned about a tragic shooting at an Oregon community college. When he flew home days later, he was struck by the fact that he had to remove his shoes before before boarding. ""The whole nation does that based on one clown that had some explosives in his shoe,"" said Bieda, D-Warren, referencing the so-called ""shoe bomber"" who boarded a flight between Paris and Miami in 2001.""We did that for a plot that was foiled, yet every time we see another mass shooting, nothing ever happens."" Nine people died and several others were injured Thursday at Umpqua Community College when 26-year-old student Christopher Harper-Mercer opened fire in a classroom and then killed himself following a gun battle with police. President Barack Obama, clearly frustrated, said he was disappointed that mass shootings have become ""routine"" and predicted a ""routine"" response from ""those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation."" Critics quickly accused him of politicizing the shooting. Bieda said he shares in the anger that the president expressed and believes ""we need to do a lot more on this issue,"" but he suggested that the gun debate should be approached in ""an intelligent manner, without emotion, without a knee-jerk reaction."" Closing the so-called gun show loophole and making it harder for people with mental illnesses to obtain firearms are ""common sense"" policies the state should consider, according to Bieda. ""I always hear the NRA say 'guns don't kill people, people kill people.' They're right. Let's do background checks on those people,"" he said. But Democratic legislation calling for universal background checks has not seen any action so far in the Michigan Legislature, where the Republican majority has moved to streamline gun rules in recent years. Gun control laws simply do not work, according to Sen. Patrick Colbeck, R-Canton, who delivered a floor speech on Tuesday challenging his colleagues to name one law that would have prevented the mass shooting in Oregon. Colbeck went on to criticize laws that create so-called ""gun-free zones"" restricting owners from carrying firearms into certain places, such as schools, colleges and sports stadiums. Gun-free zones give ""lethal advantage to mass murderers"" and disarm citizens ""when they are most in need of an armed defense,"" Colbeck said, echoing an increasingly prevalent argument that allowing more guns -- or at least more legally armed citizens -- would help prevent large-scale shootings. Umpqua Community College is not a gun-free zone, according to The Oregonian, which noted that state law exempts concealed pistol permit holders from any gun-free rules. The newspaper reported that more than one student, including a 36-year old Army veteran, had concealed weapons on campus that day but were advised not to use them because they could have made themselves targets or confused law enforcement officers already on the scene. Asked about the fact that concealed pistols are allowed at the community college, Colbeck argued there is ""a nice little trend line"" of mass shootings in other gun-free zones, such as the Colorado movie theater where a gunman killed 12 people and injured 70 others. ""And in direct response to that, our president came out and started pushing for gun control,"" said Colbeck. ""That's antithetical to not only the U.S. Constitution that he took an other to support, but also the Michigan Constitution, which makes it very clear we have the right to bear arms in self defense."" Michigan law includes a unique twist on ""gun-free zones."" The state prohibits permit holders from carrying concealed pistols in certain areas, but the law does not prevent owners from openly carrying guns in those same places. Openly carried guns have caused alarm and stoked fears in some Michigan schools, prompting legal fights and state legislation to modify ""gun-free"" zone rules. A House Bill sponsored by Democratic Rep. Andy Schor of Lansing seeks to make the zones truly gun free by prohibiting open carry there. A separate bill sponsored by Republican state Sen. Mike Green of Mayville would prohibit open carry but allow permit holders to bring concealed weapons into schools and other restricted areas. Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, supports Green's bill and expects it to receive a committee hearing soon. ""I have superintendents in my district who are asking me for help with this problem,"" Meekhof told reporters after session on Tuesday. ""They understand both sides of it, but when somebody comes in -- I think irresponsible, even though it is their right to carry openly -- it causes a school to go into lockdown. So to me, that's being selfish, because now you've robbed those kids of another day of school."" Republican Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed similar legislation in 2012, expressing a belief that public schools, day care centers and hospitals should also have the option to prohibit concealed weapons if they choose. Snyder, for his part, has not discussed firearm policy since last week's shooting in Oregon, but he did mark the tragedy by joining President Obama's call for all U.S. Flags to be lowered on Monday and Tuesday. ""These fatal shootings were a senseless act of violence that claimed the lives of nine innocent U.S. citizens,"" Snyder said in a statement. ""The state of Michigan and I join the families of these victims as well as our country in mourning their loss.""

Mississippi. A proposal seeks a statewide vote on removing the Confederate battle emblem 
from the state flag. (AP files) JACKSON, Miss. -- A new proposal seeks a statewide election on removing the Confederate battle emblem from the Mississippi flag. But it could be years before the issue gets on the ballot, and there's no guarantee voters would accept it. State officials said Friday a resident of the capital city of Jackson filed paperwork for a ballot initiative that would erase all references to the Confederacy from the flag. The emblem -- a blue X with 13 white stars, over a red field -- has been on Mississippi's flag since 1894, and voters chose to keep it in 2001. But the massacre of nine black worshippers in June at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, has renewed debate about the public display of Confederate symbols. ""It is exciting to know that we are one step closer to addressing this issue once and for all,"" said initiative sponsor Sharon Brown, who described herself as a civil rights advocate in a statement. Brown did not immediately return calls for comment Friday. It could be days or weeks before she could begin gathering signatures. Even if enough people sign petitions, the earliest her proposal could be on the ballot is 2018 because the state's initiative process is complicated. Critics say the Mississippi flag is a divisive reminder of slavery and segregation and doesn't represent a state where 38 percent of the 2.9 million population is black. Supporters say they see the Confederate emblem as a symbol of history and heritage. South Carolina lawmakers voted in July to take down the Confederate battle flag from a monument in front of their Statehouse after the mass shooting in Charleston. The suspect, who is white, had posed with a rebel flag in photos posted online before the attack. A woman who works in Biloxi, Mississippi, at Beauvoir, the final home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, filed an initiative proposal several weeks ago to keep the Confederate emblem on the Mississippi flag, but she abandoned it after she said the attorney general had written a confusing ballot title. Beauvoir administrator Greg Stewart said another initiative to keep the flag will be filed. Any initiative approved by Mississippi voters would be an amendment to the state constitution. Days after the South Carolina church shooting, Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn became the first high-profile Republican elected official to say Mississippi should remove the Confederate battle emblem from its flag. Several Mississippi cities and some counties have stopped displaying the state flag on public property, saying the symbol is divisive. There's no guarantee that legislators will address the sensitive issue when they next convene in January. Gov. Phil Bryant and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, both Republicans, have said voters should have the final say in a flag design. Although the Confederate emblem has been on the Mississippi flag since the late 19th century, the state Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that flag had lacked official status since 1906, when Mississippi laws were updated and the flag design was not described in statute. Legislators decided in 2001 to put the flag up for a statewide vote. By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, voters chose to keep the design rather than replace the Confederate symbol with an alternative proposal with circles of 20 stars to represent Mississippi's status as the 20th state. That vote put the flag design into state law, but not into the constitution. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

776,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/obama-oregon-college-shooting-routine,"Umpqua community college shooting is an event that is becoming almost ‘routine’ says Barack Obama Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST Barack Obama put words to the desperation of millions of Americans – and the despair of the rest of the world – after another mass shooting at a school in Oregon on Thursday, the latest of nearly 1,000 since his re-election in 2012. “Somehow,” the president said, “this has become routine.  “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it,” Obama trailed off, at once frustrated and spirited at the White House. “We’ve become numb to this … We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg; after Tucson, after Newtown; after Aurora, after Charleston.” The words mark a long list of tragedy. Since Obama’s re-election to a second term in November 2012 – which itself was followed by the shooting of 26 people including 20 children at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, just a few weeks later – there had been 993 mass shooting events in the United States . Thursday’s attack, at Umpqua community college in the town of Roseburg, was No 994. Almost 300 of them have occurred in 2o15. That’s almost one every day. Obama has spoken or issued statements 15 times in the wake of mass shooting events. “I’ve made statements like this too many times,” he said after the church shooting this June in Charleston, South Carolina. The numbers go deeper than the statements, as the president said. Umpqua is the 294th mass shooting event in 2015, as defined by the website Shootingtracker.com, which chronicles them as an event in which four or more people are shot. Since the Newtown shooting, there have now been 994 such events in the US. The death toll of this litany of tragedy stands at approximately 1,236 people since the beginning of 2013. By the FBI’s definition – four or more killed rather than four or more shot, a “mass murder” event rather than a “mass shooting” – there have been 45 such incidents this year, and 142 since Sandy Hook. America’s gun problem goes deeper still: on the day of the Newtown shooting, many noted that if that had been the only shooting that day, the day’s death toll from gun violence would have been below the US average. That was even more true on Thursday. The number of firearm homicides in 2013, the last year for which the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has statistics, was 11,208. The year before Sandy Hook, it was 107 fewer than that. That’s just intentional homicides. Firearms are the cause of death for more than 33,000 people in America every year, according to the CDC; a number that includes both accidental discharge, murder and suicides, which are on the increase, especially in states with lax gun-control laws, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. That means guns kill more people in America every six hours than terrorist attacks did in the entire year of 2014. On top of that, in 2010 more than 73,000 Americans were treated in hospitals for firearm-related injuries, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. This year is on track to break records. So far in 2015 there have been 39,449 total firearm incidents, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and 9,940 people killed. Of those, 550 were children, and 1,962 were teenagers. Almost half of all guns in civilian ownership on the planet are held by Americans. And the Guardian’s The Counted project, which tracks killings by police, has thus far tracked 762 people killed by police gunfire this year alone. It is also much more dangerous to be a police officer in a state with lax gun laws, according to the American Journal of Public Health. As the former attorney general Eric Holder tweeted soon after the news of the killings broke: “We weep again as a nation”: Now Oregon. We weep again as a nation. Is the answer to our gun violence epidemic to do nothing?  Again?  Come on America! We solve problems “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences,” Obama said behind the podium at the White House. “Based on my experiences as president, I can’t guarantee that – and that’s a terrible thing to say.”",2015-10-01 23:22:14,Oregon college shooting is 994th mass gun attack in US in three years,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
777,https://townhall.com/columnists/michaelreagan/2015/10/07/time-for-sensible-background-checks-n2062377,"In the wake of the recent homicidal shooting rampage at an Oregon community college, I'm forced to come to the conclusion that it is high time for common sense national background checks for journalists. It's time we closed the political loophole and prevented biased, ignorant political operatives from getting their hands on a dangerously misleading national microphone. RedState has a perfect example this week. Former Bill Clinton White House aide, and current Clinton Foundation donor George Stephanopoulos, is the host for ABC's This Week. He uses his ""bully pulpit"" to bully conservatives and Republicans. During an interview with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Stephanopoulos interrupted Christie to assert, ""But there's no question the pace of mass shootings is accelerating, happening more frequently than anywhere else. If it's not the gun, then what is it?"" This is a perfect example of leftist thinking. As Dennis Prager points out, the left always blames the inanimate object and never the user. During the Cold War the left wanted to ban atomic weapons rather than condemn and work to overthrow totalitarian regimes that could use The Bomb to further their ends. Leftist-in-Chief Obama continues to be fixated on nuclear weapons and behind the scenes is working to render our nuclear deterrent impotent. Now the left is fixated on the gun. Blaming the user of the gun is out of the question, because that involves individual responsibility. Once America starts thinking in terms of individual responsibility again, it has the potential to open up a line of questioning that is very uncomfortable for big government leftists. For example: Why can't you find a job? Where is the father of your children? How did your home enter foreclosure? What do you spend your money on? Why have we lost the War on Poverty? After demonizing the gun, leftists like Stephanopoulos use false data from anti-gun pressure groups to contradict defenders of the 2nd Amendment. First they change the definition of ""mass shooting."" Before the numbers started to trend against them, the definition was at least four deaths NOT counting the shooter. Now gun grabbers use three deaths as a minimum or they include the wretched shooter in the total. Naturally, as if by magic in a cloud of cordite, there are more mass shootings, but even doctored statistics can't support the ""accelerating"" claim. The RedState graph shows mass shootings peaked in 2004 and have not reached that peak since. Since 2008, mass shootings have been trending downward. I'm certain rabid Democrat defenders of media bias will block my common sense background checks for journalists bill in the Senate. So in the meantime I can only advise you to beware leftists bearing statistics.

Oregon College Shooting: More Details Emerge on Gunman — -- Mourners gathered at a park in Roseburg, Oregon, Thursday, holding a vigil for the victims of the deadly mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. The shooting left 10 people dead and at least seven others injured, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. People gathered around 8 p.m. at Stewart Park in the city, which is located about 180 miles south of Portland. Attendees held up candles as the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" was played. Authorities are trying to uncover the motive behind the shooting, which occurred just before 10:40 a.m. Three law enforcement sources briefed on the case identified the gunman as Chris Harper Mercer, 26. Three pistols and an AR-style rifle were found at the scene, sources said. It was unclear whether the shooter, who was killed in a gun battle with police, was counted among the 10 dead. Ian Mercer, the suspected shooter’s father, briefly spoke to reporters outside his home Thursday, calling the situation a “devastating day for me and my family.” Student Cassandra Welding was in Snyder Hall, in the classroom next to where the shooting occurred. ""I heard a really loud ka-pow noise, almost like a balloon popping, and we, all of our classmates, jumped and we did not know what it was,"" Welding said. ""We knew something wasn’t right, and so a classmate of mine went to go open the door to see what was happening next door to where the shooting occurred, and she opened the door and, unfortunately, she got shot twice and she fell down and collapsed.” The classmate was shot in the arm and abdomen, Welding said. The victim's friend performed CPR. ""I heard her breathing was really labored, she was like gasping for air, and we were just in frantic mode at that point,"" she said. One of the victims, Chris Mintz, 30, is recovering from seven gunshot wounds. Witnesses say the student and Army vet charged at the gunman, trying to save who he could and telling others to run. “He ran to the library and pulled the alarm and he was telling people to run, grabbing people, telling them you just have to go and he actually ran back towards the building where the shooting was,” student Hannah Miles said. Kenneth Ungerman said he was outside Snyder Hall, talking to a National Guard recruiter when he heard a gunshot. ""I saw a male with a gun go around the corner to Snyder Hall,"" he told ABC News. After that, he heard some more shots and ducked behind his Jeep. “Heard two more gun shots,"" he said. ""People were screaming. We got out, heard more gunshots. After that, the men told people in the parking lot to get out. ""We got down to the road and stopped traffic,"" Ungerman said, adding that he had military training. ""We didn't want anyone else to go up to campus."" Kortney Moore saidshe was in a writing class when a bullet tore through the window, according to The Associated Press, citing the Roseburg News-Review. She said the gunman came into the classroom, told people to get on the ground and then asked people about their religion. President Obama, speaking about the massacre, lamented that mass killings have become “routine” in the United States and blasting those who oppose tougher gun laws. “I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again in my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families under these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can’t guarantee that,” Obama said in the White House briefing room.

Jeb Bush Under Fire for Comments He Made Over Deadly Campus Shooting — -- Presidential candidate Jeb Bush made an eyebrow-raising comment in the wake of the Oregon school massacre -- saying ""stuff happens"" in response to a discussion about gun violence. Bush called the shooting in Oregon ""heartbreaking,"" and said he also had challenges that he faced during his tenure as governor of Florida. ""Look stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not always the right thing to do,"" Bush said at the Conservative Leadership Project in Greenville, South Carolina, referring to taking away rights. A gunman opened fire on the campus of Umpqua Community College Thursday, killing 9 people and wounding seven others. He later died in a gun battle with police. The 13 guns he had, including six that he had with him at the school, were all legally purchased, federal officials said today. The guns were either purchased by the shooter or his relatives over the past three years. President Obama, speaking at the White House, said Bush's remarks didn't deserve a response after a question about them from ABC News' Jonathan Karl. ""I don’t even think I have to react to that one,"" he said. ""I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that stuff happening."" Obama reacted emotionally to the shooting during an address Thursday and lamented that mass shootings had become ""routine"" in the U.S. He also called for greater gun control. Bush attempted to clarify his comments to reporters after the event and said they were ""not related to Oregon."" ""Just for clarity here,"" he said. ""Let’s make sure that we don’t allow this to get out of control."" He then defended his comments, adding that tragedies happen all the time and the key is to finding the solution to the deeper issue. ""It wasn't a mistake, I said exactly what I said,"" Bush said. The Democratic National Committee has already pounced on the comments, amidst a firestorm of conversation on Twitter, condemning the remarks. ""Americans are killed and injured, families lose their loved ones, and an individual who wants to be the President of the United States shrugs his shoulders and says “stuff happens.” No. The reason this keeps happening is because we let it,"" said DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Bush campaign later shot back that the remarks were ""sad and craven"" and that Democrats would take Bush's comments out of context to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. They also tweeted out out a link to two organizations that are supporting the victims of the mass shooting. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2015-10-02 16:23:44,Jeb Bush Says 'Stuff Happens' In Response to Gun Violence,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
784,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeb-bush-means/story?id=34222531,"A look at the Republican presidential candidate's gaffes. Jeb Bush In Response to Gun Violence: ‘Stuff Happens’ — -- Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has made several statements that have landed him in hot water since he entered the race. This, of course, comes with the territory, especially when one tweet is all it takes to catapult a gaffe or slip of the tongue into an out-of-context behemoth that looms over a candidate's head for months. It seems, however, that Bush has had more than the other candidates of these inelegant instances, where a great distance exists between what he said, what the public heard, and what he says he actually meant. Let's explore five examples, starting with the most recent. 1. '...Stuff Happens' What He Said: While participating in a constitutional conversation in Greenville, South Carolina, on Friday, the topic turned towards Second Amendment rights and mass tragedies. The massacre in Oregon was referenced and the conversation then turned to the broader issue of tragedies and prayer. ""We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to connect ourselves with everybody else. It's just, it's -- it's very sad to see, but I resist the notion, I did -- I had this challenge as governor because we had -- look stuff happens. There’s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."" The Reaction: One tweet was sent out, then the progressive-leaning group American Bridge sent out a clip of his comments, and media and voters alike started weighing in. Twitter was aflame with reactions from both sides: Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz weighed in, and ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked President Obama about the comment, to which the president replied: ""I don't even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening.'"" The Bush camp and others on the conservative side decried the outcry as ""sad and craven"" and accused liberals and the media of taking his comments out of context in an attempt to politicize the issue. What He Says He Meant: Directly after the event, ABC News and other reporters sought to clarify his comments. One reporter asked if his comments were a mistake. ""No it wasn’t a mistake, I said exactly what I said, why would you--- explain to me what I said wrong,"" Bush said, adding, ""Tragedies, a child drowns in a pool, and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools, it may not change it."" ABC News also asked him about his comments. Bush said that his comments were not related to the Oregon shooting and that he was broadly referring to tragedies. ""Let's make sure that we don't allow this to get out of control,"" he said. ""There are all sorts of things that happen in life, tragedies unfold."" 2. 'Free Stuff' What He Said: While speaking at an event in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, last week, Bush was asked by a voter how he would set out to attract African American voters. Bush, after citing his efforts to meet with Black ministers, set out to make the point that the Republican party could, indeed, attract black voters, a voting block that has historically leaned Democratic.  ""We should make that case because our message is one of hope and aspiration, It isn't one of division and get in line and we'll take care of you with free stuff. Our message is one that is uplifting -- that says you can achieve earned success. We're on your side, things can get better,"" Bush said. The Reaction: American Bridge sent out a video with the comments, accusing Bush of making the same mistake of insensitivity and racial polarization that Mitt Romney made back in 2012 when he said, ""your friends who like Obamacare, you remind them of this, if they want more stuff from government tell them to go vote for the other guy -- more free stuff."" Singer John Legend tweeted, a hashtag started on twitter, and a controversy brewed, some critics arguing that Bush's comments portrayed African-Americans as handout-dependent or failed to recognize the societal constructs that systematically lead to high poverty rates for African-Americans. Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson spoke about it with Larry Wilmore on the Nightly Show. ""What we’ve seen from the Republicans is that they haven't talked about race beyond immigration, that there's, like, literally no language there yet,"" Mckesson said. ""They, like, sort of start history where they want it to, in a way that erases all the people that pay with their lives. Nothing has been free. I think that all the people who died, who were the enslaved and everybody else, wouldn't say that any of this would be free."" What He Says He Meant: Bush has long said that his message is aspirational, that his policies would lead to growth for all people, voters of color included. His views have long stated that low-income families don't want to be stuck in poverty and that solutions should be designed to raise them out. ""People don't want free stuff,"" he told Fox News. ""We spend a trillion on poverty programs, and that result is the percentage of people in poverty has remained the same. We should try something different, which is to give people the capacity to achieve earned success, fix our schools, fix our economy, lessen the crime rates in the big urban areas."" 3. 'We Should Not Have a Multicultural Society' What He Said: After remarks at a diner in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Bush was speaking with a young woman who asked him how the federal government should better incorporate refugees. ""We should not have a multicultural society. We ought to have- America as a nation is so much better than the other countries because it's a set of values that people share that defines our national identity not race or ethnicity or where you come from."" The Reaction: Hillary Clinton released a video, ""GOP Candidates on Multiculturalism,"" that cuts together Bush's comments with an earlier Bush comment linking the term ""anchor babies"" to Asian-Americans. The video features controversial comments from other Republican candidates, including Donald Trump and Ben Carson, while ""America the Beautiful"" plays in the background. It stirred up conversations that Bush was unappreciative of the many cultures in this country, questioning how he could make such comments, especially with a culturally and racially mixed family. (His wife, Columba, is Mexican born). To many, it seemed as though Bush was saying that unique cultural differences should be stripped and forgotten upon coming to America. What He Says He Meant:  Bush said he was referring to multiculturalism in its most literal sense -- a phenomenon that refers to the preservation of different cultures or cultural identities within a larger society. His campaign says he was speaking out against the debate between multiculturalism vs. assimilation. He says he was advocating for all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, or creed, to unite under America and the set of shared values its people have, rather than remaining isolated in distinct cultural pockets. He has long advocated for assimilation into the larger society, writing about it in his 1994 book, ""Profiles in Character."" 4. 'People Need to Work Longer Hours' What He Said: During an interview with New Hampshire's Union Leader, Bush was commenting on how to grow the economy and said this: ""My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families."" The Reaction: That quote seems to imply that the already over-worked American workforce should work even more. This time, the DNC pounced, releasing a statement that called Bush's remarks ""easily one of the most out-of-touch comments we’ve heard so far this cycle,"" adding that Bush would not fight for the middle class as president. What He Says He Meant: Almost immediately, the Bush campaign fired back, releasing a statement that Bush was referring to the underemployed, those working part-time jobs that would rather be full-time. ""Under President Obama, we have the lowest workforce participation rate since 1977, and too many Americans are falling behind. Only Washington Democrats could be out-of-touch enough to criticize giving more Americans the ability to work, earn a paycheck, and make ends meet,"" the statement read. 5. Anchor Babies 'More Related to Asian People' What He Said: Bush came under fire in McAllen, Texas, for his repeated usage of the term anchor babies to refer to the American-born children of illegal immigrants. After being asked repeatedly by both Spanish and English media about it, he said this: ""What I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there's organized efforts -- and frankly it's more related to Asian people -- coming into our country, and having children, in that organized effort, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship."" The Reaction: Needless to say, these comments were seized by partisan and Asian-American groups. The DNC pounced, Hillary Clinton pounced, and the National Council of Asian-Pacific Americans also released a statement condemning ""the use of the derogatory term 'anchor babies.'"" What He Says He Meant: Bush and his spokeswoman both said he was referring to the birth tourism industry, in which women travel to the United States with the explicit purpose of obtaining citizenship for their child. There are companies created just for facilitating this purpose. Many news organizations, including this one, have reported on it. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2015-10-04 07:33:10,What Jeb Bush Says vs. What He Means,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

What's clear is that one avenue for Clinton to beat Sanders -- for Sanders to beat himself by running out of cash after the first round of early states -- is now closed. Sanders has his war chest, and an ability to replenish it via small-dollar donors that the Clinton apparatus can't match. What's becoming clear is that any strategy that depends on outside money to boost a candidate is basing that strategy on hope, not history. If anything, this election cycle has shown the limits of Super PACs -- think Rick Perry and Scott Walker. The Clinton campaign has weapons left to deploy, including, of course, Bill Clinton.

The Florida senator will use a foreign-policy forum in this first-in-the-nation caucus state to outline a series of steps he would take as president to isolate Mr. Putin and his inner circle in the escalating standoff between the two Cold War foes. Mr. Rubio will call for new sanctions against top Russian officials and companies, including oil and gas giant Gazprom. He will promise to provide arms and intelligence to Ukraine.

And to judge them, to sound like you’re judging them – B. CARSON: I’m not judging them at all, but, you know, these incidents continue to occur. I doubt that this will be the last one. I want to plant the seed in people’s minds so that if this happens again, you know, they don’t all get killed. But to be fair, Carson isn't saying he'd rush the shooter alone. He's saying he'd organize everyone to do so together. Because talking over gunfire to get panicked people to act in effective unison, knowing that some of them will be killed in the process, is such a breeze.

Not fair! So, and good to know, we now have it from both Ben Carson and Donald Trump that when Ben Carson was imagining unleashing his own inner Couch Rambo on the mass shooter of the moment, he was not specifically saying that the people who did get shot were doing it wrong. They just didn't Couch Rambo fast enough. There's an interesting exploration to be had in how the various would-be heroes of America's now-regular mass shootings think they, unlike all those other college students or theater patrons or elementary school kids, would Do It Better and thus save the day. We already know that having your own gun does little; if the killer(s) know you have a gun (say, because we're now arming our teachers as regular policy) that simply makes you the first target, and even if they do not it's highly likely that by the time you figure out what's going on and who to shoot the police will already be in close enough proximity to make that a very bad idea. We're told that if Couch Rambo was there, he would have tackled the shooter, but at each of these things victims attempt exactly that and even when you throw trained Army vets into the mix it seldom goes as well as Couch Rambo supposes it would have. But it's integral to gun culture, this notion that if you had been facing a bad guy you and your gun or your finely honed Couch Rambo reflexes would have saved the day, as opposed to all the things that are tens of thousands of times more likely to happen, like accidentally shooting your neighbor or your child finding your gun and shooting someone else or you drunkenly putting a hole through your own leg during one of the seemingly countless times you have your weapon of self-defense in your lap in order to ""clean"" it again.

We found children subjected to solitary confinement; mental health problems; physical and mental abuse; racial inequities; lives ruined forever at an early age. We found a system that’s supposed to help kids, but often sets them adrift. Presented by entrepreneur, music mogul and activist Russell Simmons and narrated by “Empire” actress Gabourey Sidibe, this hourlong documentary investigation [...] is a story about how to take children and ostracize them, derange them, outlaw them.

Dionne Jr. at The Washington Post writes—The conservative evasion on guns: Politicians who go on about American greatness should be ashamed of saying that the United States is the one and only nation that can’t act effectively to solve a problem every other free and democratic country has contained. Obama’s speech charged politicians to lead with gun control legislation, but he left out the more obvious point: Congress’s makeup needs to change if there’s any hope of ever passing the most basic of gun control legislation, universal background checks. This starts with targeting vulnerable pro-gun politicians and replacing them with Democrats or Republicans who better represent public opinion. And no one is more vulnerable than Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who faces reelection in a presidential swing state in 2016. George Zornick at The Nation writes—The Oregon Sheriff’s Position on Gun Control Is More Radical Than We Think: The letter has been widely reported in the media, but, in fairness to Hanlin, we don’t yet know if his apparent reluctance to enforce gun-control laws—including some recently passed Oregon measures—might have made it easier for the shooter, Chris Mercer, to carry out his plan. Given that Mercer only recently moved to the area, perhaps not. But Hanlin’s letter deserves close scrutiny nonetheless, because Hanlin is not alone. Hundreds of sheriffs across the country have sent similar letters, and if their actions match their words, already weak American gun control laws are being subtly loosened and disregarded by law-enforcement professionals nationwide. If we do, well, we have it. But if we don’t, and I believe that most of us don’t, then we have to start thinking about ways to not only keep guns out of the wrong hands, but also about how we slow or reverse the proliferation of guns. If there is one thing that my brother’s collection has taught me, it is that guns outlive their owners. These hundreds of millions of guns will most likely be part of our society for decades, and some even for centuries, regardless of what laws we pass now. That is something of which we should truly be afraid. People don’t just like and support Planned Parenthood because one in three women have abortions and 95% don’t regret them, though that’s certainly part of it. People love Planned Parenthood because women (and men) across the country have gone there when they couldn’t go anywhere else. They’ve gotten STI tests, breast exams, pap smears, birth control – and yes, abortions. Planned Parenthood has helped them – saved them, even – and that’s something people don’t soon forget. That’s why whenever Republicans make moves to defund the beloved organization, women have protested en masse. It’s why when breast cancer organization Susan G Komen for the Cure tried to take away $600,000 in grants from Planned Parenthood in 2012, they had to backtrack within days. Women were so furious – cutting up pictures of Komen’s pink ribbons, leaving thousands of posts on its Facebook wall and sending well over a million tweets – that Planned Parenthood raised over $3m in enraged donations. Her campaign insisted it was on target to raise $100 million this year, while the Sanders campaign said it had already reached its $40 million goal for competing in the Iowa caucus in February. In the Republican primary, Ben Carson, campaigning as a nonpolitician, reported an impressive $20 million for the quarter from more than 350,000 donors. [...] Whatever his fate before the voters, Mr. Sanders has shown that it’s possible to amass a war chest from ordinary people who are sick and tired of big money politics. But yesterday, the 50-year-old fund, widely viewed as one of the nation’s most popular and most successful land conservation programs, was allowed to expire completely. Despite broad bipartisan support, and despite a deadline that was no surprise to anyone, Congress failed to take action to reauthorize it. That means that offshore oil and gas producers will no longer be paying into the chest that funds the program — and now that the funding connection has been broken, reinstating it will be very difficult, especially given the tone of this Congress. Instead, lawmakers will be dickering over how to divvy up former LWCF appropriations, which will now be going into the general treasury. [...] So what’s likely to happen next? “This is a sad day for everyone who cares about our national parks and outdoor conservation, recreation and wildlife. Congress has broken an enduring promise to the American people,” said Alan Rowsome, senior director at the Wilderness Society and co-chair of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition, in a statement. But the coalition, the outdoor recreation industry, other conservation groups, and Backcountry Hunters and Anglers aren’t just  mourning the program’s loss—they’ll be kicking efforts into high gear to get the LWCF reauthorized as quickly as possible. You will hear much about the importance of the TPP for “free trade.” The reality is that this is an agreement to manage its members’ trade and investment relations – and to do so on behalf of each country’s most powerful business lobbies. Make no mistake: It is evident from the main outstanding issues, over which negotiators are still haggling, that the TPP is not about “free” trade. [...] It should surprise no one that America’s international agreements produce managed rather than free trade. That is what happens when the policymaking process is closed to non-business stakeholders – not to mention the people’s elected representatives in Congress. And Old Energy is engaged in a systematic effort to blacken the image of renewable energy, one that closely resembles the way it has supported “experts” willing to help create a cloud of doubt about climate science. An example: Earlier this year Newsweek published an op-ed article purporting to show that the true cost of wind power was much higher than it seems. But it turned out that the article contained major factual errors, and its author had failed to disclose that he was the Charles W. Koch professor at Utah State, and a fellow of a Koch- and ExxonMobil-backed think tank. The Obama administration has a long and tortured history with the smog rule; the EPA moved to strengthen it in 2011 but was overruled by the White House. Now the administration has finally imposed a new rule, only it’s too lax and four years too late. EPA is lowering the definition of a safe level for ozone from below 75 parts per billion to 70 ppb. [...] The EPA presents the rule as a victory for clean air. [...] The American Lung Association argues that lives will be lost to EPA’s political timidity, noting that EPA’s own analysis last year found that a 60 ppb standard would have prevented up to 7,900 premature deaths, 1.8 million childhood asthma attacks, and 1.9 million missed school days. “The EPA’s independent scientific advisors reviewed the evidence and concluded that a level of 60 ppb would provide more public health protection than a standard of 70 ppb,” said American Lung Association President Harold Wimmer in a statement. During her tenure in the Obama administration, Clinton, by her own frequent boastful admission, was the hawk in the Cabinet pressuring the president to be even more aggressive in his drone assassinations and murderous air wars, which have destabilized the region and created what the pope recently termed the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. But it is the still troubled economy that will dominate the election, and it is the failure of the Democratic Party establishment—now represented singularly by Clinton—to deal with the lingering recession that explains the startling rise of Bernie Sanders as a viable candidate.",2015-10-05 07:30:08,Abbreviated pundit round-up: Gun laws; Planned Parenthood fights back; new smog law not tough enough,,115,http://www.dailykos.com
802,http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/PA8jm1W8lJQ/-Abbreviated-pundit-roundup-Trump-gun-control-and-more,"Taking a page out of the National Rifle Association’s playbook, Trump then laid responsibility for gun violence at the feet of the mentally ill. But he abstained even from advocating for more screening and services for mental illness. In other words, Trump, like other conservative politicians he claims to disdain, shrugged. Trump, a man who prides himself on his great willingness to speak the politically incorrect truth, dared not offend his base. Trump, who considers himself unrestrained by special interests, paid obeisance to perhaps the most powerful special interest in the country, the gun lobby (from which he seems to have cribbed his own gun policy proposals). Trump, the self-proclaimed strongman, is now mysteriously impotent. Greg Sargent interviews Adam Winkler, a professor of Constitutional law at the University of California: WINKLER: The first thing we should do is require a background check on every single gun purchase. We know background checks work. Since the partial background check system went into effect in the mid-nineties, well over one million people have been denied the ability to purchase a gun. One million felons, mentally ill, and other prohibited persons were turned away. Some of those people may have found other ways to get guns. But the easiest way for them to get guns was shut off. There’s a gun-control Catch 22. Gun rights advocates claim gun control won’t work. And they water down every legislative proposal, such that it won’t work. Then when the killing continues, they say, “look, gun control doesn’t work.” But it doesn’t work because of loopholes that have been put in by gun enthusiasts. The background check system would work a lot better if it required everyone who purchased a gun to go through a background check. Force every criminal into the black market. Don’t let criminals go to a private seller to buy a gun. The other thing we need to do is increase funding for research on gun violence prevention. This is a major public health crisis that takes the lives of up to 30,000 people per year. And there’s almost no federal money that goes into research on how to reduce gun violence. Blair’s trainees run through a number of real-world scenarios—“force on force training” that’s designed to “inoculate” officers against the problems people naturally encounter in high-stress situations. That stress response, says Blair, includes “tunnel vision, audio exclusion and time dilation,” and one would expect people who weren’t trained in these situations to “freeze up or not know what to do, and to have difficulty performing actions correctly.” Yet it could hurt him in Democratic primaries. Clearly, after a summer spent losing ground to Sanders on her left, Clinton has begun an offensive on a crucial issue that could have Sanders playing defense. In a season marked by shocking multiple gun-killings from Charleston, South Carolina, to Roanoke, Virginia, to Roseburg, Oregon, the former New York senator has raised the issue of gun control with steadily rising fervor. His online dominance is striking: Over the past two months, on Twitter alone, he has been mentioned in 6.3 million conversations, eight times as many as Republican rivals like Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson — not to mention more than three times as many as Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly four times as many as Bernie Sanders. He is retweeted more than twice as often as Mrs. Clinton and about 13 times more frequently than Jeb Bush, according to data compiled as of Friday by Edelman Berland, a market research firm that studies social media. His Twitter following (4.36 million) dwarfs that of the rest of the Republican field, and in the coming weeks, he is expected to surpass Mrs. Clinton (4.39 million). In an interview at his office — interrupted repeatedly by Mr. Trump’s picking up his Samsung Galaxy cellphone, loading new tweets with his index finger and marveling at his nonstop mentions (“Watch this!” he implored) — the candidate compared his Twitter feed to a newspaper with a single, glorious voice: his own. Whereas Carter advocated racial and sexual equality, cornerstones of a ""just society"" and articles of faith for 19th century evangelicals, Reagan opposed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Reagan opened his 1980 general election campaign in, of all places, Philadelphia, Miss., the site of the brutal slayings of three civil rights workers by the Ku Klux Klan 16 summers earlier. In his speech at the Neshoba County Fair on Aug. 3, Reagan proclaimed his support for ""states rights,"" coded language employed by a generation of Southern segregationists. [...] What did evangelicals gain by selling their birthright to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and to the Republican Party thereafter? It's a very good question — and one that evangelicals should ponder carefully as they approach yet another election. Yes, politically conservative evangelicals have indeed neglected the teachings of Jesus and defaulted on the noble legacy of 19th-century evangelicalism, which invariably took the part of those on the margins, including women and minorities. But Trump is not responsible for these lapses. He is simply reaping the benefits of a much earlier defection.",2015-10-06 07:45:59,"Abbreviated pundit roundup: Trump, gun control and more",,115,http://www.dailykos.com

And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America next week or a couple of months from now.""  Obama pointed out that America has extraordinary levels of gun violence compared to other developed countries, which researchers widely attribute to the easy access to firearms in the US. ""We don't yet know why this individual did what he did, and it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds,"" Obama said. ""But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."" He added, ""Somehow, this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."" Obama concluded his remarks by emphasizing that he will bring this issue up again and again, urging the public to push Congress and state legislatures to pass new gun control measures. ""Each time this happens, I am going to say that we can actually can do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws,"" he said. ""I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that — and that's terrible to say. And it can change."" Javier Zarracina/Vox The US has very high levels of gun violence: America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and 15 times as many as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian's Simon Rogers. In fact, no other developed country comes close to the levels of gun violence, including suicides, or gun ownership that America has, as this chart from Tewksbury Lab shows:  The correlation this chart demonstrates — more guns mean more gun deaths — has been backed by a lot of research. Whether at the state or country level, reviews of the studies by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center have consistently found that places with more guns have more deaths after controlling for variables like socioeconomic factors and other crime. ""Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,"" David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center's director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. This is widely believed by some experts to be the consequence of America's relaxed policy approach to and culture of guns: Making more guns more accessible means more guns, and more guns mean more deaths. Researchers have found this not just with general homicides, but also with suicides, domestic violence, and even violence against police. Maybe some Americans can look at these statistics and studies and still decide that the right to bear arms should be protected and gun control is a bad policy. But given the research, America's policies and attitudes toward guns have clear, deadly costs. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

President Obama really doesn't want to give another speech after a mass shooting; a major Senate criminal-justice reform bill; and why DMV closures in Alabama could be a voter-suppression issue. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Mary Wilson/Getty Images A mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon killed at least 10 people and injured at least seven. The suspect, who's been identified as a 20-year-old male, died at the scene. One witness said the shooter asked people to stand and ""state their religion"" and then started firing. Another witness was tweeting from inside the building — prompting several reporters to ask to get in touch with her. This was treated as deeply offensive, but it's really the ugly nature of breaking news reporting. President Obama issued both a written statement and spoken remarks. The second is as angry as Obama publicly gets: ""This is something we should politicize."" This summer, Obama told the BBC that his biggest frustration as President was Congress' failure to pass gun control legislation in the face of ""repeated mass shootings."" It might seem like mass shootings happen all the time now. But whether they're really getting more frequent depends on how you define ""mass shooting."" VIDEO: President Obama addresses the Oregon shooting  Win McNamee/Getty Images Here's what you need to know about the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, the major, bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill introduced in the Senate today: 1) The bill is a compromise — not just between Republicans and Democrats, but between supporters of criminal-justice reform and Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (who's gone from staunch opposition to some form of support). 2) It doesn't eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, but it weakens them — not just for drug offenses, but also for people who had a gun on them when committing another crime. 3) It will not singlehandedly solve mass incarceration. Most prisoners are in state prisons, and the plurality of them are in for violent crimes. 4) But the bill is not supposed to be a model for the states. The states are way ahead of the federal government on criminal-justice reform. 5) The bill restores some power to judges, and theoretically takes it away from prosecutors. But there are plenty of ways that an aggressive prosecutor can still use mandatory minimums to coerce a defendant. 6) There's a narrow window for the bill to pass. Congress probably won't want to take up a big bill in 2016, and there's a government shutdown fight to get through between now and then.   Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty The state of Alabama is closing down all but four DMVs throughout the state — leaving 29 counties without a place to get an ID. That happens to include every county where over 75 percent of residents are black. In a state where government-issued ID is required to vote — and which is overhauling its state IDs for early 2016 — that means a lot of black voters are going to need to travel a very long way to get the documentation they need to cast ballots. One of the most common criticisms of voter-ID laws is that black residents are less likely to have IDs to begin with. Some recent studies have estimated up to 20 percent of black registered voters don't have ID. It's also harder for such voters to get ID. 1.2 million black eligible voters live more than 10 miles from the nearest ID-issuing office (that's open more than 2 days a week). The federal government is currently arguing lawsuits against several voter-ID laws, including a particularly aggressive one in North Carolina. But Alabama pundit John Archibald thinks the DMV closures are practically an ""invitation"" for the DOJ to take on Alabama next.

The gun-control debate rejoined; the share of Americans in the workforce is at its lowest since 1977; and the Secretary of Education resigns. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Scott Olson/Getty Images The Douglas County Sheriff's Department has released the names of the victims in yesterday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. Meanwhile, the ATF recovered 13 weapons belonging to shooter Chris Harper Mercer: six that he took with him to the college, and seven at his home. All were legally purchased. The biographical details that have emerged for Mercer fit the cultural stereotype for mass shooters: he was a loner who was very easily irritated and clearly disturbed. That stereotype is a trap. Mental health doesn't predict mass shootings. There are behavioral factors associated with violence — mental health isn't one of them. And when it comes to mass shootings, those behavioral factors are too broad to predict behavior at all — unless you're going to lock up every ""angry young man."" It's much easier to regulate guns than people. Not everyone wants to do either. Jeb Bush was criticized by liberals for, during a town hall in South Carolina, using the phrase ""stuff happens"" in a discussion about mass shootings. Bush's full argument, as Brian Beutler points out, wasn't that the shooting wasn't tragic; it was that sometimes, policy motivated by the reflexive urge to ""do something"" costs more in lost freedoms than it gains in prevention. In the abstract, Bush has a point. See this 2007 article by David Foster Wallace, which uses similar logic to talk about lost freedom in the War on Terror.   Bill Pugliano/Getty Images September was a really disappointing month for jobs. The US added only 142,000 — way below the 200,000 or more that economists were predicting. The sluggish growth is probably due to continued global insecurity (notably in China). That insecurity kept the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates last month. The jobs report could keep them from raising interest rates in December, too. The more depressing statistic is that labor force participation rate — the fraction of all Americans over 16 who are working (as opposed to unemployed or simply not looking for work) — is the lowest it's been since 1977. The falling participation rate is a long-term trend during the Obama administration. Some of it is due to slow business growth. But some is simply due to Baby Boomer retirement and young adults staying in school onger. At the same time, though, there's still a higher-than-normal percentage of people who are underemployed — an indication that the US could still need millions more jobs. None of these rates, however — the unemployment, underemployment or nonparticipation rates — are anywhere near the 42 percent ""real unemployment rate"" claimed by current Republican front-runner Donald J. Trump. That number is just nonsense. Pool/Getty Images Education Secretary Arne Duncan has announced he'll be resigning from the Cabinet in December. Duncan's most closely associated with the ""Race to the Top"" grant program, which tried to incentivize states to carry out education reforms (and led to, among other things, the widespread adoption of Common Core curriculum standards). Teachers' unions really disliked Race to the Top, and really dislike Duncan. The NEA called for his resignation over a year ago. Unfortunately for them, Duncan's announced successor — current deputy secretary John King — is even less sympathetic to union's positions than Duncan is. With Duncan's resignation, the last remaining original member of the Obama Cabinet is...Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.

It's also part of a rolling national tragedy: roughly 33,000 Americans every year are killed with firearms (homicides, suicides, and accidents). In the abstract, it's hard to appreciate just how catastrophic this death toll is. So we made a chart to make things more concrete. It compares the number of Americans killed by guns between 2001 and 2013 to the number of Americans killed by war, AIDS, illegal drug overdoses, and terrorism combined during the same time period. It turns out that guns killed more Americans than all of those horrors put together: Javier Zarracina/Vox Javier Zarracina/Vox Here's how each of these compares specifically to gun deaths. Shootings like Orlando, where there's some suspicion the perpetrators may have links to ISIS or other terrorist groups, are relatively rare. Even in 2001, more than 10 times as many Americans were killed by guns in any incident linked to terrorism. In an average year between 2002 and 2011, there were roughly a thousand times as many Americans killed by guns as by terrorism: (Javier Zarracina/Vox) In total, 6,863 Americans died fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (per iCasualties); guns killed almost five times as many Americans in 2013 alone. Here's a year-by-year comparison during the heights of both wars: AIDS spread to hundreds of thousands of Americans in the '80s and '90s; when the government at first failed to confront the problem, it was rightly considered an outrage. Since then, public health campaigns have limited the spread of HIV and antiretroviral drugs prevent many people with HIV from developing AIDS. Guns kill far more Americans per year than AIDS, and yet aren't treated as a public health crisis by the US government: (Javier Zarracina/Vox) The risk of overdose deaths are one of the many reasons the US government is waging a war on drugs. Yet illegal drug overdoses kill about one-third as many Americans per year as gun-related homicides, suicides, and accidents:  Javier Zarracina/Vox Guns aren't the leading killer in the United States. Things like heart disease and cancer kill a lot more people annually than guns. The toll from guns is still quite significant; it's roughly comparable to the number of people killed by car accidents every year: (Javier Zarracina/Vox) The federal government has spent a lot of money and time trying to lower the death toll from things like car accidents and AIDS. It's waged metaphorical wars on terrorism and drugs, and literal ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, to keep Americans safe. And yet the United States won't take the most basic steps on the national level, such as requiring background checks on every gun sale in America, to reduce the death toll from guns. ""We spent over a trillion dollars, and passed countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so,"" President Obama said in an October address following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. ""And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?"" Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Assault weapons bans and background checks aren’t enough to get American gun violence down to acceptable levels. One of the more memorable aspects of former President Barack Obama's time in office (which feel conspicuously absent under his successor) were his speeches after mass shootings, speeches that became a bit of a morbid ritual, given how regularly the shootings occur. Over time, they grew angrier, more emotional, and more disgusted at America's gun violence problem and Congress's unwillingness to do literally anything to stop it. ""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,"" Obama declared after the Pulse shooting in Orlando, the 133rd mass shooting of 2016. ""And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well."" But let's be clear about precisely what kind of decision is letting events like this recur, most recently in Dayton and El Paso. Congress's decision not to pass background checks is not what's keeping the US from European gun violence levels. The expiration of the assault weapons ban is not behind the gap. What's behind the gap, plenty of research indicates, is that Americans have more guns. The statistics are mind-blowing: America has 4.4 percent of the world's population but almost half of its civilian-owned guns. Realistically, a gun control plan that has any hope of getting us down to European levels of violence is going to mean taking a huge number of guns away from a huge number of gun owners. Other countries have done exactly that. Australia, for example, enacted a mandatory gun buyback that achieved that goal, and saw firearm suicides fall as a result. But the reforms those countries enacted are far more dramatic than anything US politicians are calling for — and even they wouldn't get us to where many other developed countries are. Think about it this way. In 2013, the US had 106.4 gun deaths per million people. That same year, the UK endured 144 gun deaths total — or 2.2 gun deaths per million people. To get to UK levels, we'd need to reduce gun deaths by over 98 percent. Even if we wanted to reach the same levels as Switzerland — the country with the third-highest rate of gun deaths in the OECD grouping of developed nations, after Mexico and the US — we'd need to drop from 106.4 deaths per million to 30.1, more than a 71 percent reduction. And here's the truth: Even the most ardent gun control advocates aren't pushing measures that could close the gap. Not even close. Plenty of research has found a strong correlation between the amount of guns in an area and its gun homicide rate. Countries with more guns have more gun homicides. States with more guns have more gun homicides. Individuals with guns in the house are likelier to be killed or to kill themselves with guns. So Australia's 1996 gun control was based on a simple idea: They took away a bunch of guns. After a 28-year-old man killed 35 people at the Port Arthur historic prison colony in Tasmania, Australia, a popular tourist destination, Prime Minister John Howard and his right-wing Liberal Party banned the importation of all semiautomatic and automatic rifles and shotguns, instituted a mandatory national buyback program for such guns, and convinced state governments to ban the weapons outright. In total, about 650,000 weapons — 20 percent of the country's total arsenal by some estimates — were seized and destroyed. Evaluations after the reforms suggest that they saved lives. A study by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University estimated that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people led to a statistically significant drop in firearm suicides — 74 percent, in fact, with no parallel increase in non-firearm suicides. While gun control opponents have tried to rebut those results, those responses have been riddled with methodological flaws, and even some of the study's critics have conceded that the laws likely cut down on suicides. The results on homicides were a little less clear. Leigh and Neill found that the buyback resulted in a 35 to 50 percent decline in the gun homicide rate, but because of the low number of homicides in Australia normally, this change wasn't statistically significant. Supporters of Australia's policy often argue that no mass shootings have occurred since, which is only true for a certain restrictive definition, as in 2014 a man shot himself, his wife, and their three children in a murder-suicide in rural New South Wales. There have also been a number of non-gun massacres in the years since the Port Arthur massacre. Also in 2014, a mother in a suburb of Cairns, Queensland, allegedly stabbed to death seven of her own children and one niece. In 2000, a man burned a backpackers' hostel to the ground in Childers, Queensland, killing 15. But the homicide and mass shooting results are almost beside the point. Nearly two-thirds of gun deaths in the US are suicides. If we can reduce them by 74 percent, we'd be saving more than 15,000 lives every year. That doesn't get us to where most developed countries are, but it gets us somewhere near the ballpark of Switzerland. So could it happen in the US? The legal scholars I talked to suggested that an Australia-style program would probably pass muster. If we went further than Australia and also banned handguns, that might cause problems; the Supreme Court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008. But Australia's actual system is probably constitutional. ""Courts have consistently upheld bans on military-style semiautomatic rifles because other firearms are equally useful for self-defense,"" Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA and author of Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, says. ""Gun control isn't stalled because of the Second Amendment. It's stalled because elected officials won't pass effective new laws to reduce gun violence."" Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas Austin and author of the landmark article ""The Embarrassing Second Amendment,"" concurs: ""If such an extraordinary law actually got through Congress (meaning with necessary Republican support), then I find it impossible to imagine that there would be five votes on the Court to say no,"" he says. ""But the real problem, of course, is that there’s not a snowball’s chance in hell of Congress actually passing any meaningful legislation re guns, let alone this kind of quite radical legislation."" And there's the rub. Former President Obama occasionally cited Australia in discussions about gun control, but proposals he and congressional Democrats put forward stopped far, far short of what Australia's done. Obama's plan to tackle gun violence focused on universal background checks for gun sales, banning assault weapons again, and increasing criminal penalties for illicit gun traffickers. That's nowhere near as dramatic as taking 20 percent of America's guns off the street. Australia provides strong evidence that a form of gun control can save lives. But it's a form of gun control that's too dramatic for most mainstream American politicians to embrace. Milder, easier-to-pass changes would probably also save lives. But the effect sizes are, unsurprisingly, smaller, and vary considerably depending on the study you're looking at. For example, researchers have found that: There are a few promising items there, especially when it comes to gun licensing. But taken together, this doesn't look like an agenda that can get the US to European rates of gun deaths. If you go by the Connecticut experience, licensing can nearly halve gun homicides — but that's by far the most promising finding. Missouri's experience suggests a much smaller effect. And the effects of various interventions aren't additive. An assault weapons ban implemented without universal background checks is going to be more effective than one implemented alongside them, because some of the violence you're trying to prevent would've been foiled by either policy alone. I asked David Hemenway, a professor at Harvard's public health school who has co-authored dozens of papers on the effects of guns and gun regulation on mortality, if he thought these kinds of smaller-bore reforms could have a big enough effect to bring the US down to European levels. ""It's all speculation,"" he replied. ""I suspect it would take a while (decades) for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a) we have so many guns which are durable, and b) we have a gun culture — we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countries."" It might be easier if there are positive feedback loops, he says — ""if the rival gang doesn't have guns, our gang has less need of guns"" — but it'll be an uphill battle. Worse, even these milder-than-Australia policies are considerably more ambitious than legislation with a chance of passing Congress. The Manchin-Toomey bill, the only post-Newtown gun legislation to even come close to becoming law, didn't even establish universal background checks, let alone mandate individual licensing, as Connecticut's law does. ""Even getting half or a quarter of the way down to other nations would save a lot of lives,"" Hemenway emphasizes. That's undoubtedly true. Background checks, licensing requirements, and the like are positive steps. They save lives, and states should pass them. But America will still be a gun violence outlier, even with them. Research on guns is murky. It's necessarily an area where it's hard to do rigorous experimental research, so most studies are conducted after the fact, raising all kind of methodological challenges. That means it's good to be skeptical of big claims from single studies — e.g., that licensing and background checks alone could cut gun homicides by 40 percent. But we have accumulated some general knowledge all the same. Perhaps the single most supported contention in all of gun research is that more guns mean more gun deaths. The US doesn't just have a gun violence problem because of its lax gun regulation. It has a problem because it has a culture that encourages large-scale gun possession, and other countries do not. That, combined with Australia's experience, makes large-scale confiscation look like easily the most promising approach for bringing US gun homicides down to European rates. Large-scale confiscation is not going to happen. That's no reason to stop advocating it. (I also want to repeal all immigration laws and give everyone a monthly check from the government with no strings attached, and will argue for those ideas even though they're not politically viable.) But it does mean that we should be realistic about what gun control with an actual shot of passage can achieve. It can make us safer. It cannot make us Europe. Unless something dramatic changes, gun violence will remain a distinctly American problem for the rest of our lives — background checks or no. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

On Tuesday, Ben Carson said he would react to a mass shooting like the one in Oregon by attacking the gunman: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Until now, there didn't seem to be a way to verify the Republican presidential candidate's claim. Would he really react that way in such a tense situation?  On Wednesday, Carson told SiriusXM radio host Karen Hunter that he had been held at gunpoint before. But in his telling, he did not react as he said he would, and he definitely did not attack the gunman: I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeyes [in Baltimore]. … A guy comes in, puts the gun in my ribs, and I just said, ""I believe that you want the guy behind the counter."" … He said, ""Oh, okay."" Twitter quickly mocked the anecdote, noting that Carson's story suggests he put someone else's life in danger to protect himself.  BEN CARSON AT THE OREGON SHOOTING: ""I believe you want the principal.""    @drewmagary Ben Carson at Ford's Theater: ""HE'S the President Mr. Booth""   The broader point is that nobody knows how they would react in this kind of scenario. As Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver psychology professor, told the New Republic, ""When you are in a life or death situation, sometimes your autonomic nervous system takes over and you may not behave the way you thought you would. … There are some factors that might make someone more likely to freeze versus run versus perhaps fight back, but it's not a real straightforward generalization that you can make."" So people like Carson can think up all sorts of fantasies about how they'd react if held at gunpoint, but they can't know for sure if that's how they would act under pressure. And suggesting that the victims of the Oregon shooting somehow reacted poorly — as Carson did — comes off as victim blaming. What's worse, someone did try to fight the Oregon shooter — and it didn't work out, as the New York Times's Alan Rappeport reported: ""The heavily armed Oregon gunman killed nine people before taking his own life. The fact that an Army veteran who did try to stop him was shot multiple times and remains hospitalized underscores the risks of attacking an armed attacker, as numerous critics pointed out Tuesday."" Then again, if someone, like Carson, doesn't want to discuss the policy solutions to this type of gun violence — like gun control — maybe fantasies are his best talking point.

Or, as Jeb Bush put it on Friday: “stuff happens.” “We’re in a difficult time in our country and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this,” the former Florida governor said at a campaign event. “It’s very sad to see, and I resist this notion because we had this challenge as governor – stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” From frontrunner Hillary Clinton to the self-declared socialist but firearm-regulation moderate Bernie Sanders, liberals danced – delicately and less so – around what Barack Obama on Thursday called “a political choice” to not enact stricter gun laws. Conservatives were quick to jump on the president’s “reflexive” remarks, though even Donald Trump was already calling for mental health reform – and Bush found himself defending another out-of-context gaffe. Perhaps none of the 21 contenders for the White House was more immediately forceful in a call for reform than former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. “Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day,” the long-shot Democrat wrote on Twitter, pre-empting Obama’s phrase that “thoughts and prayers” were not enough, even hours after the mass shooting. Clinton said the pattern of mass killings -- the Umpqua shooting was the 994th such incident in the US since Obama’s reelection in late 2012 -- was “beyond my comprehension”. “We have got to have the political will to keep people safe,” she told reporters in Boston on Thursday evening. “I know there is way to have sensible gun control measures that prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands and save lives.” Clinton has pledged to “take on the gun lobby” and push for universal background checks if elected. Further, she said at a recent private fundraiser that the US supreme court “was wrong on the second amendment”, which protects the right to bear arms. Sanders, the Vermont senator who is a relative moderate on gun control, said he was “horrified by these never-ending mass shootings” and went on to advocate for a variety of legislative measures instead of “shouting at each other”. “We need a comprehensive approach,” Sanders said in a statement on Thursday evening. “We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help then need when they need it.” Republicans, with their broad presidential field and wide constituency of gun owners, veered from contemplative to combative in responding to the Roseburg shooting. They tended to focus on mental illness and a “focus on the facts”, not background checks or what Obama openly said was “something we should politicize”. Trump, the Republican frontrunner who said in the wake of the August shooting of a television news crew in Virginia that the firearm crisis “isn’t a gun problem, it’s a mental health problem”, struck a similar tone after the Oregon tragedy. “It sounds like another mental health problem,” the real-estate mogul told the Washington Post. “So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork. We have to really get to the bottom of it. It’s so hard to even talk about these things, because you see them and it’s such a tragedy. It’s happening more and more. I just don’t remember – years back, I just don’t remember these things happening. Certainly not with this kind of frequency.” At an event in Dubuque, Iowa on Friday morning, Florida senator Marco Rubio described the shooting in Oregon as a “horrible tragedy”. “Our country needs to examine and not immediately talk about what they use to kill people and focus on why it is this violence is happening,” he said. “In some cases it is mental illness, in others we just don’t know. We need to really focus on the facts before we take hard positions.” The Republican insisted that “the reflexive reaction on the left is to say we need more gun laws” but that “there’s just no evidence that these gun laws would prevent these shootings”. Rubio also criticized Obama’s speech on the tragedy: “I don’t think the solutions he’s proposing will create a solution. This is a complex issue that may not have a federal solution.” Ohio governor John Kasich, who came under fire from the National Rifle Association in the 1990s for voting for the assault weapons ban while serving in Congress, echoed Trump’s concern about mental illness. “If we look at these cases a lot of these people have mental illness – and that’s one of the areas where we’ve really fallen down,” Kasich told NBC. “We are not treating the mentally ill. We are not making sure that someone who is mentally ill can’t get access to a gun.” Bush, the former Florida governor, almost immediately tweeted his condolences to the Oregon victims on Thursday. At a campaign event on Friday in Greenville, South Carolina, however, Bush seemed to accept mass shootings as a basic reality of American life. “Stuff happens,” he told voters, according to a tweet from the New Yorker staff writer Ryan Lizza, which quickly went viral. A spokesman for the Bush campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, just one week after Bush -- currently in a make-or-break moment in the Republican nominating contest -- found himself under fire from black voters over a comment about “free stuff”, which was also largely taken out of context. But in response to a followup question from Lizza on Friday, Bush doubled down: “No, it wasn’t a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong?” Seeing a campaign gaffe in the making, the reporter pushed the governor: “Well you said, ‘Stuff happens’.” “Things happen all the time,” Bush replied. “There – is that better?” Barack Obama, asked at a White House event on Friday about the comments, responded: “I don’t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that an make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple months, we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening’.” It was former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, as usual, who took a much more pointed stance launching a strident attack on Obama’s forceful statement from the White House. “We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy,” Huckabee said in a statement. “What kind of gun was used? How did the shooter obtain it? What is the motive? Does the shooter have a history of mental illness? Was this an act of terror? “With few facts, Obama is quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda. For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory.” The Oregon shooter, federal officials said on Friday, obtained 13 guns in his possession legally.

Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  The Daily Show's Trevor Noah is pissed off at Ben Carson for blaming the victims of the Oregon shooting. On Tuesday, the Republican presidential candidate described on Fox News how he would handle a mass shooting: ""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'"" Carson has doubled down on the comments since then, telling Fox News's Megyn Kelly, ""If you sit there and let him shoot you one by one, you're all going to be dead."" Noah was quick to point out that this sounds a lot like victim blaming. ""Let him shoot you? What do you mean, let him shoot you? What do you really expect the victims to do?"" He added, ""This guy would make the worst hostage negotiator ever. 'All right, sir, I need you to stay calm and put your gun down. Everyone else, rush him! Rush him now! How many people are dead? Well, at least it wasn't everyone.'"" Not only are Carson's comments offensive, but they misunderstand basic psychology. As Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver psychology professor, told the New Republic, blaming the victim in these situations misunderstands how people's brains work in times of crises. ""When you are in a life or death situation, sometimes your autonomic nervous system takes over and you may not behave the way you thought you would,"" she said. ""There are some factors that might make someone more likely to freeze versus run versus perhaps fight back, but it's not a real straightforward generalization that you can make."" That's why these imaginary heroic scenarios play out better in the movies, and when Carson's advice happens in real life, people tend to get hurt — exactly what happened in the Oregon shooting. Get More: Comedy Central,Funny Videos,Funny TV Shows  As the New York Times's Alan Rappeport reported, ""The heavily armed Oregon gunman killed nine people before taking his own life. The fact that an Army veteran who did try to stop him was shot multiple times and remains hospitalized underscores the risks of attacking an armed attacker, as numerous critics pointed out Tuesday."" This highlights another problem with Carson's comments: It took someone who has been trained for combat scenarios to try to act. Most other people are — justifiably — paralyzed by fear in these situations, and they don't have the training to overcome that fear. So expecting a large group of people to charge at the shooter is simply unrealistic, on top of coming off as victim blaming. So instead of suggesting that people attack shooters, a safer way to end gun violence may be preventing it from happening in the first place. ""I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away"" One way to do that is gun control: The US has more gun deaths than other developed nations because, according to the research, Americans have more guns, and more guns mean more gun deaths. So reducing the number of guns — by limiting access to them, or by immediately cutting the supply of them through, for example, buyback programs— would very likely lead to fewer gun deaths. But Carson is against gun control, writing on Monday, ""As a doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking — but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away."" Perhaps that explains Carson's comments: If he's unwilling to look at real solutions, fantasies are all he has left.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

813,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/gunman-in-oregon-massacre-was-turned-away-from-firearms-academy-when-instructor-found-him-weird/,"The gunman slain by police after he killed his English professor and eight others at an Oregon college was once turned away from a firearms academy by an instructor who recalled finding him ""weird"" and ""a little bit too anxious"" for high-level weapons training. Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, who moved to Oregon from the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, California, was officially identified on Friday as the assailant in the rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, which ranks as the deadliest among dozens of U.S. mass shootings in the past two years. According to accounts of survivors, the gunman stormed into the classroom of his introductory writing class to shoot the professor at point-blank range, then began picking off other victims one at a time as he questioned each about their religion and whether they were Christians. Harper-Mercer had a monthlong stint in the Army in 2008 and a preoccupation with weaponry that dated back at least two years. He sought to register for training in 2012 or 2013 at Seven 4 Para, a private self-defense and law enforcement training academy in Torrance, but Eloy Way, president and head instructor for the center, said he sent Harper-Mercer away. ""We wanted him to take a beginner safety course and he was trying to tell me that he already had experience with firearms and I didn't get a good feeling about him, so I turned him down,"" Way told Reuters. ""He was just kind of a weird guy and seemed kind of spoiled, immature,"" Way said. ""He was a little bit too anxious to get high-level training and there was no reason for it."" Authorities have disclosed little of what they may know about the gunman's motives. The shooter left behind a ""multipage, hated-filled"" statement in the classroom, according to a Twitter message from an NBC reporter, citing multiple law enforcement sources who were not identified. CNN, citing sources, said the statement showed animosity toward blacks. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who has vowed never to say the gunman's name, declined to comment when asked about the writings at a news conference. INTEREST IN IRA Harper-Mercer was born in the United Kingdom and arrived in the United States as a boy, his stepsister Carmen Nesnick told CBS Los Angeles. Harper-Mercer, who identified himself as ""mixed race"" on a social networking site, enlisted in the U.S. Army and served for about a month in 2008 before being discharged for failing to meet administrative standards, military records showed. At some point, Harper-Mercer appeared to have been sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army, a militant group that waged a violent campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland. On an undated Myspace page, he posted photos of masked IRA gunmen carrying assault rifles. Harper's victims were identified as assistant English professor Lawrence Levine, 67, and eight people believed to be his students: Quinn Cooper, 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59; Lucas Eibel, 18; Jason Johnson, 33; Sarena Moore, 44; Treven Anspach, 20; and Rebecka Carnes, 18; and Lucero Alcaraz, 19. Nine more people were wounded, three critically, before Harper-Mercer was killed in an exchange of gunfire with two police officers. One of those wounded, Chris Mintz, 30, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq, was credited with likely saving lives when he confronted the gunman outside another classroom before police arrived. Mintz drew fire that left him with seven bullet wounds and two broken legs, according to his former girlfriend. So far this year, 294 U.S. mass shootings have been reported nationwide, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The Roseburg shooting ranks as the deadliest bout of gun violence since September 2013, when a former U.S. Navy reservist working as a government contractor killed 12 people before he was slain by police at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard. About 80 shootings have occurred across the country since then that claimed at least four lives each. The Oregon shooting has led to fresh demands for stricter gun control in the United States, including an impassioned plea by President Barack Obama for political action, and statements by some Republican presidential candidates supporting the right of Americans to bear arms under the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

815,http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/republicans-and-gun-control-a-sad-mantra,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By John Cassidy Over the past few days, as family members of the nine people killed by a gunman at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, prepared to bury their loved ones, many of the G.O.P. candidates for President have been offering their thoughts on what to do—or, rather, what not to do—about gun violence. Let’s start with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is currently running second, behind Donald Trump, in the G.O.P. polls. Participating in an exchange on Facebook on Monday night, Carson recalled removing bullets from gunshot victims, and added, “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.” On Tuesday morning, Carson went on Fox News and said, “It’s the person behind the gun. Guns don’t kill people.” He didn’t stop there. Asked what he would do if a gunman walked up to him, put a gun to his head, and asked him what his religion was, Carson replied, “I’m glad you asked that question. Because not only would I probably not coöperate with them, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ” It’s hard to believe that anybody, let alone a politician running for national office, would insult the victims of a massacre by suggesting that their response had been inadequate. About the most that can be said for Carson is that he isn’t a professional politician: he’s a novice. So is Trump, who, on Tuesday, described himself as a “very big Second Amendment person,” and suggested that the problem in Umpqua was that no one on the scene, apart from the twenty-six-year-old shooter, was armed. (At least one student, an Army veteran, was carrying a gun, a few buildings away.) Trump also said that he opposed a ban on assault weapons—a proposal that he expressed support for in 2000. But, surely, the serious candidates—the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios—must have said something more consequential. Not exactly. Bush’s “stuff happens” line, which he uttered in South Carolina on Friday, has already entered the political lexicon and provided a gift to the Democrats. Rather than rehashing the debate about whether the remark was taken out of context (it wasn’t), let’s examine what Bush has said since then. After all, he’s had five more days to clarify how he would tackle gun violence. On Monday, he released a new campaign video, which said nothing about what happened in Oregon. On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, which also didn’t bring up the massacre or its aftermath. Then, on Tuesday night, Bush delivered a long speech at a Republican dinner in Iowa. Once again, he made no mention of Umpqua or guns. Perhaps that is not surprising. The recipient of an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association, Bush, during his time as governor of Florida, vigorously opposed efforts to expand gun control, and signed into law the notorious “Stand Your Ground” law. Marco Rubio, who is now leading Bush in most polls, is perhaps a more interesting case. Back in 2000, when he was running for a seat in Florida’s House of Representatives, Rubio said that he supported “reasonable restrictions” on gun sales. And after the Sandy Hook massacre, in December, 2012, Rubio’s spokesman said that Rubio would support measures to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill. Since then, though, Rubio has backtracked and cozied up to the N.R.A. While campaigning in Iowa on Friday, he said, “Criminals don’t follow gun laws. Only law-abiding people follow gun laws.” On Tuesday, appearing on NBC’s “Today” show, he said, “The laws that many are proposing would have done nothing to prevent these attacks.” Rather than focussing on measures like expanding background checks for gun purchases, “the country should examine mental illness.” Many of the other G.O.P. candidates took a similar line. “The problem is mental illness and not necessarily gun registration or gun ownership,” Rand Paul said in a radio interview. Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos, “I’m very concerned about the mental-health side of this.” On CNN’s “At This Hour,” Mike Huckabee said, “Do we need to do a better job in mental health? You bet we do.” What about Carly Fiorina, who promotes herself as a can-do, problem-solving leader? Couldn’t she say something different and less predictable? No. Fiorina, too, is a loyal supporter of the N.R.A., whose annual meeting she addressed earlier this year in a campaign-style video, boasting about her husband’s concealed-carry permits and saying, “When government takes away our guns, we are headed down a dangerous path.” On Friday, Fiorina criticized President Obama’s impassioned call for action, describing it as “premature, at best,” and “at worst, a really unfortunate politicization of this tragedy.” That was the pretty much the same thing Fiorina said in June, after Obama reacted to the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In fact, this is now the standard Republican/N.R.A. line. Each one of these massacres is regrettable and demands further study. But anybody who states the blatantly obvious—that countries with strict guns laws don’t have this problem—is politicizing the issue; they should either zip it, or confine themselves to expressing concern over mental illness. Of course, as HBO’s John Oliver pointed out over the weekend, talking about mental illness is largely a diversion, which distorts the facts about gun violence and serves to preserve the status quo. In 2013, during the Obama Administration’s effort to get some relatively minor gun-control laws through Congress, the White House proposed increasing the funding for mental-health programs and other initiatives designed to identify and help people who are potentially dangerous. Republicans in the Senate blocked the gun-control measures anyway, and no doubt they’d do the same this year if Obama were to send over a similar bill. On this issue, elected G.O.P. officials aren’t interested in reason or compromise. They are interested, primarily, in avoiding a challenge in the next election from an N.R.A.-backed candidate. In a sense, there’s nothing new here. For decades now, the N.R.A. and the rest of the gun lobby have had a grip on the Republican Party. But as the number of gun massacres has increased the consequences of this political capture have become harder to ignore. Now, in the full glare of a Presidential election, they cannot be avoided. Rather than engaging in an honest effort to address gun violence and prevent more senseless carnage, practically every G.O.P. candidate has been reduced to repeating a mantra that many of them, surely, cannot fully believe. Which, when you think about it, is pretty sad. Sad for them, and sadder still for the country. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Describing mental health as a ""topic we don't like to talk about,"" the host of Last Week Tonight shared clips showing the way in which we do talk about it using glib terms like ""wacko, psycho, cray-cray."" Oliver then detailed the many ways in which mental health is underfunded in the U.S. as it becomes a growing concern every day. But he saved his ire for politicians who immediately -- and opportunistically -- expressed concern for the deficiencies in mental health care system in the U.S. as a way to avoid talking about much-needed gun control following the Oregon shooting. “Perhaps the clearest sign of how little we want to talk about mental health is that one of the only times it’s brought up is, as we’ve seen yet again this week, in the aftermath of a mass shooting, as a means of steering the conversation away from gun control,” Oliver explained. “It seems there is nothing like a mass shooting to suddenly spark political interest mental health.” Ripping into the likes of GOP presidential nominees Trump, Carson and Huckabee,  Oliver challenged them to actually propose a solution for dealing with the issue. “Okay, fine — do it then,” he stated forcefully. “Because, if we’re going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a f*cking plan.” Watch the video below from HBO:  An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter.

818,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/what-gun-control-laws-worked-in-australia-and-britain/,"In his speech after the shooting at a community college in Oregon in which nine people died and seven were injured, US president Barack Obama acknowledged that the failure to pass meaningful gun laws has been the most frustrating and disappointing aspect of his entire presidency. He contrasted the US to Great Britain and Australia, noting that America was the only developed nation that had failed to pass “common sense gun safety laws – even in the face of repeated mass killings”. In the stark light of this judgement, it is worth revisiting what laws were introduced in Australia and Great Britain, what worked, and why. Both countries acted decisively after mass shooting outrages in 1996, although in neither case was the critical incident the first spree killing the country had experienced. In March that year, an embittered lone gun man entered a school in Dunblane, Scotland, armed with four handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He killed 16 five and six-year-old children, a teacher and then himself. In Port Arthur, Tasmania, some six weeks later, a young man with learning difficulties and two semi-automatic rifles killed 35 people. John Howard, then Australia’s newly elected prime minister, moved rapidly in the wake of the Port Arthur shooting, agreeing a new set of gun control policies for adoption by the federal government and the eight states and territories of Australia. Proposals included: Over one million firearms, almost a third of the civilian gun stock, were surrendered over the following decade. In Great Britain, although a judicial inquiry, The Cullen Report came to a cautious and measured compromise proposal, this was swept away by a strong tide of national opinion favouring a handgun ban. This led the outgoing Conservative government of John Major to prohibit all handguns down to .22 calibre and the incoming New Labour government under Tony Blair to prohibit even these smaller calibre weapons, via amendments to the 1968 Firearms Act. But, in each case, this was not the end of the story. In both countries, the new gun control laws ultimately made substantial contributions to public safety and a declining profile of firearm related violence (homicide and suicide). But the impact of the new laws was neither simple and direct, nor immediate. As the first graph below shows, the proportion of Australian homicides committed with firearms had been tracking downwards prior to 1996 as some states implemented tougher regulations in the wake of earlier shooting outrages.   Author provided The 1996 legislation contributed to the falling trend in Australian violence but for a few years after 1996, violence involving illegal, never-licensed handguns, often in the possession of drug and biker gangs, and semi-organised criminals, surfaced as a problem. But with semi-automatic rifles out of the picture, the police were better able to focus upon the criminal handgun problem. Since the new laws, Australia has experienced no further mass shootings. There is no internationally agreed definition of a mass shooting, but the FBI uses a threshold of four fatalities. A similar set of issues surfaced in Britain. For the four years following the 1997-8 handgun bans, apparent crime involving handguns seemed to double, as the second graph below shows.   UK Home Office., Author provided Several things were happening at once. First, the 1980s and 90s saw a significant upturn in gang-related activity in the UK. Many of the new young gangsters were using replica, air-weapon and imitation firearms as part of their “threat”. At the time police chiefs began referring to replica, air and BB guns as “fashion accessories”. There was also an influx of significant numbers of converted and reactivated weapons from eastern Europe. Ultimately, as the more disaggregated gun violence trends in the graph reveal, Britain was develop a unique “junk gun” economy. British law enforcement was also undergoing a steep learning curve in terms of understanding and responding to gun violence. The 2006 Violent Crime Reduction Act addressed the availability and misuse of these air weapons and imitation guns allowing police, who were by now deploying new ballistic and forensic tracing technologies, to focus more intelligently upon crimes involving real firearms. In due course, gun-enabled crime has continued to fall consistently. Obama is right. Other countries have clearly handled the gun violence problem more effectively than the US, but their successes have often involved more than just what Americans term “gun control”. Gun control is usually a necessary, but by itself, often an insufficient, way to reduce mass killings.

819,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/former-nra-point-man-in-congress-regrets-role-in-killing-federal-gun-violence-research/,"A former congressman whose name is attached to a 1996 bill banning federal funding for gun violence research says he regrets his role following the recent mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week. Speaking with the Huffington Post, ex-Congressman Jay Dickey (R-AR), said of his bill, ""I have regrets."" Dickey, who once described himself as the ""NRA’s point person in Congress"" in a New York Times opinion piece, says his move to ban the Centers for Disease Control from studying firearm ownership and its impact on public health was a big mistake and that we are paying for it now. ""I wish we had started the proper research and kept it going all this time,"" Dickey explained. ""If we had somehow gotten the research going, we could have somehow found a solution to the gun violence without there being any restrictions on the Second Amendment. We could have used that all these years to develop the equivalent of that little small fence."" Believing the CDC was anti-gun, guns rights activists led by the NRA attempted to shutter the $46 million National Center for Injury Prevention in 1996 for looking at gun violence.  Failing to do so, Dickey, at the behest of the NRA, authored a bill that specifically stated, “None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” According to Dickey, his bill was misinterpreted by administrators, which left researchers unable to seek out the root causes of gun violence in the United States. As Dickey, along with co-author Mark Rosenberg, wrote in the New York Times following the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado that claimed 12 lives and wounded 70: ""As a consequence, U.S. scientists cannot answer the most basic question: What works to prevent firearm injuries? We don’t know whether having more citizens carry guns would decrease or increase firearm deaths; or whether firearm registration and licensing would make inner-city residents safer or expose them to greater harm. We don’t know whether a ban on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines, or limiting access to ammunition, would have saved lives in Aurora or would make it riskier for people to go to a movie. And we don’t know how to effectively restrict access to firearms by those with serious mental illness.""

The victims of last week's shooting and the entire community deserve a thorough investigation that will get to the bottom of this heinous crime - an investigation that must be grounded in facts and evidence, not myth and bias."" Gross also pointed to the fact that Hanlin had posted a video on Facebook suggesting that the Sandy Hook shootings had been plot by the federal government to pass gun control laws. ""John Hanlin is not the man for the job,"" Gross said during a conference call on Monday. Gross argued that it would be difficult to trust that the sheriff had not omitted facts from the investigation because of his ""extremist ideology."" Hanlin has repeatedly refused to discuss his views on gun laws with reporters since last week's shooting. He has also insisted that he does not believe the Sandy Hook shooting was a government conspiracy. ""My focus right now is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and the victims' families,"" Hanlin said on Friday.

821,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/bernie-sanders-thrills-huge-boston-with-call-to-fight-racism-and-reform-gun-law/,"Bernie Sanders decried “an institutional racism that allows and continues to allow unarmed African Americans to be killed by police” on Saturday night, as he preached to a huge crowd in Boston that welcomed the Democratic presidential candidate’s now familiar vision of “political revolution”. Sanders alluded to a string of high-profile police killings of unarmed black people , and to a subsequent series of grand jury decisions not to indict officers involved in some cases. “It is not easy being a cop today,” Sanders told the crowd. “Many of them are underpaid, their schedules are terrible, and their family life is very stressful. “But like any other public official when a police officer breaks the law that officer must be held accountable.” The Vermont senator, who has for months gained on frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary race both in polling and fundraising, then sketched goals to reform a criminal justice system that he said was “broken and is in deep need of reform”. “Our job is to make police departments look like the communities they serve,” he said. “Our job is to make sure non-violent offenders do not get locked up, our job is to rethink the war on drugs, our job is to demilitarize police departments, our job is to end mandatory minimum sentences.” Sanders’ apparent decision to embrace the cause of burgeoning civil rights movement, loosely organized under the banner Black Lives Matter, comes weeks after activists upstaged the senator at one of his own campaign events. He has since pursued the cause more avidly than any other candidate, and sought to join the energy of that movement with the surge in popularity,especially among young people , of his own campaign. Sanders also outlined ideas to reform other stages of criminal justice system, a cause recently taken up by President Barack Obama , Pope Francis , Koch Industries and a handful of Democrats and Republicans . In what was largely a stump speech, Sanders embraced the cause more in spirit than specifics, railing against overspending on prisons – “$80bn every year locking people up” – and saying the US should invest instead in more education and jobs. The senator also mentioned the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Thursday, in which nine people died, linking the attack to the racially motivated murder of nine black people in Charleston, South Carolina in June. “All of us are disgusted, frustrated, bewildered in seeing every month, every two months, a sick individual walk into a school, walk into a church, take out a gun and start killing people,” he said. “Our hearts go out to the people of Oregon for what they have experienced in the last few days.” He suggested the US should enact several plans, including closing the loophole that allow unlicensed gun dealers to sell without background checks, “end the sale and distribution of semi-automatic weapons whose only goal is to kill people”, and start “a revolution in terms of mental health in this country”. “Maybe if we do all of these things we can lessen the likelihood of these horrendous disasters,” he said. Campaign staffers could not immediately provide an official estimate for the crowd inside the packed Boston Convention Center, but the venue can hold more than 25,000 people and organizers estimated that some 4,000 people filled the overflow room after the main hall filled up. Others braved cold, wet weather to watch the speech outside on a Jumbotron. Related: Hillary Clinton praises LGBT activists for changing minds – 'including mine' Sanders has a slight lead over Clinton in New Hampshire and has gained on the former secretary of state in Iowa , two key primary states. He has vowed not to run negative ads about Clinton, instead directing his ire toward Republicans, whom he called “cowards” over voting rights and “an international embarrassment” for “rejecting science” of climate change. Without naming names, Sanders also denounced Donald Trump, the billionaire and Republican frontrunner who has dominated the polls for months despite – or because of – inflammatory comments about immigrants, his rivals, reporters and critics in general. Sanders denounced Trump’s description of Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals”, saying that the remark was “demagoguery” that he would not tolerate. The two candidates, although ideological opposites, have drawn comparisons for their respective bursts of popularity, which have tapped into dissatisfaction with establishment candidates such as Clinton and Jeb Bush but befuddled the conventional logic of election season. guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2015 An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter.

A day after a rampage at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg that ended with 10 dead, including the gunman, and nine wounded, authorities sought a motive for the bloodiest U.S. mass shooting among the dozens reported over the past two years. As further details of the Roseburg shooting emerged, a former girlfriend of one of the wounded survivors, a U.S. military veteran, revealed that his heroism in confronting the shooter may have saved others from being killed. The state medical examiner on Friday confirmed that the assailant, shot dead by police, had been identified as Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, and that he was enrolled in the writing class in which Thursday's carnage unfolded. The gunman carried six guns, body armor and five magazines of bullets with him to campus. Seven more firearms were found with a stockpile of ammunition at the apartment he shared with his mother just outside Roseburg, a former timber town about 180 miles (290 km) south of Portland. Celinez Nunez, assistant special agent of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said all the weapons had been purchased legally. 'KIND OF A WEIRD GUY' Harper-Mercer's preoccupation with firearms dated back at least to 2012 or 2013, when he sought to register for training at Seven 4 Para, a private self-defense and law enforcement academy in Torrance, California, where he lived at the time, said Eloy Way, president and head instructor for the center. ""We wanted him to take a beginner safety course, and he was trying to tell me that he already had experience with firearms, and I didn't get a good feeling about him, so I turned him down,"" Way told Reuters. ""He was just kind of a weird guy and seemed kind of spoiled, immature,"" Way recalled. ""He was a little bit too anxious to get high-level training, and there was no reason for it."" Way's concerns that Harper-Mercer might misuse the training he would receive at the academy proved prescient. The gunman stormed into his college classroom, shot the professor in the head and then ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion, asking if they were Christian, before shooting them one by one, survivors said. The intervention of another student, Chris Mintz, 30, a U.S. Army combat veteran who served in Iraq, may have played a key role in preventing a higher casualty toll. As the gunman moved toward an adjoining classroom, Mintz tried to stop him, according to Jamie Skinner, Mintz's former girlfriend and the mother of their 6-year-old son. The gunman opened fire, striking Mintz. On the ground bleeding, Mintz pleaded with the shooter, telling him it was his son's birthday, but the gunman fired additional rounds, Skinner recounted, adding that the gunman then changed direction and entered a different room. ""The assailant was not able to make it into the classroom, because Chris stopped him,"" she said, adding that Mintz was hospitalized with two broken legs and seven bullet wounds. RENEWED GUN DEBATE The Oregon shooting, the latest in a series of high-profile mass killings across the country, has led to fresh demands for stricter gun control in the United States, including an impassioned plea by Democratic President Barack Obama for political action, and statements by some Republican presidential candidates supporting the right of Americans to bear arms. Among those to have championed the gun rights cause in the past was Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who has refused since the shooting to comment on the debate and has repeatedly declined to name the Roseburg gunman during news conferences. ""Media and community members who publicize his name will only glorify his horrific actions,"" Hanlin said. ""And eventually, this will only serve to inspire future shooters."" The sheriff on Friday identified the dead as Lawrence Levine, 67, the professor, and eight others who are believed to have been his students: Quinn Cooper, 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59; Lucas Eibel, 18; Jason Johnson, 33 or 34; Sarena Moore, 44; Treven Anspach, 20; and Rebecka Carnes, 18; and Lucero Alcaraz, 19. FRAGMENTED PICTURE EMERGES Authorities have disclosed little information about the gunman or his motives. The shooter left behind a ""multipage, hated-filled"" statement in the classroom, according to a Twitter message from an NBC reporter, citing multiple law enforcement sources who were not identified. CNN, citing sources, said the statement showed animosity toward blacks. Hanlin declined to comment when asked about the writings at a press conference. Harper-Mercer was born in the United Kingdom and arrived in the United States as a boy, his stepsister Carmen Nesnick told CBS Los Angeles. His parents, Ian Mercer and Laurel Harper, divorced in Los Angeles in 2006 when he was a teenager, public records show, and he continued to live with his mother. Harper-Mercer, who identified himself as ""mixed race"" on a social networking site, enlisted in the U.S. Army and served for about a month in 2008 before being discharged for failing to meet administrative standards, military records showed. He graduated from the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, in 2009, a graduation listing in the Daily Breeze newspaper showed. Switzer is a private, nonprofit school geared for special education students with learning disabilities, health problems and autism or Asperger Syndrome, the school says on its website. At some point, Harper-Mercer appears to have been sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army, a militant group that waged a violent campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland. On an undated Myspace page, he posted photos of masked IRA gunmen carrying assault rifles. Not counting Thursday's incident, 293 U.S. mass shootings have been reported this year alone, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that logs events in which four or more people are shot. The Roseburg shooting ranks as the deadliest bout of gun violence since September 2013, when a former U.S. Navy reservist working as a government contractor killed 12 people before he was slain by police at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard. About 80 shootings have occurred across the country since then that claimed at least four lives each. Gun control advocates say easy access to firearms is a major factor in the shooting epidemic, while the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun advocates say the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees Americans the right to bear arms. Among those critical of efforts to enact tougher gun control measures has been Sheriff Hanlin. A month after the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, he wrote a sharply worded letter to Vice President Joe Biden saying he would never enforce a federal law that violates the Constitution. ""Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,"" Hanlin wrote in the letter, dated Jan. 15, 2013.

Describing his career on Comedy Central as years of pretending to be a certain character, Colbert said it's important to not always pretend you know what you're doing. ""In the face of the killing in Oregon yesterday, I honestly don't know what to do or say,"" He explained.""Other than our hearts are broken for the people struck by this senseless tragedy. I don't know how to start a show like this which is often about what's happened in the last 24 hours."" ""I can't pretend that it didn't happen.I also can't pretend to know what to do to prevent what happened yesterday, all of the times it has happened before,"" he said before pausing. ""But I think pretending is part of the problem. These things happen over and over again and we are naturally horrified and shocked when we hear about them -- but then we change nothing and pretend that it won't happen again."" ""Some say the answer is stricter gun laws, some say the answer is mental health care, that we need better treatment or just keep the guns out of hands of the insane. Maybe it's both. I honestly don't know. But I do know that one of the definitions of insanity is changing nothing and then pretending that something will change.""

824,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/conan-sidekick-andy-richter-infuriates-twitter-nutters-by-ripping-apart-their-favorite-gun-arguments/,"Comedian Andy Richter took to Twitter on Tuesday to do battle with gun fanatics and shoot down some myths about the role guns play in the seeming never-ending string of mass shootings in the United States. Richter, who is best known as Conan O'Brien's long-time co-host, strongly criticized the NRA after the mass shooting last week at Umpqua Community College in Oregon while calling for gun laws that would prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Richter started last night when he tweeted an Oct. 3 column in the New York Times by Nicholas Kristof entitled, ""A New Way to Tackle Gun Deaths."" In it Kristof runs down statistics like, ""In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI."" He also calls for lawmakers to approach the problem from a public health standpoint. Richter was immediately attacked by gun enthusiasts, but used facts to repel them. At one point, he received a message from someone who seemed fine with gun violence because he claimed it mostly affected African-Americans. A lot of the criticism came from Carmine Zozzora, who argued that the Umpqua campus was a ""gun free zone"" even though the media has reported that there were people on campus who were carrying guns at the time of the shooting.  He went on to destroy arguments often employed by gun fanatics that prevent gun control in the United States. Seriously. Enough. How can more guns be the answer? http://t.co/DFSm6iOqJo — Andy Richter (@Andy Richter)1444147113.0  Looks like we already have plenty of ""good guys w guns.""

825,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/umpqua-college-victim-jason-johnson-laid-to-rest-in-first-memorial-for-those-killed-in-shooting/,"Mourners on Thursday remembered a 33-year-old student who was among 10 people who died in a shooting rampage at an Oregon community college last week, in the first of a series of publicly announced memorial services for the victims. The service for Jason Johnson took place a week after gunman Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, opened fire at Umpqua Community College in the former timber town of Roseburg. Police exchanged gunfire with Harper-Mercer, and after he was wounded, he shot himself to death. The massacre ranks as the deadliest U.S. shooting in two years. Friends and family of Johnson, who has previously been described by relatives as proud of having enrolled in school and for being Christian, came to a large white church in Roseburg to pay their respects. Harper-Mercer has been described as having asked victims their religion before he shot them, which troubled many people in Roseburg and beyond. ""These kids who were killed were martyrs,"" said Sandy DeFrees, 73, a Roseburg resident who stood near the church. About 200 people, including motorcyclists with Harley-Davison choppers, lined the street near the white-sided Church on the Rise in Roseburg for a service that marked the first publicly announced memorial for a victim of the massacre. The spectators waved American flags or signs with messages such as ""Roseburg strong."" ""When an event like this comes about, people need someone to lean on, that's why we’re here,"" said Mac McAllister, 73, a retired timber worker who is part of a Christian motorcycle club that stood near the church. The service was closed to members of the media. Other memorials are planned for the coming days. Johnson's service occurred on the same day hospital officials said Army veteran Chris Mintz, the man credited with likely saving lives during the mass shooting, confirmed he had been released from Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg after treatment for multiple bullet wounds. Mintz, 30, blocked the gunman from entering a classroom, his former girlfriend told Reuters. She said he was hit by seven bullets and lost a lot of blood, adding that he has rods in his legs and will be in a wheelchair until he learns to walk again. The massacre has reignited the national debate over gun control. President Barack Obama is scheduled to travel to Roseburg on Friday for private meetings with families of the victims.

826,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/mass-shootings-appear-to-increase-support-for-gun-ownership-in-the-united-states/,"Mass shootings occur almost once a day in the US, yet protecting gun rights seems to concern Americans more than increasing controls on guns. On Thursday, a gunman killed nine people in a community college in Oregon . It was the 994th gun incident in which there were four or more victims (including the shooter) since the start of 2013, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker . The data shows that excluding Thursday’s shootings, there have been 375 deaths and 1,089 injuries in 2015 so far. The website began to collect the figures on known incidents just after 20 children were gunned down in December 2012 at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut . Speaking from Washington after the killing spree, Barack Obama said: “We’ve become numb to this” – and he seems to be right. December 2014 marked the first time in two decades of polling that those feeling strongly that the rights of Americans to own guns should be bolstered were in the majority, according to Pew Research . According to the survey, 52% said it was more important to protect Americans’ right to own guns, in contrast with 46% who said it was more important to control ownership of the weapons. Those supporting gun control were in the majority immediately after the Newtown shootings, with 51% backing it in the US in January 2013. However, that share had dropped by five percentage points by the end of 2014. Between those two surveys, the proportion agreeing with the idea that gun ownership protects people from becoming victims of crime increased from 48% to 57%. Part of this seems to be down to misperception. In a 2014 Gallup survey, 63% of Americans said they thought violent crime was increasing despite the rate hovering at near 20-year lows . The Pew data from December 2014 showed that 63% of those surveyed thought that keeping a gun in the home made them safer, compared with 35% 15 years before. In other words, Americans feel less safe and think a gun might be able to protect them. Nearly 11m guns were manufactured in the US in 2013, with a total of just below 16m entering circulation after legal imports are included, according to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Small Arms Survey from 2011 suggested that the US had by far the highest rate of guns per capita in the world with 89 for every 100 residents . This is far above the 55 per 100 residents in Yemen and nearly twice the proportion of the third-most armed developed country in the world, Switzerland, which has 46 per 100 people in its population. This does not mean 89% of Americans own a gun . According to a 2013 Pew survey , about 37% of households had one . However, the US has the highest murder rate after Mexico of any OECD country with about two-thirds of those deaths involving a firearm . But no matter how many mass shootings there have been, it seems the argument that increasing controls on firearm ownership will make Americans safer is clearly not cutting it with the US public. guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2015 An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter.

827,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/fox-guest-obama-used-umpqua-college-shooting-speech-to-escape-avalanche-of-bad-news/,"Conservative columnist Stephen Hayes argued on Thursday that President Barack Obama's remarks regarding the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon were his attempt to avoid other issues. ""There were 50 shootings in Chicago over the weekend, for the second straight weekend in a row,"" Hayes told Fox News host Bret Baier. ""Why didn't the president go out and make a statement then? I'm sorry. It's a very cynical thing to say. But you know, he has had an avalanche of bad news over the past 36 hours. And I think he is using this shooting to get out from under it."" As Reuters reported, Obama quickly responded to the shooting, which left 10 people dead and seven other wounded, by saying the country's ""thoughts and prayers are not enough"" in the wake of another massacre. ""This is something we should politicize,"" the president said at one point, which Hayes noted in an exchange with his Washington Post counterpart Charles Lane. ""To say that the president should speak out first on what's happening on the al-Nusra Front and so forth, as opposed to this,"" Lane said, alluding to Syrian fighters allied with al-Qaeda. ""I do not think he spoke out today to distract attention."" ""He's the one who said we should politicize this,"" Hayes responded. ""Well, he did. I think that's what he did here. I think he's distracting attention from his other problems."" While the panel agreed that the president was ""passionate"" regarding gun safety, Fox contributor Charles Krauthammer criticized Obama for making his remarks while ""the bodies are still warm and the wounded are now in surgery."" ""It would be nice if he showed equal passion about the complete collapse of six-and-a-half years of policy in the Middle East and the abandonment and bombing of our allies on the ground,"" Krauthammer said.

Ziming Xuan is an assistant professor at the school who recently led a study of state gun laws and youth gun carrying in the United States. Ziming Xuan: President Obama Thursday night spoke about the “routine” nature of mass shooting in our country. Gun violence is often among the leading causes of death (homicides and suicides) and non-fatal injuries among youth, and affects families and communities across the US. Gun violence has created a major and unique public health problem for the US, compared to other developed countries. In order to protect youth, the governments and adults in other developed countries such as France have made it difficult for youth to access handguns. However, a recent study showed that about a quarter of US adolescents reported they had easy access to a gun in their home. Meanwhile, the majority of young respondents told researchers they wished to live in a society where it is impossible for teens to obtain guns. Sandro Galea: There have been 45 school shootings in America this year alone. Mass shootings have been occurring with regularity in the US for years now. More than 32,000 people die from firearms every year, as many as die from car accidents. This is clearly a public health issue, and one with a solution – the control of widespread gun availability. Sandro Galea: Control over availability of weapons, as has been done in countries like Australia, has been shown to work. Ziming Xuan: The best and longest-lasting approach involves comprehensive policy changes. We must also shift the community norms to be more consistent with the public health nature of this problem. Sandro Galea: Wider availability of firearms is associated with more firearm related injury. Allowing guns on campus is the wrong strategy towards reducing firearm injury. Ziming Xuan: Published research has shown that states with weak laws and more guns are associated with more gun violence in the forms of suicide, homicides, and other injuries and accidents. Ziming Xuan: Considering the magnitude of the gun violence problem in US, gun-related research is limited in part because there is virtually no funding from the federal government to advance our understanding about the nature and mechanism of gun violence or to identify and evaluate effective prevention strategies. Parents definitely need to teach their children to be responsible with risky and lethal products such as alcohol, guns, cars and so on. However, parents sometimes do not understand fully about child and youth development, impulsiveness, or curiosity. A recent study shows that what parents report about their children’s access to guns often contradict children’s reports; the kids reveal that they know the location of guns in the house and have handled the gun while parents reported they did not. For injury prevention, it is far more effective and long-lasting to change the environment by changing modifiable policies and norms than to change the child. Sandro Galea: Firearm deaths are driven principally by availability of firearms. While frequently after these events we link them to mental illness, the evidence is very clear that this is a negligible part of the problem. People with mental illness are much more likely to be victims than perpetrators of firearm violence.

829,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/jeb-bush-rejects-tighter-gun-laws-after-umpqua-shootings-stuff-happens-theres-always-a-crisis/,"Presidential candidates’ reactions to latest mass shooting adhered to party lines, as Democrats pushed for stricter laws and GOP was quick to blame mental illness Presidential candidates are weighing their very public consciences in the aftermath of the Oregon college shooting, as Democrats and Republicans signal a need for long-awaited gun control legislation against, as the Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly put it, the cost of “our freedom that allows insane individuals to kill so many people”. Or, as Jeb Bush put it on Friday: “stuff happens.” “We’re in a difficult time in our country and I don’t think more government is necessarily the answer to this,” the former Florida governor said at a campaign event. “It’s very sad to see, and I resist this notion because we had this challenge as governor – stuff happens. There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.” From frontrunner Hillary Clinton to the self-declared socialist but firearm-regulation moderate Bernie Sanders, liberals danced – delicately and less so – around what Barack Obama on Thursday called “a political choice” to not enact stricter gun laws. Conservatives were quick to jump on the president’s “reflexive” remarks, though even Donald Trump was already calling for mental health reform – and Bush found himself defending another out-of-context gaffe. Perhaps none of the 21 contenders for the White House was more immediately forceful in a call for reform than former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. “Only real gun reforms will stop mass shootings from occurring nearly every day,” the long-shot Democrat wrote on Twitter, pre-empting Obama’s phrase that “thoughts and prayers” were not enough, even hours after the mass shooting. Clinton said the pattern of mass killings -- the Umpqua shooting was the 994th such incident in the US since Obama’s reelection in late 2012 -- was “beyond my comprehension”. “We have got to have the political will to keep people safe,” she told reporters in Boston on Thursday evening. “I know there is way to have sensible gun control measures that prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands and save lives.” Clinton has pledged to “take on the gun lobby” and push for universal background checks if elected. Further, she said at a recent private fundraiser that the US supreme court “was wrong on the second amendment”, which protects the right to bear arms. Sanders, the Vermont senator who is a relative moderate on gun control, said he was “horrified by these never-ending mass shootings” and went on to advocate for a variety of legislative measures instead of “shouting at each other”. “We need a comprehensive approach,” Sanders said in a statement on Thursday evening. “We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help then need when they need it.” Republicans, with their broad presidential field and wide constituency of gun owners, veered from contemplative to combative in responding to the Roseburg shooting. They tended to focus on mental illness and a “focus on the facts”, not background checks or what Obama openly said was “something we should politicize”. Trump, the Republican frontrunner who said in the wake of the August shooting of a television news crew in Virginia that the firearm crisis “isn’t a gun problem, it’s a mental health problem”, struck a similar tone after the Oregon tragedy. “It sounds like another mental health problem,” the real-estate mogul told the Washington Post. “So many of these people, they’re coming out of the woodwork. We have to really get to the bottom of it. It’s so hard to even talk about these things, because you see them and it’s such a tragedy. It’s happening more and more. I just don’t remember – years back, I just don’t remember these things happening. Certainly not with this kind of frequency.” At an event in Dubuque, Iowa on Friday morning, Florida senator Marco Rubio described the shooting in Oregon as a “horrible tragedy”. “Our country needs to examine and not immediately talk about what they use to kill people and focus on why it is this violence is happening,” he said. “In some cases it is mental illness, in others we just don’t know. We need to really focus on the facts before we take hard positions.” The Republican insisted that “the reflexive reaction on the left is to say we need more gun laws” but that “there’s just no evidence that these gun laws would prevent these shootings”. Rubio also criticized Obama’s speech on the tragedy: “I don’t think the solutions he’s proposing will create a solution. This is a complex issue that may not have a federal solution.” Ohio governor John Kasich, who came under fire from the National Rifle Association in the 1990s for voting for the assault weapons ban while serving in Congress, echoed Trump’s concern about mental illness. “If we look at these cases a lot of these people have mental illness – and that’s one of the areas where we’ve really fallen down,” Kasich told NBC. “We are not treating the mentally ill. We are not making sure that someone who is mentally ill can’t get access to a gun.” Bush, the former Florida governor, almost immediately tweeted his condolences to the Oregon victims on Thursday. At a campaign event on Friday in Greenville, South Carolina, however, Bush seemed to accept mass shootings as a basic reality of American life. “Stuff happens,” he told voters, according to a tweet from the New Yorker staff writer Ryan Lizza, which quickly went viral. A spokesman for the Bush campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, just one week after Bush -- currently in a make-or-break moment in the Republican nominating contest -- found himself under fire from black voters over a comment about “free stuff”, which was also largely taken out of context. But in response to a followup question from Lizza on Friday, Bush doubled down: “No, it wasn’t a mistake. I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong?” Seeing a campaign gaffe in the making, the reporter pushed the governor: “Well you said, ‘Stuff happens’.” “Things happen all the time,” Bush replied. “There – is that better?” Barack Obama, asked at a White House event on Friday about the comments, responded: “I don’t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that an make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple months, we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening’.” It was former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, as usual, who took a much more pointed stance launching a strident attack on Obama’s forceful statement from the White House. “We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy,” Huckabee said in a statement. “What kind of gun was used? How did the shooter obtain it? What is the motive? Does the shooter have a history of mental illness? Was this an act of terror? “With few facts, Obama is quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda. For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory.” The Oregon shooter, federal officials said on Friday, obtained 13 guns in his possession legally.

830,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/the-invincibility-of-the-gun-lobby-is-being-overstated/,"No sooner had the toll from the latest mass shooting been tallied than came the world-weary predictions that the carnage would have zero political effect. ""Why the Gun Debate Won't Change After the Oregon Shooting,"" read the headline at The Fix, The Washington Post's political blog. Without doubt, the gun rights lobby is a formidable force. It is backed by a truly grass-roots network of committed and well-organized supporters who are willing to make calls to legislators and turn out in even low-turnout elections to back pro-gun candidates. This ""intensity gap"" bedevils gun-control groups, which, however well some of their proposals poll, have trouble getting voters to agitate and to prioritize the gun issue the way that gun-rights defenders do. But the invincibility of the gun lobby is being overstated. For one thing, gun ownership is becoming more concentrated in a smaller share of the population, one that is increasingly clustered in certain regions, thus limiting the lobby's political reach. For another thing, the big recent defeat for the gun-control movement, the 2013 failure to pass universal background checks for gun purchases, was a close call. Six senators with A-ratings from the NRA voted for the bill; it fell just five short of the filibuster-proof 60. Had it passed the Senate, there would have been great pressure from the Sandy Hook families to bring it up for a vote in the House, and it would have needed only about 20 Republicans to pass. No, the odds of the bill being revived anytime soon are not good, with the Senate now in Republican control. But things are shifting beneath the surface. The two Democrats who voted against the bill and were up for re-election last year both lost, after getting zero backing from the NRA in exchange for their vote; this will make centrist Democrats less likely to vote with the NRA in the future. Meanwhile, two Democratic governors who signed tough gun laws, in Colorado and Connecticut, both won re-election in an otherwise brutal year for their party. A year earlier, Terry McAuliffe was elected governor of Virginia, the NRA's home state, while running on an outspokenly anti-NRA platform. As more elected officials take on the NRA and live to tell the tale, the calculus for even self-interested politicians will evolve, especially if gun control supporters start to really challenge those who vote against them. There are three ""no"" votes on background checks with tough re-election races in swing states next year: Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Rob Portman in Ohio. Simply deciding that the gun control issue is a political loser is self-fulfilling, just the sort of fatalism that the NRA counts on to preserve the status quo.

831,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/heres-why-so-many-americans-want-to-own-guns-according-to-science/,"Yet another mass shooting in the US  , but the heated and divided nature of the debate means that a fundamental question is often overlooked; why is it people actively want guns in the first place? The answers are not as obvious as you may think Once again, we’ve had  yet another mass shooting in the US  . That the previous sentence can even be written in a serious manner is a bleak summary of the situation. Even President Obama has  clearly lost patience  with the regularity of such horrific occurrences. As ever, the fallout includes endless  scapegoating  ,  political posturing  and  analysis  . It all boils down to a large number of people not wanting to lose their guns under any circumstances. Those opposed to gun control regularly cite the  second amendment  , granting US citizens the right to bear arms. But having the right to do something doesn’t make it mandatory. I have the right to smear myself in peanut butter and dance naked through my kitchen. But I don’t, because I have no interest in doing so. So why do millions of ordinary people see weapons that use controlled explosives to propel bits of metal at lethal speeds at people, and think “I need that in my house”. Basically, why do so many want guns? Given the diversity of gun owners, there isn’t going to be any comprehensive or obvious answer. However, there are a few scientific explanations that could help understand how this comes about. Despite the preconceptions of many, according to  a Gallup poll from 2005  , the most common reason given for gun ownership is protection. Just like large dogs or security lights, guns are something people have to ensure their safety from intruders. Some might argue this is a cop-out, something gun owners say to seem moral and credible, and maybe sometimes that’s fair. However, it’s also the most common answer  given by juvenile offenders incarcerated for gun-related crimes  . If you’re already in jail for gun crimes, it should be obvious why you wanted a gun, but still the most common answer among such people is “protection”. This may seem excessively paranoid to those of us in countries where guns aren’t so familiar, but in the US at least they’re  much more commonplace  . I remember being struck by this on my one visit there. Even the guy supervising a car park had a gun. Why? How often does a Chrysler go on a rampage and need to be brought down? Humans are all about  self-preservation  and prone to  anticipating worst-case scenarios  , so if you’re surrounded by people with guns, it would be logical to conclude you need one too. This doesn’t address why guns became so widespread to begin with, but it would explain why this situation persists. And if self-preservation rather than aggression is why you have a gun, you’d undoubtedly be loath to lose it. Another common answer for why people own guns is recreation.  Target shooting  and  hunting  are two popular recreational activities, and whatever you think of them, would explain ownership of guns by a substantial number of people. Sometimes the simple explanation is correct; people enjoy  hobbies  , and hobbies require equipment. Many gun owners confess to  feeling vulnerable or “naked” without their guns  . Perhaps this isn’t surprising; having a gun gives you considerable power over people. If you feel small, or weak, or underachieving, or anything like this, dealing with others can induce a great deal of  social anxiety  . A gun would provide at least one easy way where you can have the advantage over them for once, even if this reasoning only occurs at a subconscious level. Achieving high social status is important to your typical human, and  guns can play a big role in this in cultures where they’re common  . Trouble is, of course, if everyone else has a gun too, then it’s not so useful. So you need more guns, or bigger guns, and on it goes. The fact that it’s  more often men who own guns  suggests masculinity (toxic or otherwise) plays a part too. And while associating gun ownership with mental health issues is (rightly) considered shameless scapegoating, there is some evidence suggesting gun ownership correlates with tendencies towards  anger and impulsivity  . It’s reminiscent of how Douglas Adams described people who seek power, in that that those who want it the most are least suitable to have it. It’s now common to see people  queuing up for days on end to buy the latest iPhone  . Sacrificing home comforts and hours/days of their lives, even travelling great distances, purely to buy a device which is slightly different to one they already own. Why? Clearly there are social and cultural factors that mean owning an up-to-date iPhone is absolutely essential to many people. Why wouldn’t this be true of guns to others? If you grow up and are immersed in a culture where gun ownership is the norm, even praised, of course this is going to  influence your attitudes  . Earlier suggestions that gun owners are “making excuses” for having firearms don’t make sense when you consider that, for many, owning a gun is a good thing, something to be praised for. They wouldn’t make excuses if they saw nothing that needed excusing. Guns being a status symbol or highly-valued accessory, like iPhones and the like, would explain  sheer variety of guns available, at least in the US  . If guns were purely for home protection, then you’d only need one basic sort, maybe two. But no, gun enthusiasts often end up owning a wide variety of them. Unless they anticipate being besieged by armed mobs (which could be the case), this makes more sense when you assume that guns  infer social status  in the culture in which someone is immersed, meaning more or better guns provide higher status. Polarisation  can push this even further, beyond any rational limits. Everything else There are many other possible factors that could result in someone wanting a gun, most of which probably aren’t even hinted at here. Gun ownership is  more common amongst those with right—wing views  , so a stronger self-interest,  authoritarian personality  and  mistrust of other groups  may make a gun feel like more of an essential item. Modern entertainment is  saturated with guns  , usually in the context of good guys using them to deal with less desirable sorts. What we see in the media can, within reason,  affect our views and behaviour, so if guns are regularly seen being used to save the day, then no doubt this will rub off on some. Similarly, the making and selling of guns is also a  very lucrative industry  , so the companies behind it are going to promote the benefits of firearms as often as possible. And, sadly, you always seem to get the people who acquire guns purely to do harm to others, for whatever warped reasoning motivates them. This piece isn’t meant to justify gun ownership, it’s just an attempt to look at how it becomes so commonplace, and why so many people defend it in the face of an ever-increasing list of tragedies. Understanding why people want to own a gun should be essential to better regulate them, because if you just rely on condemnation and blanket criticism of gun owners, they aren’t going to simply agree and hand over their weapons. They’re more likely to  double down and become even more adamant that they’re in the right  , making gun control ever more difficult. With an issue so serious, this is the last thing anyone needs. Dean Burnett attempted to write an objective, neutral article on the issue of gun ownership and has no doubt failed spectacularly.

832,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/they-know-how-to-stir-up-fear-obama-bashes-nra-while-vowing-stronger-gun-law-enforcement/,"President Barack Obama said on Friday that he has asked his team to look for new ways to enforce existing regulations to keep guns away from criminals in the wake of the mass shooting in Oregon. But Obama admitted he had little power to craft tougher gun laws given the political clout wielded by the National Rifle Association, and vowed to elevate discussion about the ""political dynamic"" he said was the main obstacle to preventing more gun deaths. ""The main thing I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about this on a regular basis,"" Obama said at a news conference. ""I will politicize it, because our inaction is a political decision that we are making."" Obama started by mocking Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush who earlier on Friday had said ""stuff happens"" in the course of an answer to a question about gun violence. ""I don't even think I have to react to that one,"" Obama said. Obama led a failed push for tougher gun laws in 2013 after a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. His administration also took a series of modest steps using executive actions, such as tweaks for the existing system for background checks. On Friday, he said would look for more measures. ""I've asked my team, as I have in the past, to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,"" he said. But he said it would be up to voters to demand more significant changes from Congress, which he said was in the thrall of the National Rifle Association, a powerful gun lobby group. ""They have perfected what they do,"" he said. ""They don't represent the majority of the American people, but they know how to stir up fear, they know how to stir up their base, they know how to raise money, they know how to scare politicians, they know how to organize campaigns."" A spokesman for the group declined comment on Obama's remarks. Obama said people who want tougher gun laws would need to become ""single-issue"" voters to shake up both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. ""Even if they're great on other stuff, for a couple of election cycles, you've got to vote against them, and let them know precisely why you're voting against them,"" Obama said.

""Imagine a politician politicizing something,"" Carson quipped to the hosts of Fox & Friends on Tuesday. ""When do we have people that actually want to solve our problems rather than just politicize everything?"" ""But, Dr. Carson, would you go?"" host Brian Kilmeade wondered. ""If the people of the community say don't go, would you still go if you were president on Friday?"" ""Probably not,"" Carson replied. ""I mean, I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I would go to the next one."" The GOP hopeful also explained that he would be willing to ""listen"" to ideas about how to stop mass shootings, but he insisted that no gun control proposal would solve the problem. ""Anything that they've proposed doesn't stop anything,"" he said. ""Guns don't kill people, and the Second Amendment is extremely important.

834,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/xslUyXVPZO0/,"Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey (R) was quickly criticized after calling on Christians to arm themselves following Thursday's mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon. According to The Tennessean, Ramsey made the remarks on his official Facebook page. ""While this is not the time for widespread panic, it is a time to prepare,"" he wrote on Friday morning. ""I would encourage my fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to think about getting a handgun carry permit. I have always believed that it is better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it. Our enemies are armed. We must do likewise."" Ramsey attached his remarks to a report stating that the gunman -- identified by news outlets as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer -- ordered victims to identify their religion during the attack at Umpqua Community College. Ten people were killed during the attack, including the gunman. Another seven were injured. ""The recent spike in mass shootings across the nation is truly troubling,"" Ramsey wrote. ""Whether the perpetrators are motivated by aggressive secularism, jihadist extremism or racial supremacy, their targets remain the same: Christians and defenders of the West."" The Los Angeles Times reported that, while authorities have not publicly identified the gunman, they have described him as having ""anti-religion"" and ""white supremacy"" beliefs. Harper Mercer also described himself online as ""not religious, but spiritual"" and identified politically as ""conservative, Republican."" State Rep. John Ray Clemmons (D) released a statement accusing Ramsey of ""fear-mongering and religious crusading"" instead of displaying leadership. ""Senator Ramsey’s inciting statements in the face of a national tragedy are all the more alarming when you consider them in their historical context,"" Clemmons wrote. ""Things have never ended well when any leader has asked people to take up arms in the name of their religious faith. This type of rhetoric is counter-productive to our efforts on so many levels.""

835,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/us/when-columbine-is-invoked-fears-tend-to-overshadow-facts.html,"Advertisement Supported by Retro Report transcript na By Clyde Haberman It takes neither a clairvoyant nor a morbid personality to sense that, in time, the nightmare will return. We have already seen it often enough: Someone goes berserk and shoots up a school — typically a young man who turns a gun on himself after taking children’s lives, shattering families and leaving a tormented country to ponder how things went terribly wrong. Once again. School shootings have become so much a part of the American experience that many people assume the atrocities are happening ever more frequently. But are they? The question is not simple, and evidence can be murky, if only because studies using differing methodologies arrive at varying conclusions. In search of answers, Retro Report, a series of video documentaries exploring major news stories of the past and their lasting impact, examines one of the worst shootings, a moment in 1999 so searing that it is still instantly evoked with a single word: Columbine. The massacre of 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School, outside Denver, was not the first mass killing at a school. By then, dots on the map like Jonesboro, Ark., and West Paducah, Ky., had been pushed into the national spotlight because of such shootings. Columbine, however, was different. Not only was it the most lethal attack on an American high school, but it also unfolded on television in real time, with teenagers cowering under desks and using mobile phones to report what they had seen or heard. It was “the first major hostage standoff of the cellphone age,” Dave Cullen wrote in “Columbine,” his well-received 2009 book about the ordeal. The police, he said, “had never seen anything like it.” Columbine became a model for subsequent shootings. In writings they left behind, the young men who killed dozens at Virginia Tech in 2007 and in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 spoke of being inspired by Columbine. Yet as Mr. Cullen makes clear, and as the Retro Report video demonstrates, much of what the public came to believe about Columbine was flat-out wrong. Myths took root from the start, nurtured by frightened and confused students and amplified by news outlets running hard with rumor and conjecture. The story line that unspooled ran like this: The student killers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, belonged to a group at the school called the Trench Coat Mafia, said to be goth outcasts. The pair had been subjected repeatedly to bullying, especially by self-impressed jocks. And so this was a mission of revenge. The two young men went hunting for athletes, nonwhites and those professing a love of God, singling them out as targets before holing up in the school library and turning their guns on themselves. Almost none of this proved to be true. In fact, as Mr. Cullen notes, Columbine was less a successful school shooting than it was a failed school bombing. Harris, later deemed a psychopath by some psychologists, and Klebold, a suicidal depressive, did not seek out specific groups or individuals. They wanted to blow up the entire place and kill hundreds indiscriminately with a homemade propane bomb. But their device failed to detonate. Only then did they begin using the guns that had unlawfully been supplied to them by others. transcript na Yet the “loner versus bullies” vengeance template came to be widely accepted and applied to later shootings. It can be the sort of facile notion that appeals to those eager for a rational theory to explain an action that is utterly irrational. It can also be unnerving. What high school does not have its share of student bullies and oddballs? Not surprisingly, some parents live in fear that their own children could become tomorrow’s victims. How severe is the threat of school shootings? Certitudes are elusive. Some analyses show an increase over the years, others a decline. One complication is a dearth of research drawing on universally accepted data. Some studies include stabbings in the tally of shootings, or events that occur not on school grounds but nearby, or suicides, or accidental discharges of weapons, or gang fights bearing no resemblance to the Columbine-style massacres that people tend to think of when they hear of school shootings. Other researchers omit some or all of those categories in chronicling the mayhem. Also, many studies rely heavily on newspaper and television reports, a methodology that may be inherently flawed, given that some situations may well have been overblown by the news media and others ignored. Retro Report relies on numbers compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on known school homicides. That standard, too, may be an imperfect guide, but it deals in something tangible that is hard to gainsay: a body count. C.D.C. statistics suggest that shooting homicides in schools have held fairly steady across the last two decades, ranging for the most part between 15 and 30 a year. With well over 100,000 primary and secondary schools in the United States, the odds of any one of them coming under assault seem minuscule. Some scholars recommend examining school shootings not as a discrete phenomenon but, rather, as one aspect of this country’s broader wave of gun violence. One such expert is Dewey G. Cornell, an education professor and forensic clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia. “We have a flood of gun violence in the United States,” he told Retro Report, citing an average of more than 300 shootings and 80 deaths a day. “Those occur throughout our community, not just in schools.” For sure, schools must be kept safe, he added, but “we need to think about where that flood is coming from, and address the risk factors and causes of gun violence, rather than focus specifically on the schools.” Risk factors plainly include the easy availability of guns, for the public in general and for the mentally troubled in particular. A debate is also underway over how extensively news organizations should dwell on the details of a mass shooting. That issue has been raised anew with the mass killings this year at a black church in Charleston, S.C., and the fatal shooting of two television journalists during a broadcast in Roanoke, Va. Some propose not even naming the killers, depriving them of the notoriety they seek while perhaps eliminating a possible source of inspiration for would-be copycats. Then again, all venues are not equal. New Yorkers, for instance, react more powerfully to a killing in Central Park, their secular cathedral, than to one that takes place just a block or two away; dread and a sense of personal vulnerability touch millions of people. Similarly, terror in a classroom sends shock waves rippling far and wide, whereas slayings at other locations often do not. Even a single school shooting is too much for many people to bear. After all, these are our children.
